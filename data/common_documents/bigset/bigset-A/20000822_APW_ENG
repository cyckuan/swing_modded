L.A. To Reduce Charges Against DNC Protesters
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city attorney's office agreed Monday to reduce
misdemeanor charges against scores of people arrested during last week's street
protests outside the Democratic National Convention. In exchange, the 52
protesters will plead no contest to the reduced charges Tuesday, clearing the
way for their release. A hunger strike by 45 of them will continue until then,
their supporters said. Demonstrators called the agreement a victory.

McCain Declared Cancer-Free
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tests on lymph nodes and tissue removed during Sen. John
McCain's skin cancer surgery confirmed that his skin cancer didn't spread, his
office announced Monday as McCain went home from the hospital. The former GOP
presidential candidate underwent more than five hours of surgery on Saturday to
remove melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, from his temple and
upper arm. Todd Harris, a McCain spokesman, said pathologists completed the
final review of the tissues around the cancers and found no sign the melanoma
had spread.

   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King, who released the second installment of
his online serial novel on Monday, is considering making future installments
longer -- and more expensive. He also is thinking about offering a bonus to
faithful readers: giving away the final installment. The first two installments
have been made available for a $1 voluntary contribution. Although 76 percent of
readers who downloaded the installments have paid for them -- slightly more than
the amount King said would be needed to continue the series -- he worries that
interest in ''The Plant'' may fade over time, King assistant Marsha DeFilippo

   PANAMA CITY (AP) -- Five days after Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso's Cabinet resigned, nearly all 13 ministers returned to
their posts Monday following the reassignment of the economic
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The mass resignation Aug. 16 came amid criticism that the
government wasn't doing enough to solve the country's economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers returned to their posts after Moscoso announced
the Economic Minister Victor Juliao would be made the public works
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The country's vice minister of finance was named the new
economic minister.
</P>
<P>
   Since Moscoso became president last September, residents have
complained that her government has not done enough to fight poverty
and reduce widespread unemployment. Moscoso has said she was
satisfied with her government.

<HEADLINE> Ship Missing in Indonesian Waters  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A ship with 66 passengers and crew
were missing during a voyage from Indonesia's violence-wracked
Maluka islands to neighboring Sulawesi island, a news report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-ton MV Supera One left Ruba Ruba village on Halmahera
island on Saturday bound for Bitung in North Sulawesi province,
about 180 miles to the west, the official Antara news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the boat was not equipped with a radio and
officials feared it may have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   The Maluku islands, also known as the Moluccas, have been
plagued by Muslim-Christian violence that has claimed nearly 4,000
lives since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A ferry overloaded with about 500 Christian refugees fleeing
Halmahera island sank in a storm in June. Only 10 survivors were

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sailor Ordered To Stand Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A former Navy sailor charged with five murders
was ordered Monday to stand trial in the slaying of three
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Maria Luisa Oxholm ruled during a preliminary
hearing that John Eric Armstrong, 26, should be tried in the
strangling deaths of three prostitutes from the Detroit area. He
already has been ordered to stand trial in two other killings.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mitchell, Armstrong's attorney, previewed his likely
defense by contending that confessions authorities say Armstrong
made were coerced.
</P>
<P>
   ''These statements are suspect,'' Mitchell told the Detroit Free
Press for an article in Tuesday's editions. ''We're going to fight
them. ... I do not think they are voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Monday, police officer Donald Johnson read a
confession he attributed to Armstrong in which Armstrong, a husband
and father of two, described how he picked up one victim and paid
her $50 for sex.
</P>
<P>
   He told police he didn't remember strangling her, but he dumped
her out of his Jeep Wrangler when he realized she was not
breathing, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry,'' Johnson read. ''I
didn't mean to. I don't know what happened. I'm truly sorry. I
didn't mean to kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   The five alleged murders and four attempted murders all involve
choking or strangulation and authorities say all victims are
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also say Armstrong told them he killed at least a
dozen prostitutes worldwide when he was a sailor from 1993 to 1998.
FBI officials are still investigating the claims.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of first-degree murder, he faces mandatory life in
prison.

<HEADLINE> Pedophile Murders Spark Outrage  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The sex-slayings of two little girls over the
weekend in Italy prompted calls for chemical castration of sex
offenders and publishing the nams of pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prison alone doesn't help,'' Alessandra Mussolini, a
legislator from the right-wing National Alliance, told the ANSA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini, the granddaughter of Fascist dictator Benito
Mussolini, on Monday suggested chemical castration or lifetime
confinement in medical institutions as alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Maretta Scoca of the centrist UDEUR party also called
for chemical castration, in which drugs are used to reduce the
amount of the male hormone testosterone the body produces.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gianni Baget Bozo, a priest tied to the conservative
Forza Italia political alliance, told ANSA that the suggestion of
chemical castration was a ''Nazi'' idea. Studies also have
questioned its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The two murders shocked the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people in the southern Puglia region attended the
funeral Monday of 8-year-old Graziella Mansi, who was sexually
assaulted and then burned alive. An 18-year-old, Pasquale Tortora,
has confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Mansi was slain Saturday, one day after the murder of a
5-year-old Tunisian immigrant in Imperia on the Italian Riviera.
Hagere Kilani was abducted, raped and repeatedly stabbed by a
Romanian immigrant who fled to France, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A group fighting child abuse offered to make a list available of
140 convicted pedophiles in the Tuscany and Umbria regions. The
list was compiled from court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's social affairs minister, Livia Turco, rejected the idea
as ''useless and harmful'' and said ''the experience in England
should tell us a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men in Britain committed suicide earlier this month after a
tabloid newspaper published names, photos and locations of alleged
pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''When fundamental rights are at stake ... we must stick to law
and legality,'' Turco told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera.

<HEADLINE> After 4 years, agency still pursues mystery of deadly crash  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Four years after an explosion destroyed TWA
Flight 800 and killed all 230 aboard, federal investigators are
taking what they hope will be a final look into the mystery of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day meeting
Tuesday to review the evidence collected in its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has ranged from a spark caused by electrical wiring,
to turbulence caused by another aircraft, bombs, even a missile.
There has even been a suggestion that the answer may never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   What has become apparent in the long, costly probe is the Boeing
747 was destroyed by an explosion that originated in its central
fuel tank on July 17, 1996, shortly after takeoff on a New York to
Paris flight.
</P>
<P>
   Even without knowing what ignited the Flight 800 blast, the
investigation has led to extensive changes in design and regulation
that are expected to improve safety in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, investigators determined that the
plane's almost-empty center fuel tank exploded, but they have not
settled on the source of ignition.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility that has been widely discussed is electrical
wiring passing near or through the fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had spent considerable time waiting for takeoff on the
runway, and air conditioners located beneath the fuel tank could
have caused it to overheat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the focus shifted toward the fuel tank, the Federal
Aviation Administration has ordered 37 corrective actions for
commercial airliners. Among them are replacing sharp-edged fuel
probes that might damage wires, keeping pumps idle unless they are
submerged in fuel, installing protective sleeves on wiring in tanks
and developing electronic devices to suppress power surges in
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Erickson, head of aircraft certification for the FAA, said
the agency has reviewed the history of fuel tanks on 10,000
commercial and noncombat military planes and found few problems.
</P>
<P>
   Industry also participated, reporting a week ago that a
three-year study concluded airline fuel tanks are safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade
association, said more than 100,000 work hours were spent
inspecting 990 aircraft operated by 160 airlines as part of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said the FAA determined that three factors are needed
for a fuel-tank explosion: flammable vapors, oxygen and an ignition
source.
</P>
<P>
   Changes are being made in all three areas: eliminating sparks;
inerting, or filling the empty area of fuel tanks with nitrogen
rather than allowing in air that contains potentially flammable
oxygen; reducing vapors by keeping tanks fuller; cooling fuel
tanks; and changing fuel formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the investigation the possibility of a bomb led the
government to tighten security procedures. Investigators have not
reported evidence of explosives, either from a bomb or a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness reports of streaks of light seen nearby on the night
of the crash have continued to plague investigators and to fuel
conspiracy theories. That led the NTSB to go so far as to test-fire
missiles to determine just what witnesses might have been able to
see on the night of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   This month a group of skeptics in Springfield, Mass., sued the
government seeking details of its inquiry into the crash, including
radar data and information on material found with some of the
victims' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy pilot William Donaldson, a vocal critic of the
investigation, issued a statement Monday contending that the
government is determined to cover up the cause of the crash.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With inflation under control and the economy
growing at a healthy but less feverish pace than earlier this year,
analysts expect the Federal Reserve to hold the line on interest
rates Tuesday.

   Since June 1999, the Fed has raised rates six times in an effort
to slow economic growth enough to keep inflation under control
without retarding the economy so much that it brings about a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prospects of a Fed rate increase in August look as close
to zero as you are ever going to get,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief
economist at Harris Bank in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Many private economists expected the central bank to repeat its
June decision not to boost interest rates. Still, economists
believed the Fed will issue a statement that continues to tell
markets that it is still worried about inflation dangers down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members
and regional bank presidents, was scheduled to meet behind closed
doors Tuesday to discuss interest rate policy. An afternoon
announcement was expected.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's sixth rate increase in May, its target for the
federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other, was
pushed to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine years. In June
1999 -- before the central bank starting raising rates -- the funds
rate stood at 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those increases boosted banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark
for millions of consumer and business loans, to a nine-year high of
9.5 percent, up from 7.75 percent before the Fed's first rate
increase 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed passed up the chance to raise rates a seventh time at
its last meeting on June 27-28 and economists believe there are
more reasons for the central bank to remain on hold this time
around as evidence of a slowdown grows.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the economy, which grew at a surprisingly
strong 5.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, has
slowed to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent in the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven months of this year, the underlying inflation
rate -- excluding food and energy, which has shown a big jump this
year -- has been rising at an annual rate of just 2.6 percent, only
slightly worse than last year's 1.9 percent increase in ''core''
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in the tame inflation picture has been strong
gains in productivity, increased output per hour of work, which
allows pay increases without accompanying increases in product
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are able to have our cake and eat it, too,'' said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ''I think the
Fed is likely to take a pass on raising rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic economists believe the Fed is close to
declaring total victory in its 14-month campaign to engineer a soft
landing for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Fed tightening cycle is over with,'' said Richard
Yamarone, economist for Argus Research Corp in New York. ''For the
time being, the coast is clear of inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   But some economists believe Fed meetings after the presidential
election on Nov. 15 and Dec. 19 are likely to produce further
interest rate boosts -- at one of the two meetings, or perhaps even
both.
</P>
<P>
   But with few signs that inflation is getting out of hand, the
Fed has the luxury of waiting, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   If it has the option, the Fed traditionally prefers to lay low
during the heat of presidential campaigns in an effort to avoid
accusations that its decisions on the economy are being made to
help or hurt a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, most economists believe the Fed is likely to
leave interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 3 meeting, which is only
five weeks before the Nov. 7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist at Standard and Poor's DRI in
Lexington, Mass., said it was looking more likely that the Fed has
achieved something no other central bank has been able to do: two
consecutive soft landings for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994-95, the Fed raised interest rates seven times in a
successful effort to keep inflation under control and give new life
to an expansion that is now in a record 10th year of uninterrupted
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a new record. Alan Greenspan will go down as the
Tiger Woods of Fed chairmen,'' Wyss said.

TWA Flight 800 Crash Still a Mystery
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four years after an explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800 and
killed all 230 aboard, federal investigators are taking what they hope will be a
final look into the mystery of what happened. The National Transportation Safety
Board opens a two-day meeting Tuesday to review the evidence collected in its
investigation. Speculation has ranged from a spark caused by electrical wiring,
to turbulence caused by another aircraft, bombs, even a missile. There has even
been a suggestion that the answer may never be known.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Herbert Scheftel, a real estate investor and
backer in the Pan Am building project, died Aug. 16. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Scheftel, who also invested in television stations, was involved
in the Pan Am project with his brother, Stuart Scheftel, another
partner, Alfred Burger, and several others.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Am building was erected on Park Avenue behind Grand
Central Terminal in 1963. The building, which was called Grand
Central City, initially was to have had several theaters, an
exhibition hall and an open-air restaurant. It now is headquarters
of the MetLife insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Among Scheftel's other real estate projects were the Beresford
and San Remo apartment buildings in New York and the Mark Hopkins
Hotel in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Scheftel also held ownership interests in three television
stations and six cable stations in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He and his first wife, Agnes Mary Scheftel, who died in 1970,
were active in many charitable organizations. He was a director of

<HEADLINE> A 46-year-old man is jailed for having sex with 13-year-old girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A judge sent a 46-year-old man to jail
for having sex with a 13-year-old girl and claiming that he didn't
know her age.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care how old the girl was; if you're climbing through
a bedroom window to see her, you know you're doing something
wrong,'' state Supreme Court Justice David D. Egan said Monday.
''The baloney about you being seduced by her is nothing more than
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Auld of West Seneca, Erie County, will serve two to six
years. He pleaded guilty to second-degree rape for having sex with
the girl in February.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting the girl, Auld mailed her phone cards so she could
call him without ringing up long-distance tolls, then arranged to
climb through her window at night, said Monroe County Assistant
District Attorney Mary Beth Feindt.
</P>
<P>
   The girl willingly had sex with Auld but state law deemed her
incapable of consent because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who was living with a friend because her mother was
seriously ill, now resides with her father in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Auld told Greece police that he thought the girl was
19, police seized handwritten notes from his home showing that the
girl gave him her date of birth.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of phone workers back on job, others still striking  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and negotiators
representing 35,000 employees in six states and the District of
Columbia reported some progress toward reaching a contract to end a
strike that is more than two weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 workers in New York and New England, whose union
representatives reached tentative agreements with the company over
the weekend, left the picket lines Monday and returned to the job.
</P>
<P>
   They started working on a backlog of 280,000 repair requests and
new installation orders that have piled up since the strike began
Aug. 6. Company officials estimated it will take three to four
weeks to clear the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still negotiating with the bargaining unit that
represents workers in the mid-Atlantic states. Candice Johnson,
spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, said late
Monday that there was some progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need to resolve some pretty key issues for our
members,'' she said. Members of the union remained on the picket
lines Monday in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Forced overtime levels for customer service representatives and
monitoring of those workers are unresolved issues, union officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deana Rouse, one of a dozen Verizon service representatives
carrying a red picket sign outside company headquarters in Newark,
N.J., Monday said employees are forced to work two hours overtime
five days a week and often work on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have much time to spend with your family,'' Rouse
said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon executives said the negotiations with that unit are
centered on resolving local matters, but said they believe the
talks could have been wrapped by now.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are relatively simple issues that could have been and
should have been settled'' Sunday night, said Lawrence T. Babbio
Jr., company vice chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, a company formed by the summer merger of Bell Atlantic
and GTE, reached agreements with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers and another CWA bargaining unit Sunday. Union
members must still ratify the three-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the talks, the unions also won an agreement to
let them try organizing workers in the company's largely
non-unionized wireless division using signup cards rather than
holding a representation election.
</P>
<P>
   The unions must get signed cards from 55 percent of wireless
workers in a specific group to represent them. Labor leaders say
the process is less cumbersome and faster than holding
secret-ballot elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizers and company management stipulated to neutrality
clauses allowing both sides to present their position on
unionization to employees. Only 46 workers, in a work force of
32,000 wireless employees, are union members now.
</P>
<P>
   The card-signing campaign would begin in six months. The union
can begin a similar campaign to organize employees in Verizon's
wireless retail stores in a year, under the tentative accord.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the tentative agreements include:
</P>
<P>
   -A 12 percent increase in wages over the life of the three-year
contracts. Customer service representatives will receive an
additional 4 percent wage increase effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   -An effort by the company to reduce required overtime over the
next year to about 8 hours per week for technicians. Verizon
preserves a right to require more time in emergencies or other
situations.
</P>
<P>
   -Bonuses of up to 10 percent for workers meeting higher service
and performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   -All union-covered employees will get by year's end options for
purchasing 100 shares of Verizon stock.
</P>
<P>
   -Greater access for unions workers to jobs in the company's
high-speed Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   -A limit of 0.7 percent on the number of jobs in any region that
can be moved to another area in a year. Unions had feared that
Verizon would shift work to areas of cheaper labor within its newly
expanded territory.

<HEADLINE> Former Courier-Post publisher William A. Stretch dies at 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOORESTOWN, N.J. (AP) - William A. Stretch, the longtime general
manager and publisher of the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill, has died.
He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch, who lived in Haddonfield for many years before moving
to Moorestown four years ago, died Sunday at Virtua-West Jersey
Hospital, Marlton.
</P>
<P>
   He became involved with the newspaper in 1947, when his family
bought the Camden Evening Courier and Morning Post from the
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin for $3 million. At the time, the
paper was closed due to a labor strike and had not been published
for several months.
</P>
<P>
   During his 29-year tenure, Stretch served as treasurer, general
manager and publisher, a position he held until retiring in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   When the paper was sold to Gannett Company Inc. in 1959, Stretch
served as vice president/secretary of Southern New Jersey
Newspapers, a Gannett subsidiary. He became the company's president
in 1967, a position he held until his retirement. He was elected to
the Gannett Board of Directors in 1963.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- A key prosecution witness, who
reportedly saw a Libyan suspect plant the bomb that brought down
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was scheduled to take
the stand this week as the trial resumes after a three-week recess.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of two Libyans in the 1988 bombing that killed 270
people was to resume Tuesday at a special Scottish courthouse at
this former U.S. air base.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Abdel Majid Jiacha, reportedly saw one of the
defendants place the suitcase containing the bomb on an airport
conveyor belt in Malta, where all three worked for Libyan Arab
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants sent the suitcase
onto a flight from the Mediterranean island to Frankfurt, Germany,
where it was transferred as unaccompanied luggage onto a feeder
flight connecting with Flight 103 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Jiacha is considered the closest thing the prosecutors have to a
witness who can directly link the defendants to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   After the court recessed on July 27, Scottish legal experts said
prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendants were guilty of the mass murder. They also said the case
had been meticulously assembled from reams of forensic evidence
compiled from an 11-year international investigation and did not
hinge on one or two eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expect to wrap up their evidence in September,
handing the forum over to the defense lawyers, whose case is
expected to last several months. The trial began May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah face up to
life in a Scottish prison if convicted on charges of murder,
conspiracy to murder and lesser charges in the downing of the jet
Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist attack killed 259 passengers and crew -- including
189 Americans -- and 11 people in Lockerbie.

<HEADLINE> Oil Divers Reach Russian Submarine  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- For the divers who plunged to the ocean
floor looking for Russia's stricken nuclear submarine, it was not
unlike an ordinary day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Except that on ordinary days, they serve the oil industry,
finding, fixing or modifying just about anything that lies deep
under the water.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the time, technological advances are driven by military
needs, and only later find a civilian application. This time it was
the other way round.
</P>
<P>
   In roughly 30 hours, the team of four Norwegian and eight
British divers managed what Russia's Northern Fleet had failed to
do in a week. They dived to the Kursk nuclear submarine, opened one
of its hatches and confirmed what had been suspected for days: that
all 118 crewmen inside had to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the tragic denouement, ''it really wasn't much
different from what they do at the oil fields,'' said Julian
Thomson, a spokesman for the company that employs them, Stolt
Offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk had been stranded under 350 feet of water in the
Barents Sea since it sank more than a week ago. The Russian navy
tried for more than a week to open its emergency escape hatch with
one of its own miniature rescue submarine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian navy complains of having no cash for rescue
equipment, Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, can
afford the best, and has strict rules on offshore and diver safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is the first time that deep-sea divers have been
used in a submarine rescue, and they have proven that they can be
of use,'' Thomson said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian news media have dubbed the divers an elite of
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's stretching a bit,'' said Thomson. ''We don't really
want gung-ho, John Wayne types. These are our regular divers, and
all of them very experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular work for the divers can include diving under hundreds of
feet of water to install or maintain the vast array of equipment
needed to produced oil from under the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The divers are used to the enormous strain of extreme depths,
right at the limit of what humans can stand, both mentally and
physically,'' Bjoern Kahrs, who coordinated the dive from the
mother ship Seaway Eagle, was quoted telling the Oslo newspaper
Verdens Gang on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So the Kursk dive, the paper said, was nothing special-- ''like
wading.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said most of the divers are in their mid-to-late 30s,
with 15 to 20 years of experience, and a background related to
mechanical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not identified any of the divers, but Oslo
newspapers said the Norwegians were Jon Are Hvalbye, 40, Rune
Spjelkkavik, 42, Paal Stefan Dinessen, 34, and John Elias
Bjoerneset. They said the four have experience as military divers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a huge range of expertise and tools,'' said Thomson.
''These are excellent people to have on a job, because they can fix
almost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before descending, the divers go into a shipboard saturation
chamber, where pressure is increased to deep-water levels and they
breathe a mix of oxygen and helium. According to Thomson, the
helium makes their voices squeak, and special training is needed to
understand what they are saying.
</P>
<P>
   They can spend up to 30 days in the chamber, working under water
for about six hours a day, never alone. The rest of the time they
can read, watch videos or sleep, but they can never leave.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kursk effort, four three-man teams went down. Each
consisted of one man in a diving bell that brought them to the
bottom and two others outside. Umbilical cords from the bell to
their suits pumped breathing gas and circulated warm water to keep
them from freezing. A camera on their diving helmets transmitted
pictures to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   After the crew of the Kursk was declared dead, Russia asked
Norway and its divers to assist in the grim task of bringing the
bodies out.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said that would require lengthy planning, different
equipment and another team of divers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't risk more human lives,'' he said. ''If there is a
safe way of getting in and out, then we can do it.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Debby threatens Caribbean islands  </HEADLINE>
By MARVIN HOKSTAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) - Debby strengthened from a
tropical storm into a hurricane early Wednesday as it threatened
several northeast Caribbean islands still recovering from last
year's storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   Schools closed, people rushed to buy emergency supplies and
governments prepared shelters. Tourists crowded airports to flee
the storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned
away from the winds and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle
group abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300
miles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of
recurrent protest over military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with
unnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land, with
fears that it could directly hit the Puerto Rican capital of San
Juan around noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Debby was just southeast of the island of
Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands, heading for French, Dutch
and British islands overnight and expected to continue onto the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and then the Dominican
Republic. Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the
storm could threaten the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached
near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained
winds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to
be classified as a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially
fast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on
the same track for the next three days. The weather service said
winds were expected to reach about 86 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of
Guadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St.
Maarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on
storm watch Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott
warned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby
could pass right over Montserrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris
down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned,
though that area has been in the restricted danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for
a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned
off to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and
emergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes
unrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed
Debby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had
thought,'' Laskosky said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby
threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival
that began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting three of its ships
now in the eastern Caribbean to areas further north, west and south
to avoid the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service shut down
its grounds on the island of St. John. Boaters moored off the park
were told to move to safe harbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to
flee the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yachties'' spent the day securing boats in mangrove swamps and
other relatively safe areas like Hurricane Hole on the U.S. Virgin
Island of St. John.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to
flee the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lots of people want to leave today but unfortunately most of
the flights are already sold out,'' said travel agent Angela
Belfon.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shepherd of Richmond, Va., had been vacationing with his
wife, Terry, and children, but decided to leave a day early.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know with a hurricane,'' he said at St. Thomas
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Hurricane Alberto, the longest-lived August tropical
storm on record, was moving in a circle in the open Atlantic. At 11
a.m., the hurricane was about 985 miles west of the Azores and
moving north-northeast at about 6 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto formed Aug. 4 and hasn't threatened land.

<HEADLINE> Baby Panda's Birthday Celebrated  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- They lined up early and stayed late. Hua
Mei-niacs were out in force to celebrate the history-making baby
giant panda's first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of zoo-goers lined up before the park's 7:30 a.m.
opening Monday, hoping to be among the first to wish the 60-pound
bundle of black-and-white joy a happy birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been watching her on the Internet, and we've visited so
many times, she feels a little like a part of the family now,''
said Jim Helniak, who showed up with his wife, Sue, and their
10-year-old daughter, Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   As the first surviving Ailuropoda melanoleuca born in the United
States, Hua Mei has attracted the attention of admirers and
scientists alike.
</P>
<P>
   June Baker, 79, and her 39-year-old daughter Joanna, arrived at
the zoo at 8 a.m., and quickly made their way to the panda
enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen the panda before, but we wanted to come today and
experience all the festivities,'' Joanna Baker said. ''I wish she
knew just how much everyone wants to celebrate her birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, keepers presented Hua Mei with a special
cake made of bamboo frozen in ice and a group of children from
Mexico sang a Spanish birthday song.
</P>
<P>
   ''She interacted with her birthday cake,'' said Kathy Hawk, the
zoo's senior giant panda keeper, ''even throwing it on the ground a
few times, just like a typical child.''
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the festivities were the signing of a giant
birthday card, a bell tower chiming the ''Happy Birthday'' tune at
the panda's time of birth and a $2 million donation by Pacific Bell
to support panda research at the zoo over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the San Diego Zoo's pandas -- Hua Mei, and her
parents, Bai Yun, 9, and Shi Shi, 21 -- are on loan from China. The
contract expires in 2004 but the zoo is hoping for an extension.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Warn of Crowded Classes  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks to new school construction, portable
trailers won't be needed to house excess pupils this fall at
Dorothy Eisenberg Elementary School in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Ken Ligon will have 730 children in Eisenberg's 35
regular classrooms this year -- instead of 1,200 he would had to
find room for without the new classrooms built elsewhere in the
Clark County system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adding new schools has really made a difference,'' said Ligon,
who's spent four years in the nation's fastest-growing school
district. ''It has alleviated the crowding. It has enhanced the
education of the children. That's why we keep building them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also what the Clinton administration wants the rest of
the nation to do, as fall enrollments in America's schools are
expected to reach 53 million, a fifth consecutive record.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting overflow school enrollments into the next century,
President Clinton and Democrats used the annual projection of fall
enrollment to blast congressional Republicans for resisting
government proposals to help hire more teachers and build more
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The education spending debate, now taking center stage in the
presidential campaign, comes as renewal of major federal programs
remains bogged down in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our children deserve no less,'' Clinton said. ''We need to
build new schools and modernize existing ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Renewing its fight for smaller class sizes and new school
construction, the administration reported Monday that 53 million
public and private pupils will enter kindergarten through 12th
grade this fall, up from 52.8 million last year. The new figure is
considered a record because the Education Department had lowered
its estimate of last year's enrollment to 52.8 million from 53.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   College enrollment for fall 2000 also set a record of 15.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollments for charter schools, specially chartered public
schools that get freedom from standard rules and regulations in
exchange for better test scores and other increased student
performance, also rose to a record half-million students.
</P>
<P>
   The department report, based on state and national data, also
predicted school growth through the next century. Officials said
that by 2100, the nation's schools will have to find room for 94
million students -- almost double the current number of school-age
children, ages 5 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers will grow, officials say, because of increasing
immigration and a second baby boom, which will come two generations
after the record number of births in the middle of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas and New York expect to enroll the most
children this year, but Nevada, Arizona and Florida have posted the
highest rates of student growth over the last decade. Las Vegas
alone has seen school enrollment double to 200,000 since 1990.
State-by-state figures are unavailable for the century projections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to figure out where we will put these children,''
Education Secretary Richard Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress should pass a $24.8 billion tax proposal to
help states raise money to build new schools and fix old ones --
particularly in cities where buildings are more than a century old
and communities are too poor to get money from property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of 226 House members stands ready to vote for
the plan, said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders, however, have blocked Clinton's
education proposals. They include dedicating federal money for
states to hire more teachers and finance school construction bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who favor $1.8 billion in state grants, say the
Democratic plans are too costly and don't address the growing
populations of all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House's
education panel, said the $792 billion tax package vetoed by
Clinton last year included measures to help schools raise money for
repairs and construction: ''Now, he is perfectly willing to
criticize Republicans for something for which he has only himself
to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators said Monday the enrollment figures should push
lawmakers past the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually they are going to have parents tugging at their
sleeves,'' said John Jennings, a Washington-based education
researcher who worked on education policy for congressional
Democrats. ''Maybe these numbers are going to push them into
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just immigration,'' he said. ''There are more kids
everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Car Dealer To Offer Gun Giveaway  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- With deer-hunting season fast
approaching, car dealer Greg ''Lumpy'' Lambert took a shot in the
dark with a new promotion: a gun voucher with every auto sale and a
water pistol for every child.
</P>
<P>
   Gun opponents aren't happy about his planned ''Second
Amendment'' sales campaign set for Saturday, but Lambert said that
most of the calls he has gotten have been fairly positive or
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in East Tennessee,'' he said Monday. ''This is a
sportsman's paradise. We thought just before fall, just before
deer-hunting season, that it might be nice to have a promotion like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, 34, runs a small family-owned car lot called Advantage
Auto Sales in a Knoxville suburb. He typically has 15 to 20 used
cars for sale at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to offer vouchers for a bolt-action, 8 mm deer rifle,
valued at around $100. The vouchers will be voided if the holders
aren't qualified to own a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a business standpoint, if I sell a couple of cars or if I
just get people to come out and look at what I have, I will
consider it a success,'' Lambert said of the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it in any way helps promote responsible and safe firearms
ownership, then from a political standpoint, it will be an
overwhelming success,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A Knoxville minister criticized Lambert's plan to give away toy
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rifles have legitimate purposes,'' said the Rev. Tom Rhodes of
Westside Unitarian Universalist Church. ''It is deeply disturbing
that they will be giving toy firearms to children. I don't think
even the NRA would support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Paiss, a spokeswoman for Washington-based Handgun Control
Inc., called the entire promotion irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is possible to further lower the image of used car
salesmen,'' she told The Knoxville News-Sentinel, ''this guy has
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar gun giveaways and raffles across the country in the past
year have met with mixed success. In January, the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department abandoned a raffle after gun control
advocates complained.
</P>
<P>
   But the previous month, a Future Farmers of America chapter at a
North Carolina school, expecting to raise several thousand dollars
for a building project, instead earned more than $20,000 by
raffling five guns.

<HEADLINE> China Tycoon's Prison Term Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A businessman once billed as China's
richest man lost his last appeal Tuesday in a bank fraud case and
will serve a life prison term, a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubei Province Higher People's Court upheld the conviction
of Mou Qizhong, former president of the Land Group, according to
the court in the central Chinese province. He has no other
opportunities for appeals, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Mou, 58, was sentenced in May to life imprisonment on charges of
fraudulently using letters of credit in a case that cost a state
bank $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mou became famous in 1989 for swapping 500 freight cars of
socks, shoes and other goods for four Soviet jetliners, netting $25
million. He financed soccer clubs and a scientific expedition to
the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   During the chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Mou was
jailed for criticizing the radical leadership that had destroyed
what was left of private business.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to death, but regained his freedom in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed again in 1983 for ''speculating,'' Mou was freed a year
later.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Governor Signs Pesticide Law  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYOSSET, N.Y. (AP) -- Nicole Hudson was gardening outside her
Farmingville home when she spied a white cloud with a noxious odor
wafting over from her neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   As the mix of chemicals floated toward an open bedroom of her
house where her newborn slept, Hudson called over to the worker who
was clad in protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry about it lady, I'm done already,'' he yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   In horror, she raced upstairs to find her baby, who was crying.
The child was later treated for allergic reaction to a toxic
chemical. Hudson was told to destroy the baby's linens.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's story helped pass legislation aimed at protecting New
York residents against the possible harmful effects of pesticide
spraying by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires companies that use pesticides to give at least
a 48-hour warning to neighbors living within 150 feet of any
spraying site. It also requires schools and day care facilities to
provide parents and staff with a notice before pesticides are
applied on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki on Monday signed the bill, which advocates
say is the nation's first law of its kind. The neighbor
notification law goes into effect March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every neighbor will now know to take in the wash, close the
windows, and not have the kids roll around in the yard,'' Pataki
said at the bill signing ceremony in the Willets Elementary school
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great victory for the health and safety of our
residents,'' Neal Lewis, head of the Nassau-Suffolk Neighborhood
Network, who first suggested the legislation after hearing Hudson's
story in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Notices must contain information regarding the date and location
of applications, as well as the name of the product being applied.
The law allows exemptions for more than 30 specific types of
pesticides with a low toxicity, such as boric acid and
horticultural oils, and for pesticide applications to cemeteries
and spot treatments of less than 9 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said at least seven states allow residents to register
with the state if they want to be notified about pesticide spraying
near their home. But New York will become the first to require
residents of adjacent properties to be warned ahead of time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this bill will set the standard for states
throughout the country,'' said State Sen. Carl Marcellino,
R-Plainview, who cosponsored the bill with Assemblyman Tom
DiNapoli, D-Thomaston.

<HEADLINE> Government To Monitor Flight Delays  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal task force will begin monitoring
airline performance after a summer travel season marred by
thousands of flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing formation of the task force, Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said his department will serve as a
clearinghouse to share information and praised the industry for a
''positive ... cooperative spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ''will result in improved service'' in both the
long- and short-term the secretary told a briefing. As he spoke he
was joined by airline, union and airport executives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Slater said, airlines have promised to more
promptly inform the Federal Aviation Administration when they
cancel flights, so air traffic controllers can more efficiently use
the available airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Some 670 million Americans will fly this year, up 20 million
from a year ago, Slater said. He called it an increase that is
taxing the system and could not have been foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported more than 44,000 flight delays in July alone,
and that was an improvement from June.
</P>
<P>
   It's is hard to get cooperation in a competitive industry,
Slater observed, but he called the meeting ''a necessary first step
in resolving some of the challenges'' faced by the business. He
said further sessions are planned with consumer advocates and
smaller airlines.
</P>
<P>
   At the session, participants from nine major airlines, several
unions, and airports groups discussed ways they could better
cooperate, said Slater.
</P>
<P>
   He said his newly formed a task force on airline service
performance will monitor the carriers and report back to him in 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the difficult and busy summer season is
nearly at an end. That could help matters by reducing the demand
for service.
</P>
<P>
   Increased numbers of people traveling, a spate of bad weather
and -- at least at one airline -- labor disagreements have made this
summer a time of air travel discontent for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, which has said it had to cancel many flights in
a dispute with its pilots, was represented at the meeting, as were
officials of the two largest pilots unions. Slater said the airline
and pilots are ''making progress'' in their talks.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also reported that his department has identified several
''choke points'' in the air traffic control system and efforts are
being made to solve problems at those points.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said he has asked the airlines to develop contingency
programs for extremely busy periods such as the upcoming Labor Day
holiday and the Thanksgiving and Christmas travel seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the president of the American Automobile
Association offered suggestions for improving air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Atlanta Rotary Club, Robert L. Darbelnet called
for privatizing the air traffic control system and urged Congress
to fully fund aviation improvements. He also proposed expanding the
system with new airports or better use of regional airports and
said airlines should be required to collaborate with the FAA and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While this has been a summer of extraordinary air travel
problems, the issue isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   Beset with complaints about delays and poor service, the
airlines staved off congressional action last year by promising to
treat customers better and to be more forthright with passengers
all the way through their travel experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Transportation Department inspectors checked earlier
this year to find out whether the airlines were living up to that
pledge, they found varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Airlines are making a clear and genuine effort at
strengthening the attention paid to customer service, but
bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' the department's inspector
general said in a preliminary report to Congress. ''The airlines
have a way to go to restore consumer confidence.''

<HEADLINE> Primaries in Alaska, Okla., Wyoming  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Oklahoma Democrats hope to position themselves to
recapture an
open House seat in a district where they outnumber Republicans as
three states hold primaries on Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No primary opponents rose to challenge two top Republicans in
Wyoming and Alaska, while a GOP House member in Wyoming is up
against two poorly funded challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming, a first-term Republican, faced no
primary opposition. GOP Rep. Don Young, Alaska's lone House member,
also saw no challengers for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, three Democrats and seven Republicans are seeking
their parties' nominations for a seat left open by GOP Rep. Tom
Coburn, who kept a campaign promise to retire after three terms.
Democrats, who outnumber Republicans 5-to-2 in the district, held
the seat until Coburn's victory in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seeking the nomination include state Rep. Bill Settle
and James ''Jim Bob'' Wilson, who campaigns on the fact he is not a
lawyer. Coburn's chosen successor is Republican car dealer Andy
Ewing. Another GOP candidate is Mark Detro, who faces drug and
assault-and-battery charges.

<HEADLINE> Hastert: Clinton Wrong on Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican tax cuts passed by Congress this
year would consume far less of the budget surplus than the White
House claims, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a letter to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., included a plea for cooperation on year-end
budget negotiations in the letter Monday even as he called the
president ''wildly'' wrong in contending the tax cuts would cost
nearly $2 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. President, let's get the people's work done and not play
politics with the budget process,'' Hastert said. ''We proved last
year we could reach agreement, and we can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said White House spending proposals of $1 trillion over
10 years would dwarf the GOP tax cuts of about half that size and
pose a greater threat to reaching a budget compromise before
Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has frequently contended that tax cuts passed or moving
in this year's GOP-led Congress, coupled with tax cuts passed last
year, would total $1.8 trillion over the next decade including
higher interest payments on public debt and would consume nearly
all of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Many of this year's cuts, however, duplicate those passed last
year, such as gradual repeal of the estate tax. Citing new
nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, Hastert said
this year's Congress has actually passed $531.5 billion in tax cuts
over 10 years -- or about 11.6 percent of the total projected
surplus of $4.56 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your assertion that Republicans have passed nearly $2 trillion
in tax relief is wildly off the mark,'' Hastert told the president.
''We can afford to provide some common-sense tax relief to the
American people, whose hard work and tax dollars build up this
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta told
Hastert in a letter that the administration wants to ''work
together on fiscally responsible'' tax cuts and spending
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''As it now stands, however, your party continues to support an
irresponsible tax strategy that abandons the fiscal discipline that
led our country out of deficits and toward the economic prosperity
we enjoy today,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta added that over 10 years, Republican tax cuts Congress
passed this year would take $900 billion of the surplus, counting
interest. The White House adds to that figure tax cuts of $1.3
trillion proposed by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush. When
duplicate items are eliminated, Podesta said, the total cuts amount
to about $2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert will join Clinton on a one-day trip Aug. 30 to Colombia,
giving the two time to discuss the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The $531.5 billion figure cited by Hastert has one flaw: It
assumes budget rules mandating that the marriage penalty tax cut
vetoed by Clinton expire after five years, costing $89.8 billion.
If continued through the entire decade, that bill would have
ballooned to $292 billion, bringing the total in GOP tax cuts this
year to more than $733 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also told Clinton it was ''disappointing'' that Senate
Democrats have blocked legislation that would formally lock away
all Social Security and Medicare surpluses only for those programs.
Republicans and Democrats have, however, agreed to honor these
''lockboxes'' and pay down more than $220 billion in public debt.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have much work to do when they return from recess in
early September. Only two of the 13 annual government spending
bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 have been signed into
law and there are major disagreements on many others. No one,
however, envisions a government shutdown confrontation like that of
1995.
</P>
<P>
   GOP aides say Republicans are likely to try for one final tax
bill, most likely including an expansion of contributions to
individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s, new taxpayer rights and
a measure backed by Clinton to boost private investment and make
capital available in poor inner cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Time capsule of 1873 goes online  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - People who want to see the contents of an
1873 city of Rochester time capsule need only to click onto the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking onto the Web site - www.rochestertimecapsule.com -
those interested can read, hear and see the contents of the copper
box taken from the old City Hall in May.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web site, which debuted Monday, welcomes suggestions for
the contents of a new Rochester time capsule to be buried next
year. It also invites messages and predictions for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of another place where you would go to get such a
complete account of a time capsule,'' said Connie Bodner, director
of collections and research at the Rochester Museum &AMP; Science
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The time capsule's contents are on display at the museum, but
Bodner stresses that the Web site will reach people who can't come
to the museum, just as it will help teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site lists, pictures and describes most of the capsule's
items. It also includes transcriptions of letters, such as that of
Rochester merchant William Scrantom to the mayor of Rochester at
the time of the capsule's opening.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Blast Could Spur Safety Bills  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The deaths of 11 people from a New Mexico
natural gas pipeline explosion may force Congress to pass
long-stalled legislation to intensify inspections of underground
pipelines, a lawmaker says.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two people were killed by natural gas pipeline accidents
between 1986 and June 30, according to the Office of Pipeline
Safety, an agency of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's galling to think that more tragedies could happen while
these bills sit in committee,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., a
sponsor of one of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   A man who died Monday in a Lubbock, Texas, hospital, was the
11th victim of Saturday's explosion of a buried natural gas
pipeline near Carlsbad, N.M. Five children were among those killed
when the pre-dawn explosion swept flames down the Pecos River's
banks and through tents where two families were camping.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter-in-law of the man who died Monday remained in
critical condition in Lubbock. The woman's parents, husband and two
children were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The last major pipeline safety bill passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the window of opportunity,'' Inslee said Monday. ''We
need to pass out a comprehensive pipeline safety bill now, not wait
until next session.''
</P>
<P>
   A gasoline pipeline broke in June 1999 in Bellingham, Wash., and
the ensuing fire killed three people. That accident led to an
influx of proposed regulations and reports, but none has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee said he already has been promised a committee hearing on
the issue and expects a pipeline safety bill to make it out of
Congress this session.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is the type of bill that makes it out of
Congress,'' he said. ''If it doesn't have any meat on its bones,
then it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Various versions of House and Senate pipeline safety
legislation, including bills introduced by Inslee, Rep. Bob Franks,
R-N.J., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would require more pipeline
operator training and periodic pipeline testing. The Transportation
Department does not mandate rechecks once pipes are in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation also would increase penalties for unsafe pipelines,
including cash fines and possible shutdown of a substandard pipe,
and public disclosure of all pipe locations.
</P>
<P>
   ''No longer are these pipes buried underground only in remote
locations, miles away from the nearest home or business,'' Franks
said in a speech last month. ''In my home state, thousands of
people live or work in immediate proximity to pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety office has tried for six years to create a national
pipeline map without completing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many things wrong with our pipeline system and many
things that need to be fixed,'' Inslee said.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector general's report in March criticized the Office of
Pipeline Safety for failure to complete improved inspections
required by a 1992 law of unusually sensitive and highly populated
areas of the 325,000 miles of natural gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   OPS was supposed to have completed the first step by 1994 but
has not, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding congressional mandates all will be met before
the end of the year, OPS said in its response to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4849, H.R. 4749, and S.2438.

<HEADLINE> Group Protests Scout's Gay Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Corey Brunson wants her 4-year-old son to
join the Boy Scouts in a few years -- but only if the organization
alters its anti-gay stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This judgmental attitude and discrimination is going on, and I
don't think this is right,'' she said. ''I reject the notion that
this is a private organization. It couldn't survive without public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunson joined about a dozen marchers Monday who delivered a
55,000-signature petition to the Boy Scouts of America headquarters
in Irving, near Dallas. Similar rallies were planned in front of
Boy Scout offices in 36 cities in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said they were looking for a conversation and not a
confrontation over the organization's policy barring homosexuals
from its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed,'' Dave Rice, a former Scout leader who
marched in Irving. ''We don't like confrontation. We like to sit
down, shake hands and discuss a solution that's mutually
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public pressure, the Boys Scouts weren't budging
from their position on gays.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Shields, spokesman for The National Council of the Boy
Scouts of America, said homosexuality runs counter to the oath
requiring Scouts to be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize the rights of all people to hold opinions
different than ours,'' he said. ''We stress that we are a private
organization and that no one is forced to be a Boy Scout. People
who share our values and beliefs are welcome to join.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Supreme Court agreed, ruling 5-4 that the group was
allowed to bar homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting For All, a nonprofit organization, helped organize and
coordinate the nationwide protests. Its founder, Steven Cozza, 15,
of Petaluma, Calif., said he started the group several years ago
after his father was removed as a Scout leader for supporting gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scoutmasters are people to look up to. What's wrong with being
influenced by a gay man? Someone's sexuality has nothing to do with
his character or personality,'' Cozza said.
</P>
<P>
   Cozza, who said neither he nor his father is gay, left the Boy
Scouts about six months ago after becoming an Eagle Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Not all support Cozza's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Henderson, a Boy Scout leader in Dallas, said he thinks
homosexuality is a sin and supports the scouting policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want them in a position of leadership,'' he said.
''We're not against gay people; just their lifestyle. Would they be
a bad influence on a scout troop? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Leandro, Calif., about 20 people walked outside the Boy
Scouts' San Francisco Bay area office, chanting and toting signs
saying ''Blatant Bigots'' and ''True leaders teach love and
tolerance, not hate and bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not here to be disrespectful to the Boy Scouts of America.
But we can't be silent,'' said Jan Tyler, a Bay Area Cub Scout
leader. ''Gays and lesbians are in every niche in our society, and
to exclude them based on sexual orientation is ludicrous.''

<HEADLINE> Bush and Gore on the Soldier's Life  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disagreeing over a missile defense shield and
nuclear arms, presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore
are tangling over sky-high strategic questions in their military
policies. But neither has forgotten about the soldier on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest months of his candidacy, Republican Bush has
proposed a $1 billion a year pay raise over and above the increases
that military personnel have been seeing in their checks. And
Democrat Gore has weighed in with proposals of his own to improve
the soldier's life.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his ideas Monday to the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Milwaukee, Bush accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of letting morale and manpower slip and got a
standing ovation with his vow: ''I will give our military a clear
sense of mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who unlike Bush is a veteran of a foreign war -- Vietnam --
was addressing the group Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of life for military families was popularized as a
campaign issue by Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Vietnam
prisoner of war, who, in his failed bid for the GOP presidential
nomination, called attention to the fact that thousands of service
members get food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts don't necessarily think that is a bad
thing, regarding food stamps as just another item on a long list of
military benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But it has become a mark of shame, and both Gore and Bush say
conditions must be improved so that soldiers no longer need to
depend on the coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also says the number of active service members receiving
the vouchers has dwindled by two-thirds in a decade, to about
6,000, reminding everyone that food stamps in the military date
back well before the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, the debate over defense policy has turned on the
size and timing of a national missile defense system, with Bush
pushing for an ambitious and quick deployment and Gore preferring a
limited system that could be negotiated with the Russians --
partners in a treaty that forbids such missile shields. In all,
Bush has proposed spending $20 billion more over five years for
weapons research and development
</P>
<P>
   As well, Bush has proposed reducing the nation's nuclear weapons
stockpile and suggested he would do so even if the Russians don't
follow suit. Gore says unilateral cuts could upset the nuclear
balance.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush would raise military pay by $1 billion a year for five
years on top of the $76 billion increase approved by Congress and
signed by President Clinton this month. Bush says the typical
soldier would earn about $750 more in the first year from his plan.
Gore supported the 3.7 percent pay increase enacted this month; his
position on further increases is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore and Bush generally favor re-enlistment bonuses and higher
pay for people with special skills.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore says more pre-emptive diplomacy would limit the need to
send soldiers to new crises abroad. Bush says he would review
overseas deployments with the aim of reducing the number of troops
on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush proposes spending $310 million to speed the improvement
of schools on or near military bases. He favors unspecified
increases in housing allowances or renovations to ensure service
members ''no longer have to tolerate substandard housing.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore says he would ensure ''all military members and families
live in adequate, affordable housing,'' by expanding the Clinton
administration's effort to improve services. He would ''put the
private sector to work building, owning, and managing housing for
the military,'' and spend more on employment services and
continuing education for military spouses, child care and steps to
improve health care.

<HEADLINE> Debby Threatens Caribbean Islands  </HEADLINE>
By MARVIN HOKSTAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) -- Debby strengthened from a
tropical storm into a hurricane early Tuesday as it threatened
several northeast Caribbean islands still recovering from last
year's storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   Schools closed, people rushed to buy emergency supplies and
governments prepared shelters. Tourists crowded airports to flee
the storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned
away from the winds and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle
group abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300
miles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of
recurrent protest over military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with
unnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land, with
fears that it could directly hit the Puerto Rican capital of San
Juan around noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Debby was just southeast of the island of
Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands, heading for French, Dutch
and British islands overnight and expected to continue onto the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and then the Dominican
Republic. Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the
storm could threaten the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached
near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained
winds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to
be classified as a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially
fast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on
the same track for the next three days. The weather service said
winds were expected to reach about 86 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of
Guadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St.
Maarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on
storm watch Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott
warned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby
could pass right over Montserrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris
down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned,
though that area has been in the restricted danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for
a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned
off to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and
emergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes
unrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed
Debby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had
thought,'' Laskosky said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby
threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival
that began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting three of its ships
now in the eastern Caribbean to areas further north, west and south
to avoid the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service shut down
its grounds on the island of St. John. Boaters moored off the park
were told to move to safe harbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to
flee the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yachties'' spent the day securing boats in mangrove swamps and
other relatively safe areas like Hurricane Hole on the U.S. Virgin
Island of St. John.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to
flee the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lots of people want to leave today but unfortunately most of
the flights are already sold out,'' said travel agent Angela
Belfon.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shepherd of Richmond, Va., had been vacationing with his
wife, Terry, and children, but decided to leave a day early.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know with a hurricane,'' he said at St. Thomas
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Hurricane Alberto, the longest-lived August tropical
storm on record, was moving in a circle in the open Atlantic. At 11
a.m., the hurricane was about 985 miles west of the Azores and
moving north-northeast at about 6 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto formed Aug. 4 and hasn't threatened land.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Stress Vietnam Service  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A day after George W. Bush told veterans the
Clinton-Gore administration had all but ruined the military, Al
Gore was delivering the opposite message, telling the same group
that America's fighting forces are the strongest and most modern in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was to stress his experience as a Vietnam veteran in
remarks Tuesday to the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, his spokesman Chris Lehane said. Gore was an Army journalist
in Vietnam; Bush was a fighter jet pilot in the Texas Air National
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, also planned to
highlight his role in military affairs while serving in the House
and Senate, Lehane said. One example likely to be mentioned is that
Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman both crossed party lines in
the Senate to vote in favor of the Persian Gulf War, a conflict
opposed by most Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based both on his public and his private experiences, he feels
that the approach we have taken over the last eight years and the
approach he's taken through the agenda he has put forth is the
right approach,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   That $127 billion agenda includes higher pay for personnel,
investments to modernize equipment and more funding for veterans
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival Bush has proposed pumping billions
into service member pay and spending $310 million program to fix
schools on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush told the VFW that U.S. forces are overextended
in deployments overseas. Under the Clinton-Gore administration,
there has been an average of one new deployment every nine weeks,
while defense spending has declined nearly 40 percent, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next president will inherit a military in decline,'' he
said. ''As president, I will rebuild the military power of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said the administration has reversed a decline
in defense spending that it said began when Republicans ruled the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican, also took issue
with Bush's assertion, pointing to an administration proposal to
boost Pentagon spending by $112 billion through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you will see a military on the ascendancy,'' said
Cohen, who addressed the VFW gathering earlier Monday.

<P>
   Lehane said Gore would report to the 1.9 million member VFW that
''we have the best prepared, most powerful, most modern military in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in defense spending date back to 1986 and the Reagan
administration, and military expenditures as a percentage of the
gross national product declined each year after that through the
administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal 1989 defense budget was $295 billion, dropping to
$262 billion in 1991. The fiscal 2001 defense spending bill Clinton
signed two weeks ago totaled $288 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration signed a 4.8 percent military pay
increase, the largest in a generation, and Gore supports an
additional 3.7 percent pay increase enacted this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advocates additional pay hikes of $1 billion a year over
five years. Gore says the size of Bush's proposed $1 trillion,
10-year tax cut would leave little funds for such a big pay hike.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally in Quincy, Ill., near the end of their
post-convention tour, Lieberman said Gore, as vice president, has
been ''fighting to keep America's military and make it, frankly,
the best-equipped, best-trained, most powerful fighting force in
the history of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And we'll keep it that way when Al is elected president,''
Lieberman added.

<HEADLINE> Helton Reaches .400, Then Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton reached the .400 mark with two
singles, then fell back a point when he struck out in the eighth
inning Monday night for the Colorado Rockies against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After his soft single to center off Kevin Millwood in the sixth
inning, Helton's average was an even .400. He is the first person
since George Brett to reach that mark this late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Helton struck out against reliever Mike Remlinger, dropping him
to .399.
</P>
<P>
   Brett was hitting above .400 on Sept. 4, 1980. Helton already
has surpassed the 502 plate appearances needed to qualify for the
batting title.
</P>
<P>
   Helton has captured the nation's attention on the strength of an
impressive August. With two hits in four at-bats Monday night, he
was 27-for-46 (.587) during a 13-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins WR Thomas Injures Hip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins wide receiver Lamar Thomas injured
his right hip on the first play from scrimmage in Monday night's
17-14 exhibition victory over Green Bay and could be lost for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suffered a ''fractured dislocation'' of the hip, team
officials said, after catching a 5-yard pass from Damon Huard. He
was tackled by linebacker Mike Morton and left the field several
minutes later on a stretcher. He was undergoing surgery late Monday
night at Holy Cross Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the details of the injury,'' Dolphins coach Dave
Wannstedt said. ''As far as his status for the season, we won't
know until tomorrow. ... What a shame. He's had a terrific camp and
a terrific offseason and then this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eight-year career, Thomas has 106 catches for 1,558 yards
and 10 touchdowns. He missed all of last season with a left
shoulder injury sustained during the preseason.

<HEADLINE> NFL Training Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.J. Johnson, whom the Miami Dolphins were counting on as their
starting running back, faces a four-game suspension for violating
the NFL's steroid policy, said a football source familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has appealed the suspension. The source, who did not
want to be identified, said unless the ruling is overturned by
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Johnson would miss the first four
games this season. A decision on the appeal is expected before
Miami's opener against Seattle on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The league declined to comment, but it has a a no-tolerance
policy regarding steroid use, which means Johnson, 26, would be
suspended for his first offense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a second-round pick in 1999, started four games as a
rookie and led the team with 558 yards rushing on 164 carries with
four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Chargers
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Ryan Leaf will be a starting quarterback again.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Jim Harbaugh all but declared San Diego's competition
over after Leaf took the first snaps in practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's probably Ryan who's the starting quarterback,''
Harbaugh said. ''He took the first snaps today, he took the start
the last game. He's earned it, though. Everybody's had a shot at it
and he's taken his opportunities and played real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Riley is holding back on the decision -- for now.
</P>
<P>
Raiders
</P>
<P>
   Oakland signed receiver Andre Rison, a five-time Pro Bowl
selection who was waived by Kansas City last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day I was released I already knew where I was going,''
Rison said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs said their decision to waive Rison was based on the
desire to develop young talent, not the 33-year-old's performance
in training camp. Last season, he had just 21 catches and no
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Titans
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee got a scare when All-Pro defensive end Jevon Kearse
twisted his right ankle at practice and limped to the sidelines.
The NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year twisted his ankle at the end
of a running play.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Fisher said Kearse should be fine after putting ice
on his ankle to reduce swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's too good an athlete to be hurt,'' said Fisher, noting
Kearse's value to the team.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer sat out Monday's practice with a sore
shoulder. However, offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said the
problem was ''nothing serious,'' just slight soreness from overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has completed 25 of 48 passes for 340 yards in the
preseason. He has thrown for one touchdown and been intercepted
once.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already have lost starting receiver Rob Moore,
cornerback Coby Rhinehart and defensive back-special teams player
J.J. McCleskey to season-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
Bengals
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati cut longtime placekicker Doug Pelfrey after he was
beaten out by rookie Neil Rackers. The most accurate kicker in
Bengals history, Pelfrey was the second-leading scorer for the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But he expected to lose his job, partly because of economics,
partly because of age, partly because Rackers outkicked him in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   He went up to Rackers and told the rookie he had won the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Doug was eager to get a new start somewhere,'' Rackers
said. ''He was upbeat on the outside, but that's the way he always
is.''
</P>
<P>
Ravens
</P>
<P>
   Tony Siragusa was upbeat after joining Baltimore, ending a
four-week holdout. The 33-year-old defensive tackle had one year,
at $1.5 million, left on the four-year contract he signed before
the 1997 season. The Ravens added two years to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy. I got what I wanted,'' said Siragusa, who missed
all of training camp. ''I just wish it would have been done
earlier. But I decided to take a stand and stand up for what I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects to play in the Sept. 3 opener at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a valued member of what we're doing,'' coach Brian
Billick said. ''Obviously he's got an uphill battle in terms of
getting himself in shape in quick order, but he's a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Siragusa played in 14 games last year on a unit that ranked
second in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
Lions
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Mike Tomczak was placed on injured reserve, three
days after the 16-year veteran broke his leg in an exhibition loss
to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   He was subbing for Charlie Batch, Detroit's top quarterback, who
recently resumed practice after recovering from a broken bone in
his right knee, but is being held out of games.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak was 6-of-12 for 37 yards before he was knocked down by
Oakland linebacker Greg Biekert and stayed on the ground, curled up
in pain and grasping his shin.
</P>
<P>
Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith, who left training camp to
consider retirement, likely won't return to the team, his agent
said. But a final decision on retirement is not imminent as Smith
''will take his time,'' agent Steve Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year veteran left the Cowboys two weeks ago because of
a congenital degenerative disc in his lower back. He may be put on
the reserved/retired list soon, Cowboys vice president Stephen
Jones said. But Smith also has an offer to remain with the team in
another capacity.

<HEADLINE> N.Koreans Demand Japan Compensation  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Decades of antagonism resurfaced Tuesday as North
Korea and Japan started talks on setting up official ties, with the
North demanding compensation for wartime aggression and Tokyo
urging information on suspected abductions.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations come amid an unprecedented series of diplomatic
overtures by communist North Korea. But the blunt exchange of
demands was a fresh reminder of how difficult it will be for the
old enemies to reach an understanding.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's chief negotiator Jong Thae Hwa met with Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono on Tuesday. A ministry official who was at the
meeting, and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Jong told Kono
that Japan's refusal to make amends for its 1910-1945 colonization
of the Korean Peninsula was the main obstacle to closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   Kono responded by reiterating Japan's long-held demand that
Pyongyang aggressively investigate the suspected kidnappings of
Japanese by North Korean agents in the 1970s, allegedly to serve as
language teachers for spies. Jong repeated the North's denial of
the abductions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Tokyo, scheduled through Thursday, are the second
round of negotiations begun four months ago in Pyongyang, North
Korea's capital. Prior to that meeting, discussions had been
suspended for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kono-Jong talks, negotiating teams met for an hour and
agreed to discuss details of their positions on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expressed optimism because of thawing relations
between democratic South Korea and the long-isolated North,
following a June summit.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's talks echoed disagreements raised by Japanese and
North Korean negotiators at the April talks in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry official who briefed reporters on customary
condition of anonymity said his impression was that the two sides
haven't budged on the main issues.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's top negotiator Kojiro Takano suggested that the
kidnappings would have to be addressed in any eventual agreement in
order to win the backing of the public and Parliament, the ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives of the missing shouted ''Give them back,'' as
the limousines of the North Korean delegation arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Jong told Takano that North Korea remains immovable on its
principal demands -- compensation and apology for the colonization,
a return of cultural treasures allegedly taken by Japanese
soldiers, and improving the legal status of Koreans living in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted he still hoped for an agreement by the end of the
year, set as a target by both parties.

<HEADLINE> AWOL U.S. Lt. Col. Defends Himself  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) -- A U.S. Army Reserve intelligence
officer who alarmed the American military when he went AWOL turned
up Monday in Israel, saying he hasn't revealed any government
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse met with U.S. diplomats and Israeli
police for more than three hours on the understanding he was free
to go when he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a spy,'' Mattysse told reporters after leaving
Israel's international crimes unit in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah
Tikva. ''There's been many things said about me which aren't true.
I didn't give any classified information to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse said he had ''not decided yet'' how long he would stay
in Israel. He left the station in a police car, not saying where he
was headed.
</P>
<P>
   American military officials said they're especially concerned
about Mattysse's absence because of his background in U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in
Atlanta, said last week that it would be logical for an
investigation to include ensuring that nothing was missing from
offices where Mattysse worked.
</P>
<P>
   Police located Mattysse, 50, at a youth hostel in Mitzpeh Ramon,
a desert town famed for its crater and its hippie culture. He wore
the knitted skullcap typical of Orthodox Jews and a T-shirt with a
floral motif.
</P>
<P>
   Police emphasized that he was cooperating of his own free will.
Israel has no provision for arresting someone who deserts a foreign
army.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio, Texas, as a full-time
reserve officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists
in intelligence work. Mattysse failed to report to duty on Aug. 8
after a vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group in San
Antonio earlier this year after an investigation began into his
wife's allegations that he had an extramarital affair. The San
Antonio Express-News reported that his wife, Vanda Mattysse, filed
a divorce complaint March 7 in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rivka Artzi-Nir, a woman who lives in Israel and identified
herself as Mattysse's girlfriend, has told Israeli newspapers he
had become devoted to helping Israel since he converted to Judaism
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Artzi-Nir went to the police station, but said police told her
Mattysse had no interest in seeing her and denied a relationship
with her. Artzi-Nir, 48, has said Mattysse sent her classified
material through the mail. She showed reporters a photo of the two
sitting on a porch, arms linked.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Yoram Sheftel, who successfully defended Cleveland
autoworker John Demjanjuk against charges he committed crimes
against humanity while serving as a World War II concentration camp
guard, said he was ready to defend Mattysse and accused police of
kowtowing to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, a right-wing legislator, compared Mattysse to
Jonathan Pollard, the former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst
sentenced to life in prison in the United States for selling
secrets to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hundreds of Israeli soldiers are in the United States who fled
the army, no one arrested them,'' Kleiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The police could deport Mattysse once his tourist visa runs out,
but as a Jew Mattysse would be eligible for automatic citizenship.
Interior Ministry officials said Mattysse has asked to immigrate to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Tycoon's Prison Term Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A businessman once billed as China's
richest man lost his last appeal Tuesday in a bank fraud case and
will serve a life prison term, a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubei Province Higher People's Court upheld the conviction
of Mou Qizhong, former president of the Land Group, according to
the court in the central Chinese province. He has no other
opportunities for appeals, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Mou, 58, was sentenced in May to life imprisonment on charges of
fraudulently using letters of credit in a case that cost a state
bank $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mou became famous in 1989 for swapping 500 freight cars of
socks, shoes and other goods for four Soviet jetliners, netting $25
million. He financed soccer clubs and a scientific expedition to
the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   During the chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Mou was
jailed for criticizing the radical leadership that had destroyed
what was left of private business.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to death, but regained his freedom in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed again in 1983 for ''speculating,'' Mou was freed a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also upheld convictions and sentences for
three Land Group employees who helped Mou and a fine of $600,000
for the company, a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Hong, Land's chief financial officer, was sentenced to three
years in prison. Mou Chen and Mou Bo, relatives of Mou, received
prison terms of three and two years, respectively, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Debby Threatens Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
By MARVIN HOKSTAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) -- Islanders and tourists scrambled
to prepare for Hurricane Debby as the storm gained strength and
threatened to make landfall Tuesday in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, was moving
west-northwest along the northern Leeward Islands early Tuesday, at
speeds near 21 mph. Shortly after 5 a.m., the eye was located 40
miles southeast of St. Maarten, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools closed on Monday, people stocked emergency supplies,
governments prepared shelters and tourists crowded airports to
flee, even as airlines canceled flights. Cruise ships turned away
from the wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous battering waves and 4 to 6 inches of rain were
expected in the path of the storm, which emerged with unnerving
suddenness over the weekend and became the first hurricane of the
storm season to threaten landfall.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, there were fears of a
direct hit on the capital, San Juan, which could bring
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it looks like its coming directly here,'' forecaster
Ed Tirado said from the San Juan office of the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach
74 miles per hour. Debby was upgraded to a hurricane overnight, and
forecasters expected the storm to strengthen further.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were in effect from Guadeloupe northwest
through the British and the U.S. Virgin islands and Puerto Rico. A
hurricane warning was issued for the north coast of the vulnerable,
populous Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was issued in the southeastern Bahamas, and
one remained in effect for northern Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning flashed across San Juan Bay early Tuesday and gusting
winds carrying a torrent of rain bent palm trees along the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 25 miles, and
tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 175 miles, mainly
to the north of the center, the weather service said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle
group abandoned training exercises off the Puerto Rican island of
Vieques -- the site of recurrent protest over military exercises --
and moved 300 miles south, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said it was too early to gauge the threat to the
U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service closed its
grounds on St. John. Boaters moored off the island park were told
to move to safe harbors. Hotels refused new reservations as their
guests tried to flee the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lots of people want to leave today but unfortunately most of
the flights are already sold out,'' said travel agent Angela
Belfon.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shepherd of Richmond, Virginia, vacationing with his family,
decided to leave early.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know with a hurricane,'' he said at St. Thomas
airport.
</P>
<P>
   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, southwest of Antigua, British
Gov. Anthony Abbott warned citizens in a radio address to prepare
for Debby. Stormy weather could cause mudslides of volcanic debris
down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned.
</P>
<P>
   In Antigua, electricity went out and motorists lined up for gas.
People living in roofless homes since last year's hurricane headed
for shelters.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, in the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis,
Debby threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music
festival that began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Hurricane Alberto, the longest-lived August tropical
storm on record, was moving in a circle in the north Atlantic.
Alberto formed Aug. 4 and hasn't threatened land.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Agency Hiring Nonsmokers  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)-- Wanted: Nonsmokers only.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's minister of health issued orders this week that his
ministry will only hire and promote nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you be hired in a place to cure people and you are
harming them? This is a basic job description. It is no violation
of personal freedom'', Sami Ghanem, director of the Health
Ministry's anti-smoking program, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The step is part of a campaign against smoking that is an uphill
battle in a country where smoking is common.
</P>
<P>
   Ghanem, who himself gave up smoking only four years ago, said
that a survey prepared by the ministry reports that 40 percent of
adult male Egyptians and 8 percent of adult female Egyptians smoke.
A 1995 World Health Organization report said the number of smokers
in Egypt increased by 274 percent between 1963 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   WHO estimates that smoking kills more than 4 million people
around the world every year, a figure that could rise to 10 million
per year by 2030 because of increasing tobacco use in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government's campaign to reduce smoking started in
1977 when cigarette advertisement was banned from television.
Later, smoking was banned on public buses.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry is working closely with other ministries to
''stimulate people's thinking about the dangers of smoking, ''
Ghanem says.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Education forbade smoking in schools only last
year. The Ministry of Transport announced this week that smoking in
airports would be restricted to smoking areas only.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, cigarette sales in Egypt are monopolized
by the government-controlled Eastern Tobacco company, an important
revenue-producer that is one of the largest cigarette manufacturers
in the Middle East.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Most analysts are convinced that the Federal
Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged when it meets today,
but Wall Street is awaiting the official word.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Defense Demands CIA Files  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Defense lawyers demanded full
access to a batch of classified CIA cables as the trial of two
Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 resumed Tuesday
following a three-week summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   But Scotland's chief prosecutor insisted that information
censored from the cables was not relevant to the 1988 bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people, including 189
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States considers all of this material highly
confidential,'' said Lord Advocate Colin Boyd. He added that
Scottish prosecutors were shown the full text last June ''in
conditions where copies could not be made and would not be
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said the deleted text referred to CIA agents' real and code
names, as well as locations and methods of intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 cables, dated Aug. 10, 1988, to Aug. 31, 1989, were sent
to Washington by CIA agents who interviewed a Libyan spy who has
since defected to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, identified as Abdul Majid Giaka, walked into the
U.S. Embassy in Malta in August 1988 -- four months before the
Lockerbie bombing -- and offered his services to the CIA, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The defector is expected to take the stand this week as a key
witness. He lives in the United States under the federal witness
protection program and has asked to be hidden from the court by
screens and electronic voice distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Taylor, a Scottish attorney for Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, showed the court copies of the documents as provided to
the defense. Large segments were blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vital to the securing of a fair trial for these accused
that the defense is not disadvantaged vis-a-vis the crown when
Giaka is cross-examined,'' the attorney said. ''I emphatically do
not accept that what lies behind that blanked out sections is of no
interest to a cross-examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giaka reportedly saw one of the defendants place the suitcase
containing the bomb on an airport conveyor belt in Malta, where all
three worked for Libyan Arab Airlines allegedly as cover for their
espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants sent the suitcase
bomb onto a flight from the Mediterranean island to Frankfurt,
Germany, where it was transferred as unaccompanied luggage onto a
feeder flight connecting with Flight 103 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka is considered the closest the prosecutors have to a
witness who can directly link the defendants to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   After the court recessed on July 27, Scottish legal experts said
the case had been meticulously assembled from reams of forensic
evidence compiled during an 11-year international investigation and
did not hinge on one or two eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expect to wrap up their evidence in September,
handing the floor to the defense lawyers, whose case is expected to
last several months.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began May 3 at a special Scottish courthouse on this
former U.S. air base in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi and co-defendant Lamen Khalifa Fhimah face up to life
in a Scottish prison if convicted on charges of murder, conspiracy
to murder and contravention of the British Aviation Security Act in
the downing of Flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988.

<HEADLINE> AWOL Army Officer Returning to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. Army reserve officer with access to
intelligence information boarded a flight back home Tuesday, two
weeks after he alarmed the American military by going AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse turned up Monday at a youth hostel in
the desert town of Mitzpe Ramon. Mattysse has denied allegations by
an Israeli woman who claimed to be his girlfriend that he disclosed
sensitive documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a spy,'' Mattysse told reporters after leaving a
police station in central Israel late Monday. ''There's been many
things said about me which aren't true. I didn't give any
classified information to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said that Mattysse, who earlier this month
requested to emigrate to Israel, was not at any time in detention
and left the country voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said Mattysse boarded a
plane to the United States on Tuesday. ''After speaking by phone
with senior officers at his base in Texas, ... Mattysse decided to
return to the United States,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk,
urged Mattysse to return home, saying he would be treated very
fairly. ''I think that would be the best way to put an end to an
affair that really doesn't deserve this kind of publicity,'' Indyk
told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio, Texas, as a full-time
reserve officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists
in intelligence work. Mattysse failed to report to duty on Aug. 8
after a vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group in San
Antonio earlier this year after an investigation began into his
wife's allegations that he had an extramarital affair.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Jolts Turkey Capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook central Turkey
on Tuesday, rattling buildings in the capital. There were no
immediate reports of injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3, struck at 2:40
p.m., Istanbul's Kandilli observatory reported.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor was centered near the town of Beypazari, some 40
miles northwest of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The quake occurred five days after the first anniversary of an
earthquake that killed 17,000 in northwestern Turkey. A separate
quake killed about 1,000 people in the region last November.
</P>
<P>
   Much of northern Turkey sits on the active Anatolian fault line.

<HEADLINE> Seeger Reunited With Missing Banjo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSENDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Pete Seeger can strum again: His
55-year-old banjo, which disappeared earlier this month, has been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schneeweiss Jr. was driving home from visiting his father
when he noticed the green banjo case beside the road on Aug. 8, the
same day it was reported missing, according to Rosendale police.
</P>
<P>
   On the case was Seeger's name and a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a call yesterday from this young man who found it,''
said Toshi Seeger, Seeger's wife, said Monday. She said he had
tried to call them earlier but ''the lines had been out of service
for the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneeweiss, 31, returned the banjo to the Seegers on Monday
afternoon when he met the couple at a bookstore in Poughkeepsie.
The Seegers gave the self-employed painter a $500 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Schneeweiss, who did not know the folk-legend status of the
banjo owner, said he didn't expect a reward and just wanted to
return the instrument to ''whoever Pete was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Pete Seeger's name on the case, but it was just another
name to me,'' he said. ''It's all a shock to me. I still don't
really know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-neck banjo was made by Seeger in 1945 and can be heard
on such recordings as ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeger, a longtime activist, had said the instrument was
believed stolen from his car during a trip to a political rally in
Rosendale. But his wife said it was possible her husband left the
banjo on top of his car and drove off, sending the instrument
tumbling to the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   The missing banjo had generated international intrigue and even
a hoax appearance on an Internet auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has been calling us saying that they've seen the
banjo all over the place,'' Rosendale Police Chief Jim Rowe said.
''The only thing that irritates us is that it was found the day it
was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeger, 81, started his career 62 years ago. In 1940, he formed
the Almanac singers, which another folk icon, Woody Guthrie, joined
a year later. He reached commercial success in the 1950s with the
group the Weavers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone,'' Seeger wrote or
co-wrote ''If I Had a Hammer,'' ''Turn, Turn, Turn,'' and ''Kisses
Sweeter Than Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   He was credited with popularizing ''We Shall Overcome,'' which
he printed in his publication ''People's Song,'' in 1948. He later
said his only contribution to the anthem of the civil rights
movement was changing the second word from ''will'' to ''shall,''
which he said ''opens up the mouth better.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Senior Rebel Capture  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian officials claimed Tuesday to have
captured a senior rebel commander who led the defense of the
Chechen capital before it fell to federal troops in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said it had arrested Lechi
Islamov, a prominent rebel leader accused of murder, kidnapping and
extortion. A criminal case has been opened against him, the service
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Islamov was a senior Chechen commander who played a major role
in the battle for Grozny, which rebels abandoned in February after
weeks of massive air and artillery attacks by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman said Islamov was being held in a detention
facility but didn't say where. The spokesman also would not say
when or where Islamov was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew in defeat from the breakaway republic of
Chechnya, in the Caucasus Mountains, at the end of a 1994-96 war.
They moved back in last September in a bid to end the predominantly
Muslim republic's de facto independence and quash what the Kremlin
called a breeding ground for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have said in recent weeks that they would focus on
capturing rebel leaders rather than skirmishing with rebel troops.
In March, Russia seized prominent warlord Salman Raduyev, but there
have been no reports of other major arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, an official with the pro-Russian Chechen
government said Russian Interior Ministry troops were ambushed by
rebels overnight, and that there were casualties on both sides. It
was impossible to get detailed casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Russian
jets and helicopters continued their daily raids in Chechnya's
southern mountains. Russian forces have bombed the south for months
but have yet to drive rebels out of the mountainous passes that
dominate it.

<HEADLINE> Russians Mourn 118 Dead Sailors  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Stunned Russians on Tuesday mourned the 118
sailors who died on a submarine as distraught relatives demanded to
be taken to the spot in the Barents Sea where the bodies remained
trapped in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, criticized for his administration's
often bumbling handling of the crisis, flew Tuesday to the navy's
main base in northern Russia and was to visit families of the crew
quartered nearby, a navy spokesman said. Russian news reports said
that he might go on a warship to the area where the Kursk sank on
Aug. 12 to honor its sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers on Monday gave first word that the crew was
dead. On Tuesday, Norwegian officials said there was no sign of a
collision between the Kursk and another vessel, which Russia has
given as a possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   Prayers were offered at Russian churches for the dead and money
poured into a special fund set up for the survivors as plans were
announced for a national day of mourning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations repeatedly displayed the names of the dead
crewmen and showed old footage of the Kursk sailing out of port,
its crew at attention on the deck. Film was accompanied by
classical music and mournful folk ballads.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media Tuesday voiced the outrage of many people that
their government left it to Norway to announce that all of the
sailors aboard the Kursk were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one from the leadership of the country had the bravery to
announce the death of the sailors,'' the Nezavisimaya Gazeta said
in a banner headline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for questions,'' the daily Izvestia wrote in a lead
editorial. ''What if? What if they hadn't lied to us? What if
they'd invited foreigners without waiting for five days? What if
we'd had the proper technology? It's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said a day of national mourning would be held Wednesday to
honor the crew, and flags would be lowered to half mast. He asked
all television and radio stations to cancel entertainment programs
Wednesday out of respect for the dead crew. He promised the
government would help the families.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed, mourning relatives who gathered in the northern port of
Murmansk demanded the navy take them to where the Kursk lay in
350-foot deep water. The navy was considering taking the relatives
on a hospital ship that was standing by in Murmansk, according to
Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were considering how to recover the bodies of
the crew, including using divers. It would be difficult to maneuver
the decaying bodies through the submarine's narrow internal hatches
and out of the small escape hatch at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Norway was considering a request from Moscow for assistance in
recovering the bodies. The Norwegian rescue team that played a
crucial role in trying to save the crew headed home Tuesday, said
Norwegian Capt. Erlend Raanes.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the Kursk were abandoned Monday after Norwegian
divers said the crew were all dead. The Norwegian announcement was
read on all Russian TV stations, but it took the Russian navy many
hours to officially confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive government and military officials asked for
forgiveness, insisting everything possible had been done to rescue
the Kursk, which sank after a massive explosion wrecked the vessel.
But the government initially refused to accept foreign help and
Putin was criticized for not interrupting his summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Northern Fleet, Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, in a
highly unusual public display of contrition, also apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forgive me for not saving your sailors,'' Popov said Monday
night, removing his military hat before the camera. Looking
directly into the camera, he was wide-eyed and teary.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, giving a long interview to ORT
television, was at times defensive and apologetic. Sergeyev
acknowledged the government may have made some mistakes but had
done all it could.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all mourning together with the relatives and loved
ones,'' he said Monday night, then paused and sighed deeply. ''We
will never forget what the sailors did, that they did all that was
possible and impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were considering ways to raise the Kursk.
There is concern about the two nuclear reactors on the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   But the flooded submarine weighs about 25,000 tons, and any
operation to move it could take weeks, if not months. Russian
officials said they would make an international appeal for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said the most likely cause of the accident was an
initial collision between the Kursk and another ''underwater
object'' comparable in size. He hinted that the object could have
been a submarine and said the object was supposedly detected by
Russian ships, but no evidence has been produced to back the claim.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have denied any of their ships
were involved.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Senator Home After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jim Bunning is back home in Kentucky
after undergoing surgery to remove his gallbladder and a benign
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning was released Monday from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., where surgery was performed Aug. 15, his office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator ''is continuing to recuperate at his home
in Southgate. He is extremely grateful to everyone who has sent
their well wishes,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia, Bunning, 68, underwent a medical evaluation that
found he had an inflamed gallbladder and a benign mass on his left
adrenal gland.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning spokesman John Mechem said the senator expects to resume
his duties in Washington when Congress returns on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning had a 12-year House career before entering the Senate in
1998, but he is probably best known for his 17-year baseball
career. As a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and the Philadelphia
Phillies, Bunning recorded two no-hitters and 200-plus victories
and earned him a spot in the Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 84; Nasdaq Adds 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Tuesday morning as investors
remained confident that Federal Reserve officials meeting in
Washington will leave interest rates unchanged again.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 84.42 at 11,162.23.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also posting modest gains. The
Nasdaq composite index was up 32.72 at 3,985.87, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 3.35 at 1,502.83, and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was up 1.48 at 517.93.
</P>
<P>
   Big movers among the Dow industrials included Honeywell, up
$2.063 at $38.75, and J.P. Morgan, up $3.563 at $148.50. Both
companies would benefit if Fed officials are finished with fighting
inflation by slowing the economy with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a stream of data suggesting the Fed has succeeded in
containing inflation with a 14-month program of rate hikes,
analysts believe the central bank won't try to slow the economy
again on Tuesday or any time soon. Fed officials also left rates
unchanged at their meeting last month after boosting them six times
since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq gainers held a more
substantial lead.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light again as investors awaited the results of
Tuesday's Fed meeting. Volume on the NYSE totaled 246.05 million
shares, up from 223.26 million at the same point on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.58 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.57 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.59 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Leader Cancels Trip  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- President Pierre Buyoya canceled a
trip to South Africa and a meeting with mediator Nelson Mandela on
Tuesday, and instead focused on calming Tutsi opposition to a peace
agreement aimed at ending the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in the tiny central African country have increased
dramatically in recent weeks as a deadline neared for signing the
power-sharing agreement, set by Mandela for Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The former South African president has been mediating peace
talks since December and has invited President Clinton and other
world leaders to witness the signing of the accord in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires the minority Tutsis to relinquish power
in the government and army, and set up ethnically balanced
institutions in an effort to end the civil war that broke out in
October 1993. The war has left more than 200,000 people -- most of
them civilians -- dead.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said Tuesday that one soldier was wounded when
Hutu rebels opened fire on an army truck on a road east of
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Samuel Gahiro, commander of the First Military District in
Bujumbura, said the attack was repulsed, but did not give rebel
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya warned Tutsi hard-liners Monday, who have demonstrated
against the peace accord with Hutus, not to attempt a coup against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Appolinaire Gahungu, the presidential spokesman, said Buyoya
would not travel outside Burundi until at least the weekend. He
said Buyoya would chair a cabinet meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, a retired Tutsi major who seized power in a 1996 coup,
is under increasing pressure from middle-class Tutsis and the
Tutsi-dominated army, his main constituencies, not to sign the
accord which they say favors the majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nzeyimana, leader of a Tutsi political party, said his
and nine other Tutsi political parties had written to Mandela,
Clinton and other leaders in an attempt to renegotiate virtually
all issues in the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not sign the agreement in its present form,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war started when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated
Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected president and a
Hutu.

<HEADLINE> Mint: Employee Stole, Sold Coins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A former employee of the U.S. Mint stole and
sold coins that had been stamped incorrectly, raking in about
$80,000 from collectors, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   David J. D'Angelo, a coin press operator at the Philadelphia
Mint, did not purposefully make any of the defective coins that he
stole from December 1998 until last March, said First Assistant
U.S. Attorney Michael Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and dealers have noticed some spectacular error coins
coming out of the Philadelphia Mint in recent years, including four
new Sacagawea dollar coins on which one face was struck as a
Washington quarter instead of the American Indian guide and
translator. Auctions of those coins have brought up to $41,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo did not have any of the rare Sacagawea coins, Levy said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo, 45, of suburban Broomall, agreed to plead guilty at a
later date, his attorney, Nicholas Guarente, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Guarente said D'Angelo cooperated with investigators, including
disclosing a hiding place inside the downtown Mint where federal
agents found a large cache of coins.
</P>
<P>
   Mint spokesman Michael White would not comment about the
criminal case or about security in general.
</P>
<P>
   Irregular coins and stamps are supposed to be destroyed. In
1996, federal prosecutors charged a worker at a contract printing
plant in New York with stealing Richard Nixon commemorative stamps
made for the Postal Service that had an upside-down name. About 140
of the misprinted 32-cent stamps sold for $800,000 at auction.

<HEADLINE> Quake Jolts Turkish Capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook central Turkey
on Tuesday, damaging some 50 buildings in a small town outside the
capital of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, but several people were taken to
hospital suffering from shock or after fainting, the Anatolia news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3, struck at 2:40
p.m., according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory.
</P>
<P>
   It was centered near the town of Beypazari, some 40 miles
northwest of Ankara and was felt in the capital. Turkey's Red
Crescent sent 50 tents and 100 blankets as shelter for the
inhabitants of the damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor caused cracks in some 50 buildings, including
schools, Anatolia quoted local officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The quake occurred five days after the first anniversary of an
earthquake that killed 17,000 in northwestern Turkey. A separate
quake in November killed about 1,000 people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Much of northern Turkey sits on the active Anatolian fault line.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Palace Located in Bulgaria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Archaeologists in southern Bulgaria have
located remains of what they believe are a palace in the latest of
a series of major Bronze Age finds, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of an ancient three-story building dating from the fourth
or fifth century B.C. were unearthed under a medieval fortress near
the village of Perperek, some 200 miles southeast of Sofia, Valeria
Fol, head of the expedition told the state BTA news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said that the palace could have belonged to a
leader of Thrace, a Balkan civilization that flourished in the
Bronze Age.
</P>
<P>
   A staircase carved out of rock and leading up three floors with
intact internal corridors and at least 20 well preserved rooms were
uncovered in the initial stage of excavations near Perperek, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar find Saturday near Starosel, 100 miles east of
Sofia, archeologists discovered the tomb of what appears to have
been a Thracian ruler. The tomb is the second largest Thracian
remains found in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Articles in the tomb, including a gold tiara and a 1-ounce gold
ring depicting a Thracian horseman piercing a wild boar, were dated
to the fifth century, B.C., and suggest it was a royal burial site,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items found include four silver and eight bronze vessels,
ancient Greek ceramics, a bronze shield, a helmet, swords and
arrows with bronze tips.

<HEADLINE> Only Nonsmoking Hires in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)-- Wanted: Nonsmokers only.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's minister of health issued orders this week that his
ministry will only hire and promote nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you be hired in a place to cure people and you are
harming them? This is a basic job description. It is no violation
of personal freedom,'' Sami Ghanem, director of the Health
Ministry's anti-smoking program, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The step is part of an anti-smoking campaign that is an uphill
battle in a country where smokers are so common.
</P>
<P>
   A survey prepared by the ministry reports that 40 percent of
adult male Egyptians and 8 percent of adult female Egyptians smoke,
said Ghanem, who gave up smoking four years ago. A 1995 World
Health Organization report said the number of smokers in Egypt
increased 274 percent between 1963 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   WHO estimates that smoking kills more than 4 million people
around the world every year, a figure that could rise to 10 million
per year by 2030 because of increasing tobacco use in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government's campaign to reduce smoking started
when cigarette advertising was banned from television in 1977.
Smoking was later banned on public buses.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry is working closely with other ministries to
''stimulate people's thinking about the dangers of smoking,''
Ghanem said.
</P>
<P>
   ''During Fridays prayers, sheiks are urged to preach about the
dangers of smoking,'' Ghanem said. Egypt's grand mufti, the highest
Muslim authority, ruled last month that smoking can be legitimate
grounds for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, cigarette sales in Egypt are monopolized by the
government-controlled Eastern Tobacco company, an important
moneymaker that is one of the largest cigarette manufacturers in
the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea, Japan Argue Over Past  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan and North Korea quarreled over long-standing
grievances Tuesday in talks on normalizing relations, a sign that
the Stalinist North's recent diplomatic offensive has not soothed
all tensions with its former colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In what had been expected to be a courtesy call on Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono, top North Korean envoy Jong Thae Hwa blamed
the lack of official ties on Japan's refusal to make amends for its
1910-1945 rule over Korea, said a Japanese foreign ministry
official who was at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kono demanded information on Japanese citizens allegedly
abducted by North Korea to serve as language teachers for spies,
the official said in a briefing given on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kono championed the cause of relatives of the missing, who
gathered outside the conference hall at the Foreign Ministry and
shouted ''Give them back!'' as limousines carrying the North Korean
delegation passed the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''When one thinks of these people ... they have had such a
difficult experience. I would like North Korea to aggressively
investigate,'' Kono told Jong, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Tokyo, scheduled to last until Thursday, are the
second round of negotiations begun in Pyongyang four months ago.
The first meeting restarted discussions after an eight-year
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kono-Jong meeting, the two countries' negotiating
teams met for about an hour, each presenting its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were more hopeful because of the recent
thaw between North and South Korea, whose leaders met in June and
agreed to work toward reunification, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's chief negotiator, Kojiro Takano, said a similar detente
between Tokyo and Pyongyang would make North Asia a safer region.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to contribute to Northeast Asian stability and peace,
I want to work hard toward correcting the irregular relations that
have existed... since the end of World War II,'' Takano told Jong,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's talks also evoked the sparring by Japanese and
North Korean negotiators at the April talks in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry official said in the briefing that his
impression was that the two sides have not budged on the main
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Takano suggested that the kidnappings would have to be addressed
in any agreement in order to win the backing of the Japanese public
and Parliament, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed during talks with the Red Cross in December
to investigate allegations by the Japanese government that its
agents abducted at least 10 Japanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Jong told Takano that the North remains immovable on its
principal demands -- compensation and apology for colonization, a
return of cultural treasures allegedly carted off by Japanese
soldiers, and improvements in the legal status of Koreans living in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But he hinted that he still hoped for an agreement by the agreed
target of the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we leave problems of the 20th century to be solved in the
21st, we will have failed in our historical responsibility,'' Jong
told Takano, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Russians Suspicious of US in Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia's initial suspicion of a sinister
American role in the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk is
rooted in distrust of U.S. motives -- distrust so firmly held that
Russian officials still press for answers in the sinking of a
Soviet sub in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials long have suspected that the Soviet sub K-129
was struck by an American submarine, the USS Swordfish. But the
U.S. Navy says the Soviet vessel, armed with nuclear missiles and
with a crew of 98, suffered a catastrophic internal explosion when
it sank in the central Pacific on March 11, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last fall, Russian government officials
complained that Washington was covering up its involvement. One
accused the Americans of acting like a ''criminal that had been
caught and now claimed that guilt must be proved,'' according to
the notes of a U.S. participant in a November 1999 meeting on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The case is so sensitive that at least two CIA directors --
Robert Gates and James Woolsey -- met with Boris Yeltsin while he
was the Russian president to review what the American spy agency
knew about the sub loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea on Aug.
12 during a Russian naval exercise, the Pentagon insists that no
American ships were involved, although U.S. officials have
acknowledged that two U.S. submarines were close enough to record
the sound of enormous explosions aboard the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   While presenting no hard evidence, the Russian military command
has insisted from the start that the most likely reason for the
loss of the Kursk and its 118-man crew was a collision with an
American or British submarine that survived and escaped. Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev went on television to air the theory, and
Russian officers claimed fragments of a foreign submarine were
found near the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military still sees the West as the Cold War enemy,'' said
Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst with the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the lingering suspicions, Defense Secretary William Cohen
felt compelled Monday to say ''there were no American ships
involved'' in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Pentagon and the CIA have told the Russians
repeatedly regarding the 1968 submarine sinking in the Pacific, but
Moscow continues to insist that Washington is hiding its
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POWs and missing
servicemen met last November, a senior Russian representative said
more than 90 families of the lost crew of the sunken sub -- known in
Russia as the K-129 but classified by NATO as a Golf II -- are
waiting for information on their loved ones' remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians believe not only that a U.S. submarine -- the USS
Swordfish, based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii -- collided with the K-129,
causing it to sink, but also that secret U.S. salvage operations in
1968 and 1974 removed remains of crew members and highly sensitive
equipment that went down with the sub -- possibly including nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russian suspicions about the Swordfish are based on records
indicating it underwent nighttime repair of a bent periscope at
Yokosuka, Japan, on March 17 -- six days after the K-129 sank. The
U.S. explanation is that the Swordfish collided with an ice pack
and was 2,000 miles away from the Russian sub when it sank.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has requested the Swordfish's deck logs, to trace its
movements, but the Pentagon has refused. The Swordfish apparently
had a hand in some highly sensitive operations before and after the
K-129 incident. Navy records show that in 1965 it was awarded a
Navy Unit Commendation for ''special operations'' conducted in the
western Pacific in the fall of 1963 and 1964 and the spring and
summer of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The United States denies any involvement in the K-129 sinking,
although it has acknowledged that it salvaged some parts of the
sunken sub. U.S. officials provided the Russian government with a
videotape of a burial-at-sea ceremony for six crew members whose
remains were recovered when the CIA-financed Glomar Explorer
salvage ship recovered parts of the submarine in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Kass, the executive director of the U.S. side of the
joint commission, said Tuesday that all recovered personal effects
of the Russian crew have already been provided, and nothing more
can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at an impasse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> CEOs: Welfare Improvements Needed  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare rolls are half what they were four
years ago, and the percentage of Americans on welfare is at its
lowest level in 35 years, President Clinton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In four short years, we have seen a new emphasis on work and
responsibility, as welfare recipients themselves have risen to the
challenge and made welfare what it was meant to be -- a second
chance, not a way of life,'' Clinton said in a statement issued at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on the fourth anniversary of the welfare
changes being signed into law, the Clinton administration said all
states have met the law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans on welfare has fallen from 5.5
percent when Clinton took office in 1993 to 2.3 percent in 1999,
and is now at its lowest level since 1965, the White House said.
Welfare rolls have shrunk from 14.1 million households in January
1993 to 6.3 million in December 1999 -- a drop of 56 percent or 7.8
million households.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fourths of the overall decline occurred since the
new welfare law was enacted, with 1999 caseloads roughly half what
they were in 1996, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met at the White House Tuesday with top corporate
executives who issued their own progress report on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's welfare system was dramatically improved by the
overhaul, but poor people entering the work force need help with
child care, transportation and training, the business executives
said. Their report added that former welfare recipients have made
''good, productive employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Job retention rates for those workers meet and often exceed
those for employees who haven't been on welfare, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives say government programs are still needed to
help welfare recipients get jobs, citing child care and
transportation as the ''biggest obstacles to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawmakers should sustain or, ideally, increase resources for a
range of programs that help former welfare recipients stay on the
job,'' the report says. ''Partnership companies call for increased
emphasis on child care and transportation aid, as they are
consistently the two biggest challenges facing new workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends Congress increase tax credits and
child-care grants to cover more working parents and subsidize
transportation and housing costs so welfare recipients can get to
work more easily or move closer to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law encouraged recipients to enter the work
force by placing a time limit on benefits, allowing more recipients
to work while still receiving benefits and offering incentives to
employers to hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate executives who signed the report include chiefs of
United Airlines, Sprint, Citigroup, Time Warner, Bank of America,
Burger King, Monsanto, United Parcel Service and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The Welfare to Work Partnership, as the group is known, says
over 20,000 American employers have pledged to hire at least one
person from welfare rolls, employing about 1.1 million former
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Employers report that the average starting wage of those hired
from welfare rolls is $7.80 per hour, significantly higher than the
minimum wage of $5.15, and more than 74 percent receive medical
benefits. More than 44 percent of hires, the report says, get a
401(k) matching savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   The report is critical of the way some states have used federal
welfare funds. While some states have spent the money responsibly
and creatively, others have used the funds to offset state spending
instead of directly supporting welfare recipients and low-wage
workers, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends loosening the federal requirement
that welfare recipients find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of work activities should include substance-abuse
treatment, domestic violence counseling and other special needs,
and Congress also should give a break to workers who need longer
than five years to get off welfare because of low starting pay, the
report says.

<HEADLINE> Russia OKs Balanced Draft Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The government on Tuesday approved a balanced
budget plan for 2001 after years of chaotic post-Soviet fiscal
policy and two years after a financial crisis rocked Russia's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, which must be approved by parliament, forecast
economic growth of about 4 percent in the year ahead, according to
a government statement.
</P>
<P>
   The budget approval followed some upbeat economic news Monday.
The State Statistics Committee reported gross domestic product
growth at 7.5 percent in the first six months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment was also down and Russia's exporters were enjoying
high trade surpluses, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-adjusted incomes for Russians rose by about 8 percent
in the first six months of 2000 compared to 1999, the Statistics
Committee reported.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most Russians live on incomes under $100 per month. But
the increase can be significant for extremely low-income Russian
families, putting warm clothes and more nutritious food within
reach.
</P>
<P>
   The draft budget predicts inflation of 12 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   However, this appeared to be an optimistic figure, with
inflation this July alone rising 1.8 percent from the previous
month and most economists predicting inflation will pick up this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The zero-deficit budget sets spending and revenues at about $39
billion, substantially higher than this year's revenue figure of
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The higher revenues will be used to pay off foreign debt,
increase military spending and help the education and health care
systems, according to the government statement.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of decline, Russia's economy has been improving
this year largely thanks to high world prices for oil and other key
Russian exports. That has helped the country rebound from a
financial meltdown in 1998, when the government defaulted on debt
and devalued the ruble.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Tuesday as the Federal Reserve did
what Wall Street expected and left interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 83.52 at 11,165.63.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also posting modest gains. The
Nasdaq composite index was up 38.85 at 3,992.00, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 5.66 at 1,505.14.
</P>
<P>
   Big movers among the Dow industrials included Honeywell, up
$1.813 at $38.813, and J.P. Morgan, up $3.688 at $148.625. Both
companies would benefit if Fed officials are finished boosting
rates to fight inflation by slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed likely decided to leave rates alone as a stream of
economic data in recent weeks suggested the central bank has
succeeded in slowing the economy and keeping the lid on inflation.
The Fed had raised rates six times since June 1999, before leaving
them unchanged at its last policymaking meeting in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed on Tuesday said it was maintaining its close watch on
inflation, however.
</P>

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Azerbaijan President Dies  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Abulfaz Elchibey, a former dissident who
became the first elected president of Azerbaijan following the 1991
breakup of the Soviet Union, died Tuesday. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey, who was suffering from prostate cancer and a lung
infection, died in Gulhane Military hospital in Ankara, Turkey. He
was rushed unconscious to Turkey in July for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was elected president of the oil-rich Caucasus republic
in 1992 and set his country on a track of closer ties with Turkey,
a strong Western ally, irritating hard-liners in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But he was ousted from power after only a year by soldiers
enraged at their country's humiliating battlefield loses to
Armenians. Those defeats turned 1 million Azeris into refugees in
their own country, which borders Iran, Armenia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian fighters drove Azeri forces from the disputed enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian area within Azerbaijan, and
seized nearby areas of Azerbaijan proper. The fighting left 15,000
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Angry officers blamed Elchibey for the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Some 45,000 soldiers loyal to Surat Huseynov, a former army
colonel who was demoted by Elchibey, marched on the capital, Baku,
in 1993 and vowed to continue until Elchibey stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was replaced by Geidar Aliev, the former communist
leader of Azerbaijan, who remains president. Elchibey returned home
to Nakhichevan, an enclave cut off from Azerbaijan by Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt great sorrow over Elchibey's death,'' Aliev said in a
televised message that was aired by Turkey's private NTV
television.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was born in Nakhichevan and taught Asian and African
history at Baku State University in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he formed an underground group to work for the
independence of Azerbaijan, which was soon forced to disband.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1975, Elchibey was tried on charges of anti-Soviet
activities and sentenced to 1&AMP;frac12; years in a labor camp in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   When he became president, Elchibey worked to eject all Russian
soldiers from the republic and tried to curb Iranian influence in
his country.
</P>
<P>
   Elchibey was close to Turkish nationalists who call for the
union of Turkic countries. Azerbaijan and Turkey share close ethnic
ties and the Azeri language is easily understood by Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a lover of the Turkic world,'' Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said. ''He was a valuable politician raised by
Azerbaijan.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish politicians gathered at Ankara's airport for a moment of
silence and a brief military ceremony before Elchibey's body was
flown back to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   ''His body will be taken for a state funeral like a former
president deserves,'' said Azerbaijan's ambassador in Turkey, Memed
Aliev. ''Elchibey was a very honorable man.''

<HEADLINE> National Zoo Elephant Euthanized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Zoo's only African elephant was
euthanized Tuesday after veterinarians determined she was too sick
to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, 46, had numerous health problems including a bone
infection and fluid buildup in her abdomen. Last week, Nancy began
refusing to take her oral medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy arrived at the National Zoo from East Africa in 1956. In
her prime she weighed 10,000 pounds, making her the zoo's largest
animal.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had a wonderful long life at the National Zoo and she was
a favorite among zoo visitors,'' zoo director Lucy Spelman said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo closed the Elephant House Tuesday, though officials
expected it to reopen Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A necropsy was being performed. Officials then planned to
cremate the remains, though they said they would keep the tusks at
the zoo.

<HEADLINE> Louisville Slugger maker claims stolen contracts were sold to collector </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Decades ago, great hitters like Rogers
Hornsby, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Hank Aaron
and Mickey Mantle had barely made their marks on baseball when they
signed contracts to have their bats made by Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky company, which makes Louisville Slugger bats, said
it was told years ago that those contracts and those of about 70
other major-leaguers were destroyed during a move.
</P>
<P>
   They learned otherwise when some of the contracts were listed,
for thousands of dollars, among the items in last year's auction
catalogue for The Barry Halper Collection of Baseball Memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction led Halper to withdraw the contracts. H&AMP;B
wants them back, claiming that the contracts were stolen by a
former employee and sold twice before being bought by Halper, a New
Jersey businessman and minority owner of the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The company sued Halper Aug. 8 in U.S. District Court here for
return of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Halper lawyer Joseph S. Pecora said Tuesday he has not yet seen
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a question as to whether these contract were stolen,
discarded or misplaced, and that will be decided by the courts,''
Pecora said. ''Barry Halper got these from a dealer in New York 20
years ago. And all of a sudden H&AMP;B has come up with some idea that
they were stolen from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that Halper bought them from Josh Evans, a
memorabilia collector in New York, although they differ on the
timing.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;B's lawsuit claims Evans sold them to Halper shortly after
acquiring them in November 1992 from Steve Curry, a collector in
Louisville, Ky., where the company is based.
</P>
<P>
   Curry bought them from Paul Galens, the lawsuit said,
identifying Galens as an H&AMP;B employee who stole about 76 player
contracts from a locked storage room between 1985 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Among the notables: Yogi Berra, Roberto Clemente, Hank
Greenberg, Harmon Killebrew, Stan Musial, Pee Wee Reese, Pete Rose
and Casey Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   When managers learned the contracts were missing, they were told
the contracts had been accidentally destroyed during a move,
information that originated with Galens, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Louisville home, Galens declined to comment on
the allegations. He said he worked at the company from 1961-91.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their (H&AMP;B's) lawyers came to see me. I've already talked to
them and I'm not going to say anything to anybody else,'' Galens
said.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;B vice president Bill Williams declined to say how the company
determined Galens took the contracts or how it traced the chain of
custody.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts allowed the company to use a player's name and
likeness in advertising. In return, the company made a bat to the
player's specifications, with the player's autograph branded on the
wood, said Williams, who is also executive director of The
Louisville Slugger Museum.
</P>
<P>
   For last year's Halper auction, Sotheby's listed the Mantle H&AMP;B
contract as worth $2,000 to $3,000. Mantle got $50 for signing in
1950, just before he turned 19. It ''features a fine example of
Mantle's early signature,'' the auction house catalogue said.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are separate from ''bat record cards'', which have
a record of every bat that was purchased for a player, including
the model, length and finish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Live and online sales from the Halper auction in September
totaled nearly $25.2 million, according to the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest prices was the $239,000 paid by
actor-comedian Billy Crystal for one of Mantle's gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Halper, of Livingston, spent a half-century accumulating the
items that were sold.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock film festival to showcase independent film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - From short films to full-length features, more
than 60 movies will be showcased at the Woodstock Film Festival
next month, organizers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movies in the first-time festival, to be held Sept.
21-24 in the art community of Woodstock, N.Y., focus on music.
There's ''A Voice from Heaven,'' a documentary on Pakistani singer
Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan making its New York debut, and a dance
party to screen the 1984 Jonathan Demme music documentary, ''Stop
Making Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for the festival was to be announced at a Tuesday
night news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other films cover a range of subjects, from ''That Creepy Old
Doll,'' a four-minute animated movie where a little girl celebrates
her birthday by scaring herself, to ''Black Milk,'' a feature where
the main character, a young writer, can transport himself in space
and time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Woodstock seemed to be the absolutely natural spot for an
independent film festival to take place,'' said director and
producer Meira Blaustein, who is orchestrating the festival with
her husband, film editor Laurent Rejto.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing like that here,'' she said. ''On the other
hand, there are so many filmmakers and filmlovers that live right
in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival will also include concerts and workshops. Workshops
will include adapting books to film and examining the impact of
digital production. Speakers include actor Aidan Quinn, author
Warren Adler and ''Philadelphia'' screenwriter Ron Nyswaner.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker Les Blank will be given a special Maverick
Award at the festival to honor his body of work, which has focused
on musicians and communities all over the United States. Other
Maverick Awards will be given in five categories: feature,
documentary, short, short documentary, and student film.

<HEADLINE> Study: Rabies Shots Often Overused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Rabies shots are often overused in treating
people bitten by animals, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   About 40,000 shots are given annually in the United States, and
the study suggests they may be unnecessary in as many as 40 percent
of the patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rabies shots are considered unnecessary if the animal is
available for observation or testing and is found to be
rabies-free.
</P>
<P>
   But emergency room doctors often have no way of knowing if the
animal will be observed and decide to order shots anyway, said Dr.
Gregory Moran of the University of California at Los Angeles, who
led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Control of rabies in domestic animals and development of a
vaccine for humans have led to a decline in human cases in the
United States from more than 100 yearly in the early 1900s to only
about one or two deaths a year. Only 32 cases of human rabies were
diagnosed between 1980 and 1996, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   But rabies has been increasing in wild animals, especially among
raccoons, raising fears about humans getting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 2,030 patients treated in 11 emergency
rooms nationwide for animal contact including bites in 1996 to
1998. Fifty-four -- 40 percent -- of the 136 patients who received
the vaccine didn't need it, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The study numbers translate into a huge number of people
nationwide who may be receiving inappropriate treatment for
rabies,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 119 patients who should have been vaccinated were
not. In most cases this occurred when people were bitten in an area
where animal rabies is prevalent and the animal was not available
for testing.
</P>
<P>
   But Moran said failure to give the vaccine appropriately has not
led to an increase in human cases.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine in humans used to be dreaded, painful shots in the
abdomen. It now consists of five shots in the arm over a one-month
period, plus an antibody called immune globulin that helps fight
infection. The medication costs about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The annual cost of rabies detection, prevention and control in
humans exceeds $3 million, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, which funded the study.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said more appropriate use of the medication ''could
ultimately save people from receiving unnecessary vaccines, save
health care costs and provide more consistency in rabies prevention
management.''

<HEADLINE> Teen charged as adult, arrested for shooting grandfather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LE ROY, N.Y. (AP) - A 15-year-old boy was charged Tuesday as an
adult for the attempted murder of his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather, who requested his name be withheld, was treated
for a gunshot wound Friday night after a bullet went through a
double-paned window of his apartment and lodged just below his
armpit. The 77-year-old man was later released, though the bullet
has not yet been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Devon N. Miller, who lived with his grandparents, was also
charged with stealing the .22-caliber rifle used in the shooting
from the garage of home where he had delivered newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Samuel Steffenilla said Miller was living with his
grandparents up until the arrest early Tuesday morning, and that
they did not suspect the teen in their care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bad enough being shot,'' he said. ''But when it's by
someone you love and are trying to help, it's just horrible -
they're devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffinella said the two had a disagreement when Miller was not
allowed to go to a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy wanted to go someplace where the grandfather thought
there would be no adult supervision,'' Steffenilla said.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Aid Alcoholics  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A drug used to fight nausea in cancer patients
can help the most difficult-to-treat alcoholics significantly
reduce their drinking, research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Success with the drug ondansetron comes amid a growing search
for new medications to help treat a disease that affects some 14
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past half-century, just two drugs have been approved to
treat alcoholism, though studies on a number of others are under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center
in San Antonio reported preliminary results with ondansetron in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ondansetron worked in patients with early-onset alcoholism, who
represent about 3.5 million of the nation's alcoholics, said Dr.
Bankole Johnson, a psychiatrist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   These alcoholics, who develop problem drinking at or before age
25, are believed to have a biological predisposition toward
alcoholism. They often respond poorly to counseling, exhibit
anti-social behavior and have a high relapse rate.
</P>
<P>
   An imbalance between two chemical messengers in the brain,
serotonin and dopamine, is believed to create a craving for alcohol
in early-onset alcoholics, Johnson said. Ondansetron's ability to
regulate the serotonin-dopamine interaction may explain why it was
effective only in such alcoholics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 271 alcoholics who were given ondansetron
twice daily or a dummy pill for 11 weeks. Weekly behavioral therapy
also was included.
</P>
<P>
   Three different doses were tested, with the middle dose proving
most effective. Alcoholics on that dose had an average of about 1&AMP;frac12;
drinks daily compared with nearly 3&AMP;frac12; drinks daily for the placebo
group. They also abstained from drinking for an average of about 70
percent of the study days, compared with 50 percent for the placebo
group.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could lead to better ways to treat alcoholism and
to tailor treatment to specific types of alcoholics, Dr. Henry
Kranzler of the University of Connecticut wrote in a JAMA
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome Inc. makes ondansetron. The National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism funded the study.

<HEADLINE> Study: Low-Fat OK for Kids' Minds  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Reducing children's fat intake to prevent heart
disease later in life can start before age 2 without harming their
brains, Finnish researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. guidelines recommend against restricting fat before age 2,
largely out of concern that fat deficiency could impair proper
development of children's rapidly growing brains.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 496 Finnish children who were followed from 7
months of age to 5 years ''goes a long way to laying that question
to rest,'' said Dr. Gilman Grave, chief of endocrinology, nutrition
and growth at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development.
</P>
<P>
   At age 5, children on a reduced-fat diet and those on a regular
diet performed similarly on tests of speech, language, motor
functioning and visual skills.
</P>
<P>
   Grave said the results could help address the nation's
''epidemic of childhood obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. nutrition experts were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies have shown that even young children can develop fatty
streaks in their heart arteries. And the Finnish researchers
hypothesized that limiting fat intake in early childhood might keep
that from happening and reduce the risk of heart disease later on.
</P>
<P>
   But the children's arteries were not examined, and they were not
followed into adulthood. As a result, the long-term effect of their
diets is unknown, said Sheah Rarback, a pediatric dietitian and
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't proven the necessity,'' Rarback said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Leena Rask-Nissila of the University of
Turku, appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association. In an earlier phase of the study, the authors reported
in 1997 that children on low-fat diets fared well nutritionally
except for vitamin D and iron, and they recommended supplements
until age 2.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters and their families were randomly assigned to two
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The parents in one group were asked to put their youngsters on a
low-fat diet, with a goal of limiting fat to no more than 30
percent to 35 percent of daily calories. By contrast, U.S.
guidelines recommend limiting fat to no more than 30 percent of
calories starting at age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Breast-feeding or formula were recommended for both groups up to
age 1.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the children in the low-fat group were advised to
hold down their youngsters' intake of saturated fat and cholesterol
and give them nonfat milk after they were weaned.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the children in the other group were advised to
give them cow's milk containing at least 1.9 percent fat starting
at age 1 but otherwise received no specific guidelines on fat
intake.
</P>
<P>
   At 13 months, average daily fat intake was 25.5 percent for the
low-fat group and 27.6 percent for the control group. It approached
30 percent by age 2 for the low-fat group and remained at about
that level for the rest of the study. For the control group it was
closer to 33 percent for years 2 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol levels in the low-fat group were 3 percent to 5
percent lower than in the control-group children throughout the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Persinger, a dietitian at Children's National Medical
Center in Washington, worried the findings could prompt overzealous
parents to impose diet restrictions that could put finicky
youngsters at risk for nutritional deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   And Rarback questioned whether the modest reductions in
cholesterol achieved by children in the low-fat group were worth
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the growth years,'' she said. ''You need to know the
long-term benefit to make those types of changes.''

<HEADLINE> New commission will oversee computer technology  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Some Connecticut schools are computer
ready but lack enough teachers who are computer savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are still waiting in line to get money that will put them
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   A new state commission that met for the first time Tuesday will
oversee education technology and decide how to dole out about $32
million to make sure all Connecticut students have access to
computers and teachers trained to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ''In bits and pieces, we have schools that are wired and we have
some teachers who are well prepared to teach the technology,'' said
Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell. ''But we're trying to take a comprehensive
approach to make sure all our schools and all our students are
cyber-ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly this year passed a law calling for the
formation of the Commission for Educational Technology. Along with
setting up the 20-member panel of education, computer and business
experts, the Legislature appropriated $32.5 million for the group
to distribute this year. The money will be handed out in grants for
computer wiring, teacher training and creating a digital library
that can be accessed through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislation is part of Rell's push to get every public
school classroom hooked up to the Internet by 2004 and make every
student computer proficient by the sixth grade. When it's over,
Rell expects the plan to cost about $105 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program isn't about dropping the wonderful world of the
Internet on the students' desk and telling them to go surf,''
Education Commissioner Theodore Sergei said. ''We need to use
technology as a tool to access information. And for many districts,
the focal point is getting teachers trained and comfortable with
the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashish Deshpande, chief technology officer of New Haven-based
Metaserver and a member of the commission, said Connecticut
businesses will benefit from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande said he meets many young people whose career goal is
''to get out of Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If technology companies are more involved with the education
system, it increases our visibility,'' he said. ''Connecticut is an
up-and-coming place for the technology industry, and we can help
get more kids exposed to it.''

<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- Last year, Eminem's mother sued him
for $10 million. Now it's his estranged wife's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem, the foul-mouthed rapper whose legal name is Marshall
Mathers III, filed for divorce last week from Kim Mathers, seeking
joint custody of their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she sued him for $10 million over his onstage antics
and for the lyrics of his song ''Kim,'' which she said ''depicts
horrific domestic violence against the wife, resulting in her
grisly murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She also claimed that he was unfit for even partial custody of
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's mother, Deborah Mathers-Briggs, has accused him of
defaming her in songs and interviews.

   COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) -- Karen Fowler, who spent six weeks living
in CBS's ''Big Brother'' house, plans to leave her own home.
</P>
<P>
   She said that on-air discussions of her troubled marriage have

<P>
   ''I'm sickened by the way people want to judge me so quickly and
defend him,'' said Fowler, 43.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers voted Fowler off the show last week, just as she had
hoped. She told The Indianapolis Star she was on the verge of a
nervous breakdown -- ready to divorce her husband, worried about her
children and constantly under stress from the cameras that watched
her every move.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Birds Key To Tracking West Nile  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. (AP) -- Dead birds are piling up at Ward Stone's
door by the van load -- a blue jay in a picnic cooler, frozen crows
packed in dry ice, sparrows, hawks and warblers.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are potentially infected with the deadly West Nile
virus, and Stone, New York state's wildlife pathologist, will pluck
some out for examination. Organs of sick-looking birds will then
receive a final diagnosis at a lab nearby, where Dr. Laura Kramer
and her staff are already inundated with hundreds of bird parts and
thousands of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the West Nile virus is being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne virus, which can cause encephalitis, a brain
inflammation, killed seven people in the New York City area last
year during its first known appearance in the United States and has
become a public health threat this summer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Three elderly New York City residents tested positive for the
disease in the nation's only confirmed cases this summer. All three
are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms. But the virus can be dangerous in children under 5, the
elderly and people with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Given that threat, New York is among 44 states, along with the
District of Columbia and New York City, getting funding from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance of
mosquito-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Infected birds and mosquitoes can serve as an early warning
system for the presence of the West Nile virus. So at the urging of
New York health officials, counties and private citizens have been
sending dead birds to Stone's wildlife pathology lab just outside
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, scores of infected birds have been found in
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
with nearly 300 in New York state alone, most of them crows
discovered in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have prompted insecticide spraying in New York City
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the dead birds is a huge and exhausting job.
Researchers at the New York state Health Department's West Nile
virus lab, which Kramer heads, work weekends and the office is
running out of space for specimen jars. Stone starts at 3 a.m. and
puts in 16-hour days to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I go five minutes in a day without thinking of
West Nile,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and his small staff perform triage on the hundreds of
bagged and boxed birds arriving daily. They must decide which birds
to perform a necropsy on -- fresh carcasses are better than old
ones, crows are better indicators than some other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Stone looks for West Nile symptoms such as lesions on the birds'
hearts or enlarged livers and spleens. If he finds symptoms in a
bird, four specimen jars are shipped to the state Health
Department's nearby Griffin Lab -- one jar each for a bird's brain,
heart, spleen and kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's staff, working in the tight confines of a converted
horse stable, performs molecular tests on the tissue for a final
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's lab receives about 200 birds a week. On top of that,
tests are done each week on some 600 pools of mosquitoes shipped in
on dry ice from around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer came out from California in May to head the lab and has
been hustling to keep up since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really am amazed at the level to which the virus has
spread,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have also kept busy. For instance, Connecticut has
trapped and tested 104,000 mosquitoes. But New York is believed to
be doing more testing than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the work may not let up until a little after Labor
Day. With luck, disease-carrying mosquitoes will perish with the
first frost.	   The would give Stone a chance to get back to his other pathology
work, such as checking contaminated turtles and diseased ducks.
Kramer wants to spend the winter researching West Nile research,
instead of reacting to it.
</P>
<P>
   And after that?
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for Connecticut's
Agricultural Experiment Station, offered this gloomy assessment:
''Next year, we're going to be doing this all over again.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Travel To Africa  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Lending his prestige to a faltering
peace process, President Clinton travels to Africa next week to
witness an agreement aimed at ending seven years of civil war in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nelson Mandela struggles to get Tutsi and Hutu leaders to
accept a peace deal they say they are not ready for, militants on
both sides say that for them any peace deal will be a declaration
of war.
</P>
<P>
   President Pierre Buyoya has pleaded with the former South
African president to extend an Aug. 28 deadline for signing an
agreement. Without a cease-fire from Hutu rebels, the retired Tutsi
major has had little luck convincing war-wearied Burundians of a
peace agreement's merits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Buyoya warned Tutsi hard-liners who oppose the peace
deal not to try to stage a coup against him, a remarkable statement
that revealed his vulnerability and his uncertainty of support from
the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya also canceled a trip to meet Mandela in South Africa on
Tuesday. Instead, he stayed home to chair a cabinet meeting ahead
of his trip to Arusha, Tanzania, for next Monday's signing
ceremony, spokesman Appolinaire Gahuzu said.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton scheduled to attend, Buyoya is loath to boycott the
ceremony and snub such an important world leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if the mediator is reluctant to postpone the
signing of a peace agreement,'' Buyoya said Monday, adding that if
he didn't sign, ''Mandela will see this as a sign of disrespect and
that we, the Burundians, do not want peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 political and special interest groups represented at the
talks have been meeting for more than two years. Although the key
facilitator, Tanzanian judge Mark Bomani, says they have agreed on
more than 100 topics, several key problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's draft proposal calls for power-sharing in the army,
government and parliament, free elections after three years of
transition and an amnesty for those responsible for more than
200,000 deaths since the war began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the two main actors -- the Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi-dominated army -- have been unable to agree on a cease-fire or
the future of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, Hutu politicians and Tutsi opposition leaders cannot
agree on a transitional president. Buyoya wants the job for himself
but does not necessarily meet the qualifications because of he is
widely believed to have been involved in the 1993 assassination of
Burundi's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no stated national interests in Burundi, a
small tea and coffee growing nation, but wants to see an end to the
humanitarian disaster in which more than a million Hutus live as
refugees in Tanzania. Many Tutsis are forced to spend nights in
army-protected camps.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government donated $35 million in aid last year alone,
and gave an extra $1 million to finance the Arusha negotiations in
the hope of stabilizing the region. Only six years ago in
neighboring Rwanda, more than 500,000 Tutsis were killed in
massacres orchestrated by that nation's extremist Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya says he could sign on Monday if pressured by Mandela, but
only on the points already agreed upon. He wants to leave the
cease-fire and leadership issues for later.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, those points supposedly already worked out were
suddenly called into question when the 10 Tutsi political parties
jointly called for the accord to be completely renegotiated and
refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Hutu political parties have agreed in principle to
sign, but they have little or no influence over the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   With the signing date approaching and Buyoya wavering, the Hutu
rebels have launched a series of well-organized attacks aimed at
military targets. In the last three weeks, rebel ambushes have
killed 27 army cadets coming home from a basketball game and a top
military commander and his escort returning from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have led to military reprisals in Hutu villages
around the capital, and the fighting has only hardened the army's
reluctance to share power.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsi hardline leaders have flatly refused to take part in the
negotiations, saying they will not deal with Hutu rebel and
political leaders with blood on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, about 6,000 university students have been on
strike since Monday and police have detained trade union leaders
who called for a general strike for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hutu rebels are divided.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Bosco Ndayigenkurukiye, leader of the main rebel group, the
Front for the Defense of Democracy, says he will not sign unless
11,000 rebel activists or sympathizers are freed from government
jails. The second rebel group, Forces for the National Liberation,
did not even participate in the negotiations, demanding the
unconditional surrender of power.
</P>
<P>
   Failing any major breakthroughs, both groups have pledged to
keep fighting.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Awaits New UN Inspection Team  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- With a new team of U.N. inspectors just
finishing its training, Iraq stands defiant, confident that
international support for an attempt to restart the search for any
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons program is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with army commanders broadcast on Iraqi television
late Monday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein declared there ''is a
huge difference'' between conditions today and the situation in
1991, when a U.S.-led multinational force routed Iraqi troops from
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   State-run newspapers are full of articles declaring that the
U.S.-backed sanctions are fizzling and the once formidable
anti-Iraq alliance Washington led is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day, the world witnesses serious changes and
developments showing the degree of shift (toward Iraq) in the
international political climate,'' declared the government
newspaper al-Jumhouriya in a front-page article on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year and a half after the last arms inspection in
Iraq, the new U.N. inspection agency quietly finished a monthlong
training program for 44 staff members from 19 countries on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sharply divided Security Council must make a decision on
the next step -- a decision many at U.N. headquarters believe won't
come at least until after U.S. presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can only be suspended if Iraq cooperates with the new
inspectors, and can only be lifted if Iraq is declared free of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The last U.N. inspectors left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of
U.S. and British airstrikes meant to punish Saddam for failing to
cooperate with the United Nations, and Iraq has said it will bar
new inspectors from returning.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department spokesman insisted Tuesday that Iraq
must accept inspections if it wants ''out of the box'' of
sanctions. But Richard Boucher would not say what the U.S. response
would be if Baghdad refused and said that there were no ''specific
timetables'' on resuming inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials say privately that their rejection of any U.N.
request for new inspections could spark a new diplomatic, or
perhaps military, confrontation with Washington. But they also say
public opinion -- in Arab and international arenas -- is against
continued punishment that has hit ordinary Iraqis hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Senior foreign dignitaries are frequently shown on Iraqi
television delivering message to Saddam from their heads of state.
The stream of international visitors culminated this month with a
trip by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, the first head of state
to call on Saddam since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. exemptions to the sanctions have enabled Iraq to re-emerge
as a profitable market in international trade. The oil-for-food
program, initially a humanitarian proposal, has also recast it as
an important player in an oil-thirsty world.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's external trade under the U.N.-monitored oil program,
which allows it to skirt sanctions as long as most of the proceeds
are used to meet the basic needs of ordinary Iraqis, now runs into
billions of dollars a year, prompting visits to Baghdad by foreign
trade delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Tuesday with Hans Blix, who has been assembling the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, known as
UNMOVIC, created by the Security Council in December.
</P>
<P>
   Blix has to submit a progress report to the Security Council on
Sept. 1, and a 17-member board of commissioners that advises
UNMOVIC will meet in New York on Wednesday and Thursday to consider
his draft, UNMOVIC spokesman Ewen Buchanan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after his report is submitted depends to a large
extent on the Security Council, which is badly divided over
sanctions against Iraq. Russia and China are pushing for suspension
while the United States and Britain are pushing for renewed
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If U.N. inspectors are allowed back into Iraq, one of their
first tasks would be to update the status of several hundred sites
that used to be monitored by the previous inspection commission,
Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador in Magazine Squabble  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- As diplomatic incidents go, the squabble between
Tatler magazine and the U.S. ambassador over his 15-year-old
daughter's article savaging British boys ranks decidedly lower than
any trade war.
</P>
<P>
   But the media storm that accompanied Mary-Catherine Lader's
indictment -- particularly over whether or not she maintained that
''British boys really suck'' -- threatens to turn her broadside into
an Anglo-American contretemps.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ambassador Philip Lader fired off a letter to Tatler on
Aug. 11 accusing editors of manufacturing the ''British boys'' line
and inserting it in bold red letters even though Mary-Catherine
objected to it.
</P>
<P>
   The publication caused ''considerable embarrassment to my
daughter and our family,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Extensive publicity attendant to the publication of this
article has stemmed from, or been characterized by, language that
was not in her submitted draft and actually was suggested by an
adult editor,'' wrote Lader, who has been on vacation since the
August article appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the society magazine has accused Lader of a little
sensationalism of his own. Tatler said that the ambassador's
letter, distributed by the embassy to news organizations, has yet
to arrive at its office.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody from the U.S. embassy has even called, said
Tatler editor Geordie Greig.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every paragraph, every word, every sentence was checked off by
her and she was 100 percent happy with it,'' said Greig, who added
that he sat in on the meeting with Mary-Catherine at which she
signed off on the final column.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's two-page opinion piece -- developed after she moved
from South Carolina to London in 1997 -- complained that British
boys are scrawny, pale, antisocial and sulking.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I gave all the boys who had underwhelmed me the
benefit of the doubt but, after three years, I've finally
distinguished what it is -- that American guys have it and Brits
don't,'' the column said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Catherine, who attends St. Paul's Girls School, wasn't just
quibbling over personal style, however. British boys were called
''cheap,'' far too quick to make a pass and -- in short -- nothing to
write home about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even most British girls I know admit that American guys beat
the English when it comes to looks,'' the column said.
</P>
<P>
   The British press, from The Times and The Daily Telegraph to The
Mirror and other tabloids, was quick to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't aware diplomatic bags came as young as 15,'' wrote
The Mirror's Bill Borrows. ''Perhaps she should pack up her Prada
bag (and) go back to the land of Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. embassy spokesman Barry Levin reiterated that
the ambassador's daughter had not used the phrase ''sucks'' in her
original draft article, and that she had told editors it was not
something of which she would approve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ambassador's letter speaks for itself,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greig said Lader should be proud of his daughter's
''stunningly provocative'' journalistic debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Newsstand sales are up 11 percent, which is terrific,'' he
said. ''I've just come back from the U.S. and she was very much the
talk of Manhattan.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Cities Decry Virginia Census Law  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fifteen cities and counties across the country
hope to join a legal fight against a Virginia state law barring the
use of statistically adjusted census data for political
redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is one of 16 states covered under the federal Voting
Rights Act that must gain approval from the U.S. Justice Department
before changing affected state laws. In April, the state asked a
three-judge panel of U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia to rule that the law requiring the use of nonsampled
numbers did not violate federal regulations and should not be
subject to Justice approval.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 cities and counties, led by Los Angeles, have asked the
court if they could ''intervene'' in the case on Justice's behalf.
They contend that the use of the statistical method known as
''sampling'' helps account for parts of the population missed in
prior counts, including minorities, the poor and inner-city
residents that tend to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being closely watched by other states with similar
laws as a benchmark for deciding the constitutionality of sampled
data.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's all taking place around Virginia's
redistricting requirement, if that kind of decision came down
(approving the law), it would affect the whole country,'' Jessica
Hines, assistant city attorney for Los Angeles, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virginia is obligated to move forward with swift, timely
elections for 2001,'' said David Botkins, spokesman for Virginia
Attorney General Mark Earley, a Republican. ''The census should be
a real count, not statistically adjusted data, which is nothing
more than guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines said Los Angeles and other cities and counties concerned
with the case all suffered undercounts in the last census in 1990.
They include: Richmond, Va.; Houston; Denver; Inglewood, Calif.;
Oakland; San Francisco; San Antonio; Dearborn, Mich.; and Dade
County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cities have a distinct interest in the sampling debate,'' said
Gerry Hebert, a lawyer representing several Virginia state
legislators who intervened in the case against the law. ''A lot of
the outcome is in the inner city, where minorities have been
underrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   Census figures are used to reapportion billions of federal
dollars among the states. The Constitution also calls for census
data to be used every 10 years to reapportion the 435 House seats
among states, and to redraw political district lines within states.
</P>
<P>
   Raw census data is due to be released by Dec. 31; sampled
numbers by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said that reapportionment must be
based solely on raw population totals. It left open to states the
option of using either set of numbers for redistricting,
heightening the importance of statehouse elections in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important is that everybody be counted and the most
accurate, responsible way to do that is through an actual head
count,'' Botkins said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rulers Control Students  </HEADLINE>
By VIJAY JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar's military rulers have reopened
the country's universities after 3&AMP;frac12; years, but are keeping students
under tight control by making them pledge their loyalty to the
government and barring political activity, said pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the universities ''is a mere surface job to
make people think that there has been progress'' on democratic
rights in Myanmar, the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a
videotaped statement smuggled out of the country by human rights
activists and shown to reporters in Bangkok on Tuesday. ''But in
fact there has been no progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's rulers allowed full resumption of higher education on
July 24. They closed down campuses to stop anti-government
demonstrations in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 activists, who included academics, journalists, youth
workers and students from 10 countries, joined 200 Suu Kyi
supporters at a workshop Monday in the Myanmar capital of Yangon to
discuss the state of education in the country, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop was held at the headquarters of Suu Kyi's
opposition party, the National League for Democracy, whose
activities are kept under close scrutiny by the government,
especially when they involve foreign visitors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The party won general elections in 1990, but the military regime
never allowed it to form a government. Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel
Peace prize.
</P>
<P>
   Activists said the government did not try to disrupt the
workshop, but security officials at the airport searched them and
confiscated one videotape, not realizing it was blank.
</P>
<P>
   Students have been politically active in Myanmar since the days
of British colonial rule earlier this century. They spearheaded an
uprising that almost toppled the military in 1988. Thousands of
protesters were gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   Students were being allowed to enroll after signing a
declaration that they will stay away from political activities and
be loyal to the government. Student unions and other student
organizations are banned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Education is a conditionality, not a right in Myanmar,'' said
Christine Weima Lager, a youth worker from Norway. ''If you want
education you have to give up your political rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Lager and the other activists said political science is not a
subject in the universities.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi urged student movements around the world to force their
governments to pressure Myanmar's rulers into freeing the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like ... the student community to think of education
in Burma as part of our broader political problem,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Syria-Israel Talks Not Revived  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Syria remains interested in making peace with
Israel, but after another overture by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright a way to revive stalled talks has not been found, the
State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations sponsored by the Clinton administration broke down
in January. Albright telephoned Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
on Monday in an attempt to reopen them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The door has remained open to progress along this track, but
at this point we don't have anything specific to report on
restarting,'' the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel efforts are being made in the region by senior U.S.
mediator Dennis B. Ross. His main goal is to prod Israel and the
Palestinians into a settlement, but there, too, American diplomacy
is hitting a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   The late Syrian President Hafez Assad declared peace with Israel
was in Syria's strategic interest. Consequently, he demanded
surrender of the strategic Golan Heights border enclave, which
Syria lost in the 1967 Mideast war, as well as a strip of shore
along the Sea of Galilee. His son and successor, Bashar Ashad, is
committed to the same demands.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports from Damascus, Foreign Minister al-Sharaa
reiterated those demands in his telephone conversation with
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   She also has talked twice to Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of
France in the last week and to Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt
on Monday, looking for ''ways to move the process forward,''
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has stayed actively engaged with regional leaders,'' the
spokesman said. ''We believe that both the Syrians and the Israelis
want to reach an agreement.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Wins Weekly Ratings Crown  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Summer reality series ''Survivor'' and ''Big
Brother'' helped CBS squeak into the ratings top spot last week,
according to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' the week's top-rated show, was seen by 28.7
million viewers. The live Wednesday edition of ''Big Brother''
ranked fifth with 17.0 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 parsed out largely as it has for much of the summer:
CBS' reality shows plus ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire''
(whose Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday editions ranked second through
fourth), plus three newsmagazines and two scripted series: ABC's
''The Practice'' and CBS' ''Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall in prime time, CBS led the week with an average of 8.98
million viewers (a 6.3 rating and an 11 share), followed close
behind by ABC with 8.91 million viewers (6.1 household rating, 11
share).
</P>
<P>
   In third place, NBC had 7.94 million viewers (5.6 rating, 10
share).
</P>
<P>
   Fox had 6.37 million viewers (4.2 rating, 8 share). UPN had 3.57
million viewers (2.2, 4), the WB had 2.35 million viewers (1.6, 3),
and Pax TV had 1.38 million viewers (1.1, 2).
</P>
<P>
   In the evening news race, NBC's ''Nightly News'' won with 9.65
million viewers (7.1 household rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World
News Tonight'' had 8.20 million viewers (6.1 rating, 14 share),
while ''The CBS Evening News'' had 7.56 million viewers (5.8
rating, 13 share).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Aug. 14-20, the top 10 shows, their networks and
household ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 17.9; tie: ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday), ABC, and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, both 14.5; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC,
13.7; ''Big Brother'' (Wednesday), CBS, 10.8; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS,
9.9; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.2; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS,
8.6; ''Dateline NBC'' (Monday), NBC, 8.0; ''Dateline NBC''
(Tuesday), NBC, 7.8.

<HEADLINE> Man charged in stabbing death of estranged wife in McDonald's parking lot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLSTONE, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania man was charged with
murder Tuesday in the Monday stabbing death of his estranged wife
in the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant here, State Police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey E. Grant, 43, of Langhorne, Pa., stabbed his wife,
Theresa A. Grant, 40, several times Monday evening in the parking
lot of the restaurant, where she worked, said Sgt. Al Della Fave,
State Police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When state troopers arrived at the restaurant, they saw Mrs.
Grant, of Seaside Heights, laying on the sidewalk, Della Fave said.
Several bystanders had tried to administer first aid before she was
taken to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At least four witnesses gave statements to police identifying
the killer as Grant's husband, from whom she was separated, Della
Fave said. Mrs. Grant's family members also implicated him, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grant was pronounced dead at CentraState Healthcare System
in Freehold, Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was charged Tuesday morning with murder and unlawful
possession of a weapon. He had shaved his mustache and beard in an
attempt to conceal his identity, Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was taken from the Bucks County (Pa.) Jail to be held at
the Monmouth County Correctional Facility in lieu of $1 million
cash bail, Della Fave said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Lazio continue debate over debates  </HEADLINE>
With BC-NY--NY Senate, Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rick Lazio's Senate campaign on Tuesday said
Hillary Rodham Clinton was ducking debates, a charge denied by the
first lady's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton has said she is willing to debate the
congressman from Long Island ''anytime, anywhere,'' Lazio campaign
manager Bill Dal Col said she has only agreed to one of three
debates her Republican rival has accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''She apparently has her own version of Clinton-speak where
'anytime, anywhere' means sometime, somewhere, maybe, I'll decide
later,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign said that while it had agreed to a debate in
Buffalo on Sept. 13, moderated by NBC's Tim Russert, and two more
later in New York City, Clinton had agreed to only the Buffalo
debate thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a total lie,'' Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the first lady had agreed to the Buffalo debate and
was in the process of finalizing dates for the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said that while the first
lady has agreed to the Buffalo debate on Sept. 13, she has yet to
agree to dates proposed for the other two debates, Sept. 24 on
WCBS-TV and Oct. 18 on WNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to pin them down,'' McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson noted that the first lady has also accepted an
invitation from WABC-TV and the League of Women Voters for a fourth
debate. McLagan said that was still under consideration by the
Lazio camp.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, noting Clinton had accepted two other proposed debates
that Lazio hadn't agreed to, said, ''Rick Lazio should stop ducking
and accept all the debates that Hillary has agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign, meanwhile, noted that the congressman had
unsuccessfully offered to debate the first lady on Russert's ''Meet
the Press'' show on July 30.

<HEADLINE> Horse owners urged to vaccinate their animals against encephalitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Eastern equine encephalitis is being blamed
for causing the death of a quarter horse in Newfield, Gloucester
County, and horse owners are being urged to ensure their animals
have been vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ernest Zirkle, the state veterinarian, said the horse that
was put down last Wednesday had not been vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Zirkle said Eastern equine encephalitis should not be confused
with West Nile virus, the potentially fatal virus that killed seven
people in New York and sickened dozens last year. Three Staten
Island residents in New York have tested positive for the virus
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are completely different diseases but share some
characteristics - in both cases mosquitoes carry the virus to the
host animal after feeding on infected wild birds,'' Zirkle said in
a prepared statement. ''Neither virus can be spread from horse to
horse or from horse to human.''
</P>
<P>
   Zirkle noted there is no vaccine for West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Horse owners should check their records to make sure that EEE
vaccinations and boosters are kept up to date,'' he said. ''Any
horse that hasn't received a primary series or booster within the
last six months should be given the vaccination or booster now.''

<HEADLINE> Pipe Blast Could Spur Safety Bills  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The deaths of 11 people from a New Mexico
natural gas pipeline explosion may force Congress to pass
long-stalled legislation to intensify inspections of underground
pipelines, a lawmaker says.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two people were killed by natural gas pipeline accidents
between 1986 and June 30, according to the Office of Pipeline
Safety, an agency of the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's galling to think that more tragedies could happen while
these bills sit in committee,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., a
sponsor of one of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   A man who died Monday in a Lubbock, Texas, hospital, was the
11th victim of Saturday's explosion of a buried natural gas
pipeline near Carlsbad, N.M. Five children were among those killed
when the pre-dawn explosion swept flames down the Pecos River's
banks and through tents where two families were camping.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter-in-law of the man who died Monday remained in
critical condition in Lubbock. The woman's parents, husband and two
children were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The last major pipeline safety bill passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the window of opportunity,'' Inslee said Monday. ''We
need to pass out a comprehensive pipeline safety bill now, not wait
until next session.''
</P>
<P>
   A gasoline pipeline broke in June 1999 in Bellingham, Wash., and
the ensuing fire killed three people. That accident led to an
influx of proposed regulations and reports, but none has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee said he already has been promised a committee hearing on
the issue and expects a pipeline safety bill to make it out of
Congress this session.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is the type of bill that makes it out of
Congress,'' he said. ''If it doesn't have any meat on its bones,
then it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Various versions of House and Senate pipeline safety
legislation, including bills introduced by Inslee, Rep. Bob Franks,
R-N.J., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would require more pipeline
operator training and periodic pipeline testing. The Transportation
Department does not mandate rechecks once pipes are in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation also would increase penalties for unsafe pipelines,
including cash fines and possible shutdown of a substandard pipe,
and public disclosure of all pipe locations.
</P>
<P>
   ''No longer are these pipes buried underground only in remote
locations, miles away from the nearest home or business,'' Franks
said in a speech last month. ''In my home state, thousands of
people live or work in immediate proximity to pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety office has tried for six years to create a national
pipeline map without completing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many things wrong with our pipeline system and many
things that need to be fixed,'' Inslee said.
</P>
<P>
   An inspector general's report in March criticized the Office of
Pipeline Safety for failure to complete improved inspections
required by a 1992 law of unusually sensitive and highly populated
areas of the 325,000 miles of natural gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   OPS was supposed to have completed the first step by 1994 but
has not, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding congressional mandates all will be met before
the end of the year, OPS said in its response to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4849, H.R. 4749, and S.2438.

<HEADLINE> Bird-biting mosquitoes found in Norwalk, 26 more dead crows discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Bird-biting mosquitoes infected with the
West Nile virus have turned up again in Norwalk, but state
officials said Tuesday they do not plan any new pesticide spraying
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes, of the culex restuans variety, were collected
Aug. 7 at the Rowayton School trap site in Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Nile virus activity has intensified over the past several
weeks and isolation of the virus in another mosquito pool does not
come as a surprise,'' said Department of Environmental Protection
Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on Tuesday also announced the discovery of 26
additional crows infected with the virus, collected in Darien,
Milford, New Canaan, Norwalk, Stamford, Wallingford, West Hartford
and Wethersfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state's program has identified West Nile Virus birds in 19
communities and expects to identify it in many more,'' Rocque said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus first surfaced in the region last year, killing seven
people - all of whom were over 75 - and sickening 62 others in New
York. It also killed hundreds of birds in Connecticut, New York and
New Jersey. There have been three human cases reported in New York
this year.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans End Mostly Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices finished mostly lower
Tuesday after a day of sluggish trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans dipped on the outlook for crop-beneficial rains in the
Midwest and the prospect of showers in the Delta later in the week.
The weather overcame an early increase in the price based on a
slightly lower weekly crop rating issued by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Corn finished down slightly after also reversing course. Traders
said the crop rating decline wasn't enough to justify pushing
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat fell under pressure from soybeans in a generally quiet
session.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 1&AMP;frac12; cent to $2.53 a bushel;
December corn fell &AMP;frac34; cent to $1.88 a bushel; December oats rose &AMP;frac34;
cent to $1.09&AMP;frac14; a bushel; November soybeans fell 3&AMP;frac34; cents to
$4.67&AMP;frac12;
a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures declined.
</P>
<P>
   October live cattle rose .07 cent to 68.22 cents a pound;
October feeder cattle fell .30 cent to 86.75 cents a pound; October
lean hogs fell 1.10 cent to 52.45 cents a pound; February frozen
pork bellies fell .38 cent to 65.02 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Publishers Clearing House to change promotions, repay $18 million  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Publishers Clearing House has agreed to pay 24
states and the District of Columbia $18 million to settle lawsuits
that accused the sweepstakes promoter of deceptive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said on Tuesday that
Publishers Clearing House will refund money to thousands of
consumers and revise its methods of selling magazines, compact
discs, and other items through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who received the company's 100 million mailings a year
included many elderly people who were victimized by its ''tricks,
gimmicks and greed,'' Spitzer said. He said the company sent some
of them 150 mailings a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Publishers Clearing House's most famous ''gimmicks'' are
the garish envelopes sent to consumers in every state, saying ''You
May Have Already Won'' some prize and containing a simulated but
worthless check for a large amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Spitzer said, the consumer had won nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should know they have about as much chance of winning
these sweepstakes as they do of getting hit by lightning,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said $1.6 million of the $18 million will go to 1,600
New Yorkers, most of them customers who spent at least $2,500 a
year with the company between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office will determine how much money each
individual gets based on a formula yet to be determined, Spitzer
said. He added that his office will receive $148,000 for the costs
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also requires Publishers Clearing House to include
a ''sweepstakes fact box,'' similar to a nutrition content label,
in future mailings, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The box must say customers may enter for free, that buying won't
improve chances of winning, that customers may enter as often as
they like, that they have not yet won, and that all entries have
the same chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason someone should buy a magazine subscription,''
Spitzer said, ''is because they like the magazine. There is no link
between what you spend and your odds of winning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about the settlement, Publishers Clearing House
said it has been in business 46 years and has awarded almost $160
million in prizes. The company said 24 of the 31 people who have
won $1 million or more did not buy anything when they sent in their
winning entries.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher L. Irving, senior director of consumer and legal
affairs at Publishers Clearing House, said the company has agreed
to contact consumers who spend more than $2,500 in a year with his
company.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers are confused about the sweepstakes' rules or about
their chances of winning, or if consumers are having money
troubles, they will be removed from the company's mailing list,
Irving said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving praised the agreement and said it should serve as a model
for other deals that Publishers Clearing House is trying to work
out with more than 20 other states that have filed lawsuits against
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no admission of wrongdoing by Publishers Clearing
House in this agreement,'' Irving said.

<HEADLINE> Camden leaders want state to help, not take over, ailing city  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The City Council wants the mayor, who has
been charged with extortion and money laundering, to resign. The
city attorney has quit, saying Council has created a ''hostile,
racist'' workplace. The business administrator is right behind him,
and Council members are forbidden by the mayor from speaking
directly with department heads.
</P>
<P>
   Things are difficult, to say the least, in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration wants the state to have the power to
take over operations of New Jersey's poorest city. But city leaders
say they need cooperation, not control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's against everything we've ever learned about democracy,''
Councilman Gilbert ''Whip'' Wilson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the state were to take control, that would, in effect, seize
the citizens' voting rights, because the people they elected would
not be running the city, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not the way it's supposed to work, not in this country
anyway. It's offensive, when you think of all the things done over
the years to keep freedom ringing - wars, the civil rights
movement. That's very precious to a lot of us, the right to vote.
Once you appoint an overseer, you have no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said it's exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our belief that the residents might not be being served
now by that same democracy,'' Anthony Cancro, deputy commissioner
of the state Department of Community Affairs, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state wants to ''give the people a voice by
providing more involvement and leadership that's not there now.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has been monitoring the city's spending and hiring
since May. But Gov. Christie Whitman wants the state to have the
authority to assume control of city operations. If that happens,
Camden would become the first New Jersey city to be fully run by
state government.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to give the state that power was introduced in the Senate
before the summer recess and no committee hearing is scheduled. No
action has been taken in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're unable to make the long, lasting changes we need without
this legislation,'' said Ulrich ''Al'' Steinberg, director of the
state Division of Local Government Services, which oversees city
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last two or three decades, there's been Band-Aids put
on the problems in Camden. Our intent is really to address the long
term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg also said trying to solve the problems without the
state's help would be limiting the resources available to
revitalize the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say they are able to turn around decades of problems
without the tools available at the state, I think, is looking at
things short term again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancro said under the proposal, the state could reorganize city
departments to make them more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure the services the government is supposed
to provide are provided effectively and efficiently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Also under the current system, we don't really have a sense of
a mayor that's responding to a leadership position,'' Cancro said.
''He hasn't been seen in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, a chief management officer would
be installed to ''provide some leadership and management skills in
the city, independent of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City Council on Friday unanimously voted to ask Mayor Milton
Milan to step down. Milan called the move a ''political gesture''
and defended his work as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Milan has been indicted on federal charges of corruption and
money laundering. His trial is to begin in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   City attorney John A. Misci Jr. resigned last week, saying the
Council had created an ''unhealthy, openly hostile, racist and
retaliatory workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the difficulties in City Hall, Milan recently directed
city department heads not to talk to Council members. Instead,
Council members must go through Business Administrator Preston
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, too, announced last week that he is resigning, effective
Oct. 31. Cancro said the state is working with city officials to
find a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It stinks, this whole thing,'' Joseph A. Twardy, who owns a
tobacco shop across the street from City Hall, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Twardy supports the state assuming control, saying ''anything
would be better than what's happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Milton Milan thinks he's in Disney World,'' said Twardy. ''He
runs this here city the way Mickey Mouse would run it.''

<HEADLINE> EPA: Asbestos In Garden Products OK  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small amounts of asbestos in some gardening
products such as potting soil pose little risk to consumers but may
be hazardous to people who regularly work with the raw material,
the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An agency study of 38 vermiculite products from around the
country found five that could expose people to asbestos and 17
others with trace amounts. All five products with higher asbestos
levels were straight vermiculite, which is often mixed with soil by
consumers for lawn and garden uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''These levels were very low and do not pose significant health
risks,'' said Susan Wayland, an administrator with the EPA's office
of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
the Mine Safety and Health Administration said they were
investigating the asbestos exposure of people who regularly work
with vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Vermiculite, produced from an ore mined worldwide, can be found
in products such as insulation, brake pads, cement and fireproof
safes. Gardeners have used vermiculite for decades because of its
ability to hold water, fertilizer and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos is a natural, minor contaminant of the ore and poses a
health risk when it becomes airborne and is inhaled. Asbestos
exposure has been linked to cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA recommended that consumers use premixed potting soils,
which produce less dust. People mixing their own vermiculite with
soil should work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and keep the
vermiculite damp to avoid dust.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said consumers can purchase alternative
materials to mix with soil such as peat, sawdust, perlite or bark.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermiculite Association, an international group, agrees with
most of the EPA's conclusions and is planning its own scientific
study, said spokesman Michael J. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the association has similar recommendations to avoid
dust, but added the EPA is premature in suggesting consumers use
vermiculite alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think from the work they've done in this report
there's justification for that,'' he said in an interview from the
association's headquarters north of London.
</P>
<P>
   The five products in the EPA study that caused concern are
Earthgro's Best Vermiculite, Hoffman's Vermiculite, Schultz
Horticultural Vermiculite and two samples of Ace Horticultural
Grade Vermiculite purchased in different states. These products
didn't produce airborne asbestos, but examinations under the
microscope found significant amounts. After an additional test only
the Earthgro product showed noteworthy levels of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our analysis shows there's a great deal of variability in each
of these products,'' said Steve Johnson, another administrator with
the EPA's toxic substances office.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz Co. spokesman Robert Weaver said his company was
reviewing the EPA study, but its own research had detected no
asbestos in its vermiculite products. Ace, Hoffman and The Scotts
Company, which makes Earthgro, did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier study, the EPA examined 16 vermiculite products
from the Seattle area and found one, Zonolite Chemical Packaging
Vermiculite, that produced airborne asbestos when handled. In
April, the agency advised consumers to avoid the product, which was
produced from ore from the W.R. Grace mine in Libby, Mont. The mine
closed in 1990 and the product is no longer sold, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are conducting medical tests in the Libby
area following reports that hundreds of vermiculite miners and
their relatives have died or are dying from asbestos-related
diseases. Several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of workers and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Government health officials said earlier this month that
Zonolite insulation produced at the Grace mine is a danger to
workers or homeowners who handle it because of the asbestos it
contains.

<HEADLINE> Stamford wins battle for combined IP-Champion HQ  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - International Paper Co., which bought
Champion International Corp. in June, has agreed to move its
combined world headquarters from Purchase, N.Y., to Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials and a spokesman for International Paper
said a verbal agreement was reached after Connecticut economic
development officials offered a generous package of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ends a fierce competition between Connecticut and
New York for IP, the top forest paper company in the world. For a
while, it looked like IP would keep the combined headquarters in
Purchase, where the company has been located since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut officials put on a full-court press to lure the
company to Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper will move its employees at its current
headquarters in Purchase to the building in downtown Stamford where
Champion had its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Department of Economic &AMP; Community Development has
agreed to give IP a $1 million loan that will be forgiven after 10
years if the company retains 550 jobs in Connecticut. The jobs are
not limited to the Stamford headquarters, but can be anywhere in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper already employs about 430 people in
Connecticut in manufacturing operations in Waterbury and Putnam; an
office in East Granby; and a distribution network in West Haven,
Hartford and Stamford. The 120 IP workers to be moved from the
Purchase headquarters will bring the company up to the 550 required
under the loan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Connecticut Development Authority has agreed to
give the company a sales tax exemption for construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   The CDA has also agreed to give the owner of the Champion
building where the newly combined company will be located a $5.2
million loan for high-tech communications wiring and other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real feather in the cap for Connecticut,'' said James
Watson, a spokesman for the Department of Economic &AMP; Community
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cox, a spokesman for IP, said the company wanted to move
its headquarters from its current location in a suburban office
park.
</P>
<P>
   ''While (the financial package offered by Connecticut) was a
considerable part of the decision, one of the real motivating
factors was the visibility we would have as a corporation in
Stamford,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford is home to several major corporations, including Xerox
Corp., Pitney Bowes and GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Champion, with $5.3 billion in revenues and about 17,000
employees, was acquired in June by the much-larger IP, with $24.6
billion in revenues and about 100,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said it is still unclear how many people will end up working
at the combined headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 people currently work at IP's headquarters in
Purchase. Cox said all of those employees have been offered jobs at
the new headquarters, which is roughly 12 miles from the Purchase
location.
</P>
<P>
   Before the acquisition, Champion had about 375 employees at its
Stamford headquarters. About 265 of those employees have been given
notices that their jobs will be eliminated. Another 50 have been
given jobs with IP, although most of them are going to be
transferred to other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the fate of the remaining 60 Champion employees is
unclear because IP is continuing to integrate the two businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he expects a formal agreement to be signed within
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a done deal,'' said Cox, who said the company hopes to
complete the move by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, who was involved in the
negotiations, said there was an intense competition between the two
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite frankly, I thought they were going to New York. At any
number of times, I thought we had lost, but we kept at the table
and kept the lines of communication open.''
</P>
<P>
   New York officials said they also offered IP incentives to stay
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put forth a competitive offer ... but it was difficult to
compete against a building they now own in Stamford,'' said Charles
Gargano, chairman and chief executive of Empire State Development,
the economic arm of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't like to lose any jobs but ... the good news is that
that area of Westchester County ... there is an influx of
information technology and telecommunications expansions. We have
every confidence that the (IP) space will be filled.''

<HEADLINE> New law allows localities to sell tax liens to state agency  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Local governments will be able sell
delinquent property tax liens and transfer the job of collecting
overdue taxes to a state agency under a bill signed into law by
Gov. George Pataki Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows the Municipal Bond Bank Agency (MBBA) or a
trust created by the agency to purchase tax liens on the property
of delinquent taxpayers and take over enforcement of the liens.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, municipalities, which depend heavily on real property
taxes as a revenue source, will gain funds by selling the liens to
MBBA. ''Budgetary imbalances'' resulting from tax delinquencies
would therefore be avoided under the new law, said the bill's
sponsor, state Sen. John Marchi, R-Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the law will also benefit taxpayers by reducing
pressure on municipalities to raise property taxes to compensate
for uncollected property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Current law requires tax districts to enforce liens, a legal
claim attached to property of delinquent taxpayers. Municipalities
also cannot sell the liens to other parties, and the MBBA doesn't
have the authority to purchase tax liens.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law the MBBA would issue obligations secured by
the real property liens, and proceeds from those bonds would become
payment to the municipalities for the liens.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts have indicated a cost-effective transaction
would require at least $35 million to $50 million in delinquent tax
liens - an amount only the largest of New York state's
municipalities could amass. The new law will enable smaller
localities to participate by pooling their liens and sharing
proceeds from their sale.
</P>
<P>
   Marchi said local governments theoretically could foreclose
properties, but that process is time-consuming and foreclosure
costs could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience teaches us that securitzation of tax liens, when
accompanied by adequate safeguards, will be the most beneficial in
the local provisions of capital needs,'' Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax lien securitization will provide a centralized, efficient
and reliable means of ensuring full collection of municipal
taxes,'' added Edward Farrell, executive director of the New York
State Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said law is similar to a program in New York City that
has recovered millions of dollars in lost property tax revenues
over the past years.

<HEADLINE> An analysis of Clinton ad criticizing Lazio's legislative record  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the new Clinton campaign ad regarding
Republican
Senate candidate Rick Lazio's congressional record:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Won't See''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCERS: Mandy Grunwald, Mark Penn and DeVito/Verdi agency.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Statewide beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: (Read by a male announcer)
</P>
<P>
   ''The end to nursing home standards. The largest education cuts
in history. The slashing of Medicare by $270 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who voted for all this? Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four years as Newt Gingrich's deputy whip. You won't see that
in his ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''And you won't see his recent votes against investing in
100,000 new teachers, and against guaranteed prescription drug
coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Rick Lazio, the more you know, the more you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Black background, white letters with the title of each
act appearing as it's read. As the announcer mentions Gingrich, a
still picture of Lazio and the former speaker of the House appears
on screen, followed by a headshot of Lazio that accompanies the
ad's final words.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The spot visually resembles an ad Lazio's campaign put
out recently with the titles of various pieces of legislation he
supports appearing on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Both commercials are seriously focused on the issues - not on
personalities - though Lazio's campaign has taken such ads
personally in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This one is designed to draw attention to Lazio's sometimes more
conservative stance on legislative issues, which he has recently
tried to cast himself as moderate on.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for example, he was the only New York Republican to
vote against a $352 billion bill funding education, health and
human services. Democrats said the bill cut the programs too
deeply. It was the first time Lazio voted with Democrats on such a
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers are heavily dependent on social services, and
the state gets a huge amount of federal dollars from the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio said the issues
Clinton's most recent ad takes on - support for nursing home
standards, education, and Medicare - are ones crucial to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what the debate should be about, what did you vote
for, what did you vote against?'' de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain slight-of-hand to the ad, however. It
criticizes Lazio for voting against a prescription drug benefit for
Medicare recipients. In truth, he has also supported such coverage
as part of a Republican-backed plan the Clinton ad doesn't mention.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say he voted against coverage is not accurate. He voted for
another plan,'' said Lazio campaign spokesman Bryan Flood.

<HEADLINE> President to visit overcrowded school, attend two fund-raisers  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   President Clinton will visit an overcrowded school
district to
speak about school construction and attend two fund-raisers for New
Jersey congressional candidates in the state on Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton will meet with students and teachers at the Crossroads
Middle School in South Brunswick, where more than 200 of the
school's 1,635 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade students attend
class in trailers scattered around campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't build them fast enough,'' South Brunswick Assistant
Superintendent Willa Spicer said of new schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district of over 7,000 students has grown by about 400
children a year for the past seven or eight years, she said.
Twenty-one trailers make up classrooms at Crossroads and two other
schools in the district, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spicer said the central New Jersey city is becoming increasingly
popular for parents with diverse commuting needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's halfway between New York and Philadelphia,'' she said.
''It's halfway between Rutgers and Princeton. It's on a train line,
it's on the turnpike.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also headline fund-raisers in Princeton and Cherry
Hill later Wednesday for U.S. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Pennington, and
Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin.
</P>
<P>
   The president will speak at a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser at a
Princeton private home for Holt, D-Pennington, who is seeking
re-election against former Rep. Dick Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who is in her first congressional race against Republican
Rep. James Saxton, expects at least 400 people at the $300-a-head
cocktail reception at Garden State Park in Cherry Hill.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 59; Nasdaq Rises 5  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks rose Tuesday after the Federal
Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, indicating inflation fears
are moderating. Technology stocks were mixed, with computer shares
up and telecommunications issues down, partly on worries of slowing
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 59.34 at 11,139.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.06 at 3,958.21 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 1.35 at 1,498.13.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers had expected the Fed to leave rates steady as a
stream of economic data in recent weeks suggested the economy was
slowing and inflation was under control. The Fed had raised rates
six times since last summer in an effort to bring the fast moving
economic expansion in for a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed on Tuesday said it was maintaining its close watch
on inflation, it noted that ''rapid advances in productivity have
been raising the potential growth rate'' of the economy. That
bullish statement was missing from the Fed's June statement when it
also left rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Various economists cited these more positive comments to bolster
their positions that the Fed has finished raising rates. The Fed's
next meeting is in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got exactly what we wanted,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market
analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The market had been rallying for the past month on the
expectation that the Fed would leave interest rates alone. But a
more sluggish economy also raised the specter of slowing corporate
profits which could hurt stocks, particularly more risky technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Most banking and retail stocks rose on the Fed's decision, with
PNC Financial jumping $2 to $59.125 and the Gap, adding $1.25 to
$28.375.
</P>
<P>
   In the tech sectors, most software and computer stocks gained,
while investors sold semiconductor and telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker Gateway added 75 cents to $63 and software
designer Adobe Systems rose $2.375 to $122.25. Sprint PCS was the
biggest decliner among telecom stocks, falling $3.188 to $49.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Composite volume on the NYSE totaled 1.01 billion shares, up
from 909.05 million Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.01 at
517.46.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.58 percent,
Germany's DAX index was up 0.69 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.65 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.88 percent.

<HEADLINE> Latest trooper recruits still mostly white males  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Despite a recruiting drive that targeted
minorities and a revamped testing process, the latest pool of
potential New Jersey state troopers is still mostly white and
virtually all male.
</P>
<P>
   Many minorities distrust the State Police and law enforcement in
general, a disappointed Superintendent Col. Carson Dunbar said
Tuesday as he announced the results of the recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police must combat that fear as well as a booming
economy to attract more minorities and women, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar said he has worked to diversify the ranks, but those
efforts are still not working. After charges of racial profiling
became widely public many criticized the State Police for being
mostly white with few minority supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of all the problems that I face, this may be one of the
most difficult that I deal with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times Dunbar admitted that the figures he made public
were not the ones he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 percent of the 3,000 troopers are minorities and 3
percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   Only one woman is in the final pool of 105 candidates.
Minorities account for about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started off, I thought these numbers would be better,''
Dunbar said. ''It is very difficult to attract individuals to law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Just over 5,000 people applied for the job, according to state
police figures. Of those approximately 86 percent were males and 30
percent were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   After each step in the testing process, the percentages of
females and minority applicants dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we went through this, proportionately we kept losing
people, which is to be expected,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics faulted the State Police for not keeping track of
applicants who do not return after each testing level.
</P>
<P>
   After settling a lawsuit with the NAACP in March, the state
agreed to allow former applicants to reapply. Dunbar said that
applicants were also personally screened if they were rejected
after an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, trooper candidates were interviewed by
people outside the department, Dunbar said. The panel included a
human resources expert from another area of state government and at
least one minority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The screening process was different from the beginning,
according to Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   Each application was reviewed by someone who did not know the
race or gender of the applicant. Physical fitness standards changed
and applicants were allowed to take that test up to four times.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunbar said that does not mean standards were lowered to
allow more minorities and women to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the testing process starts, then I think my
responsibility is to be fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman LeRoy J. Jones, D-Essex, said he is concerned by
what he called a failure to diversify the ranks of the State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly they need to reassess their approach and re-examine
who they are using as consultants in recruiting minorities into the
ranks,'' Jones said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   When recruits begin classes Sept. 5, they will see more changes.
</P>
<P>
   The previous class numbered 175 cadets. Dunbar said cadet
classes will now be no larger than 50. That comes after
consultation with other police groups, including the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them have seen that smaller is better and we're going
to follow that,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets will also be issued laptop computers and be allowed to
work shorter days. They will also be scheduled to attend classes in
night shifts, much like troopers assigned to road duty, Dunbar
said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaigns for women's votes  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Clinton visited the birthplace of
the suffrage movement Tuesday to stress her credentials on women's
issues, including abortion, and attack those of her U.S. Senate
opponent, Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Rochester that took her to a shopping mall,
women's gathering and the Susan B. Anthony House, Clinton sought to
reach women voters who, according to polls, have been inconsistent
in their support.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing her compare-and-contrast strategy, Clinton repeated
her promise never to vote to confirm any U.S. Supreme Court nominee
who would vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, and attacked Lazio for
refusing to make the same pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has already voted against ... funding for poor women,
voting to prohibit American women in the military from using their
own funds,'' she told supporters at an event with U.S. Rep. Louise
Slaughter, D-N.Y., where she also cited the need for improved child
health care and education, higher standards for nursing homes, tax
credits for long-term care providers and more money for breast
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio ''has a very anti-choice record,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates say they are abortion rights supporters,
Lazio is opposed to using federal Medicaid funds to pay for poor
women's abortions and favors a ban on what critics call
''partial-birth abortion.'' Clinton favors Medicaid funding and is
opposed to a partial-birth abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   At the gathering, 99-year-old Ruth Dyk told of marching with
suffragettes in Boston. ''If I have learned one thing,'' she said,
''it is that New York needs a woman's touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Such direct appeals to women voters will position the first lady
to provide that touch, Slaughter predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she'll benefit a great deal just by being here
today,'' the congresswoman said after the women were given a
room-by-room tour of the Susan B. Anthony House, the former
headquarters for the National American Woman Suffrage Association
and the site of Anthony's arrest for voting in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, Clinton added her name to a petition advocating
a U.S. stamp for Martha Matilda Harper, who is credited with
creating modern franchising by opening a chain of beauty salons in
Rochester. The first lady also promised to call on a friend at the
Harvard Business School to see about adding Harper's
accomplishments to the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls show women backing Clinton over Lazio, 50
percent to 38 percent. But among white women, Clinton has
consistently trailed - 41 percent to 46 percent in an August poll
by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Interviews have shown
that some in the crucial voting bloc resent what they see as her
riding her husband's coattails. Others believe she should not have
stuck with the president in light of his infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Shaw, who waited at the Marketplace mall to shake
Clinton's hand, said she viewed the first lady's commitment to her
marriage as a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ''She showed incredible strength in standing by him. In my mind,
it's not a weakness, it's a strength,'' she said. ''She certainly
has put her family first. That's family values right there.''

<HEADLINE> Cape May-Lewes Ferry continues to sell food despite third inspection failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOWER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The operators of the Cape May-Lewes
Ferry will continue to sell prepared food despite being told to
stop by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The directive came in an Aug. 18 letter from FDA District
Director Douglas Ellsworth to the Delaware River and Bay Authority,
which operates the ferries.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent after four of the fleet's five ships failed
a third round of health inspections Aug. 10-12. Ellsworth noted
that the authority has made improvements but ''the conditions under
which food is stored, handled, prepared and served remain
unsanitary,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings, the authority will continue to cook up
hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries and other fast food for
passengers, said James Salmon, a spokesman for the authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the authority's food service operation is safe,
clean and professionally managed,'' Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said food service standards were being improved and that
a new corrective-action plan, filed Tuesday, would address some of
FDA's complaints. The authority had until Friday to file a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has spent $13,000 on new equipment and held
training sessions for 160 food service employees, Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the ferries' 1.3 million annual passengers
snack on the prepared foods during their excursions, Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has classified the ferry food service as
''use-prohibited,'' meaning the authority should not prepare, serve
or sell any food that requires ''manual manipulation of
ingredients,'' Ellsworth wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA can take measures to seize all food or shut down food
service if the authority continues to prepare and serve food while
it is use-prohibited.

<HEADLINE> Law imposes tougher murder sentences when death penalty involved  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, N.J. (AP) - A law prompted by the parole bids of a
murderer of two Lodi police officers ensures that convicted
murderers who face the death penalty will at least serve life in
prison without parole, lawmakers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill signed into law by Acting Governor Donald DiFrancesco
in front of the relatives of the two slain officers, however, does
not affect the case of Thomas Trantino, who faces a state Supreme
Court hearing next month on a judge's order to parole him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know this initiative will not undo the damage that was done
at the hands of this particular murderer,'' DiFrancesco said of
Trantino. ''We can, however, ensure their families and the families
of all victims of crime that they won't have to relive their pain
through the parole process.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law states that in cases where prosecutors seek the
death penalty for convicted murderers, the defendants must serve no
less than life without parole. Under the previous law, judges could
sentence murderers to 30 years to life in prison with the
possibility of parole if juries decline to issue a death sentence
or if the defendant's death sentence is overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino was sentenced to die for killing officers Gary Tedesco
and Peter Voto in a bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's death
penalty was overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was changed to
life in prison. Sentencing guidelines in effect at the time made
him eligible for parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death penalty came back, but he didn't go back on death
row,'' said Elaine Tedesco, Gary Tedesco's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino has lost at least nine parole bids during his 37 years
behind bars, but a three-judge appellate panel on June 9 said
parole board members ignored several key points on Trantino's
behalf, including his clean prison record since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The panel ordered that Trantino be released to a halfway house,
but the state appealed the ruling. The state Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear arguments on Trantino's case on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they read any of the transcripts,'' Elaine
Tedesco said of the judges' recent decision.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco signed the bill next to Tedesco's mother,
76-year-old Sadie, who clutched a photograph of her 22-year-old
slain son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't take it no more,'' Sadie Tedesco said of the years she
has relived her son's death. ''You get numb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been myself in 37 years.''

<HEADLINE> State says scores show students do well but test is questionable  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Results from standardized tests show New
Jersey's fourth- and eighth-graders appear to do well in science
and math but most fourth-graders can't write well enough to pass
state standards.
</P>
<P>
   So many students did so poorly in the writing section that the
state will re-examine how those tests are scored. Forty percent of
the fourth-graders tested scored a zero, according to results
released Tuesday by the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials said they don't know if it's the test
or the students.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year for the tests designed to gauge how
students perform when compared to new, tougher classroom standards.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe warned that new tests will
show variable results from year to year, especially when new
standards are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to remember progress takes many years and it is never
linear,'' Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   For eight-grade students, about 80 percent scored above
proficiency levels in science and language arts.
</P>
<P>
   But roughly one-third of the students failed to make the grade
on the math test.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth grade, just under 90 percent ranked proficient or
above on the science exam, roughly the same as the 1999 figure.
</P>
<P>
   Math results were better than last year. About 71 percent tested
at or above the standard. In 1999, 57 percent hit that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased with the real gains in this area,'' Hespe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top educator gave high marks to the students and the
test process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, we think our testing program is strong. It's showing
the numbers we want with one exception,'' Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   That glaring area is the writing exam for the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a performance gap between the multiple choice
reading sets and the writing tests,'' Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   Test supervisors reviewed the raw scores with consultants who
told the state there appears to be a problem with the way writing
samples were scored, Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will go back to the committee of teachers who drafted
the score sheet and the models, the commissioner said. The state
could recalculate the test scores for that test.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the grading standards are changed, there will not be a
great change in the overall results, Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   That means schools must work to improve writing skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This area will still be one of the most troublesome for school
districts. The problem with writing will not go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School districts use these test to design programs. Teachers use
them to identify problems with particular students.

<HEADLINE> US: No Plan if Iraq Stops Inspectors  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a new U.N. weapons inspection program
almost ready for duty in Iraq, the State Department said Tuesday no
hostile actions are planned if, as expected, Iraq refuses to
cooperate with the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with the director of
the program, Hans Blix, and expressed full support for his
activities, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission, known informally as UNMOVIC. It will replace
UNSCOM, which was expelled by the Iraqis in December 1998, touching
off several days of U.S. and British airstrikes against military
targets in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Blix is a former Swedish Foreign Minister who also served for
many years director general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Blix is close to recruiting a core staff for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Iraq stands to benefit by cooperating. The United
Nations won't lift its sanctions, he said, unless it does.
</P>
<P>
   While ruling out the use of force if Iraq rejects the
commission, Boucher renewed the administration's warning that Iraq
could face American military power under other circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he (President Saddam Hussein) reconstitutes his programs
for weapons of mass destruction, if he threatens his neighbors or
threatens U.S. forces or moves against the (Iraqi) Kurds, we have a
credible force in the region, and we're prepared to act an
appropriate time and place of our choosing, as necessary,' Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been U.S. military actions against Iraq for the last
20 months but they have been limited to periodic air strikes
against Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries. These batteries have been
used to fire on allied planes enforcing ''no fly'' zones in
northern and southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Peru Chief Announces Arms Ring Bust  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Opposition leaders voiced suspicion Tuesday
about the timing of President Alberto Fujimori's announcement that
his shadowy security adviser had broken a smuggling ring supplying
arms to Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made the announcement Monday alongside his reclusive
security chief Vladimiro Montesinos, who spoke publicly at a news
conference for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian officials said that an international ring, headed
by a retired Peruvian army lieutenant, used parachutes to drop at
least 10,000 Russian-made AKM rifles obtained in the Middle East
into rebel-held Colombian territory between March and July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Many Peruvians were fascinated as evening and morning newscasts
replayed Montesinos's televised appearance, belying his image as
the feared mastermind behind Fujimori's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   But top figures from three opposition parties, including
congressman Ernesto Gamarra and Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade, called
the timing of Montesinos' announcement suspect. And they expressed
skepticism that the arms scheme goes no higher than a retired
low-ranking Peruvian army officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I think it (the news conference) was staged by the
government to validate Montesinos' presence,'' opposition leader
Alejandro Toledo told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ''There's no
serious willingness to make the country more democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement took attention away from both demands for
Montesinos's ouster and negotiations on democratic reforms between
the government and Fujimori's opposition that started Monday. The
Organization of American States, a group of 34 Western Hemisphere
countries, has called for legal oversight of the National
Intelligence Service, among other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's critics say Montesinos has used his intelligence
service to infiltrate all branches of government on Fujimori's
behalf and to undercut political opposition with coercion, bribes,
and dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won an unprecedented third five-year term in May,
following a campaign marred by irregularities and accusations of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Fernando Tapias, head of Colombia's armed forces, said
Tuesday that his government had detected a parachute drop of
smuggled arms last year. He said that the arrests announced by
Montesinos and Fujimori resulted from a coordinated operation that
involved the Colombian, Jordanian and Peruvian intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos said weapons were carried on three flights over
Colombia's southern jungle and dropped to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Fujimori said Montesinos'
investigation stopped a fourth delivery, proving the security chief
was invaluable to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos conceded that the arms smuggling scheme could have
deeper implications for Fujimori's government, possibly reaching
into the higher ranks of Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must have been some element at a level that made it
possible,'' Montesinos said. A low-ranking officer and a former
soldier have been arrested in the case.

<HEADLINE> Report: Research Needed on Cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report suggesting the cleanup plan could be
flawed has delayed an operation to clear nuclear waste from a South
Carolina nuclear weapons site while the Department of Energy looks
into whether it is pursuing the safest and cheapest option.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the report, released Tuesday by the National Research
Council, the Savannah River Site project is stalled at least until
June. A committee of experts spent a year on the study after the
department asked for an independent review before moving forward
with the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The site, in Aiken, S.C., across the Savannah River from
Augusta, Ga., was established in 1950 to produce isotopes, mainly
plutonium and tritium, for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not discredit the department's selection of
potential cleanup plan but said: ''The screening procedure was
cumbersome, complex and lacked transparency to document the
(plan's) technical soundness.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional time and money necessary for more research would be a
pittance compared with the cost of building a $1 billion disposal
facility that wouldn't work, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   DOE officials said they weren't surprised by the report's
conclusions, in part because they had read an interim report last
October that foreshadowed such a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have technical uncertainty, you don't want to build a
plant to process something when you don't know exactly what you're
doing,'' said Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary for
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, liquid and solid wastes have been stored in some
48 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. Much of
the solid waste is being removed and transformed into glass,
eventually to be buried in an underground repository in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most radioactive waste, however, including cesium
and plutonium, still exist in the bottom of the tanks. Their high
salt concentration makes it almost impossible to transform them
into glass, and DOE officials have been struggling for years for a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, researchers thought they had one. They learned how to
separate the high-level radioactive waste in the storage tanks with
the help of two chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The cesium, plutonium and similar compounds would be cemented in
an onsite storage facility. Everything else would be made into
glass for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite successful tests, researchers were shocked when benzene
gas was released as they tried to implement the plan. That sent
them back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern was you could build up a lot of benzene, have a
spark and blow the top right off the tank,'' said Kevin Crowley,
one of the study directors for the National Research Council. ''You
could release that waste right into the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the experiment fell flat, Savannah River
officials proposed using a similar process involving smaller tanks
to limit how much benzene might leak. DOE asked the council for a
second opinion on the process.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report said more research is needed to determine
whether the process is safe. It also said DOE again should review
three other disposal plans.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Levenson, a retired chemical engineer who served as
chairman of the review panel, said the latest delay poses no
immediate danger because the tanks holding the waste should be safe
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   He denied feeling any pressure to hasten the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I would hope would be a factor is that we would make
most of our decisions based on risk reduction, not political
perceptions,'' Levenson said. ''The tanks certainly need to be
cleaned up as quickly as possible, but that has different
connotations.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Ray Paid Contractors $742K  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray has paid
contractors nearly $742,000 since taking over the investigation of
President Clinton eight months ago, including $210,777 for private
investigators, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Totaling more than $52 million, the Clinton probe is the most
expensive independent counsel inquiry ever. Ray, who is considering
whether to seek charges against Clinton after he leaves office,
recently confirmed that he empaneled a new grand jury last month to
resume investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office listed expenses for contract work at the request of
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who criticized Ray's predecessor,
Kenneth Starr, for spending so much on private investigators and
consultants despite using dozens of FBI and Justice Department
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''These millions and millions of dollars would have been better
spent on serious criminal investigations that could make a real
difference,'' Leahy said in a statement Tuesday. ''It is time for
the independent counsel to file his report, pack it up and go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to Leahy's request, Ray's office noted that it
spent $7,400 to gather information for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Responding to such detailed inquiries imposes costs and
diverts resources from completion of the investigations within the
office's jurisdictions,'' wrote deputy independent counsel Jay
Apperson. He expressed confidence the expenses ''were all
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The expenses listed by Ray and released by the General
Accounting Office cover the eight months from October 1999, when
Ray took over from Starr, through the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contractor payment was $445,429 to a computer
analysis company. Four criminal investigators received payments
ranging from $74,348 to $8,214. Ray spent $43,948 on legal
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Ray's office spent $741,961 on contract work over eight
months, said the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress. Starr spent
$4.9 million on private contractors during his five-year tenure as
independent counsel investigating the Lewinsky matter, Whitewater
and other controversies, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The office now employs 10 full-time and two part-time lawyers,
the report said. Ray, who's salary is set by law, makes $122,400.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's total spending is reported twice a
year, and those numbers haven't yet been updated to reflect Ray's
tenure. His office didn't immediately return a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over for Starr, Ray has closed an investigation
into the White House gathering of FBI files on several hundred
people in prior administrations. No one was prosecuted; Ray
concluded that none of the sensitive material had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   He also concluded an investigation of the firings of White House
travel office employees without bringing any charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ray got the go-ahead from a panel of federal
appellate judges to continue his investigation of the Lewinsky
matter for another year. At issue is whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstructed justice when he denied an affair in sworn
testimony for the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also continues work on missing White House e-mails that
should have been turned over to his office as part of the Lewinsky
investigation.

	   WESTFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - Police are awaiting autopsy results
following an Aug. 14 fistfight between 16-year-olds that left one

<HEADLINE> SEC clears Lazio in stock option probe  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A probe into lucrative stock option trading
by Rep. Rick Lazio, Hillary Rodham Clinton's Republican opponent in
New York's Senate race, ended Tuesday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission taking no action.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is to advise you that the above-captioned inquiry has
been terminated, and that no enforcement action has been
recommended to the commission,'' said a one-paragraph letter to
Lazio from Dorothy Heyl, a senior trial counsel with the SEC's
Northeast Regional Office in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased that this matter has been quickly settled,'' the
congressman from Long Island said in a statement issued by his
campaign office. ''I hope Mrs. Clinton will now join me in a
campaign about issues and finally abandon her tactics of personal
attacks and innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Dunn said, ''Hillary has been
running a campaign of issues and ideas for over a year. Now that
the SEC probe is over, maybe Congressman Lazio will come out of
hiding and begin defending his record.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC probe began in June, about the time New York state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat and supporter of Clinton's
candidacy, wrote to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. requesting the
commission look into news accounts of Lazio's stock option trading
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Records showed that Lazio spent about $2,300 in early August
1997 for options on stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a Long Island-based
brokerage firm. On Sept. 17, 1997, the firm was bought by the Fleet
Financial Group. Lazio sold his stock options that same day for
almost $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly, who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
had never discussed the company's stock or possible sale with the
congressman. Lazio denied any insider knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio announced the SEC was looking into his stock option
trading, his campaign and his supporters attacked the first lady
and the SEC for what they said was a politically motivated probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration has a long history of abusing
federal authority and using government bureaucracies to attack
their political opponents,'' Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col
said at the time. ''Today, they reached a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the members on the SEC were appointed by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The questions raised by Lazio's stock option profits did give
the Clinton campaign an opening to step up demands for the release
of his income tax returns. Lazio has said they will be made
available before the end of this month, but he has been dogged at
campaign stops recently by ''Tax Man,'' a Democratic operative
dressed up in an Uncle Sam outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has faced questions about her own financial
investments.
</P>
<P>
   She turned a $1,000 investment in the cattle futures market into
nearly $100,000 during a nine-month period in 1978 and 1979, when
her husband was attorney general and then governor of Arkansas. She
denied any wrongdoing in those transactions. She was assisted in
her trades by an executive of Tyson Foods, which had extensive
business before Arkansas state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first lady campaigned in Rochester where she
spoke to a group of women supporters and visited the home of
suffragette Susan B. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the opportunity to once again boost her abortion
rights credentials while questioning the congressman's. While Lazio
has said he is an abortion rights supporter, he is against Medicaid
funding to pay for poor women's abortions and has refused to join
Clinton in pledging not to support nominees for the U.S. Supreme
Court who are anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Clinton spoke at a Democratic dinner at a resort
in Alexandria Bay on the St. Lawrence River in an area that is
overwhelmingly Republican. The event drew a standing-room crowd of
more than 1,200. Money raised at the $25-a-person dinner was
divided among the Democratic parties in Lewis, Jefferson and St.
Lawrence counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never had so many people so excited about a candidate,''
said Steve Burke, the St. Lawrence County committee chairman. ''The
three counties have never done anything jointly, and we usually
only get maybe 200 or so out for a dinner. She's already
accomplished something here by uniting us.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 30-minute speech, Clinton stuck to her favorite issues
- the upstate economy, education and healthcare - as well as
offering anecdotes from her past visits to the area as she
continued to work to defuse the criticism that she is a
carpetbagger. She did not attack her GOP rival, Rick Lazio, and
made only a few references to him as ''my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a job interview,'' Clinton told her audience,
explaining why she was talking issues only. ''I'm here asking you
to hire me. It's a six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hire someone, you want to know what it is they are
going to do for you ... what are their priorities,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Three Neo-Nazis Face Murder Charges  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Three neo-Nazis charged with murdering an
African immigrant showed no remorse Tuesday on hearing accusations
that they kept kicking and beating their victim even after he
stopped moving.
</P>
<P>
   On trial for one of the worst attacks in a surge of neo-Nazi
violence this year, the young defendants freely admitted in a
closed court session causing the death, attorneys said. Their
motivation, prosecutors alleged, was hatred of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miethbauer and Christian Richter, both 16, and Enrico
Hilprecht, 24, are charged with murder in the June 11 attack on
Alberto Adriano, a Mozambican who lived for years in the eastern
city of Dessau with his German wife and their three sons, ages 8,
3, and 5 months.
</P>
<P>
   As federal prosecutor Joachim Lampe read the indictment, none of
the defendants showed emotion except Richter, who grinned at one
point. Miethbauer's stubbly hair and Hitler-style mustache were
clear signs of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are handling the case in a show of Germany's
determination to combat hate crimes that Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder says are casting a bad light on the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the accused testified in a Halle courtroom, authorities
reported a similar attack on an African man who was beaten and
kicked in Barmstedt, north of Hamburg in western Germany. The
victim suffered abrasions and bruises, police said. Three suspects
were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Nine skinheads between the ages of 16 and 21 were convicted
Tuesday in Bochum of shouting ''Heil Hitler!'' and molesting
foreigners on a bus last December. Three were given jail terms of
between eight and 10 months, three were ordered confined in a youth
home for four weeks and three were ordered to perform 100 to 150
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Though neo-Nazi violence is not limited to eastern Germany, the
area is fertile ground due to its post-communist economic collapse,
a lack of jobs and frustration at being virtually colonized by the
richer west when Germany united 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder began an unprecedented two-week tour of the region
Monday, hoping to get a better feel for its problems but also to
rally citizens against the neo-Nazi menace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Halle trial, prosecutors described a frighteningly random
attack set in motion when the two younger suspects and Hilprecht
met by chance at the Dessau train station, went drinking and came
across Adriano, 39, on his way home in a city park at 1:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The three shouted racist abuse at Adriano, then attacked. Lampe,
the prosecutor,said Hilprecht alone kicked Adriano 10 times in the
head with his jackboots, after the three had yelled slurs such as
''Blacks Out!''
</P>
<P>
   Lampe said Adriano's life was worthless to the attackers. ''The
accused accepted that Adriano could die from this use of
violence,'' he said in the indictment. ''They were indifferent
because of their hate of foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   After five minutes of beating when Adriano no longer moved, the
three stripped their victim to humiliate further, ripped off his
wristwatch and assaulted him again, not stopping until a police car
arrived. Even as he lay motionless, they shouted ''You Negro pig,
get out of our country!''
</P>
<P>
   Adriano, who came to East Germany from socialist Mozambique in
the 1980s and stayed after unification, died three days after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the two juveniles face a maximum sentence of 10
years, while Hilprecht, 24, could get life with parole possible
after 15 years. A verdict is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Adriano's widow, Angelika, sat across from the accused as
co-plaintiff. She skipped the afternoon testimony by witnesses
because listening to the defendants left her too distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was shocking for her and me was that there was not the
slightest sense of remorse, not one word of apology'' said Ronald
Reimann, the family's lawyer. ''I didn't get the impression that
they had too much feeling for what they did.''

   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Scottish judges hearing the
Lockerbie bombing trial called on the U.S. government Tuesday to

provided by a Libyan informant around the time of the 1988 airliner
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial resumed following a three-week summer recess,
lawyers for two Libyan defendants accused of bombing Pan Am Flight
103 insisted the information was indispensable to their case. The
explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people, including
189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ranald Sutherland said Scotland's chief prosecutor should
''use his best endeavors to ensure that all the material contained
in these cables be disclosed.'' However, he added, ''we
appreciate'' that the documents are in the hands of the CIA, over
which the court has no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, prosecutors insisted the information censored from the
cables was removed for reasons of U.S. national security and was
not relevant to the Lockerbie disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States considers all of this material highly
confidential,'' said Lord Advocate Colin Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said the deleted text referred to CIA agents real and code
names, as well as locations and methods of intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Majid Giaka, who has since defected to the United States
and is in the U.S. federal witness protection program, reportedly
saw one of the defendants place a suitcase containing the bomb on
an airport conveyor belt in Malta, where all three worked for
Libyan Arab Airlines allegedly as cover for their espionage
activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants sent the suitcase
bomb onto a flight from the Mediterranean island to Frankfurt,
Germany, where it was transferred as unaccompanied luggage onto a
feeder flight connecting with Flight 103 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka is considered the closest thing the prosecutors have to an
eyewitness who can directly link the defendants to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 cables, dated Aug. 10, 1988 to Aug. 31, 1989, were sent
to Washington by CIA operatives who interviewed Giaka. The Libyan
had walked into the U.S. Embassy in Malta in August 1988 -- four
months before the Lockerbie bombing -- and offered his services to
the CIA, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka is expected to take the stand this week as a key witness.
He has asked to be hidden from the court by screens and electronic
voice distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Taylor, a Scottish attorney for Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, showed the court copies of the documents as provided to
the defense. Large segments of text were blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expect to wrap up their evidence in September,
handing the floor to the defense lawyers, whose case is expected to
last several months as well. The trial began May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah face life in a Scottish
prison if convicted on charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and
violating the British Aviation Security Act in the downing of
Flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a man who lost his parents and sister in the plane
crash died after being struck by a train. British Transport Police
said Stephen Flannigan was walking home Sunday night in
southwestern England when he was hit. Tuesday was his 26th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and sister died when the main part of the jet
crashed down on their home. Another brother who was not in
Lockerbie at the time of the crash has since died.

<HEADLINE> Stuyvesant teacher sues three students for slander  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A teacher at Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School
has sued three former students for $6 million each, charging that
they falsely accused him of sexual misconduct because he gave them
low grades.
</P>
<P>
   John Joyce, 32, says in court papers filed late Monday in
Manhattan's State Supreme Court that the allegations caused him to
be removed as a social studies teacher on Sept. 22, 1999, and
assigned to a non-teaching job in the superintendent's office.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the news media reported that Joyce, a teacher at
the prestigious, highly ranked Stuyvesant for four years, had been
accused of sexual misconduct by two female students.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents say Joyce was ''totally shocked, distraught and
suicidal,'' leading him to seek help from a psychologist. The
papers also say the charges damaged his reputation and career.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's lawsuit asks $2 million in actual damages and $4
million punitive damages from each of the three students.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce has since returned to his teaching job at Stuyvesant.
Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said an
investigation found ''no substantial evidence to support the
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's tenured and he had the option of transferring, but he
elected to stay at (Stuyvesant),'' Feinberg said. She said a letter
of admonition was put in his file and he was cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce's papers quote one girl as saying she was ''tired of
having that pervert looking down my blouse.'' She also said she saw
Joyce reach to touch a girl's arm, ''pretend to slip,'' and touch
the girl's breast.
</P>
<P>
   The same girl also said Joyce ''is not a very good teacher and
often makes inappropriate comments such as, 'How is the Holocaust
like a big barbecue?' and 'Everybody knows that there are Jews and
Blacks in the KKK,''' Joyce's court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say the girl's accusations are false. The student
was angry that he ''gave her a final grade of 85 in European
History and was assigned to him again for American History,'' court
papers say.
</P>
<P>
   A second female student alleged that Joyce ''hovered around her
or stood near her and asked how she was doing,'' court papers say.
She is quoted as saying she ''frequently felt like crying after
leaving his class.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce's papers say she had ''received a failing grade (55) in
the Spring term.'' They say she ''plagiarized, with two students,
three homework assignments and cheated on her term essay with the
same students.''
</P>
<P>
   A male student supported the female students' accusations. Court
papers quote him saying Joyce ''has a habit of staring at the
female students.''
</P>
<P>
   But the male student ''was also unhappy with his final grade
from the previous year'' and was not pleased that Joyce kept him
from dominating every class discussion, Joyce's papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the students nor their parents could be found for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Woods Doesn't Use Balls He Endorses  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Tiger Woods endorses ''Nike Tour Accuracy''
golf balls in TV and magazine ads, but he really plays with
custom-made balls unavailable to everyday duffers, Nike
acknowledged Tuesday after being sued in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Inc. said the balls Woods uses for his monster swings that
produce 300-plus-yard drives have a slightly harder inner and outer
core than the balls sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those two elements are slightly firmer than the marketed
ball,'' Mike Kelly, marketing director for Nike Golf, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said it's common practice in the golfing world to sell the
public different products than what the pros really use.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an industry practice to make minor specification changes
to golf products: irons, putters and golf balls for tour players,''
Kelly said. ''Slight specification and modifications need to be
made to their equipment for their game.''
</P>
<P>
   But other leading names in golf say their customers get exactly
what their pros endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gomes, a spokesman for Titleist, of Fairhaven, Mass., said
its players use the same products they advertise. And if a player
uses a ''tweaked'' version of a club, he said, a consumer could
special order it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very particular about our advertisements. We don't make
any claims that cannot be substantiated in both golf balls and
clubs,'' Gomes said.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Golf of Carlsbad, Calif., said that if one of its golf
pros says he uses a certain club, that identical club is available
retail. Spokesman Larry Dorman did say, however, that in February,
one of its golf balls had a different number of dimples on it than
the ones its pros used.
</P>
<P>
   That occurred, he said, because Callaway was awaiting approval
of the new ball by the United States Golfing Association, so the
company's pros were briefly forbidden from using it in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used a prototype with a different number of dimples,''
Dorman said. ''As a result, for a very short period of time, there
was a little bit of a lapse from what was being marketed. We were
very up front about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return a call
requesting comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, a nonprofit group called Public Remedies Inc. claimed
Nike, based in Portland, Ore., was engaging in unfair business
practices. It asks that Nike's ''ill-gotten gains'' be restored to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger Woods does not play the Nike Tour Accuracy golf ball,
but instead plays one with a different composition and performance
characteristics specially made for him ... and not available to the
general public,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The group did not return repeated calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Woods officially switched to the Nike Tour Accuracy ball before
the U.S. Open, the first of his three major championships this
year. The move officially ended a marketing conflict between Woods'
top two golf sponsors -- Nike and Titleist -- that began last year
when Nike entered the ball market.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist argued that Nike was using Woods to promote golf balls
because of two commercials -- one that showed Woods bouncing a ball
off his wedge, and another that showed hackers on the range belting
300-yard drives as soon as Woods showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist contemplated a lawsuit, but instead reworked Woods'
deal so that he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in
tournaments. Titleist also gave up its right to have its logo on
his bag and to use Woods in advertisements.

<HEADLINE> Players Talking About Sosa's Blast  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Of the 210 home runs at Enron Field this season,
Sammy Sosa may have hit the most majestic.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was so neat about it was the fog by the lights,'' Chicago
Cubs teammate Jeff Huson said. ''It was like that shot from 'The
Natural.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's fifth-inning homer in Chicago's 5-4 loss to the Houston
Astros on Monday night clanked off a light tower and was estimated
at 457 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That figure immediately was questioned because the ball was
still rising when it hit the fixture beyond left field and bounced
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that ball went a foot, it went 550 feet,'' Astros left
fielder Lance Berkman said. ''There are a handful of guys who can
hit a ball 550 feet and he's one of them. I can guarantee you, it
was approaching that distance and it wasn't even on its way down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who leads the major leagues with 43 homers, didn't seem
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't look at it on replay, it was just another home run,''
he said. ''I knew I had good contact but I didn't know how good it
was. I didn't look going around. I put my head down and ran. I
respect the other team too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homer, the 102nd at Enron by an opposing player, came off
Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had a home run off me like that before and I hope I
never do again,'' Elarton said. ''Nothing has ever come close to
that, but it was enjoyable. I know the fans enjoyed it. We won the
game, so it was OK. There was a buzz in the stadium for 10 minutes
after he hit it. It was very weird. They just kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton said he usually doesn't watch homers he allows. He
watched this one.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just the way he swung and the way the ball came off the
bat,'' Elarton said. ''He had a perfect swing in a perfect
location. I thought it was a good pitch when it started. I wanted
it about belt high and in. It was belt high and right over the
plate. Perfect, for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron estimates are based on results from a survey crew that set
up at home plate and measured the stadium, then constructed a grid
from which estimates are made. That doesn't account for the
trajectory and how far the ball would have traveled.
</P>
<P>
   If the retractable roof had been open, the fixture wouldn't have
gotten in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything hit like that into the lights,''
center fielder Richard Hidalgo said. ''I saw it going up and I
couldn't believe it. I've seen a couple of guys, like (Mark)
McGwire and (Mike) Piazza, hit balls that far, but this was really
a sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Don Baylor thought a marker should be erected to
commemorate Sosa's homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so dramatic, they should put up a star like they did in
the Astrodome when Jimmy Wynn hit that one into the upper deck,''
Baylor said. ''Even when you try to do that it batting practice
it's hard but he did it in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enron roof is usually opened after the sixth inning, unless
it's raining or still too warm outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd kind of like to know where that ball would have landed
if the roof was open,'' Baylor said. ''I know it's something the
guys will be talking about for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Virginia Tech Flanker To Transfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Tech flanker Andrae Harrison, a
high school teammate of star quarterback Michael Vick who was
expected to become part of the 11th-ranked Hokies' passing game
this year, has decided to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a shame. He's really done well academically,''
coach Frank Beamer said Tuesday. ''It's just he decided that this
program wasn't the program for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer said he learned of Harrison's decision on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish him the very best. We hope it will work out good for
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear to which school Harrison planned to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison could not be reached for comment. His number in
Blacksburg is unlisted and a phone number listed for his mother in
Newport News was not in service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really disappointed Andrae has decided to leave. We've
known each other for a long time and we've been friends since high
school,'' Vick said. ''I'm a little hurt he didn't come and talk to
me. I wish he would've told me what was going on before he made his
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, a 6-foot-3, 209-pound redshirt freshman from Warwick
High School in Newport News, was third on Virginia Tech's depth
chart and expected to play this year.
</P>
<P>
   He had 127 catches for 2,604 yards and 25 touchdowns at Warwick,
where Vick was the quarterback. He also had a 50-yard reception in
the Hokies' spring game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too bad. He worked really hard,'' said Billy Hite,
assistant head coach and running backs coach. ''Sometimes guys just
want to do something different.''

<HEADLINE> Tex. Killer Executed by Injection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convicted murderer was killed by
injection Tuesday for abducting and fatally stabbing a woman and
then setting her body on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wayne Jones, 40, acknowledged burning Tammy Livingston,
27, but said he wasn't responsible for the 17 stab wounds that
killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the victim's family to know I didn't commit this
crime,'' Jones said while strapped to the death chamber gurney.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized prosecutors for convicting an innocent man,
saying, ''I hope you can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had a past that included theft, burglary and robbery
convictions and a parole violation that returned him to prison, was
on parole for about 4&AMP;frac12; months when he was arrested for killing
Livingston on Feb. 19, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters responding to a call about a grass fire discovered
her remains.
</P>
<P>
   Jones blamed the murder on his sister and her boyfriend who were
looking for money and drugs and said she came to him asking that he
help get rid of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the 30th Texas prisoner put to death this year.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Jet downed by explosion in fuel tank  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Despite all the fears and conspiracy theories,
the conclusion is ''inescapable'' that an explosion of vapors in a
fuel tank is what brought down TWA Flight 800 four years ago at a
loss of 230 lives, a top federal investigator concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators ''cannot be certain'' what ignited the blast, but
the most likely cause was an electrical short in wiring inside the
tank, said Bernard S. Loeb, aviation safety director of the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The physical evidence, he said, ''leads to the inescapable
conclusion'' that the plane was brought down by a fuel-air
explosion inside the center wing tank.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting wore on, Robert Swaim of the aviation engineering
section expressed the frustration of investigators seeking the
source of ignition. ''I would love to walk in here with a molten
piece of wire and say, 'Here it is,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said there was no evidence that metal fatigue, corrosion,
recent repairs of the plane, a bomb or a missile was involved in
the disaster off the coast of New York's Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   John Seaman of Albany, N. Y., who lost his 19-year-old niece
Michelle Becker of St. Petersburg, Fla., was at the hearing, along
with more than 75 relatives of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited four years for the truth,'' said Seaman. ''We wanted
an open, honest and scientific answer. I think that is what we
got.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The crash of Flight 800 graphically demonstrates that, even in
one of the safest transportation systems in the world, things can
go horribly wrong,'' said NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, opening the
two-day meeting to study investigators' reports on the crash and
its cause.
</P>
<P>
   At the session, teams of investigators set forth their findings
in detail, an effort to show that the agency has made every
possible effort to determine what happened and how it can be
prevented in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the center fuel tank came under suspicion early and the
agency has made several recommendations for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, in turn, has issued 37
directives to airlines and aircraft makers for improvements and is
working on other possible changes including introducing
nonflammable gas into partly full tanks and eliminating any
possible source of sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB findings, however well documented, are unlikely to be
accepted by dissenters with theories ranging from bombs to a Navy
missile to air turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend the government is trying to cover up the real
cause, and one group, calling itself the TWA 800 Eyewitness
Alliance, ran a full-page ad in Tuesday's Washington Times
insisting missiles brought the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   Those theories drew a rebuke from Hall, who said the FBI, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and his investigators all
failed to find evidence of a bomb or missile blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate that a small number of people, pursuing
their own agendas, have persisted in making unfounded charges of
government coverup in this investigation,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb and missile blasts leave distinct patterns, Loeb explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''High-energy explosions leave distinctive damage signatures
such as severe pitting, cratering, hot gas washing, and petaling.
No such damage was found on any portion of the recovered airplane
structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny traces of explosive discovered in the cabin were probably
left over from exercises testing bomb-sniffing dogs conducted on
the plane days before, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that our investigation confirmed that the
fuel-air vapor in the center wing tank was flammable at the time of
the accident, and that a fuel-air explosion with Jet A fuel was
more than capable of generating the pressure needed to break apart
the center wing tank and destroy the airplane,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747 crashed on July 17, 1996, shortly after taking
off from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York en route to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator James Wildey of the NTSB's materials laboratory
explained that the explosion originated in the huge fuel tank
located where the wing spars pass through the plane's center. The
tank was partly empty and air conditioners located beneath the tank
had given off heat, warming the fuel during a long wait for
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The initial blast shoved the front wall of the fuel tank against
the forward wing spar, knocking it down onto the bottom of the
nose. From there, Wildey said, cracks rapidly moved forward,
opening a hole in the bottom of the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Without that support, the nose bent down and came off the plane,
falling to the water, he explained. Relieved of that weight, the
rear of the plane first climbed, then rolled and plunged into the
ocean, breaking up as it fell.
</P>
<P>
   Wildey said his investigation found minor corrosion and a few
fatigue cracks in the 25-year-old plane but these were minor and
played no part in the crash. He said there was no evidence that
recent repairs to the plane structure were involved.

<HEADLINE> Padres 16, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Mike Hampton's broken rib hurt really left the
New York Mets hurting.
</P>
<P>
   With Hampton sidelined, Pat Mahomes was ripped by San Diego in
his spot start Tuesday, as Damian Jackson hit his first career
grand slam and Phil Nevin and John Mabry hit consecutive
second-deck homers in the Padres' 16-1 romp.
</P>
<P>
   The game was so out of hand that Mets right fielder Derek Bell
made his first career pitching appearance in the eighth inning. His
first pitch was clocked at 47 mph, and he wound up allowing five
runs on three hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing sunglasses and drawing chuckles from his teammates, Bell
did not even look in to catcher Todd Pratt for signs. Manager Bobby
Valentine made a trip to the mound during the inning, which
included a three-run double by Kory DeHaan.
</P>
<P>
   After Joe Vitiello flied out to end the inning, Bell pumped his
fist. The one-time Padres player received a standing ovation and
tipped his hat to the crowd as he walked into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had three hits, including an RBI double, and drove in a
career-high five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Adam Eaton (5-2) won his third straight decision. He also
drove in two runs with a double and a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego beat the Mets for the second straight game and
improved to 6-2 this year against them. The Padres have won four in
a row overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lead the wild-card race, lost two straight for the
first time since July 20-21. They had won eight straight series
before dropping this one to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton fractured a rib while batting against Colorado on
Thursday, so the Mets turned to Mahomes (4-2), who made just his
fifth start this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes gave up 10 runs on seven hits in four innings. It was
the most runs allowed by a Mets pitcher since Bobby Jones also gave
up 10 on June 25, 1997, against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes hurt himself with five walks, all in the second and
third innings. He issued three straight walks with two outs in the
second, including one to Eaton with the bases loaded to force in
Mabry with the first run. Jackson hit Mahomes' next pitch into the
seats in left field, the Padres' fourth grand slam this year, for a
5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes served up five more runs in the third. He walked leadoff
batter Ryan Klesko and Nevin hit a 411-foot homer into the second
deck in left, his 27th of the season. Mabry then hit a 415-foot
shot into the second deck in right, the first homer to land there
since the open end of the stadium was enclosed during a 10,000-seat
expansion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 32 years of baseball in the stadium
that consecutive homers have been hit into the second deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres weren't done against Mahomes, though, adding two more
runs on three straight doubles by Ruben Rivera, Wiki Gonzalez and
Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes lost as a starter for the first time since June 8, 1996,
when he was with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Erdos pitched three scoreless innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: IF-OF Matt Franco pitched twice for the Mets last year. The
only other position player to pitch for the Mets was infielder Bill
Pecota. ... Mets C Mike Piazza sat out the game with a swollen shin
suffered when he slid into Gonzalez Monday night and was tagged out
on an inning-ending double play. Piazza also has a bruised hip from
one of his two catches of foul pops Sunday in Los Angeles. ...
Eaton raised his average to .321, with three RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Nader Criticizes NAFTA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement on Tuesday as a
means for practicing ''toxic violence'' on the U.S.-Mexico border
and said the trade policy should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning across this city, Nader said the pact has led to
violence along the border, destroyed the environment and is harmful
to residents of the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get out of NAFTA and renegotiate trade agreements
with the countries involved,'' he said of the 1993 trade agreement
between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also dismissed claims that his candidacy will pull votes
from either GOP candidate George W. Bush or Democratic candidate Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''No candidate -- Al Gore, George W. Bush or myself -- is entitled
to votes, we all have to earn them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader cited the example of Jesse Ventura, a third-party
candidate with scant support in the polls who surprised the pundits
by being elected governor of Minnesota in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do you think, I'm running to lose?'' Nader added.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pitcher Wood Activated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs activated pitcher Kerry Wood
from the 15-day disabled list Tuesday night and started him against
the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Wood had been out since July 30 with a strained muscle in his
left rib cage. He missed the 1999 season after undergoing surgery
on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was 6-6 with a 5.16 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Don Baylor planned to carefully watch the 1998 NL
Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he gets six innings, that's good,'' Baylor said. ''I'd say
100 pitches is his cutoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs optioned infielder Jose Nieves to Triple-A Iowa. He was
hitting .215 in 67 games with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has pitched well against the Astros in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In his fifth major league start May 6, 1998, Wood struck a major
league record-tying 20 and pitched a one-hitter to beat Houston
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Wood returned from the disabled list this year on May 2 against
the Astros and beat them 11-1, allowing three hits and one run over
six innings.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Court Halts Man's Execution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday halted an
execution while it considers whether electrocution violates the
state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Williams, 32, was scheduled to die in Georgia's
electric chair Thursday night. He was 17 when he kidnapped
16-year-old Aleta Bunch from a mall, raped her, robbed her and shot
her to death in Augusta in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 5-2 order gave no reason for blocking the
execution, two justices cited the constitutional question. The
state's highest court is considering whether electrocution
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Williams' attorneys asked the state Board of
Pardons and Paroles to halt the execution on grounds that Williams
was only 17 when he committed the crime, is mentally ill and his
original lawyer was incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important reason Alexander Williams should not be
executed is that the crime of which he was convicted occurred when
he was a minor,'' attorney Harold T. Daniel said after the closed
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The board had planned another hearing for Wednesday to hear from
prosecutors, and possibly the victim's family, but postponed the
hearing after the court order.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature this year approved and the governor signed a law
requiring lethal injection for all people sentenced to death for
crimes after May 1.

<HEADLINE> More West Nile Spraying as infected birds are discovered citywide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - New areas of the city were scheduled to be
sprayed with pesticide on Tuesday after birds and mosquitos

</P>
<P>
   City health officials say that as of Tuesday, a total of 57
infected birds and 62 infected mosquito pools have been found in
the five boroughs. Two new species of mosquitos also have been

in northern Manhattan, including Washington Heights and Inwood and
Inwood Hill Park and Fort Tryon Park, between 10 p.m Thursday and 5
a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, spraying is scheduled for the north Bronx from
Marble Hill north to Riverdale along with the Kingsbridge section.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the East Bronx, including the Country Club and
Castle Hill sections and Ferry Point Park and St. Raymond's
Cemetery, are also scheduled to be sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticide spraying is also scheduled for all of Pelham Bay Park
and Orchard Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst areas of Brooklyn,
including Washington Cemetery, are scheduled to be sprayed Thursday
night.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Mourning Confident of Team  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning has a message for
his new teammates -- get ready to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new guys look good on paper,'' he said Tuesday. ''You
never know until we step on the court. We need them to digest our
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat coach and general manager Pat Riley has given the team a
major facelift the past two months, acquiring Eddie Jones and
Anthony Mason and getting ready to trade for Brian Grant. Mourning
hopes they are willing to play for a ''hard-working, no-nonsense
guy'' like Riley and help the Heat advance deep into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care about the regular season,'' Mourning said.
''Winning the Atlantic Division championship, defensive player of
the year -- that's all nice. But the playoffs is what I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost some good friends in P.J. (Brown) and Mash (Jamal
Mashburn) but the game is about change, especially with Riles down
here. It's going to be different, but I hope it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning is also confident often-injured point guard Tim
Hardaway will come back with a vengeance next season, saying
Hardaway ''has a different approach'' this offseason in his
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   But before the two begin another quest for that elusive NBA
title, they have some business to take care of at the Olympics in
Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''To know you have the opportunity to represent your country in
the first Olympics of the millennium, I am excited,'' Mourning
said. ''I want to win a gold medal with my son there watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning also weighed in on the rival Knicks and the trade talk
surrounding his good friend Patrick Ewing, saying he ''has carried
the Knicks for 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where does the loyalty lie?'' he asked. ''That defines the
business. It's not about what you've done anymore.''

<HEADLINE> AWOL Army Officer Returns to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. Army reserve officer with access to
intelligence information returned home Tuesday, two weeks after he
alarmed the American military by going AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse turned up Monday at a youth hostel in
the desert town of Mitzpe Ramon. Mattysse has denied allegations by
an Israeli woman who claimed to be his girlfriend that he disclosed
sensitive documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a spy,'' Mattysse told reporters after leaving a
police station in central Israel late Monday. ''There's been many
things said about me which aren't true. I didn't give any
classified information to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said that Mattysse, who earlier this month
requested to emigrate to Israel, was not at any time in detention
and left the country voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was met at Newark International Airport in Newark, N.J.
, by two Department of Defense police officers, said Joseph Hanley,
a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in Atlanta. Mattysse
was to be taken to Fort Knox, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk,
urged Mattysse to return home, saying he would be treated very
fairly. ''I think that would be the best way to put an end to an
affair that really doesn't deserve this kind of publicity,'' Indyk
told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio as a full-time reserve
officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists in
intelligence work. Mattysse failed to report to duty on Aug. 8
after a vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group in San
Antonio earlier this year after an investigation began into his
wife's allegations that he had an extramarital affair.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Tourist Pedophiles Rising  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The number of tourists in Asia seeking
sex with children is on the rise, and more of the pedophiles are
Asians themselves, officials and experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper airfares, the opening of countries once closed because
of war or politics, and the advent of the Internet have provided
more opportunities for tourists looking for underage sex partners,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   While countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam have been well
known a destinations for such tourists, Thailand, the Philippines
and Sri Lanka are gaining similar reputations, said Christine
Beddoe of ECPAT, an organization that fights the sexual
exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no longer just the key destinations we knew about five
years ago,'' Beddoe said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, offenders are increasingly coming from within
Asia itself, particularly Taiwanese, Korean and Japanese tourists
and businessmen working abroad, Beddoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ECPAT organized a two-day workshop at U.N. regional headquarters
in Bangkok, Thailand, for representatives from tourism authorities,
tourism training institutes and the travel industry to discuss ways
to stop sex tourism and sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives came from Australia, Cambodia, China, India,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''With organizational support from the tourism industry we can
train people to report incidents of exploitation,'' Beddoe said,
noting that it is often tour guides, hotel staff and taxi drivers
who are approached by tourists looking for prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been made, child advocates said. Several European
airlines are now showing in-flight videos on preventing child sex
tourism, for example, and at least 23 countries have laws allowing
prosecution of their citizens at home for sex offenses with
children overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet bringing offenders to justice remains tricky because of
difficulties in compiling a court case using child witnesses, who
are often either poor or homeless, Beddoe said. A lack of political
will in governments and reluctance on the part of the tourist
industry is also hampering effective action, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many years ago there was not a problem with child sex tourism
in our country,'' said Rafael Relucio, chief of the Philippines
+tourist+ police. ''But that's because we were not aware of it.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Soccer Coach Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Prosecutors are examining the bank
records of Brazil national soccer team coach Wanderley Luxemburgo
as part of an investigation into charges of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations began in 1997 after a woman who identified
herself as a former aide to Luxemburgo testified she bought and
sold assets at auctions for Luxemburgo in her name, the Brazilian
soccer federation said Tuesday, responding to a report in the O Dia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Renata Carla Moura Alves, later filed a worker's
compensation law suit against Luxemburgo, claiming that he had
fired her after she testified against him, O Dia reported. The
court ruled in her favor after Luxemburgo failed to appear in
court, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The federation did not comment on the suit, but said the
investigation has had no affect on Luxemburgo's performance as
coach.

<HEADLINE> Wilson, Salinetti Share Honors  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- A car salesman who once was a
professional golfer and a collegian from Rhode Island shared medal
honors at the U.S. Amateur on Tuesday but the event lost one of its
most recognized faces when former champion Matt Kuchar didn't
advance to match play.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstated amateur Jeff Wilson, the medalist at the recent U.S.
Open, and Jim Salinetti of the University of Rhode Island topped
the field of 312 players by posting 4-under-par 137 totals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower and Upper courses at the famed Baltusrol Golf Course
yielded only seven sub-par rounds for 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McKnight, who lost the 1998 Amateur final to Hank Kuehne,
finished a stroke behind the leaders and one ahead of Lucas Glover
of Clemson, who shared the first-round lead with Wilson and David
Miller of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Georgia Tech All-America Bryce Molder, considered the
top player in the college ranks, Ricky Barnes of Arizona and James
Driscoll of Virginia were the only other players to break par with
1-under 140 totals.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to match play which starts Wednesday on the Upper
Course were James McLean of Australia and Luke Donald of England,
the last two NCAA champions, respectively, Andy Miller, the son of
NBC Sports golf analyst Johnny Miller, and Ben Curtis, who lost to
eventual winner David Gossett in the semifinals of last year's
Amateur. They were at 142.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 64 players made the cut at 5-over 146, marking the first
time there has not been a playoff for positions in match play since
the current format was started in 1979, the USGA said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, the 1997 Amateur champion, finished at 7-over 148 in
missing match play for the second straight year. He had a 1-over 71
on the Lower Course on Tuesday, but that wasn't good enough to
overcome his 77 on Monday that featured a triple-bogey 8 at No. 11
on the Upper Course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Amateur, like everybody says, is probably the hardest
event to win,'' said Kuchar, who rode a big smile and great
performances in the U.S. Open and the Masters to immense popularity
in golf circles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe in years to come, I will be able to say that with a
little more conviction,'' said Kuchar, who plans to work as an
investment banker before turning pro next year. ''I'll know better,
how tough it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a 37-year-old who mostly hits ball at a range because of
time constraints with work and two children limit his golfing,
stayed in front with an even-par 70 on the Lower Course. He had
three birdies and three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wanted to be the medalist when I started my round
today,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinetti, 22, a two-time winner of the New England Amateur,
shot a 2-under 68 on the 7,116-yard Lower Course, which has been
the site of four U.S. Opens since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Salinetti, who plans to turn pro in a month unless he wins the
Amateur, had four birdies and two bogeys in posting his second
straight sub-70 round. He reached match play last year but lost in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year I was too conservative in the second round,''
Salinetti said. ''I wanted to go out and be more aggressive
today.''
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, the first-round co-leader, also made the cut at
143.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Weibring, the son of PGA Tour player D.A. Weibring, was in
a group at 144 after shooting a second straight 72. His father was
his caddie. Jeff Curl, the son of Rod Curl, also made the cut at
141.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Marucci, the 1995 runner-up who was playing in his 23rd
Amateur, and 1993 Amateur champion John Harris missed the cut,
finishing at 149. Harris had a second-round 79.
</P>
<P>
   Also collapsing in the second round was Georgia Tech's Carlton
Forrester, who had an 80 after a 69 on the tougher Lower Course.
</P>
<P>
   Several sons of PGA pros also missed the cut, including Kevin
Stadler (147), Michael Beard (149), Kyle Coody (151) and Raymond
Floyd Jr. (155).

''It's given him something to really remember. The team's made him
feel so special and they've really done all they could to make him
feel like part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobs family arrived in Williamsport early Tuesday morning
after leaving Washington on his first-ever plane ride at 6 a.m. on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He got to visit the team, wish them good luck and give them all
high-fives before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The team repaid him, rallying from a 4-0 deficit to beat
Goffstown 6-4 on Dustin Corl's two-run homer in the bottom of the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Corl did after the game was autograph
the ball and give it to TJ.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think TJ was a big part of this game,'' Corl said, ''We
didn't want to lose this game because TJ had traveled all the way
across the country just to see us play.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave us the spirit to come back and work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the length of the flight and the fact that TJ won't be
fully recovered until the end of September, Laura Jacobs and his
doctors weren't sure that he could handle the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the stands with her sons, Laura said she thought she
made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a T-ball player himself, has served as the inspiration
for the Vancouver team all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The team became involved with TJ after his mother wrote the
squad a letter asking if they could possibly dedicate a game to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tom Peavey read the note to the team and asked player
Jay Ponciano what he thought of the idea. Ponciano suggested
dedicating the rest of the season to TJ.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Jacobs credits the team with giving TJ something to think
about while he recuperates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ponciano said TJ has taught him there's more to life
than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Being the inspiration for a team means media attention, however,
which is something TJ isn't familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's kind of shy and overwhelmed with everything,'' Ponciano
said. ''But I know he's happy.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Mull Calif. Power Plans  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KERR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- New proposals for helping San Diego
residents strapped by soaring electric bills surfaced Tuesday, with
the governor requesting federal aid and Assembly Republicans
suggesting refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis sent President Clinton a letter asking him to
provide energy assistance for low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republicans, meanwhile, proposed spending $300 million
to cover refunds for major power customers, including hospitals,
schools and businesses not covered by a state-ordered rate
rollback.
</P>
<P>
   They also asked the Democratic governor to call a special
session next month to pass legislation making it easier to build
power plants. The Legislature is scheduled to leave for the year
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation, approved by lawmakers four years ago, was supposed
to lower rates. Instead, increases in population and power use due
to the high-tech boom have caused power shortages, more than
doubling rates in San Diego County and southern Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is considering a measure that would force San Diego
Gas &AMP; Electric to scale back rates to those in effect June 1,
before the increases began. The bill, sponsored by two San Diego
Democrats, already has Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   Four of San Diego County's five supervisors roamed the Capitol
on Tuesday lobbying for the bill and telling lawmakers and
reporters that small businesses will be ruined unless approval
comes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state Public Utilities Commission ordered the
utility to cut rates for most San Diego residents, small businesses
and school districts who don't use more than 1,500 kilowatt hours a
month. The San Diego County supervisors said that was not enough.

<HEADLINE> More Armed Militiamen In E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Growing numbers of armed
anti-independence militiamen are infiltrating the new country of
East Timor, raising fears of more attacks, a U.N. peacekeeping
officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Col. Brynjar Nymo, a U.N. peacekeeping spokesman, said
frightened villagers reported seeing at least 10 militia gangs,
numbering about 120 fighters, active in East Timor after crossing
from Indonesian West Timor in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor, voted to
secede from Indonesia a year ago in a U.N.-sponsored ballot. The
vote triggered a destructive rampage by anti-independence militias
backed by Indonesia. Most of the violence ended after the arrival
of international forces, led by Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is administering East Timor during its
transition to full independence. Indonesia still holds West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes between pro-Indonesia groups and peacekeepers have
become more frequent recently and there is growing speculation that
sections of Indonesia's military have been arming and training the
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has complained repeatedly that militiamen are
using West Timor as a base for border incursions.
</P>
<P>
   Security in East Timor's capital, Dili, and along the border was
tightened ahead of the first anniversary of the independence ballot
Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Security was also beefed up for a meeting Monday in Dili of
independence leaders who were taking their first steps toward
self-rule and the end of the U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people fled last year's mayhem for refugee
camps in Indonesian West Timor. Most refugees have since returned
to East Timor, but about 80,000, mainly militiamen and their
families, remain in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Nymo, the U.N. spokesman, said there are concerns that some
militia groups are bent on more violence, but others might be
considering a peaceful return to their villages. One gang contacted
a local Roman Catholic priest who told U.N. civilian police that
the men wanted to return to East Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This a welcome twist,'' Nymo said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many militiamen had long heard false rumors of U.N.
atrocities in East Timor and wanted to see for themselves before
deciding whether to return.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor has inherited five centuries of neglect by Portugal,
the former colonial master, and 25 years of violent Indonesian rule
that brought at least 100,000 deaths.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Leader To Call For Truce  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A separatist rebel leader in India's
Kashmir region said Tuesday that efforts were being made to revive
peace talks and that his group would call a truce in the coming
weeks, a news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the principal guerrilla group in Kashmir
fighting to secede from India, had declared a unilateral cease-fire
last month saying it was ready to talk peace with the Indian
government.
</P>
<P>
   But the group ended the cease-fire two weeks later when New
Delhi refused to include Pakistan in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attempts are being made to resolve the deadlock between the
government and the militants,'' said Abdul Majid Dar, the group's
top commander, told the Current News Service. ''Hopefully within
the coming two months, again there will be a cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dar maintained that any talks would have to include
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only solution to the Kashmir problem is tripartite
talks,'' Dar said. ''Without the participation of Pakistan there is
no solution possible for the people of Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan but both countries
claim to the entire territory. India and Pakistan have fought two
of their three wars over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India has refused to talk to Pakistan, whom it accuses of arming
and funding the 11-year-old insurgency in Kashmir that has killed
25,000 people. Pakistan says it supports the Kashmiris but denies
providing material aid to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, India's Independence Day, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee reiterated his government's stand that India will not talk
to Pakistan until it stopped its support for what he called
cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, has taken responsibility for a series of
violent crimes in Kashmir, including a lethal car bombing in August
that killed 13 policemen and a photojournalist and injured 24
others.
</P>
<P>
   Dar said the Hezb-ul-Mujahideen had the interest of the people
of Kashmir at heart and that was why they were restarting the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''If bloodshed continues for 10 years, after that, parties will
have to come to the table to resolve the dispute. So it is better
to start today a meaningful dialogue.''

<HEADLINE> Little League W.S. Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Some families have a
baseball glove
that gets handed down from brother to brother. The Griffith family
passes down the experience of the Little League World Series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oldest brother Gwilym was a member of the 1994 Saudi Arabian
team while middle brother Eli came to the Series with the Saudis in
1996. Now it's youngest brother Chris' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the most fun I've had with this is having the little
argument at home with the three of them about who's best,'' Al
Griffith, the boys' father, said. ''I'm impartial. I told them I'd
take all three of them on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith managed Gwilym's team in '95 and is the Saudi Arabian
manager this year. He never managed Eli.
</P>
<P>
   Little League spokesman Lance Van Auken said he could not recall
three brothers playing in three separate Series before.
</P>
<P>
   JUST IN TIME: Ross Haggard proved he had the talent to be in
Williamsport when he tossed the eighth one-hitter in Series history
in Bellaire, Texas's 3-0 first-round win over Goffstown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old almost didn't get the chance to show off his
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Haggard broke his wrist in a snow boarding accident in the
spring. Since Little League rules say a player must play at least
half of the season in order to make the All-Star team there was
some trepidation that Haggard might not heal in time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Haggard, and Bellaire, the cast came off in time and
Haggard and his teammates earned a spot in Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
   AND HE WAS RIGHT: After beating Toronto 5-4 Tuesday morning,
Maracaibo, Venezuela manager Eduvino Quevedo was certain his team
was going to Thursday's International Pool final -- even though they
hadn't mathematically clinched.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 record, Maracaibo had to wait until Dhahran -- 0-1 at
the time -- lost one of its final two games against Tokyo or Toronto
before officially clinching the playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Technicalities, technicalities, Quevedo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be more impossible for (Dahran) to beat Japan
and Canada than it would to kill a donkey by pinching him,''
Quevedo said through interpreter Micah Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Dhahran wound up losing 9-0 to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   BASELINES: According to lifeguards, the teams from Toronto and
Goffstown, N.H. are the ones most often in the junior Olympic-sized
swimming pool made available to the players. ... Jeff Evans, a
coach for the Davenport, Iowa squad, let the players shave his head
when they arrived in Williamsport. ... The team from Toronto
traveled the shortest distance to Williamsport, just 230 miles,
while Tokyo's team has come the farthest, traveling 6,380 miles.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Secret Will Be Spoiled  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After East Coast television viewers learn who
the ''Survivor'' winner is Wednesday night, can the well-kept
secret hold for a few hours more until the rest of the country
tunes in?
</P>
<P>
   Not if some radio stations and Internet sites have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd probably tell. That's what we do,'' said a mischievous
Mark Thomas, assistant program director for Los Angeles station
KFI.
</P>
<P>
   But listeners will get fair warning if they want to avoid
knowing who claims the show's $1 million prize before ''Survivor''
airs in time zones outside the East. The two-hour finale is set for
8-10 p.m. EDT Wednesday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   At Denver station KOA, which is affiliated with CBS and ABC, a
disclaimer will precede any announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people react negatively to a party pooper,'' said
Jerry Bell, KOA's news director. ''If somebody's driving home we
wouldn't want to blow it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Overeager fans can go directly to the Internet. As soon as news
reports move with the winner's name, Yahoo! plans to post them. The
Denver Post Web site, among others, said it will put the
information up as soon as it's available.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is rushing to spill the beans. Los Angeles news
radio station KFWB plans restraint, said news director Crys Quimby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been ongoing for such a long time, I prefer not to spoil
it for anybody inadvertently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   KNX, a CBS station that will broadcast the ''Survivor'' town
hall meeting airing after the show, also plans to keep quiet.
''It's like tearing out the last page of a book and reading it. You
just don't do that,'' said KNX news director Robert Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Non-CBS TV stations are unlikely to make a big deal about the
show, which has been a summer hit for CBS. KNBC in Los Angeles said
whether it airs the result at all will be up to the producer of its
11 p.m. newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Though the series was filmed and the winner selected months ago,
the outcome has remained a secret. On Wednesday, the last four of
the 16 contestants stranded on a Malaysian island will be whittled
down to one.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are Kelly Wiglesworth, 23, a river guide from Las
Vegas; corporate trainer Richard Hatch, 39, of Newport, R.I.; Rudy
Boesch, 72, a retired Navy SEAL from Virginia Beach, Va., and truck
driver Susan Hawk, 38, of Palmyra, Wis.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Survivors Climb Mount Fuji  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- More than 200 U.S. and Japanese cancer patients
reached the summit of Japan's Mount Fuji on Tuesday, completing an
arduous climb aimed at inspiring themselves to overcome the
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The climb up the 12,460-foot mountain, Japan's tallest, was
proposed by Andrea Martin, founder of the Breast Cancer Fund, a San
Francisco-based non-profit organization, and Dr. Jinroh Itami, a
Japanese cancer specialist who endorses mountain climbing as a way
to motivate patients to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The climb, which began Monday, was the third for the Breast
Cancer Fund. In 1996, 17 patients climbed 23,000-foot Aconcagua in
Argentina, and five breast cancer survivors climbed Alaska's
20,400-foot Mount McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a breast cancer survivor, said the climb was also aimed
at bringing attention to the seriousness of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Each U.S. team member raised from $5,000 to $30,000 for
research, education, and patient support.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, some 30,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer
each year, Kimiko Goldberg, a patient and leader of a Japanese
support group, told reporters before the climb.

NTSB Rules on TWA 800 Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The conclusion is ''inescapable'' that an explosion of
vapors in a fuel tank is what brought down TWA Flight 800 four years ago at a
loss of 230 lives, a top federal investigator said today. Investigators ''cannot
be certain'' what ignited the blast, but the most likely cause was an electrical
short in wiring inside the tank, said Bernard S. Loeb, aviation safety director
of the National Transportation Safety Board. The physical evidence, he said,
''leads to the inescapable conclusion'' that the plane was brought down by a
fuel-air explosion inside the center wing tank.

Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Alone

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, citing strong productivity growth and
a moderating economy, decided today against boosting interest rates for a
seventh time in its campaign to fight inflation. While still warning about the
dangers that tight labor markets might spark inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and his colleagues included more upbeat language about the
economy in explaining their latest decision. It marked the second meeting at

Clinton: Welfare Rolls Declining

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare rolls are half what they were four years ago, and
the percentage of Americans on welfare is at its lowest level in 35 years,
President Clinton said on the anniversary of the passage of welfare reform. ''In
four short years, we have seen a new emphasis on work and responsibility, as
welfare recipients themselves have risen to the challenge and made welfare what
it was meant to be -- a second chance, not a way of life,'' said Clinton, who
has used each anniversary as an opportunity to trumpet the falling rolls. In a
report, the Clinton administration said all states have met the law's
requirements.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Veterans Chris Mims and John Avery, both first-round
draft
picks, were waived Tuesday as teams moved to solidify opening-day
rosters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mims, a Chicago Bears defensive lineman who was a first-round
pick of the San Diego Chargers in 1992, was injured most of camp
and missed an 11:30 a.m. practice Monday, reportedly because he
overslept.
</P>
<P>
   Mims, who also played for Washington, recorded 10 sacks as a
rookie and 42 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, a first-round pick by Miami in 1998, appears to have been
a victim of a numbers game in Denver's deep backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Avery rushed for 61 yards on 12 preseason carries. He rushed for
503 yards on 143 carries as a rookie for the Dolphins in 1998, but
had only 21 yards on five carries for the Broncos last season. He
caught four passes for 24 yards and returned seven kickoffs for 137
yards.
Chiefs:
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham, tight end Kirk McMullen, a rookie from
Pittsburgh, and wide receiver Wasswa Serwanga were among 12 players
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Joe Perez was placed on injured reserve after
injuring his knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs also cut receivers Scott Cloman, Brock McGrew and
Germaine Stringer; linebacker Jonathan Jackson; guard Eric King;
safety Percy King; fullback Charles Kirby; offensive tackle Josh
Rawlings, and defensive tackle Kevin Sluder.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Sean Bennett, the second-year halfback who the Giants hoped
would be a key part of their offense, will have season-ending
surgery on his right knee within a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who injured the same knee last year, was hurt early in
the exhibition opener against Chicago.
Bills:
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Joe Panos will miss at least the
season-opener against Tennessee after injuring the arch of his foot
in Buffalo's 31-27 win at St. Louis on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Panos, who missed the entire 1999 season with a neck injury,
worked himself back into the starting lineup until the most recent
setback.
</P>
<P>
   Also, running back Jonathan Linton sustained a rib injury
against the Rams and won't play in Thursday's preseason finale
against Philadelphia.
Eagles:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Greg Jefferson underwent surgery to repair the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who hurt his knee during practice Monday, started 41
games the past three years. A third-round draft pick in 1995, he
has 192 tackles, including 13&AMP;frac12; sacks, in 57 career games.
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Lamar Thomas, scheduled to start the opener in
place of O.J. McDuffie, will miss his second straight season with
an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Miami placed Thomas on injured reserve Tuesday, one day after he
fractured and dislocated his right hip against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins also made two trades, sending wide receiver Nate
Jacquet to San Diego for an undisclosed 2001 draft pick, and
acquiring wide receiver Jeff Ogden from Dallas for an undisclosed
2002 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Miami also placed McDuffie on the physically-unable-to-perform
list with a toe injury and waived eight others. McDuffie will miss
at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, defensive end Adewale Ogunleye was placed on
reserve with a non-football injury.
Colts:
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis got down to the NFL roster limit by trading punter
John Baker to Super Bowl champion St. Louis for an undisclosed
draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, an undrafted rookie from North Texas, had seven punts in
four exhibition games for a 43.6-yard average. His longest was a
56-yarder and his net punting average was 34.1.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams released punter Rick Tuten and linebacker Troy Pelshak
to get below the NFL roster limit and be able to acquire Baker.
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith was placed on the reserved-retired list
and could become an assistant coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left training camp a few weeks ago to decide whether to
call it a career after nine seasons. Being placed on this list
doesn't necessarily end his playing days, but becoming a coach
would.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Dallas released running back Michael Black.
Lions:
</P>
<P>
   Detroit claimed running back Ken Oxendine off waivers from
Atlanta on Tuesday and released 13 players to reach the 65-man
roster limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions also placed rookie running back Rueben Droughns and
cornerback Kevin Abrams on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine, a 230-pounder from Virginia Tech, is a third-year pro
who spent two seasons with the Falcons. He was a seventh-round
draft pick in 1998. In 21 NFL games, he rushed for 502 yards with a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The players released were: tight end Steve Brominski; cornerback
Andre Dixon; wide receivers Damien Dodson and Henry Douglas;
linebackers Scott Fields and Joe O'Neill; guards Paul Janus and
Jeremy Mankins; defensive tackle Sean Powell; defensive ends
Quinton Reese and Paul Spicer; running back Charlie Sanders, and
safety Ryan Stewart.
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   One day after releasing longtime kicker Doug Pelfrey, Cincinnati
cut punter Brad Costello on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Costello's release leaves the job to Daniel Pope, who punted for
Kansas City last year and was claimed off waivers in July. He
averaged 41.8 yards for the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also waived linebacker Ben Peterson and three
college free agents: fullback Ricky Brown, linebacker Alan
Buckwalter and defensive tackle Mike Willetts.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Charles Fisher, recovering from reconstructive knee
surgery, was placed on the physically-unable-to-perform list.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals claimed offensive tackle Kris Farris off waivers
from the Pittsburgh Steelers. Farris missed last season with a
broken foot.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Smith Fined by NFL  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith, cited in a
domestic-violence incident, received a $25,000 conditional fine
from the NFL that he will not have to pay if he adheres to the
terms of his two-year probation.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL ruling, announced Tuesday, was applauded by Broncos
coach Mike Shanahan as fair. Smith declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, arrested on Jan. 24 for suspicion of domestic violence,
pleaded guilty last month to one misdemeanor count of verbal abuse.
He was sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to attend
counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith requested a face-to-face meeting with NFL officials at his
disciplinary hearing in New York City on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Smith presented his version of the circumstances surrounding the
altercation with Jami Mourglia, the mother of his two children. He
also submitted documents that showed Mourglia recanted her claims
of physical assault and said the couple merely engaged in an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NFL's new personal-conduct policy, Smith could have
been fined, suspended or both.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has conditions that he has to meet,'' Shanahan said of the
NFL's decision. ''If he meets those conditions, the fine will be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''After evaluating the situation, I said initially I would have
been surprised if anything would be done. I knew the story. I can't
see how they could ever suspend somebody with what happened. I'm
just glad that he had a chance to go to the NFL and explain what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the league heard the circumstances, I think they felt
very similar to how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said Smith will inevitably, and perhaps unfairly, be
judged by this incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the nature of being in the limelight,'' he said.
''Those are the things that I talk about to our players all the
time. You get in a situation like that, regardless of whether
you're right or wrong, your name is in the paper and it's going to
come out negative. So I tell our players to try not to put
themselves in that situation if possible.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cos Sued Over WWII Slavery  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers pursuing reparations for World War II
atrocities sued two Japanese companies Tuesday on behalf of Chinese
people used as slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, names Mitsui and
Mitsubishi groups as companies that used slave laborers to produce
rubber, grain and coal during a period beginning in the 1930s and
continuing until the war ended in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''During their forced servitude in Japan, the Chinese workers
were tortured and starved,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Barry A. Fisher said Chinese children were sent to work
in coal mines, and victims were transported in ships and trains
under inhuman conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese citizens were herded like cattle into trains and
loaded into cargo ships,'' he said, adding that many died aboard
ships and their corpses were tossed overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Messages requesting comment were left on phone machines at a
Cypress office of Mitsubishi, and the New York headquarters of
Mitsui.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who was involved in reparation suits in Germany,
Switzerland and Austria, said the lawsuit seeks payment for labor
that was never compensated as well as damages. The suit asks for
the companies to turn over ''ill-gotten gains'' from that era.
</P>
<P>
   He said the lawsuit could involve hundreds of thousands of
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court under a law passed by
California last year that allows cases involving World War II slave
labor to be filed until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several filed recently against Japanese companies
alleging slave labor during the war.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Governor Signs Pesticide Law  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYOSSET, N.Y. (AP) -- Nicole Hudson was gardening outside her
Farmingville home when she spied a white cloud with a noxious odor
wafting over from her neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   As the mix of chemicals floated toward an open bedroom of her
house where her newborn slept, Hudson called over to the worker who
was clad in protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't worry about it lady, I'm done already,'' he yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   In horror, she raced upstairs to find her baby, who was crying.
The child was later treated for allergic reaction to a toxic
chemical. Hudson was told to destroy the baby's linens.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's story helped pass legislation aimed at protecting New
York residents against the possible harmful effects of pesticide
spraying by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows counties to require companies that use pesticides
to give at least a 48-hour warning to neighbors living within 150
feet of any spraying site. It also requires schools and day care
facilities to provide parents and staff with a notice before
pesticides are applied on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Counties will have to adopt legislation if they want to conform
to the new state law.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki on Monday signed the bill, which advocates
say is the nation's first law of its kind. The neighbor
notification law goes into effect March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every neighbor will now know to take in the wash, close the
windows, and not have the kids roll around in the yard,'' Pataki
said at the bill signing ceremony in the Willets Elementary school
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great victory for the health and safety of our
residents,'' Neal Lewis, head of the Nassau-Suffolk Neighborhood
Network, who first suggested the legislation after hearing Hudson's
story in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Notices must contain information regarding the date and location
of applications, as well as the name of the product being applied.
The law allows exemptions for more than 30 specific types of
pesticides with a low toxicity, such as boric acid and
horticultural oils, and for pesticide applications to cemeteries
and spot treatments of less than 9 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said at least seven states allow residents to register
with the state if they want to be notified about pesticide spraying
near their home. But New York will become the first to require
residents of adjacent properties to be warned ahead of time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this bill will set the standard for states
throughout the country,'' said State Sen. Carl Marcellino,
R-Plainview, who cosponsored the bill with Assemblyman Tom
DiNapoli, D-Thomaston.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Police Tear Down Shelters  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Under pressure to restore law and order,
Zimbabwe police Tuesday tore down shelters built by militants
squatting on some white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, militants have staked claims to land on more
than 1,600 white-owned farms in occupations defended by President
Robert Mugabe as justifiable against unfair ownership by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Police had ignored several court orders to evict the squatters,
but Tuesday for the first time, they destroyed scores of the
shelters and ordered more than 700 occupiers to evacuate farms on
the western and southern outskirts of the capital, Harare.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long the police action would continue or
whether it would be extended countrywide against the farm
occupations criticized as destroying the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo, who ordered the police
action Monday, told the official Zimbabwe news agency that police
would no longer tolerate lawlessness on farms and urban plots.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no interference with normal farming
activities. I expect all concerned to take note that anarchy and
all other similar negative attitudes shall be dealt with swiftly
and thoroughly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous orders by senior ministers for occupiers to vacate
private land -- one made by Vice President Joseph Msika when Mugabe
was at a summit in Cuba -- have been quickly revoked by Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Mugabe has come under increasing pressure
to restore law and order in farming districts -- backbone of
Zimbabwe's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The moves against the squatters began Monday when police drove
about 100 squatters off a farm near Chitungwiza, 15 miles south of
Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, militants on that farm were accused of
abducting and sexually molesting 17 farm workers' children.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday also arrested 13 militants who threw up
roadblocks and halted traffic on a main highway into Harare from
northeastern Zimbabwe, police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Commercial Farmers Union, representing some 4,000
white farmers, were locked in meetings at their Harare headquarters
Tuesday and were unavailable for comment on the police moves.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced this month it would confiscate 3,000
white owned properties without paying compensation and hand them
over to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 whites own a third of the nation's prime land --
about 24 million acres -- where about 2 million farm workers and
their relatives live. Some 7.5 million people live on the other
two-thirds.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Back on Fund-Raising Tour  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Democratic convention over,
the handoff to Al Gore complete, President Clinton went back to
what he has done most of this year and clearly enjoys -- raising big
bucks for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''America has to be thinking about this election for us to
prevail; you can't sleepwalk through it,'' Clinton said at a
fund-raising dinner at the home of Internet entrepreneur Bill
O'Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the whole shooting match, folks,'' he said. ''We have the
chance to build the future of our dreams for our children. We can't
sleepwalk through it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a pair of fund-raisers here and in nearby Bingham Farms,
Clinton racked up a reported $825,000 for Democratic congressional
candidates with the feature spot going to Rep. Debbie Stabenow,
D-Mich. who is challenging one-term Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham
in one of the nation's hottest Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, speaking under a white tent next to a turreted white
house in Bingham Farms, Clinton told Michigan Democrats who had
plunked down $1,000 a couple to attend that their money was well
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Electing Democrats, he said, ''helps people who can't go to
fund-raisers like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plugged hard for Stabenow, who is trailing Abraham in
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want her to win. She can win and she should win if all of
you do what you can to help her,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also pitched for Gore and his vice presidential
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., for whom Michigan's
18 electoral votes are important.
</P>
<P>
   ''My party has a new leader and I thought he did a magnificent
job at the convention Thursday night,'' Clinton said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He took a jab at the tax-cut plan being pushed Gore's Republican
rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked too hard to get this country out of a ditch and
we have worked too hard to get rid of the deficit,'' he said. ''So
don't give all the surplus away in a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issues that matter to the largest numbers of average
Americans, Clinton said, ''You've got to vote for Debbie -- and Al
and Joe.''

<HEADLINE> AWOL U.S. intelligence officer returns to United States  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) - A U.S. Army reserve officer with access to
intelligence information returned home Tuesday, two weeks after he
alarmed the American military by going AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse turned up Monday at a youth hostel in
the desert town of Mitzpe Ramon. Mattysse has denied allegations by
an Israeli woman who claimed to be his girlfriend that he disclosed
sensitive documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a spy,'' Mattysse told reporters after leaving a
police station in central Israel late Monday. ''There's been many
things said about me which aren't true. I didn't give any
classified information to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said that Mattysse, who earlier this month
requested to emigrate to Israel, was not at any time in detention
and left the country voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was met at Newark International Airport in Newark,
N.J., by two Department of Defense police officers, said Joseph
Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in Atlanta.
Mattysse was to be taken to Fort Knox, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk,
urged Mattysse to return home, saying he would be treated very
fairly. ''I think that would be the best way to put an end to an
affair that really doesn't deserve this kind of publicity,'' Indyk
told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio as a full-time reserve
officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists in
intelligence work. Mattysse failed to report to duty on Aug. 8
after a vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group in San
Antonio earlier this year after an investigation began into his
wife's allegations that he had an extramarital affair.

<HEADLINE> 1.3M Acres of Montana Land Closed  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A federal agency closed an additional 1.3
million acres of its land in Montana on Tuesday to protect against
the danger of western wildifires that have scorched an area the
size of New Hampshire this year.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Bureau of Land Management came as Forest Service
spokesman Ed Nesselroad said that agency was preparing to shut more
of its land as well.
</P>
<P>
   Closures ordered last week covered 6 million to 8 million acres
of state, federal, tribal and private land in western Montana, the
area hit hardest by wildfires. The latest shutdown extends to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   ''With extreme fire conditions and limited firefighting
resources, we want to provide for public safety and minimize the
possibility of new fires,'' said Mat Millenbach, the Montana
director of the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's decision is likely to further rankle outdoor
enthusiasts who have seen the amount of land available for hiking,
camping and fishing shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize the hardship this places on recreationists,
outfitters and guides and other forest and public-land users,''
Millenbach said. ''However, the situation is extreme and
precautionary measures are needed to prevent further public safety
concerns and natural resource impacts.''
</P>
<P>
   The land will not be open to the public for activities such as
hiking, camping or fishing, mainstays of summer recreation in
Montana, but the bureau order allowed exceptions for specified
campgrounds and recreation areas. People still can cross the
federal land for access to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said Tuesday that
79 fires were burning on 1.4 million acres in Arizona, California,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said wildfires have burned 5.7 million acres this
year, or about 8,900 square miles, approximately the land size of
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Montana had 29 large fires on 613,000 acres, the
fire center reported. More than a third of the blackened land lay
in the Bitterroot Valley of southwestern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since Montana's fire season began, the burning has
disrupted major industries such as tourism and agriculture, drawn
thousands of firefighters and sent smoke miles from the flames. On
Tuesday, haze from Montana fires hung over Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot is considering a recommendation to keep people
off of state land in 16 counties from Wyoming to the Canadian
border. The governor shut access to state and private land in nine
western Montana counties last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, officials worried about losing help as many college
students fighting fires return to class. Twenty-seven large fires
were burning on almost 629,000 acres in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing probably half our force right now,'' said Keith
Hackbarth, a crew boss for the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, firefighters made progress on a blaze that closed a
major route into Yellowstone National Park for four days.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which was 20 percent contained, was just south of the
Yellowstone's southern boundary but was not an immediate threat to
move into the park, said Les Wadzinski, fire information officer
with the Forest Service.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chechen Cop Wins Parliament Seat  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- A retired police general won elections for
a Russian parliament seat from breakaway Chechnya, officials
announced Tuesday, in a vote criticized by human rights groups for
taking place while the republic is still at war.
</P>
<P>
   Aslanbek Aslakhanov won 30.3 percent of the vote in Sunday's
elections, said Chechen Election Committee Chairman Abdul-Kerim
Arsakhanov. He beat 12 other candidates, including Adam Deniyev,
who finished second with 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vote counting was delayed at many polling stations because of
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the vote is a sign of peace returning to
Chechnya. Elections for the lower house of parliament were held in
the rest of Russia in December, when intense fighting in Chechnya
made it impossible to hold a local ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups criticized the elections because parts
of Chechnya are still in rebel hands, and most areas controlled by
Russian forces are not safe. The U.S. State Department also said
conditions were less than ideal, since international observers did
not take part and the conflict has not been settled.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was 62.1 percent, Arsakhanov said, though rebel fighters
boycotted the vote and Chechen observers at polling stations in the
capital Grozny said the figure was probably lower.
</P>
<P>
   Aslakhanov, an ethnic Chechen who was a police major general
during the Soviet era, now heads Chechnya's Association of Law
Enforcement Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, military operations continued. Russian officials
claimed Tuesday to have captured a senior rebel commander who led
the defense of Grozny before it fell to federal troops in February.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, the Federal Security Service said it had
arrested Lechi Islamov, a prominent rebel leader accused of murder,
kidnapping and extortion. A criminal case has been opened against
him, the release said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have said in recent weeks that they would focus on
capturing rebel leaders rather than just skirmishing with rebel
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, an official with the pro-Russian Chechen
government said Interior Ministry troops were ambushed by rebels
overnight, and that there were casualties on both sides. No
casualty figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a
1994-96 war, then moved back in last September in a bid to end the
republic's de facto independence and quash what the Kremlin called
a breeding ground for terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Helton Won't Get Much Rest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies manager Buddy Bell will give Todd
Helton every opportunity in his quest to hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said Tuesday that Helton probably will get only one or two
days off in Colorado's final 36 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't expect him to be happy if I decided he wasn't going
to play because he didn't hit this guy or that guy very good. He's
hit everybody,'' Bell said. ''I think he has a better chance to hit
.400 playing every day. Every time he goes up there he has a chance
to get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who has missed just two games this year, entered
Tuesday's game against the Atlanta Braves hitting .398. He is
seeking to become the first player to break the .400 barrier since
Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had 185 hits in 456 at-bats when he accomplished the
feat. Helton began the night with 178 hits in 447 at-bats and
already had enough plate appearances (534) to qualify for the
batting title.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Yellowstone Hot Spring  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- A park concession
employee died Tuesday after falling into a 178-degree hot spring
and two others were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Hulphers, of Oroville, Wash., died about 15 hours after the
accident late Monday. The 20-year-old woman died from complications
from very severe burns, said Chris Nelson, spokesman for University
of Utah's Intermountain Burn Center in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in the Lower Geyser Basin near Old
Faithful, roughly in the middle of the park.
</P>
<P>
   According to park spokeswoman Cheryl Matthews, the three were
returning from a swim in the Firehole River when friends heard
their cries between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday. They fell into
Cavern Spring, a 178-degree pool about 10 feet deep, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three were trying to navigate the geyser basin in the dark
hours after sunset and before the moon rose, said park spokeswoman
Marsha Karle. Rangers spoke with park concession employees and
determined alcohol likely was not a factor in the accident, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's hot springs are often surrounded by thin, fragile
crusts and numerous warning signs are posted. Visitors to the Lower
Geyser Basin are urged to stay on a half-mile boardwalk over the
treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not venture off this boardwalk. You couldn't pay me
enough to set foot off this,'' said Carla Wilson, of Denver, who
was visiting Yellowstone with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Hulphers had third-degree burns over her entire body. Tyler
Montague, 18, had second- and third-degree burns over 97 percent of
his body, and Lance Buchi, 18, had third-degree burns over 90
percent of his body, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said some of the friends stayed with Hulphers while
others helped Montague and Buchi walk to their cars about a quarter
of a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty remarkable that they walked these two young men
out, which took some time because they were pretty hurt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   All three worked in the Old Faithful area; Hulphers in the Old
Faithful Inn employee dining room, Buchi in housekeeping at the inn
and Tyler at the Old Faithful Lodge kitchen.

<HEADLINE> Girl dies during sailing program at Old Greenwich Yacht Club  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - A 9-year-old girl died Tuesday while
participating in a sailing program with the Old Greenwich Yacht
Club in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they are not sure if the girl drown, or if something
else led to her death.
</P>
<P>
   She was in the water just before noon, practicing uprighting a
14-foot sailboat, when a member of the yacht club staff noticed she
was not moving, police said. Yacht club staff immediately began
lifesaving efforts, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was taken to a nearby dock at the south end of
Greenwich Point where paramedics tried to revive her. She was
transported to Stamford Hospital and pronounced dead just after 3
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was not released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were treating the death as a boating accident,
pending the outcome of an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was one of 13 children, all between 9-and-11-years old,
participating in the junior sailing program operated by the
Longshore Sailing School at the yacht club. The children were under
the supervision of certified instructors, police said.

<HEADLINE> Angels 11, Red Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Kent Mercker earned his first victory since
missing 80 games with a brain hemorrhage, leading the Anaheim
Angels to an 11-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker (1-2) left his May 12 start after 30 pitches with a
severe headache and dizziness and was later diagnosed with a
cerebral hemorrhage. He was hospitalized for 12 days -- four of them
in intensive care -- and didn't move into the rotation until Aug.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker struggled through six innings, allowing four runs on
nine hits and four walks, striking out two. Troy Glaus had three of
Anaheim's six doubles, and Orlando Palmeiro went 4-for-5 with a
career-high three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield (6-8) allowed eight runs on nine hits and two
walks in 4 1-3 innings. He has not won in seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro doubled and scored in the first, then singled in two
runs in Anaheim's three-run second. Boston scored one in the third
and three in the fourth to tie it before Anaheim chased Wakefield
in a six-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson all
singled to score one run, and Glaus doubled to drive in two more.
Hipolito Pichardo relieved Wakefield and got Bengie Molina to
ground out, then he walked Adam Kennedy and gave up an RBI double
to Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy scored on a wild pitch before Palmeiro doubled to drive
in a sixth run and make it 10-4. Anaheim added another run when
Glaus doubled and scored in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Angels had lost nine of their previous 12 on the road.
... Salmon needs two homers for the Angels to become the first AL
team in baseball history with four players with 30 or more homers.
Glaus had 36, Anderson had 31 and Vaughn had 30. ... Darin Erstad,
who leads the AL with 189 hits, missed his third consecutive game
with muscles spasms in his left rib cage. ... The Angels protested
Monday night's game, in which the umpires made two bad calls.
General manager Bill Stoneman said the protest was filed Tuesday.
... Anaheim acquired LHP Scott Karl and cash from the Colorado
Rockies. ... Rico Brogna was not in the starting lineup for the
seventh consecutive game. He is hitting .182 (4-for-22) in 12 games
with Boston. ... Brian Daubach's last 14 RBIs have been at home.
... Nomar Garciaparra is in a 4-for-26 slump, his worst of the
season. ... Ramon Martinez will make a rehab start for Triple-A
Pawtucket on Friday in Buffalo. ... LHP Pete Schourek made a rehab
start for Pawtucket Tuesday night, allowing one hit and one walk
while striking out one in three scoreless innings. ... Troy O'Leary
had two doubles. ... Anderson had three hits.

<HEADLINE> Lottery To Choose Reform Candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- While opposing Reform Party factions fight
over who is the party's true presidential nominee, Secretary of
State Mike Cooney will use a lottery to settle the issue for
Montana's general election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing will be conducted Thursday to determine whether Pat
Buchanan or John Hagelin will be listed as the Reform Party
candidate for the Nov. 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney said that process is dictated by state law when a party's
choice of nominee is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion was caused when Reform Party groups backing
Buchanan and Hagelin each submitted certificates of nomination to
place their candidate on Montana's ballot. Both factions claim to
represent the party and consider their choice the legitimate
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Party chairman Gerald Moan filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal
court in Virginia to prevent Hagelin from claiming to be the
party's proper nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney said his office would have to abide by any court order
regarding the party nominee, regardless of the outcome of
Thursday's lottery.

<HEADLINE> Davey Johnson Doesn't Miss a Beat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dodgers manager Davey Johnson came to the
ballpark with his left shoulder in bandages following arthroscopic
surgery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Jobe, the Dodgers' team physician, operated on Johnson
for almost two hours at Centinela Hospital Medical Center to repair
his labrum, which is the cartilage rim of the socket. Jobe removed
a large spur that was cutting into Johnson's rotator cuff and also
took off the end of his clavicle, where the spur was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad that's over, but it was something I needed to have
done because it was getting worse and worse,'' Johnson sad. ''The
last few weeks have been kind of painful, but thank goodness for
Dr. Jobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who began feeling pain Aug. 8, thought he may have
injured himself working out in the weight room. But he couldn't be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't hit any water coolers or any concrete things, so I
know it wasn't that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 57, arrived at Dodger Stadium about 90 minutes before
game time. He already had made out Tuesday's lineup after Monday
night's 4-1 loss to Montreal and gave it to bench coach Jim Tracy,
who managed the Dodgers to a 3-1 record last month while Johnson
was hospitalized because of an irregular heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a tough one,'' Jobe said. ''I had the same operation
about six weeks ago, and I couldn't have come down here and managed
the same day. He had substantial surgery, but he's doing extremely
well.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Yankees 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro hit a tiebreaking homer in the
eighth inning after Tim Crabtree got out of a bases-loaded jam to
give the Texas Rangers a rare win at Yankee Stadium, 5-4 over New
York on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted a 4-0 lead and appeared to be on the way to
their 32nd loss in their 40 games in New York when the Yankees
loaded the bases with two outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree (2-6) relieved Rick Helling and fell behind Derek Jeter
3-1 before striking him out on a high fastball. Crabtree pumped his
fist as he left the mound, having kept the Rangers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who went 3-for-4 with two RBIs, then put them back
ahead leading off the eighth. On a 2-0 pitch from Denny Neagle
(3-4), Palmeiro hit a high fly to right field that drifted about
three rows into the stands. It was Palmeiro's 32nd homer of the
season and 393rd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had been just 12-40 against New York since winning
the first game of their 1996 playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Helling took advantage early of a Yankees' lineup missing Bernie
Williams and David Justice, out with minor injuries. The
right-hander retired 17 straight batters after Luis Polonia led off
the first with a double.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the sixth, Polonia homered to right field, his
first since joining the Yankees on Aug. 3, to make it 4-1. After
Jeter walked, O'Neill lined his 15th homer into the right-field
seats to cut Texas' lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez doubled and scored on Luis Sojo's double in the
seventh to tie the game. But Crabtree kept it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro pitched a scoreless eighth and John Wetteland went
the ninth for his 27th save in 35 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who hadn't allowed a first-inning run since June 21 when
he was still with Cincinnati, was touched for four in the first
against Texas. Luis Alicea led off with a double and went to third
on Rusty Greer's single to left.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Palmeiro lined an RBI single that got by Clay
Bellinger -- making his fourth career start in center -- for a
two-base error allowing Greer to score and Palmeiro to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler added an RBI double, and former Yankee Ricky Ledee
had an RBI single to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle settled down after that, allowing only two hits until
Palmeiro's homer in the eighth. Neagle, who has lost four of five
starts, allowed five runs and eight hits in seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Helling gave up four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jorge Posada was 0-for-4 with four strikeouts. ... Neagle
hadn't allowed four runs in the first since May 19, 1999, in a
24-12 win for Cincinnati at Colorado. ... Kapler, who went 2-for-4,
had been in a 4-for-21 slump since his 28-game hitting streak ended
last Wednesday. ... Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre returned
from cancer treatment to join the team. 3B coach Willie Randolph
missed the game with a broken rib. Chris Chambliss coached third in
his place. ... Williams missed his fourth straight game since
feeling a twinge in his rib cage Saturday. Justice missed his
second straight game with a sore neck.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Trade Austin to Grizzlies  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Michael Jordan's first trade as a front
office executive, the Washington Wizards on Tuesday sent
disgruntled center Ike Austin to the Vancouver Grizzlies for four
players: Dennis Scott, Cherokee Parks, Obinna Ekezie and Felipe
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives the salary cap-strapped Wizards a needed jolt of
new blood, while it rids them of a seven-year veteran who wanted
out after losing his starting job to Jahidi White last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are acquiring three quality young players with a proven
veteran scorer,'' said Jordan, who became the Wizards president of
basketball operations in January. ''And Ike Austin gets a new
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade comes 12 months after the Wizards gave up four players
-- Terry Davis, Tim Legler, Jeff McInnis and Ben Wallace -- to get
Austin from Orlando. But Austin sat on the bench for most of the
second half of the season and asked to be traded. He played in 59
games, averaging 6.7 points and 4.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gives us a very big body. He played for Chuck Daly (in
Orlando). Chuck was very instrumental in setting up this trade,''
Grizzlies president Dick Versace said. ''Michael and I did the
deal, but Chuck was the one who brokered the deal, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Versace didn't seem worried about Austin's poor second half to
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very impressed with his commitment to rededicate -- those
are his words -- rededicate himself to being the kind of player that
he once was,'' Versace said. ''He's only 31 years old. He's got a
lot of basketball left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a native of nearby Hagerstown, Md., is one of the most
prolific 3-point shooters in NBA history, but is coming off a
career-worst 5.6 points average last season with the Grizzlies. He
made an NBA-record 267 3-pointers with Orlando in 1995-96,
including a record 11 in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, a forward-center who was the 12th overall pick by Dallas
in 1995, has never averaged in double figures. He averaged 3.0
points with the Grizzlies last season.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, a guard, was a first-round draft pick by San Antonio in
1998. He was traded on draft day to Vancouver, where he averaged
9.3 points as a rookie and 4.5 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ekezie, a forward, was a second-round draft pick from Maryland
last season. He averaged 3.2 points in 39 games.

NTSB: Fuel Tank Caused TWA Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The conclusion is ''inescapable'' that an explosion of
vapors in a fuel tank is what brought down TWA Flight 800 four years ago at a
loss of 230 lives, a top federal investigator said today. Bernard S. Loeb,
aviation safety director of the National Transportation Safety Board said
investigators ''cannot be certain'' what ignited the blast, but the most likely
cause was an electrical short in wiring inside the tank. The physical evidence,
he said, ''leads to the inescapable conclusion'' that the plane was brought down
by a fuel-air explosion inside the center wing tank.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. was doubled up for the final
out after right fielder Dante Bichette's error let in the go-ahead
run in the ninth inning Tuesday night, and the Philadelphia
Phillies rallied to beat the Cincinnati Reds 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu and Scott Rolen hit two-run homers as the Phillies
got only their second win in nine games. They overcoming Alex
Ochoa's first-inning grand slam, the record-setting 142nd in the
major leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who wasn't feeling well, slept in the trainer's room
during batting practice, but was in the lineup and went 2-for-4,
extending his hitting streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
   After the Phillies went ahead in the top of the ninth, Griffey
singled with one out in the bottom half and Bichette hit a soft
foul pop to first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who was running on the 3-2 pitch, wasn't able to get
back in time and he was easily doubled up.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Luebbers (0-2) put the Phillies in position to pull it out
by giving up Pat Burrell's single leading off the ninth. Marlon
Anderson was safe at first on a sacrifice attempt when third
baseman Chris Stynes double-clutched and threw too late to get him.
</P>
<P>
   After a sacrifice by Tomas Perez, a hard-charging Bichette
dropped Kevin Jordan's shallow fly to right, letting in an unearned
run. Bichette also hit into three of Cincinnati's four double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla (3-3) pitched two perfect innings and Jeff
Brantley got three outs for his 19th save in 23 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds went up 4-0 in the first on their second grand slam in
two games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey singled with two outs to start the rally. Bruce Chen
then walked Bichette and Dmitri Young, who hit an upper-deck homer
in the third inning Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, hitless in his last 14 at-bats, connected on an 0-2 pitch
for his first career grand slam. The Reds hadn't hit slams in
consecutive games since May 4-5, 1996, when Eric Davis had a pair
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies tied it with a pair of homers in the third, Rob
Bell's only bad inning out of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Perez singled with one out for Philadelphia's first hit and
Abreu hit his 18th homer with two outs. Doug Glanville followed
with a double that extended his hitting streak to nine games, and
Rolen hit the first pitch for his 22nd homer, tying it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bell gave up six hits in seven innings, four of them in the one
big inning. Chen lasted six innings, giving up only three more hits
after the Reds' four-run first.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies turned a season-high four double plays, giving them
seven in two games, and got the play of the game from third baseman
Scott Rolen in the second. He dove toward the line to grab Juan
Castro's grounder in the second and threw to first from his right
knee, making a one-hop through to get the out.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen made three other tough plays to take hits away from the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Abreu batted leadoff for the third consecutive game and
went 1-for-4. Abreu, who had never batted first in his career, is
4-for-10 with six walks atop the order. ... The Phillies have
turned a double play in 11 of their last 12 games. ... Kasey
McKeon, son of Reds manager Jack McKeon, was promoted from
scout/cross checker to director of scouting. ... The Reds have five
grand slams this season -- two by Griffey, one each by Dante
Bichette, Young and Ochoa. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers, bothered by a
sore stomach, had tests at a hospital Tuesday that came back
normal. ... RHP Osvaldo Fernandez will have an MRI on his sore
right shoulder Wednesday. The initial diagnosis is tendinitis. ...
C Eddie Taubensee, disabled by a bulging disc in his back, will
have another injection Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> The Debate Over Debates Is On  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Participants call it an exercise in
frustration, bluffing, conniving, outright bickering and unintended
hilarity. They fight over the pickiest details, like what the
audience should wear.
</P>
<P>
   Few debates in the long presidential campaign season are as
intense as the ones leading up to the debates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even people in chicken outfits get into the act. A flock of
costumed fowl tailed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's father, President
Bush, around the country in 1992 until he agreed to debate Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-debate debate is in full cry again now, with Al Gore
accepting invitations by the dozen, Bush languidly concluding
''three is plenty'' and both sides bidding for public relations
advantage from the mere process of deciding when and how the two
men will meet.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over TV debates have been guided by one principle
from the start, says Alan Schroeder, an authority on the subject:
''Never give an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered to meet Gore three times and have running mates
Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman do so twice. The record for
presidential debates on TV is four, set by John Kennedy and Richard
Nixon in 1960. None was held again until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not committed to recommendations of the Commission on
Presidential Debates for three presidential matchups and one
between running mates, all in October. The Gore campaign accused
Bush of shopping around for a format that fewer people would watch,
like the Sunday morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unprecedented in modern times for a major party
candidate to try to stiff the prime-time commission debates,''
charged Gore, a more experienced debater. The Bush campaign pointed
out that President Clinton and Bob Dole only had two debates in
1996 despite the commission's recommendation for three.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, whose book ''Presidential Debates: Forty Years of
High-Risk TV'' is coming out next month, says Bush has been
following the classic pattern of front-runners who play hard to get
or insist on the most favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   With polls suggesting the race has tightened, he said, it is
questionable how much longer the Republican candidate can do that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he doesn't believe Democrat Gore wants to
debate nearly as often as he says he does.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some hubris involved in Gore accepting so many
invitations,'' he said. ''He has this pattern of proposing a lot of
debates as a means of seeming open.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman William Daley talked briefly with his
Bush counterpart, Don Evans, on Monday, and asked Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman and former Fannie Mae chairman Jim Johnson to help
with debate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said Tuesday no direct negotiations with Gore
operatives were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and Andy Card, who
was chairman of the party's national convention, will talk with the
more than 40 organizations that have offered to sponsor debates,
said Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Debates in a competitive presidential contest can draw audiences
rivaling those for anything on TV except the Super Bowl. With so
many people watching, details matter.
</P>
<P>
   In what was later regarded as a masterstroke, Clinton told aides
in 1992 to try to get the Bush campaign to go along with a
town-hall format, which he had used to good effect in the
primaries, for one of his three debates with George Bush and Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember thinking, Bush will never go for that,'' said Paul
Begala, a Clinton strategist from that campaign. When he did, ''we
were amazed.'' Bush's people said later they thought their man was
good, too, with small groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But in that Richmond, Va., debate, citizen Marisa Hall asked
Bush how the national debt affected him personally and he flubbed
the answer. ''God bless him,'' Begala recalls saying when that
happened.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush was seen checking his watch twice during the
debate. His campaign's polling showed that a recent rise in his
support stalled after that night.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore and Gov. Bush are seen as fairly evenly
matched in the pre-debate debate negotiations, unlike many other
campaigns where a candidate lagging in polls and almost desperate
to debate was ultimately forced to accept his opponent's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis, six inches shorter than George Bush, got little
in his 1988 negotiations except a ramp to make him higher at the
lectern, said Schroeder, who teaches journalism at Northeastern
University in Boston. Dole's people dropped the idea of an audience
dress code in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hanna, a producer of 1980 debates, spoke of the
''frustration and hilarity'' in watching operatives for Ronald
Reagan and Jimmy Carter haggle over every nuance. Carter's press
secretary, Jody Powell, called the process one of ''bluff and
counterbluff, scheming, conniving.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Grand Slam Record Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Alex Ochoa hit the 142nd grand slam of the
season Tuesday night, setting a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds outfielder hit his first career slam in the
first inning against Philadelphia's Bruce Chen, the Reds' second
slam in two nights. Dmitri Young hit an upper-deck grand slam in a
7-4 win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who lost 5-4, hadn't hit grand slams in consecutive
games since May 4-5, 1996, when Eric Davis had a pair. They have
five overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   The record was tied earlier Tuesday in San Diego when the
Padres' Damian Jackson hit No. 141.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson connected in the second inning off Pat Mahomes for his
first career slam, San Diego's fourth of the season, in a 16-1 win
over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record of 141 slams was set in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Gov. Extends Gas Tax Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The governor is continuing his suspension of
the sales tax on gasoline even though Indiana's gas prices are the
lowest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank O'Bannon suspended the 5 percent tax on June 27 to
help drivers cope with prices that had skyrocketed to among the
highest in the country. The suspension was set to expire Saturday,
but O'Bannon said he wants residents to enjoy the extra savings
through the Labor Day weekend, when supply and demand often drives
prices up.
</P>
<P>
   If gas supplies and prices remain at their current level,
O'Bannon said he would lift the suspension Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   O'Bannon's Republican opponents say he is spending down the
state surplus while using the tax suspension to bolster his
November re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had the nation's lowest average cost for gasoline on
Tuesday, with drivers paying an average of $1.31, down from $1.69
in July, AAA reported.

<HEADLINE> Schourek Begins Rehab Assignment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I (AP) -- Boston Red Sox left-hander Pete Schourek
began a 30-day rehab assignment at Triple A Pawtucket on Monday
night, allowing one hit over three innings in a 2-1 victory over
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek has been on the disabled list since July 21 with a
frayed left rotator cuff and bone chips in his left elbow. He was
2-9 with a 5.05 ERA in 19 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest and restrengthening, without having to throw a lot at
game speed, really helped,'' Schourek said. ''I didn't pick up a
ball for 10 or 11 days. I just concentrated on resting and getting
my shoulder and elbow strong again.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, 31, was on a 50-pitch limit. He wound up throwing 45
pitches, 25 for strikes, and allowed only a third-inning double by
Sean Mulligan and a walk. He struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy with the way I felt and with the way I threw,''
Schourek said. ''I felt a little rusty in the first inning, and a
little anxious. I haven't been on the mound in a game situation in
a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek expects to return to Boston, but doesn't want to rush
his rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably throw another rehab game somewhere,'' he said.
''If everything goes well, I can increase my pitch count.
Certainly, 45 pitches isn't an absolute true test. When I get it up
to 90, 100 pitches with no problem, then I've got something to be
excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I reach that point, I assume I'll be activated when they
expand rosters (on Sept. 1).''

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer and Tony
Batista followed with his 36th home run as the Toronto Blue Jays
rallied in the eighth inning to defeat the Kansas City Royals 7-5
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Dan Reichert took a 5-3 lead into the eighth. He
was pulled after issuing a leadoff walk to David Martinez and
giving up a single to Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (6-4) relieved and gave up Fullmer's 26th homer.
Batista then connected for an insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar (8-13) got two outs for the win. Billy Koch
pitched a perfect ninth for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert, who hasn't lost since July 15, allowed five runs --
three earned -- on eight hits in seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon drew a leadoff walk from Mark Guthrie in the
seventh and stole second. Mike Sweeney's RBI single put the Royals
ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took advantage of two errors to score three unearned
runs. Delgado made a wild throw from first base that gave Kansas
City a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After shortstop Alex Gonzalez botched a ground ball with two
outs in the Royals first, Joe Randa hit a two-run double. Jermaine
Dye's RBI single gave Kansas City a 3-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto came back in the fourth on Delgado's RBI single and
Fullmer's run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays tied it at 3 in the fifth when Sweeney, the first
baseman, failed to catch Reichert's throw for an error, allowing
Jose Cruz Jr. to score.
Notes: Martinez has hit in 13 straight games since being acquired
from Texas on Aug. 5. ... Damon went 0-for-4. He began the night as
the top hitter in the majors since the All-Star break, batting .449
(75-for-167) in 38 games.

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners snapped their eight-game
losing streak as Mike Cameron hit a tiebreaking, two-run double in
the eighth inning and Alex Rodriguez hit a three-run homer in the
ninth to defeat Detroit 8-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's skid was its worst since a club-record 14 consecutive
losses in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The AL West-leading Mariners also ended a string of allowing at
least nine runs in seven straight games. That tied the major league
record set by the 1901 New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit scored once in the ninth, and nearly tied it when Dean
Palmer flied out to the warning track with the bases loaded to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's leadoff single in the eighth finished Tigers
starter Jeff Weaver (8-11).
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson got Rodriguez to hit into a force play, but
Edgar Martinez singled. After Al Martin grounded out, Cameron
doubled down the left-field line for a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two-out walks to Rickey Henderson and Olerud set up Rodriguez's
31st homer off Matt Anderson in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua (2-0) worked 1 2-3 innings for the win. He escaped
a two-on, two-out jam in the seventh when Juan Gonzalez flied out
to deep center.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki got two outs for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson homered for the Tigers, who failed for the
second time in three days to reach .500 for the first time since
they were 1-1. Detroit lost for the only the second time in nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver gave up four runs on six hits in seven-plus innings.
Weaver, who won at Seattle in his last start, has lost his last
four home decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter Freddy Garcia allowed three runs on five hits in
6 2-3 innings. The Tigers turned two of his five walks into runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead in the second when he hit a
two-out single, stole second and scored when Carlos Guillen's hard
liner glanced off the glove of first baseman Palmer, who tried to
make a jumping catch, for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia walked Palmer and Damion Easley to start the home half
and Deivi Cruz hit an RBI single. Easley scored on a wild pitch to
put the Tigers up 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez tied it with a sacrifice fly in the third after
Henderson walked and Olerud singled. Higginson led off the home
half with his 24th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive two-out doubles by Joe Oliver and Mark McLemore in
the fourth tied it again. Oliver hit a routine fly to left that
dropped when Higginson lost it in the lights.
Notes: The Tigers are 15-5 when Higginson homers. ... Gonzalez was
0-for-4, snapping his season-high 13-game hitting streak. ...
Henderson stole a base in the ninth inning. The swipe at Comerica
Park gave him steals in 42 different stadiums in his major league
career.

<HEADLINE> Britain Re-Arrests Belfast Militant  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Police re-arrested notorious
militant Johnny ''Mad Dog'' Adair Tuesday night as Britain moved to
suppress rising violence among the province's pro-British gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped Adair's car in Belfast, ordered him at gunpoint
onto the ground and handcuffed him. He was transferred by
helicopter to Northern Ireland's Maghaberry prison under the orders
of Britain's minister responsible for the province, Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   The re-arrest came 11 months after Adair, 36, was paroled from
prison under terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord -- and a
day after two Protestant militants were gunned down in a vicious
feud involving Adair.
</P>
<P>
   ''My priority is public safety, and I cannot give freedom to an
individual intent on abusing it,'' said Mandelson, who retains
control over security affairs in Northern Ireland despite the
recent formation of a local Catholic-Protestant administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson took the decision after consulting commanders of
Northern Ireland's police force and British army garrison, who
credited Adair with playing a central role in recent violence. The
peace accord granted Mandelson the power to order paroled
terrorists back to jail, to serve the outstanding portions of their
sentences, if they became reinvolved in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''A man who, with his associates, has been inciting so much
violence in recent days has been removed,'' Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in armored cars and full riot gear flooded the area
around Adair's house in the hard-line Shankill district while
detectives conducted a detailed search of the property. Angry
crowds gathered but didn't try to attack the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   British authorities had come under mounting pressure to
reimprison Adair, a senior figure in the outlawed Ulster Defense
Association, following Monday's fatal shootings, which were blamed
on a rival band of outlaws called the Ulster Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
   One of those slain was a close associate of Adair, and the UDA
vowed immediate revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Several homes belonging to UVF supporters were attacked late
Monday and early Tuesday. The wave of intimidation caused no
casualties but spurred more than two dozen families to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   While mainstream Catholic and Protestant leaders welcomed
Mandelson's move against Adair, politicians linked to both the UDA
and UVF warned it would spur more violence.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, instantly recognizable with his bodybuilder's physique
and shaved head, played a prominent role in recent months in
stoking UDA confrontation with the UVF. Last weekend, clashes broke
out between rival groups when Adair led a UDA parade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Adair received a 16-year sentence after being convicted
of the unprecedented charge of ''directing terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the Good Friday accord, the bulk of convicted
terrorists from the Irish Republican Army and loyalist groups were
allowed gradually to walk free. Adair was paroled in September
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 1994 arrest, Adair boasted of his responsibility for
slaying scores of Catholic civilians.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Inquiry Report Released  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special prosecutor tasked to investigate
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt released her final report Tuesday,
explaining why she had previously found insufficient evidence to
prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stemmed from allegations that Babbitt rejected
a proposed Indian casino because of campaign contributions and then
lied to Congress about it.
</P>
<P>
   The report, over 600 pages long, was met with sharp words from
the chairman of the House committee Babbitt testified to, and
relief from Babbitt's office that the ordeal is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he
was disappointed at statements in the report that Babbitt conceded
to a grand jury that some of his sworn statements ''either were not
entirely accurate or at least constituted 'overstatement.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very disturbed that a cabinet official would come before
my committee and give false testimony,'' Burton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   To the grand jury, Babbitt described some of his testimony as
hyperbole, and occasionally was ''paraphrasing and summarizing and
overstating in an argumentative way'' to a hostile committee.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce, a veteran prosecutor who
was assigned the case in March 1998, said in October that she would
not seek indictments against Babbitt or anyone else involved in the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Bruce said she found ''no evidence that there was
a quid pro quo'' in the Indian casino decision, and was left with a
''marginal case of potential perjury,'' taking into account
Babbitt's awkward statements trying to play down how he deceived an
old friend -- who was also a lobbyist for the pro-casino tribes -- in
an attempt to get him out of Babbitt's office.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce noted that the friend, Paul Eckstein, and Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., would also attest to Babbitt's ''good character
and reputation for truthfulness'' in any potential perjury trial.
McCain was also involved in the affair, as Babbitt said his office
made some inaccurate statements in a letter to McCain, then later
called the senator to apologize for them.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involved interviews or grand jury testimony of
more than 450 people and 630,000 pages of documents, investigators
said. Bruce was expected to close the case when she submits a
lengthy report on her investigation to a special three-judge panel
of the U.S. Court of Appeals, possibly within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was one of five independent counsel investigations of
Clinton Cabinet officers besides Kenneth Starr's investigation of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel for
Babbitt in February 1998. A month later Bruce was given the case by
the special three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt complained he was being attacked for political reasons
and that the allegations already had been thoroughly aired at
hearings in both the Senate and House, and internally by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruce's conclusions were released in October, Babbitt said
he was ''gratified'' at the outcome. Babbitt's office said Tuesday
that the secretary is happy to put the issue behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just glad it's over,'' said spokesman Mike Gauldin.

<HEADLINE> Women Denied Heart Transplant  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A German hospital drew harsh criticism Tuesday for
admitting it denied a heart transplant to a Turkish resident
because she didn't speak German.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart and Diabetes Center of North Rhine-Westphalia said
denying the transplant for 56-year-old Fatma Elaldi was standard
procedure when a patient is unable to understand a doctor's
instructions or communicate with hospital staff after the
complicated surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue touches a nerve in Germany, coping with a wave
of anti-foreigner violence and always sensitive about how it deals
with its 2 million Turks, the largest minority group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic's decision was criticized by other medical groups in
Germany and government officials, as well as Turkish community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arguments of the clinic don't convince me,'' said Safter
Cinar, a board member of the Turkish Council of Berlin and
Brandenburg. ''I don't want to say racist, but it's a problematic
thing. Medicine has the obligation to care for the health of the
people and this cannot depend on German knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaldi, who has lived in the western city of Neuwied for 21
years, has suffered heart trouble since birth and received a
pacemaker last year. At the time, doctors told her she wouldn't be
able to survive long without a new heart. After five days of
examination at the clinic this year, specialists planned to place
her on the transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   But in February she was notified by letter that she wasn't a
candidate, citing her ''lack of knowledge of the language'' as one
of the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Bektas, who speaks German and had offered to serve
as a translator, called the decision ''insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaldi eventually was placed on a waiting list for a transplant
at a Muenster hospital, according to Dr. Yasar Bilgin, chairman of
the Turkish-German Medical Foundation. He also said language
knowledge wasn't a reason to deny a transplant -- citing German
patients who go to the United States for operations without
speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the medical center in the town of Bad
Oeynhausen, Petra Mellwig, stood by the decision Tuesday -- saying
the hospital has found that 50 percent of its patients without
sufficient language knowledge die soon after transplants. She said
two other hospitals in Germany also refused to operate on her.
</P>
<P>
   Mellwig stressed the doctors' decision had nothing to do with
Elaldi being a foreigner. She said drug or alcohol addicts are also
turned down as transplant candidates for the few available organs
because they are seen as risk cases in complying with medical
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   She said the offer from Elaldi's daughter to translate wasn't
enough. ''Are they there 24 hours a day caring for the patient?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital later said that, in light of the ''public
discussion,'' it would review its criteria to see whether
''possibilities can be found in similar cases that would lead to an
improvement in the chances of success.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 hearts are available each year for transplants in
Germany, but the demand is for more than twice that. About 20
percent of patients on waiting lists die before they are able to
receive the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, Birgit Fischer,
called Monday on the clinic to seek more practical solutions for
the problem rather than denying operations -- such as using
relatives to translate or Turkish-speaking doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every person has the right to adequate medical care. And we as
doctors have the duty to help,'' Alfred Moehrle, president of the
Hesse state doctors' association, said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Quake Shakes Japan Volcanic Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook a chain of volcanic
islands south of Tokyo early Wednesday, but no injuries or damage
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor was part of a series of quakes that rattled the area
a day after a volcano again spewed ash on one of the largest of the
Izu islands, about 120 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 6:21 a.m. and was
centered six miles under the ocean floor near the islands of
Niijima and Kozushima in the Izu chain, Japan's Meteorological
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake caused buildings to sway, but no damage or injuries
were reported, said Katsuhiro Ishida, a town official on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   The Izu chain has been shaken by thousands of quakes since Mt.
Oyama, a 2,686-foot volcano on Miyake island, awoke from a 17-year
slumber July 9.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mount Oyama again spewed ash more than a thousand
feet into the air, forcing the island's airport to close
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the volcano shot a cloud of ash five miles high, the
fifth and largest eruption since the mountain rumbled back to life.

	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two passengers on a United Airlines flight
from San Francisco to Newark were injured Tuesday night when the
plane hit turbulence about 25 minutes before it was scheduled to
land at about 10 p.m., officials said.

   The two passengers injured aboard the 757 were treated at the
airport for their injuries and were not transported to a hospital,
according to United spokesman Joe Hopkins. The spokesman did not
know the extent of their injuries. Police at the Port Authority of

<HEADLINE> Indians 14, Athletics 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- After weeks of slow-speed pursuit, the
Cleveland Indians passed Oakland in the AL wild-card race Tuesday
night as Manny Ramirez homered and drove in three runs in a 14-6
rout of the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, trying to make it to the postseason for the sixth
straight year, won their fourth in a row by chasing Gil Heredia
(13-9) early.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has won 13 of 18 and now leads the wild-card chase by
one-half game over the banged up A's -- who have dropped four of
five -- and the Boston Red Sox, who lost to Anaheim 11-4.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, Oakland had a 5&AMP;frac12;-game lead over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar and Jim Thome added three RBIs apiece for the
Indians, who have scored 45 runs in their last four games and
gotten a little revenge on the A's, who swept them last week in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley (10-9) straightened himself out after two shaky
innings to win for the first time since July 25. The left-hander
allowed three runs and seven hits for his first win over the A's
since July 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia had his worst outing of 2000, lasting a season-low three
innings. He gave up six runs and eight hits and dropped to 9-2 on
the road this year.
</P>
<P>
   He left trailing 7-2, but the Indians didn't let up against Omar
Olivares, scoring four runs in the fourth, two in the fifth and one
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's 26th homer got the Indians started in the second when
they scored five runs off Heredia, whose throwing error on a
botched pickoff play typified Oakland's night.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman had a run-scoring single, David Segui hit an RBI
double and Alomar's sacrifice fly put the Indians up 4-2. After
Omar Vizquel singled with one out, Heredia went to a full count on
Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   With Ramirez due up, Heredia may have been distracted when he
wheeled and threw toward first with first baseman Mike Stanley
nowhere near the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero scored on the error to make it 5-2, and Heredia only
got out of the inning when Ramirez lined to third with two on.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians added two more in the third on Sandy Alomar's
two-run single, and four more in the fourth thanks to two
bases-loaded walks by Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland grabbed a 2-0 lead in the second off Finley on Frank
Menechino's RBI double and Terrence Long's RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
   Finley pitched himself into and out of a jam in the first,
walking Adam Piatt with two outs to load the bases before striking
out Ben Grieve looking to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The A's were without starters Jason Giambi (strained
shoulder) and Randy Velarde (strained neck). ... Heredia's error
was the Athletics' major league-leading 112th. ... Finley, who has
now won at least 10 games eight straight years, is just 8-19 in 40
career outings vs. Oakland. ... Eric Byrnes, recalled from Triple-A
earlier in the day, singled in his first major league at-bat in the
second. The ball was quickly thrown into the A's dugout where
shortstop Miguel Tejada threatened to toss into the stands before
putting it aside. Byrnes finished 2-for-4.

last eight games. ... Gabe Kapler began Tuesday 4-for-21 following
his 28-game hitting streak. ... The Rangers have allowed 10 or more
runs in a game 21 times this season, tying a franchise record set
in 1998. By losing Monday, Texas also matched its loss total from a
year ago (67).
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre returned from cancer
treatment to join the team. He hopes to take the upcoming road trip
with the team but won't finish the season. 3B coach Willie Randolph
missed the game with a broken rib, sustained when he was hit during
batting practice last week. Chris Chambliss coached third in his
place. ... CF Bernie Williams missed his fourth straight game since

with 30 or more homers. Going into Tuesday's game, Troy Glaus had
36, Garret Anderson had 31 and Mo Vaughn had 30. ... Darin Erstad,
who leads the AL with 189 hits, missed his third consecutive game
with muscles spasms in his left rib cage. ... The Angels protested

General manager Bill Stoneman said the protest was filed Tuesday.
... Anaheim acquired LHP Scott Karl and cash from the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox led the major leagues with a 4.11 ERA. ...

Nomar Garciaparra is in a 4-for-23 slump, his worst stretch since
beginning the season 4-for-22. ... Ramon Martinez is to make a
rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday in Buffalo.
Mariners-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: OF Jay Buhner went on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to Aug. 17, because of a sprained right wrist. Buhner
hasn't played since the injury occurred Aug. 16 in a collision with
2B Mark McLemore against Detroit. Buhner has appeared in just 93
games this year, batting .262 with 22 homers and 73 RBIs. ... OF
Raul Ibanez, out since Aug. 7 with a strained right groin, was
activated from a rehab assignment to fill Buhner's roster spot. ...
McLemore, who has been bothered by headaches, was in the Mariners'
lineup Tuesday for the first time since the collision with Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark took early batting practice Tuesday and
is scheduled to continue the next two days. Clark, on the DL since
July 15 with a lumbar spine strain, may start a rehab trip Friday
to Triple-A Toledo. ... RHP Todd Jones' 35th save Monday tied him
with Florida's Antonio Alfonseca for the major league lead. Jones
entered Tuesday needing one save to tie to tie John Hiller (125)
for second on the Tigers' career list and three shy of Hiller's
club season-record 38. ... The Tigers entered Tuesday with a 15-4
record when OF Bobby Higginson homered.
Devil Rays-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: When the Devil Rays opened the season in Minnesota
against the Twins, only 11 of the 25 players on their current
roster were with the team ... During Monday night's Devil Rays win
at Chicago's Comiskey Park, Tampa Bay CF Gerald Williams became
just the 25th major leaguer to hit 20 or more home runs from the
leadoff spot. ... Tampa 2B Miguel Cairo, who didn't start Tuesday's
game, is leading the major leagues in hitting with runners in
scoring position with a .419 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: On Monday the Twins sent RHP Joe Mays to their
Triple-A affiliate in Salt Lake City, and called up RHP Jack
Cressend ... Minnesota INF Denny Hocking, who is one of only two
Twins batting better than .300, hit three doubles in a game earlier
this year versus Tampa Bay ... On Tuesday the Twins signed C Joey
Hamer, who was their 25th round pick in the 2000 free agent draft.
The Twins have now signed 27 of their 52 picks.
Royals-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: OF Johnny Damon has been the top hitter in the
majors since the All-Star break, batting .449 (75-for-167) in 38
games. ... OF Mark Quinn leads all AL rookies in average (.294)
homers (18) and RBI (59). ... 1B Mike Sweeney entered the game with
a career high 109 RBIs, marking the second straight year he passed
the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Toronto GM Gord Ash and manager Jim Fregosi met before
the game to discuss September callups. Fregosi said the Blue Jays
will call up no more than five players. Anymore, he said, would be
a distraction. ''They only allow so much time for batting practice
on the road,'' Fregosi said. ... It doesn't look as if 2B Homer
Bush will be activated from the 15-day disabled list in early
September. An X-ray showed that he still has a broken bone in his
left hand.
Athletics-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi was not in the starting lineup for the
fourth straight game because of a strained left shoulder. Manager
Art Howe said Giambi's shoulder was improving, and that he might be
able to pinch-hit if necessary. ... SS Randy Velarde missed his
fifth game in a row with a strained neck. Velarde was examined by
one of Cleveland's team doctors before Tuesday's game and was given
medication. The rash of injuries come at an inopportune time for
the A's, who began play Tuesday leading the AL wild card by
one-half game. ''You have to deal with it,'' Howe said. ''It's
refreshing to have young players coming up and it's kind of
interesting to see how they respond. In the long run it will help
us.'' ... Oakland entered with an league best 25-22 record against
the AL Central. Cleveland, five-time defending division champs, are
an AL worst 16-25 against the Central.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: LHP C.C. Sabathia, the top pitching prospect in the
Indians' organization, is a strong candidate to be picked for the
U.S. Olympic team, which will be announced Wednesday. The Indians
had considered recalling the 20-year-old in September, but were
leaning toward letting him go to Sydney for the experience. The
Olympic selection committee also inquired about Indians infielders
Russell Branyan and John McDonald as well as outfielder Dave
Roberts, who will all be brought up when rosters expand on Sept. 1.
... LHP Ricardo Rincon, who underwent elbow surgery in June, will
likely be activated in the next few days. Rincon has pitched pain
free after making two rehab appearances for Triple-A Buffalo. ''I'm
ready to go,'' he said before Tuesday's game. ... Dave Burba and
Omar Vizquel were among the Indians on stage for a benefit concert
Monday night that raised $25,000 for charity. Vizquel played drums
and sang lead on Ozzy Osbourne's ''Crazy Train'' while Burba sang
Van Halen's ''Ice Cream Man'' after arriving dressed as an ice
cream vendor. ''I was real nervous,'' Burba admitted. ''But it was
a blast.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Phillies-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Bobby Abreu batted leadoff for the third
consecutive game. Abreu, who had never batted first in his career,
went 3-for-6 with five walks in his first two games atop the order.
... Doug Glanville took an eight-game hitting streak into the game.
He had struck out only six times in his last 96 at-bats. ... Mike
Lieberthal had 23 RBIs in his last 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Kasey McKeon, son of manager Jack McKeon, was
promoted from scout/cross checker to director of scouting. McKeon
joined the Reds in 1998 after four years scouting for Cleveland.
... The Reds are on pace to shatter records for wild pitches.
They've thrown 82, one shy of the club record. The NL record is 91
by the 1970 Astros and 1989 Phillies. The AL record is 94 by the
1986 Rangers. ... Scott Sullivan had pitched in seven of the last
nine games.
Cubs-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Going 0-for-14 and getting hit in the back by a pitch
from Randy Johnson was enough for Cubs manager Don Baylor to decide
to give Mark Grace a rest. Grace was not in the starting lineup
Tuesday night. ''I just wanted to give him a mental break,'' Baylor
said. ''I know it's going to end but I'd rather do it today on the
road. Let's stop it now.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Watching Jeff Bagwell hit home runs has been one of the
few joys for Astros fans this season. Not in Bagwell's estimation.
''It's a very overrated stat,'' Bagwell said. ''My job is to drive
in runs and score runs. If I get a two-run homer or a two-run
single, it's fine with me. Run production is what I'm after not
home runs. Wins and losses are the only stat I really care about.''
Braves-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Tuesday's starter RHP John Burkett last threw a
complete game more than three years ago against Colorado on July 2,
1997. Burkett was 0-3 at Coors Field coming into the game. He had
an 8.51 ERA, giving up 23 runs in 24 1-3 innings. ... CF Andruw
Jones is the only major league player to play every inning of every
game this year. ... The Braves are 21-2 when 1B Andres Galarraga
hits a home run.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Manager Buddy Bell says he'll wait a couple days
before deciding whether to put C Brent Mayne on the disabled list.
Mayne missed his fifth straight start Tuesday due to a sprained
left wrist. ... Todd Hollandsworth started in place of the injured
OF Larry Walker, who went on the 15-day DL on Monday. ... The
Rockies traded LHP Scott Karl to the Anaheim Angels for a player to
be named. Karl came to Colorado from Milwaukee in a four team, nine
player trade in December. ... For the second straight day, general
manager Dan O'Dowd met with the agent for first-round draft pick
Matt Harrington. The sides are said to be about $2 million apart.
Pirates-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Mike Benjamin was scratched at shortstop due to a
sore muscle in his upper thigh, with Enrique Wilson replacing him
in the eighth slot. He said he was injured during fielding drills
before Monday's game. ... RHP Kris Benson, who hasn't won since
July 8, will get three days off before his next start next Tuesday
against San Francisco. ... Jason Kendall's 12th home run Monday
night matched his career best, set in 1998. ... Entering the game,
the Pirates led the major leagues with 77 unearned runs allowed.
Last year they had the second-highest total with 93.
</P>

   ST. LOUIS: Rookie Gene Stechschulte is in his fourth stint with
the team this year, and manager Tony La Russa said it's an
''ideal'' situation. ''He goes to Triple-A and gets a lot of
important experience, goes to the big leagues and gets a little
feel for it. That's a terrific way to spend a year for a young
pitcher.'' Stechschulte leads the Pacific Coast League with 29
saves at Memphis, but was 1-0 with a 5.54 ERA in 13 innings over
nine games with St. Louis. ''Going in, I knew how that's how it was
going to be,'' Stechschulte said. ''I had a couple of good outings
the last time I was up and I got sent right back down. In the back
of my head, I kept thinking, maybe if I throw well I stay up, but
that's not how it is.'' ... Rookie Rick Ankiel, who is 0-4 with
five no-decisions since June 20, goes again for his eighth victory
on Wednesday. ... Ray Lankford was the Busch Stadium career home
run leader with 107 in 689 games, while Mark McGwire was second
with 105 in 220 games.
Marlins-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Cliff Floyd has been taking batting practice with
the team and could come off the 15-day disabled list (tear of the
medial meniscus of the left knee) as early as Friday when the
Marlins return home to play Cincinnati. Floyd has made an excellent
recovery from July 29 arthroscopic surgery. Floyd should have an
affect on OF Preston Wilson, who seems to be floundering without
Floyd batting ahead of him. Wilson hasn't hit a home run since July
18 and is batting .198 in his last 122 at-bats with 17 RBI and 38
strikeouts. ... LHP Armando Almanza has allowed seven runs while
retiring only four hitters in his last three appearances. He gave
up a grand slam on Monday. ... Florida has just 11 wins in their 34
games against NL West opponents so far this season. ''I don't know
what the problem is, but West teams are killing us,'' Marlins
manager John Boles said. ... Boles also predicted the San Francisco
Giants would win the NL West. ''Their starters have been great and
people are just now starting to notice their rotation,'' said
Boles. ''(Shawn) Estes and (Livan) Hernandez are great, and they
have great balance throughout the rotation.'' The Marlins faced
Estes on Tuesday night and were up against Hernandez on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP John Johnstone reported no discomfort a day
after making his first rehab assignment at Single-A San Jose.
Johnstone, who is recovering from lower back pain, is expected to
make another appearance in San Jose on Wednesday. ... Giants
manager Dusty Baker expects OF Ellis Burks to play on Wednesday,
even though it's a day game after a night game and Burks, who has
sore knees, has usually sat in those situations. ''As long as he
feels good we want him to keep playing,'' said Baker. ''He's one of
the hottest guys in the world right now.'' ... The Giants are 67-41
since April 21, the best record in the majors. They started the
season a major league worst 4-11.
Mets-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Bobby Valentine took a shot at Padres C Wiki
Gonzalez, contending that his poor throw led to New York's Derek
Bell being called out on batter's interference in the ninth inning
of Monday night's 5-4, 10-inning loss. With two outs in the ninth
and the game tied at 4, Darryl Hamilton attempted to steal second.
Gonzalez's throw was way off the mark, sailing into center field.
''Because it was such a ridiculously bad throw, it initiated it,''
Valentine said. Gonzalez said that because the pitch was inside, he
was almost behind Bell when he threw the ball. ''I just throw the
ball this way because I don't want to hit Derek,'' Gonzalez said.
As for Valentine's comment, ''I don't care what he said,'' Gonzalez
said. ''I don't want to get mad at those things. Whatever he said,
I don't want to take it personally. The umpire called
interference.'' Said Padres manager Bruce Bochy, ''I've never seen
Wiki make a throw like that. He was trying to get around the
batter.''
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: In beating the Mets 16-1 on Tuesday, the Padres had
their largest victory margin of the season. It was their largest
offensive output since beating Texas 17-8 on June 7, 1998. ...
Damian Jackson had a career-high five RBIs, with a grand slam and
RBI double, passing his old high of four, set on April 27 at
Pittsburgh. ... With his home run, Phil Nevin has reached base via
hit or walk in 43 straight games.
Expos-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: RF Vladimir Guerrero was a late scratch from Tuesday
night's lineup because of a strained left shoulder. ... Expos CEO
Jeffrey Loria reportedly has decided to replenish the team's
coffers with between $17 million and $19 million of his own money,
in order to erase the team's operating deficit and fulfill its
financial obligations -- including paychecks for players and other
employees. The 14 local shareholders Loria has been in charge of
since Dec. 9 already have refused to put any more capital into the
financially-strapped franchise, which reportedly was in danger of
running out of cash by mid-September. Loria is still working on a
deal to buy out the Expos' 14 local partners, but that is still
weeks away. ... Tim Raines, the Expos' all-time leader in stolen
bases, runs scored, singles, triples and walks, won't be on the
U.S. Olympic roster when it is announced Wednesday in Los Angeles.
Raines, who will turn 41 a day before the competition begins, was
the last former major league player still under consideration. He
had battled lupus at the end of his 21-year major league career,
but came out of retirement to play in the independent Atlantic
League as a way of getting back into shape and auditioning for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Davey Johnson was back on the bench Tuesday night
without missing a beat after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
left rotator cuff in the morning. ''I'm glad that's over, but it
was something I needed to have done because it was getting worse
and worse,'' said Johnson, who arrived at Dodger Stadium about 90
minutes before game time. ''They did some things in there that
needed to be corrected. The last few weeks have been kind of
painful, but thank goodness for Dr. Jobe.'' ... Gary Sheffield was
a late scratch from Tuesday night's lineup because of the flu. ...
Sheffield entered Tuesday night's game tied for the NL lead in
walks with Barry Bonds and three homers behind Sammy Sosa in home
runs. Sheffield is trying to become the ninth NL player since 1910
to lead the league in homers and bases on balls in the same season.
The only other Dodger to accomplish the feat was Duke Snider in
1956, the same year he set the franchise record with 43 homers. The
only other players to do it since Snider, are Mark McGwire (1998),
Dale Murphy (1985) and Mike Schmidt (1983). ... The Dodgers have
drawn the most walks in the NL, but have the league's fourth-lowest
hit total. ... Dodgers pitchers have hit a league-leading 59
batters, which could help explain why they also have allowed the
fewest hits in the NL.
Brewers-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers tied seven club records in their 16-8
victory over Arizona Monday night -- the NL franchise record for
hits in an inning (nine) and runs in an inning (eight), the club
record for most home runs in an inning (three) and the NL franchise
record for most RBIs in an inning (eight). ... Milwaukee's
three-game winning streak matches its longest of the year. ...
Richie Sexson has six home runs in 20 games since coming from
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks used every reliever in Monday night's
loss. ... Geraldo Guzman, Tuesday night's starter, worked for seven
years as a carpenter in the Dominican Republic before he began
pitching on the weekends at the urging of Arizona scout Rafael Mena
in 1997. He started this season at Double-A El Paso, then had six
starts at Triple-A Tucson before being called up by the
Diamondbacks. ... Arizona's seven-game winning streak, which ended
Monday, was its second-longest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal Sought in Columbine Suits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and other
defendants on Tuesday argued that five lawsuits filed by the
families of Columbine victims should be dismissed because they
failed to prove their claims.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have asked a federal judge to dismiss the
wrongful death suits filed over the April 20, 1999, shootings at
Columbine High School. Two teen gunmen killed 12 students and a
teacher before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defendants -- the sheriff's office, Sheriff John
Stone, seven sheriff's officers and former Sheriff Ronald Beckham --
filed documents Tuesday saying the lawsuits failed to show that the
victim's constitutional rights were violated because the U.S.
Constitution does not guarantee a right to police protection.
</P>
<P>
   They also said officers have no constitutional duty to
investigate crime to prevent violence by private citizens; that the
families failed to prove the officers' actions put the victims in
danger; and that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity
from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed by the families of Richard Castaldo,
Sean Graves, Lance Kirklin and Mark Taylor, who were wounded in the
attack, and the family of Isaiah Shoels, who was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were originally filed in state court and then
transferred to federal court.

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies After Hot Spring Fall  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- A park concession
employee died Tuesday after falling into a 178-degree hot spring
and two others were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Hulphers, of Oroville, Wash., died about 15 hours after the
accident late Monday. The 20-year-old woman died from complications
from very severe burns, said Chris Nelson, spokesman for University
of Utah's Intermountain Burn Center in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in the Lower Geyser Basin seven miles
north of Old Faithful, roughly in the middle of the park. An area
along the Firehole River was cordoned off with yellow police tape
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to park spokeswoman Cheryl Matthews, the three were
returning from a swim in the Firehole River when friends heard
their cries between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday. They fell into
Cavern Spring, a 178-degree pool about 10 feet deep, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three were trying to navigate the geyser basin in the dark
hours after sunset and before the moon rose, said park spokeswoman
Marsha Karle. Rangers spoke with park concession employees and
determined alcohol likely was not a factor in the accident, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's hot springs are often surrounded by thin, fragile
crusts and numerous warning signs are posted. Visitors to the Lower
Geyser Basin are urged to stay on a half-mile boardwalk over the
treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not venture off this boardwalk. You couldn't pay me
enough to set foot off this,'' said Carla Wilson, of Denver, who
was visiting Yellowstone with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Hulphers had third-degree burns over her entire body. Tyler
Montague, 18, had second- and third-degree burns over 97 percent of
his body, and Lance Buchi, 18, had third-degree burns over 90
percent of his body, park officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said some of the friends stayed with Hulphers while
others helped Montague and Buchi walk to their cars about a quarter
of a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty remarkable that they walked these two young men
out, which took some time because they were pretty hurt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   All three worked in the Old Faithful area; Hulphers in the Old
Faithful Inn employee dining room, Buchi in housekeeping at the inn
and Tyler at the Old Faithful Lodge kitchen.

<HEADLINE> Overtime still an issue with bargaining unit  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Telephone workers remained on strike Tuesday
in six Mid-Atlantic states as colleagues, who have returned to work
in New York and New England, started to whittle down a large
backlog of repair orders from their two-week walkout.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington bargaining table, Verizon Communications and
negotiators representing 35,000 employees in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the
District of Columbia continued to haggle over such issues as the
amount of worker overtime the company can require.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon spokesman, Eric Rabe, reported no developments late
Tuesday, as the parties were planning to break up for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives have proposed a plan that would move toward
an 8-hour-per-week cap on mandatory overtime for technicians and
service representatives in that region over the life of the
three-year contract. Currently, workers can be ordered to put in 10
to 15 hours of overtime a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed to some limits,'' Rabe said. The debate is
''over where those limits should be.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company still needs some flexibility to meet heavy
traffic demands or in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we need to be able to require people to stay on the
job to serve customers,'' Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Union employees argue that overtime that was supposed to have
been reserved for special circumstances has become part of their
weekly routines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of single parents, and it is hard for them. The
company is telling them to make a choice between their family and
Verizon,'' said Pat Carter-Farah, a striker picketing Tuesday in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Employees without a contract demonstrated at about 220 locations
Tuesday, the company said. Some strikers from the Mid-Atlantic
region have begun picketing at sites in New York City, and some
union employees honored the lines, even though their contracts are
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, CWA President Morton Bahr said striking
Verizon workers would intensify picketing throughout New York state
on Wednesday. He instructed New York members to honor the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''CWA members are always ready to help their union brothers and
sisters in a struggle, and our members in New York will refuse to
work ... anywhere they encounter a CWA picketer,'' Bahr said.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative contract reached Sunday by Verizon and 50,000
workers in New York and New England did not set new overtime
limits, mostly because employees in that region work less overtime
than their counterparts in the Mid-Atlantic area.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and another
CWA bargaining unit represented those 50,000 workers in talks with
Verizon, a company formed by the summer merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE.
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of striking employees back on the job, the
company has been able to make a dent in its considerable repair
backlog, clearing 42,000 trouble reports. It still has about 73,000
requests to be processed and hopes by week's end to begin working
through about 200,000 orders for new service and installation. That
could take a month to complete.

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driver Sentenced for Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- A six-time convicted drunken driver has
been sentenced to at least 16 years in prison for driving drunk and
killing a 5-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Paul Castillo, a 39-year-old unemployed construction
worker, was due to serve a jail sentence for drunken driving when
he got behind the wheel April 22 and struck a car driven by Masako
Saenz. Her son, Manuelito Saenz, was killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was driving with a suspended license and had more than
twice the legal blood-alcohol level when he took an illegal left
turn in his pickup truck and plowed into Saenz's compact car.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Murray said during sentencing that Castillo had
failed to make good on many promises to turn his life around over
the years. Murray gave him a sentence of 16 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't express my sorrow and I can't bring him back but I do
ask the court and the family to forgive me,'' Castillo told the
court.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Congress Leader Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The speaker of Ecuador's national
legislature resigned on Tuesday, breaking a three-week deadlock
over the leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Susana Gonzales' announcement came less than an hour after
Ecuador's highest court ordered the legislature to take another
vote to determine who will head the 123-seat Congress. ''I am
stepping down from my position for a greater good, that of peace
and civic tranquility,'' Gonzales told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Gustavo Noboa had accused lawmakers of dragging the
country into a ''grave institutional crisis'' and refused to
recognize any legislative decisions until the leadership fight was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was elected with support from centrist and left-wing
lawmakers on Aug. 1 in a session marred by shoving and cursing on
the Congress floor.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Social Christian party argued that one of its
members was entitled to the post under Ecuadorean law because its
candidates received the second highest number of votes in the 1998
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's supporters justified her appointment, saying she had
been a member of the Social Christians until she quit in July.
Leaders of the party, which holds 25 seats, won a court order to
annul her election.
</P>
<P>
   The case was appealed to the Constitutional Tribunal, which
issued its ruling Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Welfare Rolls Declining  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare rolls are half what they were four
years ago, and the percentage of Americans on welfare is at its
lowest level in 35 years, President Clinton said on the anniversary
of the passage of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''In four short years, we have seen a new emphasis on work and
responsibility, as welfare recipients themselves have risen to the
challenge and made welfare what it was meant to be -- a second
chance, not a way of life,'' said Clinton, who has used the each
year's anniversary as an opportunity to trumpet the falling rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the Clinton administration said all states have met
the law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans on welfare has fallen from 5.5
percent when Clinton took office in 1993 to 2.3 percent in 1999,
and is now at its lowest level since 1965, the White House said.
Welfare rolls peaked in 1994 at 14.2 million people, mostly single
women and their children. They dropped to 6.3 million by December,
a 56 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fourths of the overall decline occurred since the
new welfare law was enacted, with 1999 caseloads roughly half what
they were in 1996, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national decline was slower in 1999 than it has been
in recent years, and welfare rolls edged up in a handful of states,
including Texas, where GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush is
governor. They also rose in Tennessee, the home state of Democratic
nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met at the White House Tuesday with top corporate
executives who issued their own progress report on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's welfare system was dramatically improved by the
overhaul, but poor people entering the work force need help with
child care, transportation and training -- the very challenges this
group has always faced, the business executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Their report added that former welfare recipients have made
''good, productive employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Job retention rates for those workers meet and often exceed
those for employees who haven't been on welfare, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives say government programs are still needed to
help welfare recipients get jobs, citing child care and
transportation as the ''biggest obstacles to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawmakers should sustain or, ideally, increase resources for a
range of programs that help former welfare recipients stay on the
job,'' said the report from the Welfare to Work Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends Congress increase tax credits and
child-care grants to cover more working parents and subsidize
transportation and housing costs so welfare recipients can get to
work more easily or move closer to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law encouraged recipients to enter the work
force by limiting the time they can collect benefits and requiring
them to work while on the rolls. It also offered incentives to
employers to hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate executives who signed the report include chiefs of
United Airlines, Sprint, Citigroup, Time Warner, Bank of America,
Burger King, Monsanto, United Parcel Service and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The Welfare to Work Partnership, according to a survey of its
members, found the average starting wage of those hired from
welfare rolls is $7.80 per hour, significantly higher than the
minimum wage of $5.15, and said about three in four receive medical
benefits. More than 44 percent of hires, the report says, get a
401(k) matching savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends that Congress, when it revisits the
law next year, loosen the federal requirement that welfare
recipients find work while on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of a ''work activity'' should include
substance-abuse treatment, domestic violence counseling and other
special needs, it said. And Congress should give a break to workers
who need longer than five years to get off welfare because of low
starting pay, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Barrels Into Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
By DAN PERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Compact, quick-moving Debby became
the first hurricane to make landfall this season, hitting several
small Caribbean islands Tuesday on a northwesterly route that
menaced Puerto Rico and the Bahamas archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said it was too early to gauge the threat to the
U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   With winds up to 75 mph, Debby was a Category 1 hurricane,
apparently causing little damage on Antigua, Anguilla and other
small islands Tuesday morning. It then made a slight -- but crucial
-- turn to the north that meant populous Puerto Rico and the
vulnerable Dominican Republic could be spared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've fared well. I'm looking outside at my garden, which was
devastated by Hurricane Lenny last year, and it still has
flowers,'' said Glen Holm, director of the tourism bureau on the
Dutch island of Saba.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby St. Maarten, battered by hurricanes in recent years, a
curfew was lifted and meteorologist Ashford James celebrated the
passage of ''Little Debby.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the threat was sufficient to disrupt life throughout the
northern Caribbean as residents, tourists, businesses and
authorities sprang into the routine -- terrifying to some,
exhilarating to others -- of bracing for a storm strike.
</P>
<P>
   A 78-year-old San Juan man died Tuesday, Puerto Rican police
reported, when he fell off a roof as he tried to dismantle a
television antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Virgin Islands declared a curfew and requested federal
help, and a major oil refinery was partially shut down. Airlines
canceled flights, schools and banks closed, storekeepers nailed
plywood to windows and cruise lines diverted ships.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Debby was centered about 150 miles northwest of
San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was moving west-northwest near 18 mph,
slower than its 21 mph pace of several hours earlier, but still
carrying maximum winds of 75 mph, with higher gusts.
Hurricane-force winds extended 25 miles from the storm's center and
tropical storm-force winds another 175 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters were trying to determine if the storm would have a
serious impact on the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The center will likely be approaching us (Florida) by Friday
morning. If it stays on our track, we've got Wednesday and Thursday
to prepare,'' Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, told AP Network News.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 4 million people, there was
relief as Debby's eye passed just north of the island. Still,
officials warned heavy rains could come late in the afternoon,
causing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, and that water
spouts could come ashore as isolated tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're forecasting 4 to 6 inches (of rain), and they could have
some locally heavier amounts up to 10 inches,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy abandoned exercises near the outlying island of
Vieques, moving 10 ships and two submarines 300 miles south.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the north coast of the
Dominican Republic, the British Turks and Caicos islands and the
southeastern Bahamas, and a hurricane watch was in effect for the
central Bahamas, northern Haiti and northeastern Cuba. Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands maintained tropical storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis was spared,
enabling the continuation of Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Fred McGriff and Bobby Smith homered as the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays won their third consecutive game, 3-2 over the
Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Rupe (5-4) struck out eight in a season-high seven innings,

Matt Lawton's leadoff homer.

   Twins starter J.C. Romero (2-3) gave up four hits in 7 1-3
innings, but two of the hits were home runs.
</P>

   Smith hit his fifth homer of the season in the second inning,
and Tampa Bay increased its lead in the fourth, helping by an error
from second baseman Jay Canizaro.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ochoa's Grand Slam Sets MLB Record  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Alex Ochoa hit the 142nd grand slam of the
season Tuesday night, setting a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds outfielder hit his first career slam in the
first inning against Philadelphia's Bruce Chen, the Reds' second
slam in two nights. Dmitri Young hit an upper-deck grand slam in a
7-4 win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who lost 5-4, hadn't hit grand slams in consecutive
games since May 4-5, 1996, when Eric Davis had a pair. They have
five overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa wasn't aware that his slam had set a record.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my first grand slam so that's special, and that makes
it even more special,'' Ochoa said. ''But losing takes the fun out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The record was tied earlier Tuesday in San Diego when the
Padres' Damian Jackson hit No. 141.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson connected in the second inning off Pat Mahomes for his
first career slam, San Diego's fourth of the season, in a 16-1 win
over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record of 141 slams was set in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Report: Surgery for Virginia Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Virginia women's basketball coach
Debbie Ryan has undergone surgery to remove a tumor from her
pancreas, according to The Roanoke Times.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 47, was described by a relative Tuesday as ''really weak''
following Sunday's surgery at the University of Virginia Hospital
but ''doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not talking to anybody right now,'' Gene Corrigan, a
former athletic director at Virginia and retired commissioner of
the Atlantic Coast Conference, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan, who is Ryan's uncle, did not offer a diagnosis of
Ryan's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is preparing for her 24th season with the Cavaliers and has
a record of 526-183. Virginia was 25-9 and reached the round of 16
in the NCAA tournament last season, and Ryan was selected ACC coach
of the year for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia athletic director Terry Holland could not be reached
Tuesday on when Ryan might return to her duties.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Cubs 7  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell homered and doubled twice as the
Houston Astros spoiled Kerry Wood's return from the disabled list
by sending the Chicago Cubs to the seventh straight loss, 10-7
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White homered twice and drove in four runs for the Cubs.
He went 4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning that
rallied the Astros from a 7-6 deficit. He also had an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Wood had been sidelined since July 30 because of a strained
muscle in his left rib cage. He lasted four innings, giving up four
runs on three hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Wood struck out eight. He was pulled after throwing 95 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno drew a leadoff walk from Wood in the first and
Bagwell hit his 39th homer to tie it at 2. Bagwell went 3-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   To protect his left side, Wood batted left-handed for the first
time in his major league career. He flied out in his only at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Houston trailed by a run in the seventh when Julio Lugo walked
and Bagwell doubled off Kyle Farnsworth (1-7). After Richard
Hidalgo struck out, Alou hit his 24th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bogar hit a solo home run in the Houston eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes (4-4) pitched the seventh inning for the victory.
Jose Cabrera worked 1 1-3 innings for his first major league save.
</P>
<P>
   White hit his first homer since being traded from Montreal to
the Cubs on July 31, connecting for a two-run shot in the first off
Brian Powell.
</P>
<P>
   White had a solo homer in the third and an RBI single in the
fifth. It was the seventh two-homer game of his career and first
since he did it June 16 against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's triple and a single by Mitch Meluskey lifted Houston
into a 6-all tie in the fifth. An RBI grounder by Gary Matthews Jr.
in the sixth put the Cubs ahead 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez also homered for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: White's first-inning homer was his 12th of the season. ...
The six combined home runs raised the season total for Enron Field
to 216. There were 118 homers hit last season in the Astrodome.
