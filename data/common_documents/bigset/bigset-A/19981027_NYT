THEY'RE POLLS APART  
 UCLA, NOT OHIO ST., LEADS 1ST BCS RANKING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series ranking made its debut Monday and
wasted little time in generating controversy.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, ranked second in the Associated Press and coaches polls,
earned the top spot in the BCS ratings. Ohio State, ranked first in
both polls all season, is second. Tennessee, Kansas State and
Florida State round out the top five. Arizona is 14th.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams in the BCS standings at the end of the year
will play in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 in Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me whether we are ranked first or
second in the BCS poll,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. ``The
important thing is to have a chance to play in the championship
game, and you can do that being ranked first or second.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State Coach John Cooper and the Buckeyes claim they aren't
bothered by the BCS poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about the BCS ratings, just like we can't worry
about our rankings in the national polls,'' Cooper said. ``I can
say that we are happy to be ranked as high as we are in the polls.
We've been the No. 1 team in both the major polls all season, and
we are just going to keep working hard to try and win football
games. Winning takes care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ranking is based on a formula that includes a team's
record, strength of schedule, average ranking in the AP and coaches
polls, and the average rating of three computer polls.
</P>
<P>
   Teams earn points based on the four categories, and the ones
with the lowest totals are ranked highest. The BCS rankings will be
released each Monday and include 20 teams. UCLA leads the standings
with a 3.04 point total _ two points for poll average, one for
computer average, 0.04 for strength of schedule and zero for
losses. Ohio State has 4.31 points _ one for poll average, 2.67 for
computer average, 0.64 for strength of schedule and zero for
losses.
</P>
<P>
   John Junker, the executive director of the Fiesta Bowl, said he
was a little bit surprised that UCLA was No. 1 in the BCS standings
instead of Ohio State. ``I thought it was interesting that in the
three (computer rankings), UCLA was one, one and one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was ranked ahead of the Buckeyes by virtue of its strength
of schedule and computer rankings, which rely heavily on strength
of schedule. The computer rankings have the Pac-10 rated higher
than the Big 10.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has victories over Oregon, ranked 12th in the AP poll, and
Arizona, which is 14th. Ohio State counters with wins over No. 10
Penn State, No. 18 Missouri and No. 21 West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between the two teams would have been much closer a
week ago, before Missouri and West Virginia lost, weakening the
Buckeyes computer ranking and strength of schedule numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One recent theory to surface is that the Buckeyes' schedule
could keep them out of national championship game in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State could finish undefeated and rated No. 1 in both polls
yet be ranked behind other schools, such as UCLA, Tennessee or
Florida State, in the BCS standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But `could' is a much different word than `will', '' Junker
said when asked if a No. 1-ranked Ohio State could be bypassed for
the Fiesta Bowl. ``It's statistically possible but I don't see it
as very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   It's early for fans to get too worked up about the BCS poll,
because there is great potential for it to change.
</P>
<P>
   Its strength of schedule component is based on what opponents a
school has already played. Ohio State, for instance, could receive
a boost by beating No. 22 Michigan on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   And the Buckeyes would also be helped if their opponents were to
win out. The Ohio State faithful will have to swallow hard and hope
Michigan beats No. 9 Wisconsin (8-0) on Nov. 14, because Wisconsin
and Ohio State don't meet this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other huge games left to play. Nebraska, sixth
in the BCS ratings, plays Kansas State, rated fourth, on Nov. 14.
And Florida State, which is fifth, plays No. 7 Florida on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS system was designed to provide an unbiased way to match
the top two teams in one bowl game to determine a national
championship. If there are more than two unbeaten teams, however,
things will get sticky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem you're going to have is if you have two teams
playing for the national championship and you've go three or four
teams who feel like they deserve to be in there,'' Cooper told
``The Columbus Dispatch.'' ``You can't please everybody.'' &QL;

FORMER ASU PLAYER FIGHTS LEUKEMIA  
 PLUMMER, KUSH JOIN BENEFIT TO FUND BONE MAR ROW TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-CAJIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It climbed into Joe Cajic's car after a doctor's visit and
hasn't left his side since.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia. It's what defines him.
</P>
<P>
   Cajic (pronounced CHYCH) is no longer simply the former Arizona
State lineman with a quick smile. He is the former Arizona State
lineman with a quick smile and a disease that makes him wait on a
very public death row.
</P>
<P>
   His only reprieve: a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for the leukemia part,'' he said. ``I wasn't ready
for the `three years' part.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how long Cajic, 27, has been told he will live unless a
match is found for a transplant. No members of his family proved a
fit.
</P>
<P>
   His ``extended family,'' as he calls ASU, has teamed with United
Blood Services and the Joe Cajic Foundation to host a benefit at 5
p.m. today at Karsten Golf Course. Money raised from the autograph
party featuring Cardinals Jake Plummer, Pat Tillman, Mario Bates,
Frank Sanders, former ASU Coach Frank Kush and former quarterback
Jeff Van Raaphorst will be used to subsidize bone marrow testing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cajic had been bothered by back pain late last year, and it
became so severe that a co-worker called paramedics just days
before Christmas. Tests revealed an elevated white blood cell
count, and doctors delivered the news in a subsequent office visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't remember anything about the visit,'' he said.
``I'm amnesic about it. I remember before, telling everyone at the
office that I had to go out for lunch. And after, going back to
work. I can't remember everything else. I guess because it's kind
of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   For a week, he told no one. He was afraid of ruining the
holidays. On Dec. 30, he finally broke down and told his father,
Mike, because he needed someone to take him to the hospital for a
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation still haunts him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I need your help. I need to have something done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have . . . leukemia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing in the world to tell your parents you
might die,'' he said recently. ``I just remember the look on my
dad's face.''
</P>
<P>
   After the procedure, Cajic joined some friends at a cabin in
Payson for a few days. He had his father break the news to his
mother, Carol, while he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   His type of leukemia doesn't respond to chemotherapy, so he
takes medication daily. He does not wear the face of cancer, if
there is such a thing, but he is often exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult adjustment for someone whose passions
include Russian literature and sports. Now, his athletic endeavors
are limited to bike rides, and even those wipe him out.
</P>
<P>
   He was Arizona's two-time 5A state discus champion and a
standout offensive lineman at Shadow Mountain High. He is 6 feet 5
now, only two inches taller than he was in seventh grade. His size
made for a challenging, albeit interesting, childhood.
</P>
<P>
   His first kiss, at 12, was with a 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't know how old I was,'' he said mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the state's hottest recruits as a senior. One
afternoon while watching Southern California and Penn State play,
the phone rang. It was USC's recruiting coordinator, who handed the
phone to head Coach Larry Smith . . . ``during'' the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hi, we really want you to come here,' '' Cajic said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sold, but USC proved a poor fit. After two seasons, he
transferred to ASU, where he started fives games during 1993 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he tried his hand at several careers before
landing in the wholesale roofing business.
</P>
<P>
   He now generates his energy toward improving awareness for the
The National Marrow Donor Program. While the procedure to be placed
in the candidate pool is a simple blood test, the $40 cost that
accompanies it prevents many from testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are slim,'' said Judy Bartholomeaux, Arizona's
National Marrow Donor Program presentative. ``But when you do find
that match . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Cajic understands that his odds are slim, but he's hoping for a
break. And he wants to help others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cajic's parents are from Croatia. Even though a donor match
wouldn't have to be Croatian, Cajic's odds increase if there are
more Croatians in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian community, which has some representation in the
Valley, has been notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating for a while,'' Cajic said. ``And then you
realize you just have to take it one day a time, a lot like we
talked about when I played at ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder remembers Cajic as someone ``very
positive, upbeat. No chip on his shoulder at all. We felt he bought
into what we were trying to teach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he seems to be handling what he's facing now much the same
way. He has the same spirit. Live for today.'' &QL;

KEALY TO START AT QUARTERBACK VS. COUGARS  
</HEADLINE>
  STATE-QB-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy is back at starting quarterback, but he may not be
joined in the backfield by J.R. Redmond for Saturday game's at
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond is ``50-50'' to play against the struggling Cougars,
Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder said Monday. He was unable to
practice Sunday because of a sore toe on his left foot and a
sprained right ankle. He sat out the second half of ASU's 44-38
overtime victory against Stanford on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils were rallied to victory by Kealy, a sophomore who
completed 8 of 15 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns,
including the game-winning 25-yard scoring pass to Tariq McDonald
in overtime. Kealy entered the game late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went in there and looked like a quarterback who was really
alive,'' Snyder said. ``His arm was good, his tempo was good.
Something was right, because he played extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Chad Elliott was 9 for 17 for 92 yards in his
first start. Although Elliott left the field quickly after the game
and didn't linger for the players' post-game celebration, Snyder
said there is no animosity between the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I talked about it,'' Snyder said. ``I think he was
going through a lot of pain, or whatever that feeling is of
starting but not finishing a game. I believe him, that he was truly
happy for the football team, and he congratulated Ryan Kealy in his
own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he felt was appropriate and right, and Ryan Kealy
will acknowledge that. I don't have a problem. I think he was
disappointed he didn't have the opportunity to finish it, which is
OK. And I think he is very supportive of Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also backed Elliott's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not displeased at all with Chad Elliott's preparation
for the game,'' he said. ``He did a nice job of preparing himself.
He did a nice job of managing the club in terms of signals and
clocks and formations. He threw the ball at about a 50 percent
completion rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy did not start for the first time in his career Saturday
after struggling much of the season. When he came in against
Stanford, he had the sharpness he displayed during much of the 1997
season.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he still believes strongly in committing to one
quarterback but acknowledged he won't be afraid to make a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that as I look at my two quarterbacks, both of them are
talented young players with good arms, quick feet,'' he said. ``I'm
not so rigid that I don't see myself saying, `Hey, somebody's got a
hot hand, let's go with it,' because the bottom line, regardless on
my philosophy of playing one quarterback, is to figure out the very
best percentages to win the football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a change is required, I would do that because the team
deserves that kind of a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10) face a Washington State team
(3-4, 0-4) that has lost four consecutive conference games but
ranks fourth in the league in pass defense (and third in
interceptions with 11).
</P>
<P>
   ASU's defense, which has intercepted just three passes this
season, could find itself short-handed in the secondary again.
Starting strong safety Christon Rance is questionable because of a
strained left hamstring. If he is out, freshman Willie Daniel will
start.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Stephen Trejo, who has been sidelined much of the
season because of a knee injury, is expected to be available if he
recovers from a foot injury that has bothered him on and off
recently. &QL;

BAIUL, MOCEANU FIND REALITY THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oksana Baiul is in her hotel room, finally. For days we have
played phone tag, with the front desk staff at a Delaware Howard
Johnson's trying to flag down the now-in-serious-training skater.
</P>
<P>
   Now corraled, she is gushingly apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so sorry. I have been to the rink seven or eight hours a
day. I'm getting back into shape for my exhibition (which was this
past weekend in Boston) and a show coming up in November. I love
skating so much. I have been so hard practicing but my legs, they
feel good,'' Baiul said, her voice low and scratchy, a little
weary, but who would not be, after all she has been through?
</P>
<P>
   True to the achingly emotional persona Baiul portrayed during
her days as one of the world's best female figure skaters, nothing
this now 20-year-old woman does comes without overwhelming flashes
of raw honesty and vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of emotion and waifish spirit that helped the
then-16-year-old Baiul glide past Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 Winter
Olympics in Lillehammer and win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But the glitter of gold for this teenage orphan could not
prevent the eventual crash and burn of a post-Olympic reality
check.
</P>
<P>
   With no family, with no secure, happy personal history to cling
to like a safety raft, Baiul became another symbol of teenage
female athletes whose best years are those before puberty, before
the mind and body break out and demand accountability for all those
years spent shuttling to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Just returning to the rink this past September felt like walking
through a minefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach, Natalya Linichuk, she called and asked what I am
doing. I said not much. For 20 years of my life I am skating for my
family, for friends and I never had time for myself. So nothing.
That's what I am doing. I was too scared. I had so many burnouts, a
nervous breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible not to look at every female teenage skating
champion or gymnast or even tennis stars and not wonder when the
disaster will come? There has to be a cost for being so good, so
young. The mind and body can't bend that far without breaking.
Something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the news late last week that 17-year-old Olympic
gymnast Dominique Moceanu is suing her parents did not come as a
complete shock.
</P>
<P>
   At first, yes, there was surprise at the news. What other
response can a person have to the revelation that a very prominent,
seemingly well-adjusted teenager has instead been living with such
anxiety and distress that she is moved to legally separate from and
accuse her own parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, who won a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
and whose autobiography was a bestseller, has asked the court in
Texas to grant her adult status. In her suit, Moceanu and her
attorney claim that Moceanu's parents have used most or all of the
money she has earned since winning her gold medal, including money
in a trust fund earmarked for the gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Moceanu nor her attorney know for sure how much money is
in question, but it could be in excess of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a sport where an athlete peaks between ages 12 and
16, it is not surprising to see an elite gymnast like Moceanu make
a vigilant claim to what is rightfully hers.
</P>
<P>
   Did she have a childhood? In her court papers and in interviews,
Moceanu says absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always about the gym,'' she told reporters last week
and, for anyone who was looking, Moceanu had been exhibiting signs
of stress since at least 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not in the gym, one of my favorite things to do is
just to relax quietly in my room, listening to music. Sometimes it
seems as if I hardly ever have time to do this! The demands of
training, schoolwork, competitions, public appearances _ they all
leave me with very little free time,'' Moceanu wrote in her best
seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my parents and I try to make sure I do get the occasional
chance to decompress.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Moceanu was one of the most heralded athletes at
the Olympic gymnastics trials in Boston. She had a stress fracture
in her leg and was having difficulty completing many of the
required moves. But she demonstrated enormous resolve for such a
young athlete.
</P>
<P>
   During those trials, Moceanu impressed me as one of the most
focused and poised athletes I had ever interviewed _ regardless of
the fact that she was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was fooled, though. Maybe this girl with such awesome
athletic talent really was a tragedy waiting to happen, since up
until then her life had been nothing except gymnastics, about
becoming an Olympic champion _ as much for her driven father,
Dumitru, as for herself.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Moceanu at least hints at the changes that will
grip her life and twist it into something so different from the
narrow, driven and hard-working world she had known.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gymnastics career won't last forever, as my body ages and
changes, gymnastics will become less of an option for me. When that
time comes, I have another life, another career planned,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Moceanu has gotten up the courage to lift her head
and get a broader view of her life. And apparently, what she sees
in the rear-view mirror is not all good.
</P>
<P>
   If this lawsuit is the start of a new beginning, it probably
will not be that easy. The road is difficult for these teenagers
whose lives narrow into a dead end from which they are almost
desperate to escape.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story Baiul is telling, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Though the circumstances of their lives are different, Baiul and
Moceanu share the same fate. They are teenage phenoms who came to
some sort of emotional, psychological crash upon reaching
adulthood, mostly because of their compromised growth experiences
as kid superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Baiul was spiraling into the depths of
alcoholism, which almost took her life. One late night in January
1997, she drove her new Mercedes into a tree alongside a
Connecticut road. She got 14 stitches and a benevolent judge who
sentenced her to community service.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the wide-eyed 18-year-old said she understood that
this accident was a sign that she needed help, it took months more
of personal anguish before Baiul removed herself from a
professional skating tour, declaring she could not take it anymore,
and sought professional help. This past summer, she checked herself
into a clinic in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to stay 20 days. I stayed there much longer,
almost two and half months. So much damage done,'' said Baiul, who
could not come to grips with the losses in her life and found the
clinic's counselors extremely helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul's mother died when she was 13. The young skater moved from
the Ukraine to Moscow, only to have her coach leave her too. Then
she hit the jackpot with her Olympic gold, which turned into
millions of dollars. By now she was living in America, home of the
free and the free-spending. All of her money was spent on a home,
her Mercedes, gifts for ``friends'' and trips into Manhattan for
nightclubbing and selections from the Versace racks.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the skating was just something her agent or friends
would push her to do. It became the thing that was killing Baiul,
entwined with her alcoholism. It was no longer the gift that set
her free.
</P>
<P>
   ``On tour, I was sitting by myself after shows, drinking a
lot,'' Baiul said. ``I was thinking suicidal things. About killing
myself. One day, I woke up at 9 a.m. and made a phone call (to her
agent). I said I have to get out of here. I don't want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, after her agonizing struggle, Baiul is back on the
ice. She is talking about wanting to return to the Olympics in 2002
for a shot at another gold, though she knows skating officials will
have their say in that decision. She is no longer the 16-year-old
innocent she was when she won that first gold medal, with all the
world watching. Her body has grown five inches. She is now a
5-foot-5, 120-pound woman _ not a whirling dervish the way she once
was, the way Tara Lipinski was last February in Nagano, when
Lipinski became the latest teenage Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very artistic person. I like to create new numbers and
new styles. I like to give everything inside me during a
performance, so that when they judge me and the people clap for me
I know I am doing this from inside me,'' Baiul said.
</P>
<P>
   But her first priority is to make sure that she is as whole and
as healthy as she can be. That is her biggest competition now, just
as it is for the 17-year-old Moceanu, whose entire life is supposed
to be ahead of her.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jean-Claude Van Damme makes millions of dollars as
an action hero in the movies, but Monday the martial-arts star told
jurors that he'd rather not be so famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a simple guy, my friend. I don't like when you call
me a star,'' the L.A.-area resident testified during the first day
of a Los Angeles Superior Court civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what happens to me when I become a star. I get sued by
friends and people like you,'' he told attorney Steven Kramer,
whose client Frank Dux is suing Van Damme for more than $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over ``The Quest,'' a 1995 martial-arts movie
based on a story Van Damme and Dux both got credit for creating.
Van Damme also directed and starred in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about, ladies and gentlemen, a bill that hasn't
been paid, plain and simple,'' Kramer said in opening statements.
``No more delays. No more excuses. It's time to pay the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dux and Van Damme used to be friends _ Van Damme's first hit
movie was based on Dux's life story _ but they glared at each other
from opposite ends of the courtroom Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dux contends the actor promised him 2.5 percent of the gross
profits from ``The Quest,'' which Kramer said may be more than $60
million. Van Damme asserts Dux made a deal with a studio to work on
another film that was never made and doesn't have any connection to
``The Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the last two years, the two known for their physical
fighting skills have been doing battle with words and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the witness stand Monday afternoon, Van Damme verbally
sparred with Kramer until Superior Court Judge James A. Kaddo
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a script,'' the judge told the actor, after his
testimony wandered beyond the question he was asked. ``Once you
answer, you stop. It's on to the next question.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the lawsuit was filed in early 1997, it's been clear the
dispute between Dux and Van Damme is personal.
</P>
<P>
   Dux's complaint alleged that ``Van Damme had lied to the public
that he was a martial-arts champion.'' He also claimed the actor
was trained in ballet and invented his European karate titles.
</P>
<P>
   Van Damme's lawyers challenged those statements in September
1997 and got a judge's order to keep the accusations out of any
future court records.
</P>
<P>
   Dux, who once owned several martial-arts dojos &UR;  &LR; in the L.A.
area, claims that he was the first American to win an off-the-books
martial arts tournament called the Kumite.
</P>
<P>
   That battle _ described by Kramer as a ``human cockfight'' _ is
the backdrop for the 1987 cult hit ``Bloodsport,'' Van Damme's
first film as a star.
</P>
<P>
   Dux said he only got $15,000 for his life story, and the
percentage points from ``The Quest'' was supposed to be his big
payback.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer asserted that Van Damme got a mutual friend to convince
Dux to come to the actor's Chatsworth home, where he promised Dux a
share of the profits from ``The Quest,'' predicting it would be
``the greatest martial-arts movie of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie opened to lukewarm reviews and wasn't a box office
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Claude put one hand on his own heart and one on Frank's
heart and said, We are brothers,'' Kramer said, claiming that the
actor told Dux, ``This will be our `Dances with Wolves' ... This
will be our `Spartacus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Damme said the meeting took place, but only because Dux
needed work. &QL;

BCS RATINGS MAKE A BAD SYSTEM WORSE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ambiguity is for ice skating and ballroom dancing, not for a
sport dripping with machismo. Subjectivity is for gymnastics and
synchronized swimming, not for a sport that defines our country.
</P>
<P>
   Football demands finality. And it's completely un-American to
allow writers, coaches, computers and any bias that may exist
determine a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the world was treated to the first edition of the
Bowl Championship Series rating. Take the Championship away from
the BCS, and you get a better idea what this concept is all about.
And with UCLA on the top rung, you have the last piece of evidence
needed to warrant a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State could finish No. 1 in both polls and get aced out of
the Fiesta Bowl. All because the Big Ten stinks and strength of
schedule might catapult Florida State all the way to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ohio State received 64 out of 70 first-place votes.
Its defense has held its past four opponents to 80 rushing yards or
fewer. But even with a 36-10 drubbing of Northwestern, it lost
ground in the BCS formula.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, two teams considered among Ohio State's toughest
opponents _ West Virginia and Missouri _ lost last weekend. So
while UCLA allows 408 yards per game and benefits from a conference
buoyed by Oregon and Arizona, Ohio State has one Top 25 opponent
left. The Buckeyes must beat Michigan and hope the formula works
out.
</P>
<P>
   It may not. Over the final five weeks, West Virginia and
Missouri play a combined six games against teams currently ranked
in the Top 25. Strength of schedule, one of four major criteria
used in the BCS formula, might sink the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   It gets even worse. Even if Ohio State runs the table, it could
finish tied with Wisconsin atop the Big Ten. But because the two
teams won't play this season and because Ohio State has visited
Pasadena more recently than the Badgers, Wisconsin would get the
Rose Bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a broken system gets even worse.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that we've seen two teams share the national
championship three times this decade. It would be even worse if the
best team were denied the opportunity to win the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   The solution seems so obvious. College football needs a playoff
system.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so easy. Take the top eight teams and put them in a
bracket. Designate seven sites and rotate them yearly. Run the
tournament over three weeks, watch the ratings and advertising
dollars soar, watch a country gravitate to the payoff of a real
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, watch the debate go from who's No. 1 to who's
No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The suits that run college football don't want this because they
fear it would render all the other bowls useless, the ones that
boost the economy in remote outposts. They cry that a playoff
system would be far too demanding for student-athletes who can't
forget their studies.
</P>
<P>
   Such garbage. If they wanted, they could allow all the
lower-level bowls to remain intact, accommodating the alumni who
want their postseason road trips, pacifying the corporations that
give you gems such as the Weedeater Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As for this genuine concern about a quarterback's GPA . . .
</P>
<P>
   Really. Do they care that a basketball road trip in the Pac-10
requires two days of missed classes? In the Big Ten, do they care
about the late-night bus trips from Illinois to Indiana? If so, why
is a playoff system OK in Division I-AA?
</P>
<P>
   All it would take is chopping one week off the season. And with
a month of inactivity, a month when most colleges are on Christmas
break, the system could be easily enacted.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL wallows in mediocrity, filled with bad teams and
conservative coaches, the college game is missing a huge
opportunity. It is a game with more creativity, with hash marks and
the triple-option, with the unpredictability of college athletes.
In short, it is a better game than its professional counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   College football could be king.
</P>
<P>
   If it only had a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If it only had a brain. &QL;

SWANN MAY NEED ARTHRO SCOPIC SURGERY ON KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals fear defensive tackle Eric Swann's arthritic left
knee is so sore he might have to have arthroscopic surgery and miss
a few games.
</P>
<P>
   Swann left the team's Tempe training facility before Monday's
practice to have the knee re-examined by team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates said the knee had become swollen and didn't improve
during the three days off the players were given over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials are expected to learn the seriousness of the
injury today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that continues to bother him,'' said Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin, whose team returns to action Sunday at Detroit.
``He's unable to practice on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann played against Chicago Oct. 11 and the New York Giants
Oct. 18 despite not practicing all week.
</P>
<P>
   ```He has to get himself healthy,'' linebacker Jamir Miller
said. ``If he's out there only halfway, he's not helping us.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Mark Smith said it has been obvious for weeks
that Swann has been playing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could help the team by not practicing and
playing on Sunday,'' Smith said. ``He probably could have gotten
better by doing whatever he needed to get done earlier. The pain
has been lingering on. If he's hurting that bad, he should get the
work (possible surgery) done so he can come back healthy in two or
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Swann would be replaced by second-year pro Rashod
Swinger if he can't play against the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Swann is tied for the team lead in sacks with four and is tied
for second among linemen in tackles with 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd miss Swann,'' Tobin said. ``He's a force not many teams
have, and he has played well when he's been in there. He has the
ability to dominate the middle and force a double-team.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Slow healing
</P>
<P>
   Starting cornerback Tom Knight, who has missed the past three
games because of a knee injury, didn't practice again on Monday and
likely won't play against the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not look very good for this week,'' Tobin said. ``I
don't know when he's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight would be replaced again by J.B. Brown, who played well
against Oakland and Chicago but was benched in the second quarter
of the 34-7 loss to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals secondary should be tested Sunday. The Lions'
Herman Moore and Johnnie Morton are one of the league's best wide
receiver tandems.
</P>
<P>
   Knight practiced last Wednesday, but the knee swelled on him
that night, and he has been out since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gung-ho last week because I hadn't been able to do
something for so long,'' Knight said. ``Every week, I think this is
the week.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eye sore
</P>
<P>
   Backup cornerback J.J. McCleskey, out the past four games
because of a knee injury, has been running without any problems in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered a black eye Monday when rookie safety Corey
Chavous poked him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry about it, but I think I improved his looks,''
Chavous joked.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred when Chavous got his hand caught in
McCleskey's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer cute,'' McCleskey said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rasslin' update &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 20 players rode a bus to America West Arena Monday
afternoon to attend World Championship Wrestling's Monday Nitro
show.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Tommy Bennett said he could see himself being a pro
wrestler someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be known as `Street Smarts,' '' he said. ``I'd come into
the ring with chains and knives. Of course, I wouldn't use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Chris Dishman said his favorite wrestler goes by
the name of ``Goldberg.'' He's Bill Goldberg, former Los Angeles
Rams and Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only won 152 in a row,'' Dishman said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are expected to bring in a couple of defensive
linemen for a tryout today because of the uncertainity of Swann's
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has had the cast taken off his dislocated left wrist and
now wears a splint.

RETIRED GEN. COLIN POWELL ENTERS CULTURE WAR TO CLEAN UP HOLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY IVAN SCIUPAC  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell is urging Hollywood
entertainment industry leaders to turn away from dysfunctional
images that he said permeate television airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was speaking
Monday as the current chairman of Virginia-based America's Promise
_ The Alliance for Youth. Powell told industry executives,
producers, agents and writers to create more positive images for
the nation's youth in their programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have such power. Children watch what you put on the air _
they listen to you,'' Powell said at a luncheon at the Beverly
Hills Hilton Hotel sponsored by the Hollywood Radio and Television
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Powell urged the audience to crusade for children by being
positive role models and using television as a medium to focus on
character building for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a responsibility not only to satisfy the market that
is out there, but to help shape that market,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Perth, former president of USA Network, called the general's
speech ``sensational'' and agreed with his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a message of individual effort and individual
connection to our future, which is our children,'' Perth said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said African-Americans can sometimes play roles on
television that can be dysfunctional and can have negative effects
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what it's all about then we might as well go back
to `Amos `n' Andy,''' Powell said, referring to a controversial
1950s television sitcom many civil rights groups believed fostered
racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to himself as an ``at-risk kid'' while growing up in
the New York's South Bronx, Powell credited his church group, an
after-school job and caring adults in the neighborhood for keeping
him out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise _ The Alliance for Youth is a nonprofit
umbrella group to smaller organizations. The alliance's mission is
to improve the lives of the nation's kids through mentorship and
outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who has been the group's chairman since April 1997, used
the platform to echo five primary goals of the alliance, which he
said are necessary for children to lead a successful life:
</P>
<P>
   _ The expansion of existing mentorship and outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increased number of safe havens such as the Boys &AMP; Girls
Club.
</P>
<P>
   _ A healthy start through vaccinations and medical exams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extensive intern- and apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
   _ More service-oriented programs for high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``No child should be left at risk if there are those of us in
society who can do something,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Black, president and general manager of KNBC-TV in Los
Angeles, said television can help children by showing adults as
positive role models in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can reflect to the community as a whole that if
they reach out to a young person at risk they can change the life
of that young person,'' Black said.

LEGACE LIVING A DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Manny Legace ran out of clean clothes a couple of
cities ago. That's what happens when you pack for a few days and
are gone for two weeks. The Los Angeles Kings' goaltender has had
to wear the same moldy golf shirt four days in a row (no wonder
he's rooming alone). Luckily, Legace is holding up better than his
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as an excursion with the Long Beach Ice Dogs
has turned into the experience of a lifetime for the 25-year-old
rookie who will make his fourth NHL start tonight in Long Island in
emergency relief of Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr, both of whom
are nursing groin injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Legace (pronounced LEG-uh-see) has been a fine fit for the
Kings, stopping 92 of 96 shots for a save percentage of .958. He
faced 50 shots in his NHL debut against Florida last Wednesday and
stopped 49, all the while struggling to keep his pregame meal down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I've felt nauseously nervous,'' Legace
said Monday by telephone from the team's hotel in Long Island.
``The (nausea) didn't go away until the second period.''
</P>
<P>
   The waves of familiar faces also left Legace slightly
disoriented. He could have sworn a hand had come bursting out of
his television screen at home and pulled him him into the set.
</P>
<P>
   Legace said he saw veteran Kirk Muller skating toward him at one
point and thought, ``I've been watching this guy play in the NHL
for years and now he's coming in on me. This is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third period, Legace had the Panthers muttering to
themselves. He heard one player say something to the effect of
``Geez, what does it take to get the puck past this guy?'' after
the player took a shot, collected the rebound off to the side and
tried unsuccessfully to wrap it around the goal.
</P>
<P>
   That night Legace was the windshield. Two days later he would
know what it was like to be the bug. He suffered a concussion in
the second period of the Kings' game at Tampa Bay when Darcy Tucker
rolled over him like a tank on his way to a short-handed score.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went on to lose 3-2. Legace was back in the net for
the Kings' game Sunday at Carolina. The way he looked at it, given
the week he'd had, who was to say where the haziness ended and the
concussion began?
</P>
<P>
   Legace had another reason to feel better in a hurry. The
Hurricanes (nee Hartford Whalers) had left Legace to languish for
four years in the American Hockey League, the East Coast Hockey
League and the IHL. Even when it became clear their 1997-98 season
was beyond salvaging, the Hurricanes auditioned everybody, it
seemed to Legace, but him.
</P>
<P>
   So he was gleeful when he was dealt to the Kings on the last day
of July and gratified beyond words not quite three months later
when he stopped 29 of Carolina's 31 shots to post his first NHL
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question I'm happy to be out of that organization,'' said
Legace, who knew he wasn't with Carolina any more in September when
he was assigned to the Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Legace was planning to fly home to Massachusetts at his own
expense to see his wife Karen, their 3-year-old daughter Sabrina
and their son Manny III, who was born on Sept.6, when the Kings
intervened. They paid for his airline ticket and sent him off with
their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just little things like that make players want to play harder
for a team,'' said Legace, who since has moved his family to Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The next soft NHL goal Legace lets in will be his first, which
makes you wonder: is it a dilution of talent or an abundance of
good goaltenders that's holding down the scoring in the league?
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Legace said, today's goaltenders are a
different breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '70s, they would say, `you can't skate, then you
have to play goalie,' '' Legace said. ``Now goalies are more agile
and more athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Legace in action is to marvel at his dexterity. But
he'll hear none of that. His wife, he'll tell you, is the really
nimble one in the family. It's beyond him how she juggles caring
for an infant and a 3-year-old in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, their rented apartment is never as quiet as the
visitors' dressing room was at the Panthers' new arena in Sunrise,
Fla., when Legace straggled in after his 49-save performance.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said a word for what seemed like an eternity but was
probably more like 10 seconds. ``I thought somebody had died,''
said Legace, who began to sweat anew. He sat down, shifted
uncomfortably and thought, ``What? Are they mad at me for letting
in one goal?''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the time he heard a rumble coming from Craig
Johnson's direction. Johnson congratulated him in his best
``Fargo'' twang and everybody merrily joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Those Kings, they're such kidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a thick skin,'' Legace said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   And a quick glove hand doesn't hurt.

BRUINS PULLOFF UPSETOF OHIO STATE IN PLAYOFF RANKINGS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a complicated formula that mixes opinion,
computer-generated rankings and something called ``quartile rank,''
but it has a simple explanation: If the college football season
ended today, UCLA would play Ohio State for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated Bruins, 6-0, are No. 1 in the nation in the only
poll that matters _ the initial Bowl Championship Series rankings
that were released Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Updated BCS polls will be released periodically until Dec. 6.
The teams with the fewest points in the final poll will play for
the national title Jan. 4 in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, Los Angeles, football team greeted
the news with a small dose of satisfaction and a load of
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point that we're not celebrating any polls,''
said senior Shawn Stuart, a Saugus, Calif., native who plays center
for the Bruins. ``When Dec. 6 comes, we'll look at it and see where
we're ranked. Right now, we can't pay attention to it. Every team
we play is coming after us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had 3.04 points in the BCS poll, followed by Ohio
State (4.31), Tennessee (6.5) and Kansas State (8.79). But they
realize the loftiest perch means nothing if they lose any of their
remaining games: Stanford, Oregon State, Washington, USC and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   One defeat means they'll plunge in the poll and watch the Fiesta
Bowl from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flattered to be selected No. 1, but it doesn't mean a
thing,'' said Bruins coach Bob Toledo, a Westlake Village resident.
``The key is to be No. 1 or 2 after our five remaining games, so we
can play in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players not to worry. We need to focus on the
Stanford game. It can slip away real fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS poll was created this year by Roy Kramer, commissioner
of the Southeastern Conference. It's goal: eliminate the loopholes
in a system that used the opinion-based top-25 polls to crown a
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   There are four parts to the BCS formula:
</P>
<P>
   _ A team's average ranking in the Associated Press' media top-25
poll and the USA Today/ESPN coaches' top-25 poll.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 2 in both, UCLA received two points for that
component.
</P>
<P>
   _ A team's average ranking in three computer polls: the New York
Times, the Seattle Times, and Jeff Sagarin's power ratings
published in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 1 in each of those computer polls, UCLA received one
point.
</P>
<P>
   _ A schedule-strength rank determined by the win-loss record of
each team's opponents (66.6 percent) and each team's opponents'
opponents (33.3 percent). That number is divided by 25 to produce a
quartile rank. Each place is worth .04 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's toughest schedule to date, UCLA received .04
points.
</P>
<P>
   _ One point is added for each loss. The Bruins are 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Add 'em up _ two points for their top-25 average, one point for
their computer average and no losses _ and UCLA has 3.04 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many factors, how can you control anything?'' Stuart
said. ``It's pointless to try. All we can do is play hard and see
where we land.'' &QL;

TOLEDO RESENTS RECEIVER REMARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Their bulletin board is filling up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo took exception to a postgame comment
from Cal receiver Dameane Douglas, who said UCLA looked more like
the nation's No. 27 team than its No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' remark _ five days after USC coach Paul Hackett called
Oregon the best team in the Pacific-10 _ followed UCLA's 28-16
victory Saturday in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable to me,'' Toledo said. ``The guy catches 10
passes for 70 yards. My daughter can catch 10 passes for 70 yards
and lose. For guys to pop off when they lose doesn't show me
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas also made a throat-slitting motion while passing in
front of the UCLA bench with four minutes left and the Bruins in
control, according to a member of UCLA's travel party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's frustrating is when you're on top everybody
takes shots at you,'' Toledo said. ``But we aren't going to let it
affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruised, not beaten: Quarterback Cade McNown absorbed more
pounding at Cal than any game this season _ perhaps any game of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   McNown arrived for his weekly media conference Monday with
protective padding on his left hand, the result of two bruised
knuckles and subsequent swelling. The padding was gone for
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time was I at the point where I couldn't play,'' he
said. ``I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Photogenic?: McNown got plenty of reaction to Sports
Illustrated's full-color photo of him vomiting in the Oregon game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wanted to know what I thought: Was it in poor
taste, or cool?'' he said. ``I thought it was a little of both. It
was funny to see other peoples' reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster changes: Toledo announced two depth-chart changes: Oscar
Cabrera will replace penalty-plagued Jim Ghezzi at left guard, and
Jermaine Lewis is once again the top tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the starter until a one-game suspension for fighting,
gained 60 yards and threw a touchdown pass against Cal. Keith Brown
rushed for minus-4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10: McNown is one of 10 finalists for the Davey O'Brien
Award, given to the nation's top quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   His competition includes Kansas State's Michael Bishop,
Kentucky's Tim Couch, Central Florida's Duante Culpepper, Oregon's
Akili Smith and Ohio State's Joe Germaine.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Numerous players have bumps and bruises, strains
and sprains. But only one regular has been ruled out of the
Stanford game: freshman tailback DeShaun Foster, who's out at least
another week with a sprained knee suffered against Oregon. Foster
jogged during practice Monday but is not ready for full speed and
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers Mike Wiley (ankle), Ramogi Huma (hip) and Tony White
(thigh, ankle) center Shawn Stuart (ankle), fullback Craig Walendy
(back) and kicker Chris Sailer (groin) are probable./``This is the
most beaten up we've been in my three years at this stage of the
season,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Tight end Ryan Neufeld and defensive end Vae Tata
are the captains this week, joining season-long selections McNown
and Larry Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins (fumble recovery, interception) was named Pac-10
defensive player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, defensive end Kenyon Coleman and Marques Anderson
(special teams) were named UCLA's players of the week.
</P>
<P>
   As the nickel back, Anderson also had five tackles and three
passes broken up in what Toledo called, ``his best game this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an intensity to him. He's playing hard,'' Toledo
said. ``The other two guys (Ryan Roques and Jason Bell) are playing
so well at cornerback it's hard for him to get back in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA defeats Stanford, Oregon State and Washington, it'll
clinch the Pac-10 title regardless of the outcome of the USC game.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the Nov. 7 game at Oregon State is 3:30 p.m. No word
on the television situation.

BRUINS PULLOFF UPSETOF OHIO STATE IN PLAYOFF RANKINGS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a complicated formula that mixes opinion,
computer-generated rankings and something called ``quartile rank,''
but it has a simple explanation: If the college football season
ended today, UCLA would play Ohio State for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated Bruins, 6-0, are No. 1 in the nation in the only
poll that matters _ the initial Bowl Championship Series rankings
that were released Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Updated BCS polls will be released periodically until Dec. 6.
The teams with the fewest points in the final poll will play for
the national title Jan. 4 in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, Los Angeles, football team greeted
the news with a small dose of satisfaction and a load of
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point that we're not celebrating any polls,''
said senior Shawn Stuart, a Saugus, Calif., native who plays center
for the Bruins. ``When Dec. 6 comes, we'll look at it and see where
we're ranked. Right now, we can't pay attention to it. Every team
we play is coming after us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had 3.04 points in the BCS poll, followed by Ohio

MURDER CASE SHOWS FLAWS IN SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The double murderer Michael Poland should be seven days a
corpse, yet he breathes and eats and wakes each morning from a
sleep that's not eternal in the Arizona State Prison, which is one
level above the hell where he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Poland was to have been executed last Tuesday for the murders of
two armored-car guards but was spared by a last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It was torture for the families of the victims, who'll suffer
all their lives no matter what happens to the killer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an irresistible opportunity for politicians and
prosecutors to make speeches about how tough they are _ or would be
_ on crime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance for the rest of us to take to the streets over
the seemingly endless delays of this and every other death penalty
case.
</P>
<P>
   To form a mob.
</P>
<P>
   Light some torches.
</P>
<P>
   Git a rope.
</P>
<P>
   But . . . we didn't. &QL; 
It's not as if we'll weep when Poland is executed, as he will be,
eventually. Stone cold killers don't deserve sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But Poland alive doesn't bother us much, either. What we want,
and need, is for Poland to be out of circulation. And he is.
</P>
<P>
   The system worked.
</P>
<P>
   It's the death penalty that doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with morality or religion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is we can't agree on who should live and who should
die. Sentencing men like Poland to life without parole is something
just about everyone can agree on. Choosing those we want to execute
is what leads to the arguments, the appeals, the moral indignation.
</P>
<P>
   Is Poland worse than Theodore Kaczynski, the ``Unabomber,'' or
the 15-year-old who gunned down three students and wounded five
others at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky.?
</P>
<P>
   They got life.
</P>
<P>
   Is he worse than the Menendez brothers, who murdered their
parents for money and also got life?
</P>
<P>
   Is he worse than Jack Ray Hudson, the former Yuma County
sheriff's deputy convicted of murdering two fellow members of a
drug-enforcement task force? He got life, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they all should get the needle.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't matter. Eventually, we'd have to draw a line
somewhere to determine who lives and who dies, and the arguments
would start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the problem solves itself. Antonio Sapien, who
stabbed a Phoenix man 29 times and castrated him, received a life
sentence but hung himself with a bedsheet in prison. &QL; 
Most often, the problem isn't so easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Benjamin Smith was an 18-year-old Mesa High School senior
in 1966 when he ordered five women and two children to lie on a
floor and started firing. Only one woman and one child survived.
</P>
<P>
   Smith got life.
</P>
<P>
   We got protected from Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect trade-off. Not for the families of the
victims, who must believe Smith is more evil than Poland. I would
if I were them. And I'd want him dead.
</P>
<P>
   But life-without-parole works.
</P>
<P>
   And it eliminates the potential horrors described in a U.S.
Justice Department report that came out a few years ago, which
detailed 28 cases of men who had served a total of 197 years,
including three on death row for more than 25 years, before DNA
tests proved they were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty get what they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of time and degree.
</P>
<P>
   The double murderer Michael Poland breathes and eats and sleeps
in a bed in the Arizona State Prison, one level above the hell
where he belongs. He's been there for more than 20 years, which to
the families of his victims must seem like a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Like forever.
</P>
<P>
   It must seem that way to Poland, too.
</P>
<P>
   At least, it will until he takes his final breath, either by
natural causes or injection, and finds out what eternity really
means. &QL;

L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF UNDERGOES SURGERY AFTER FALL IN BATHTUB
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Tonight in story refers to Oct. 27.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block underwent
surgery Monday to remove a blood clot from his brain that developed
after he fell in the bathtub at his home over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Block's hospitalization came just one week before the
culmination of the 74-year-old sheriff's toughest re-election
campaign in which rival Lee Baca repeatedly questioned Block's
health and fitness to serve in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four-hour operation was successful and completed without
complications,'' said Dr. Srinath Samudrala, assistant professor of
neurological surgery at USC University Hospital, who issued a
statement on the sheriff's condition following the operation Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheriff Block tolerated the procedure well and is
recovering,'' Samudrala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to speculate on the length of his hospital
stay or recovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Block's wife, Alice, who was in the hospital during the
operation, compared her husband of 52 years to the Energizer Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know how gutsy he is. When the battery does run
down, I replace it,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Block's campaign consultants spent Monday preparing
contingency plans should his health deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are unchartered waters when something like this happens.
People in the campaign feel strongly about completing the campaign
like he is here,'' said Joe Scott, a consultant working on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Undersheriff Jerry Harper would fill in for Block at
a fund-raiser tonight hosted by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D.-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund-raising events are going on as scheduled,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a longtime public relations professional, said his
business cards advertise that he handle's crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought crisis management would take on ... capital
letters. No one has been through anything like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Shallman, another consultant for Block, said the campaign
would continue regardless of whether the sheriff is still in the
hospital Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to let it slip away to someone he has no faith
in,'' Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects Block to make a full recovery, much like he
has from other ailments in the past.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether voters will be more concerned about the sheriff's
health and his ability to serve four more years, Shallman said even
if Block eventually has to give up the post, a new sheriff
appointed by the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors would be better
than Baca.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, god forbid, something should happen to the sheriff, any
number of people could step forward to be a much better future
sheriff than Lee Baca has offered himself to be,'' Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Block has been locked in a fierce battle to retain his job
against Baca, a former department regional chief who in June forced
Block into the first run-off to lead the nation's largest sheriff's
department since he was elected in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Baca announced late Monday that he would suspend all personal
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect and concern for Mr. Block, his family and the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, I will not make any public
appearances as a candidate, nor attend scheduled debates until the
condition of Mr. Block is known,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have directed my campaign staff to alter as soon as possible
my media advertising so it no longer makes reference to Mr. Block.
My prayers are with Mr. Block and his family. I wish him a full and
speedy recovery,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Flores, a campaign consultant for Baca, said a radio spot
focusing on Block's previous health problems would be pulled and
that new radio ads would not mention Block. However Baca's media
campaign will continue.

LONG TALKS YIELD LITTLE SIGN OF PROGRESS IN LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Representatives of the National Basketball
Association and its locked-out players on Monday held the longest
negotiating session in their labor dispute, which has brought the
cancellation of the season's first two weeks, but chief negotiators
said that no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met all day and we didn't accomplish anything,'' Patrick
Ewing, the union president, said. ``We're going to meet tomorrow
and Wednesday, and hopefully we can come up with something. No
progress was made. They made a proposal, we made a proposal, we
made over various points, but nothing is concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said: ``We really
haven't made any progress. I don't want to call it a waste of time
_ that would be too strong. But it's hard for me or anybody to come
out of this meeting encouraged. Talking about systems is a nice
thing, but we're not going to have a deal until we look at some
real issues about how to fix the current climate. Right now we're
nowhere near that.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said on Monday night that he expected to announce more
game cancellations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides will meet on Tuesday, with the next major
bargaining sessions scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some players provided a more positive assessment of Monday's
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there has been minor progress, but we still have a
very long way to go,'' said Danny Schayes, one of 12 players who
attended the meeting, which lasted for about seven and a half hours
and adjourned about 10 p.m. ``We haven't agreed on one specific
yet, but it was definitely moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most productive talks, only because the other talks
went nowhere. We're finally in the same arena, but we're not in the
same section yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Schayes said a hard salary cap, something the players adamantly
oppose, was not discussed during the session, adding that David
Stern, the NBA commissioner, was willing to entertain other
proposals that might let the players keep their flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, David has been willing to talk about other issues, and
we're working to address their cost controls,'' Schayes said. ``We
always felt that the NBA's prior proposals all looked for a way to
back into a hard cap. But that wasn't the case today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the two sides could be zeroing in on an agreement in
the next two weeks, Schayes replied: ``I wouldn't want to put a
date on it right now, but then again it could be one of those
things where there's three months of nothing and a day and a half
of getting a deal done. But my personal feeling is, some limited
progress was made today.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Before, we were 1,000 miles apart. Now, we're maybe
800 miles apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at a midtown hotel, came one day before the
league's labor relations committee was scheduled to meet in
Manhattan to discuss the stalemate that has led to the cancellation
of the first two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Before last weekend, there had been no substantive negotiations
since Oct. 13. But Stern and Granik met with the union's chief
negotiators, the executive director Billy Hunter and Ewing, for
three and a half hours on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The second meeting in three days indicates the growing concern
over lost games and the potential for losing the entire season
should the dispute continue.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have indicated flexibility on many of the key
economic issues that have held up previous negotiations. While the
players have said they will not tolerate a hard salary cap, the
owners have indicated they are willing to discuss any proposal that
might increase their total share of the basketball revenue. This
includes a tax on clubs with salaries above a certain level, a
proposal by the players that has been bandied about by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The owners want certainty on costs, while the players have said
they want to keep their right to earn as much as they can through a
clause known as the Larry Bird exception.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the clause were discussed. Also, a participant
in the meeting said, both sides have talked openly about raising
the minimum salary for veterans with 10 or more years of experience
to more than $750,000. The minimum salary last season was $272,500,
a figure that 20 percent of players earned.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting of the NBA board of governors could be a key
to the negotiations. The union has invited all 400-plus members to
attend talks that will also include owners and ownership
representatives from the league's 29 teams.

STEELERS DEFEAT CHIEFS, 20-13 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pittsburgh and Kansas City have met for three
consecutive seasons on Monday nights in Arrowhead Stadium. By now,
the dance is familiar: play it close, grind it on defense and make
something good happen at the end. And maybe most important: watch
the turnover battle.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game followed the formula. But it was Pittsburgh
that made something happen on offense late. And then the Steelers
gained the game's big turnovers _ two, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   It wound up a 20-13 Pittsburgh victory before 79,431 fans,
Arrowhead's fifth-largest crowd ever. The Chiefs are 4-3 and have
lost to Pittsburgh (5-2), Jacksonville (5-2) and New England (4-3),
all American Football Conference playoff favorites who have the
head-to-head tie-breaker edge on Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh led by 10-6 at halftime and nearly lost the lead on
the second-half kickoff, but a holding penalty negated a 95-yard
touchdown return by the Chiefs' Joe Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers made it 13-6 late in the third quarter on a Norm
Johnson field goal set up by a 17-yard pass from the rookie Hines
Ward _ a running back-receiver-quarterback at Georgia _ to the
Steelers' quarterback, Kordell Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chiefs' Andre Rison scored on a 2-yard pass from Elvis
Grbac with 2 minutes 28 seconds left in the third quarter, the
score was tied at 13-13.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh made the next move. Stewart passed 5 yards to Charles
Johnson with 10:05 remaining, and the Steelers led, 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   Then with 4:28 left, Pittsburgh cornerback Carnell Lake
intercepted Grbac's pass at the Steeler 38. With 57 seconds left,
linebacker Jason Gildon forced Grbac to fumble and Lethon Flowers
recovered near the Kansas City 20.
</P>
<P>
   The dance was over with the usual ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to come up with some big plays, particularly
defensively,'' Steelers Coach Bill Cowher said. ``Tonight we were
able to finish things off. A good football team reacts and
responds, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Bettis ran 33 times for 119 yards as Pittsburgh ground
out 182 yards on 43 carries. The Chiefs ran only 19 times, for 72
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of place you can't come in to and
overreact,'' Gildon said. ``They've got the crowd and they've got
the noise, but if you're able to play defense and stop the run,
then it gives you a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers took the opening kickoff and ran nine plays before
punting from the Kansas City 48. Chiefs kick returner Tamarick
Vanover signaled for a fair catch but at the last second moved up,
away from the ball, and let it bounce. It hit just inside the
Chiefs' 10-yard line and rolled, and the Steelers downed the ball
inside the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, the Chiefs were punting from their end zone,
the Steelers swarmed punter Louie Aguiar, and Lance Brown easily
blocked the punt. Fred McAfee recovered the ball in the end zone
for a touchdown. Pittsburgh led by 7-0 with 8:05 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar had not had a punt blocked in 587 previous attempts as a
pro. It was Pittsburgh's first blocked punt for a touchdown since
Jan.2, 1983, against Cleveland. It was the first block against
Kansas City since Dec. 12, 1993, in a game with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were punting from the end zone,'' McAfee said, ``for
our punt team it was like the dog going after the mailman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs wanted desperately to respond, but did so in an odd
way.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City started its next drive at its 29 and stalled at the
Pittsburgh 37. The Chiefs then took a risky shot on fourth-and-5.
Grbac passed to tight end Tony Gonzalez for 31 yards to the
Pittsburgh 6. Kansas City then moved only to the 3 and settled for
a Pete Stoyanovich 20-yard field goal. Pittsburgh led, 7-3, with
5:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the second quarter, Kansas City again moved inside of
the Pittsburgh 20, to the 11, but the drive stalled again.
Stoyanovich kicked a 28-yard field goal and it was 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly the final 13 minutes of the half, the score remained
7-6. Stewart was 5 of 11 passing for 47 yards in the half, and 24
of those yards came on one play. Stewart's 24-yard pass to receiver
David Dunn to the Kansas City 30 with 13 seconds left gave
Pittsburgh a chance to score the final points before halftime, Norm
Johnson's 34-yard field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of the game was driven by two things: our
penalties and our turnovers,'' Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer
said. ``Until we understand the importance of that and accept that
and do something about it, we're going to continue to have the same
problem.''

LOS ANGELES:   campaign will continue.

<P>
   Shallman, though, continued to criticize Baca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last week they called him a sick old man. Now they're
trying to backpedal from those offensive remarks,''Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called the hospital and
offered Block's top aides his best wishes for a speedy recovery,
said the mayor's spokeswoman, Noelia Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Block fell Saturday and needed 10 stitches to close a wound to
his head. He was released from a Humana Columbia Hospital in the
L.A. suburb of West Hills that day, but began feeling dizzy and
disoriented about four hours later as he prepared to go to a
fund-raiser, according to Sheriff's Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   His family called 911 and he was taken to USC University
Hospital in Boyle Heights, a Los Angeles suburb, where surgeons
operated on him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Block already has fought off prostate cancer and non-Hodgkins
lymphoma and currently undergoes dialysis three times a week for
treatment of a serious kidney ailment. He has said he wanted a
kidney transplant after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his health problems, Block has run a vigorous campaign
for a fifth term as part of his efforts to deflect Baca's assertion
that it is time for him to retire because of his health.
</P>
<P>
   Baca also claimed that Block planned to quit after winning
re-election, forcing the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to
appoint his handpicked successor to the job. Former Los Angeles
Police Department Capt. Mark Kroeker's name has surfaced as a
likely candidate, and he has said he would consider the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Block has denied those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Block's name will appear on the ballot Nov. 3, regardless of his
physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   If he is re-elected but is unable to serve for any reason, the
supervisors are required to pick a successor, said Conny McCormack,
the county's registrar-recorder-county clerk.
</P>
<P>
   A special election would be held in November 2000 if the sheriff
were to leave office in the first two years of his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said county lawyers would have to research whether the
supervisors could appoint a successor if a sheriff became
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack noted that her office has already received some
115,000 absentee ballots. But anyone who wants to change their vote
in any contest because of recent developments is out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you send in a ballot, you can't get it back,'' McCormack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Block is the nation's highest-paid elected official, earning
$234,016 a year _ more than the president's $200,000-a-year annual
salary.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff supervises 12,400 employees, including 8,000
deputies, and is responsible for providing police services to 2.5
million people in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County and 40
incorporated cities that contract for services. The department also
operates the nation's largest urban jail system, with 19,000
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Myles Saunders, a neurosurgeon with Cedars Sinai Medical Center
who was not involved in Block's surgery, said the swift treatment
of Block's condition should help lead to successful recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of these patients, barring some
complication, will retain normal brain function,'' he said.
``That's what I fully expect of him. I expect him to return to work
in an estimated three weeks, four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that there is a risk of brain swelling several days
after surgery. But barring such a complication, he said the surgery
should not interfere with Block's duties as sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many patients at his age, and with the type of problem that he
has could return to a highly rigorous, intellectual and physical
job of that type,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said that patients suffering kidney failure are at
greater than average risk of brain bleeding after head injuries.
But he said Block's kidney disease should not significantly affect
his recovery. &QL;

THREE FIGHT FOR FRANCHISE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The work, conducted at a breakneck pace,
wasn't completed until the weekend, just beating the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of an NFL expansion team in the Coliseum got what
they desired: an entirely new design for a renovation of the
ancient facility, and, more important, something to counter the
dazzling stadium mock-ups of expansion proposals in Carson and in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes game of show and tell officially kicks off
today, as all three prospective expansion groups make presentations
at the fall meeting of the NFL's owners and chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   The league is hopeful of awarding its 32nd franchise next year
and having it on the field in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable curiosity about what kind of Hollywood
flair Michael Ovitz might demonstrate on behalf of the Carson
project, which proposes a hacienda-style stadium on a landfill at
the junction of the San Diego and Harbor freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be very interesting and I would like to see
it myself, but I haven't been invited,'' said Houston
multimillionaire Robert McNair, whose group will counter with a
design for a retractable-roof stadium next to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our perspective is, this is really a business, and
there has to be substance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   All three groups can expect pointed questions _ now and in the
coming months _ on how they intend to crunch their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But a little flash won't hurt any causes today. That's why the
Coliseum group, faced with Ovitz's tolling mission bells and
Houston's giant moonroof, signed with the architectural firm NBBJ
Associates just a few weeks ago and begged for a dramatic makeover
of their previous design. They can only hope the NFL owners can be
fooled into thinking it isn't the Coliseum anymore.
</P>
<P>
   New Coliseum Partners released photographs of the model Monday,
while NBBJ employees began to assemble it in a hotel ballroom here.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hallmark, NBBJ's principal architect on the project, and
John Semcken, New Coliseum Partners executive vice president,
pointed out the new wrinkles:
</P>
<P>
   _The south and north portions of the stadium constructed in
three levels, with three levels of luxury suites rather than the
previous two.
</P>
<P>
   _A canopy over each of the two structures.
</P>
<P>
   _A grove of palm trees just inside the peristyle end, with a
restaurant and a Hollywood Bowl-like box seating area between the
trees and the east end zone.
</P>
<P>
   _A park-like area and affordable family seating at the west end.
</P>
<P>
   _Facility for expandable seating at the west end for Super Bowls
and major college games like USC-Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the expansion of the venue,'' said City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, ``we'll have the largest club lounge in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this would be positioned within the gutted walls of the
current stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, our issue was to try to preserve the peristyle
and the exterior wall,'' Hallmark said. ``It costs a tremendous
amount of resources to develop these kinds of entrances and these
kinds of exterior expressions in new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've determined that, in fact, those elements are in exactly
the right place for us to do what we want to do with this design.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that perhaps 80 percent of the seating would be along
the north and south sides of the playing field, with high end zone
and high corner seating eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners are likely to be impressed by all three
expansion-site designs. But this is a group that divides its
windfall of television revenues equally, so it will also want to be
certain each proposal is on solid footing for ultimate financial
success. That likely will mean inquiries about Carson's sudden
pledge of $180 million in bonds for a stadium and mall, and about
the Coliseum group's insistence that Los Angeles fans will line up
to pay dearly for a club seat at ... well, the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is,'' said Houston's McNair, ``can you build the
project? Do you have the money? Do you know how to operate it?''

DODGERS DROP MARTINEZ'S OPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers ace Ramon Martinez, who
underwent career-threatening shoulder surgery last June, will not
receive his $5.6 million salary for 1999 but is expected to remain
with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The club on Monday did not exercise its option on next year's
contract for Martinez, who is technically a free agent. The Dodgers
said they will try to re-sign him at a lower figure.
</P>
<P>
   They also did not pick up the option for veteran outfielder Jim
Eisenreich, who would have received $1.4 million. Instead,
Eisenreich, 39, will get a $200,000 buyout. Martinez, 30, will
receive $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenreich, who hinted about retiring this past season, now is
talking about playing another year, perhaps in Minnesota, where he
began his career in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who pitched a no-hitter in 1995 and struck out 18
in one game during the 20-victory 1990 season, has been the
Dodgers' top pitcher for most of his 10 major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He also is the leader of the Dodgers' large Latin contingent and
perhaps the most admired member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate and respect Ramon and we need to keep him
here,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said Monday. ``But
with no assurances that he will pitch in 1999, it is not fiscally
responsible to pick up the option for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have acknowledged since Martinez went down with a
torn rotator cuff last June that his option was a delicate subject.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's brother, Pedro, who signed a $77.5 million contract
last year with Boston after winning the National League Cy Young
Award, had talked about Ramon joining him next year with the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But Pedro later said Boston might be a bad fit because its rabid
fans would not be sympathetic to Ramon's long rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe, who repaired extensive muscle
and cartilage damage in Martinez's shoulder, said he was optimistic
Martinez could resume pitching next June.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA before the injury. Eisenreich,
acquired May 15 from Florida, batted .215 with one homer and 13 RBI
with the Dodgers and Marlins.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's show time!
</P>
<P>
   And who better to put on a show than Michael Ovitz?
</P>
<P>
   After all, he built the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) into the
biggest and most successful in Hollywood, he helped launch the
acting careers of Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, took David
Letterman to CBS and picked Disney's pocket for a $128 million
severance package. That alone should win him a few fans in
America's most exclusive sport's fraternity, the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the league's owners will entertain presentations from
three groups seeking an expansion franchise _ Ovitz/Carson, the New
Coliseum and Houston. Each group gets an hour to show its best
open-field moves and answer owners' questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz hour will include a model of The Hacienda, the
proposed stadium in Carson _ a model that is so big it has to be
dismantled to fit in a freight elevator. The presentation will also
include a film that Ovitz aides describe as ``evocative.'' It will
extol the virtues of a multinational Los Angeles, link the
experience to family values and hammer home that L.A. is the No. 2
market in America and the world's 11th-richest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will not decide on its 32nd team this week, but Ovitz is
clearly hoping to be a showstopper and leave Kansas City as the
front-runner. But Kansas City is not Cannes and NFL owners are not
a sentimental bunch. Mostly, the owners want to be sure any
proposal has financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   The league once gave lukewarm support to a proposed stadium near
Hollywood Park but bailed as soon as it realized R. D. Hubbard
didn't have the money to make it happen. It threw out author Tom
Clancy's bid to buy the Minnesota Vikings for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz group has had a stock answer for every question since
its campaign began: ``We have it covered.'' But at today's
meetings, the league will want facts and figures. Anyone caught tap
dancing will get the hook. The owners will want to know exactly how
much money Ovitz will be contributing to the project; a list of his
fellow owners and their finances; details on the involvement of
Herbert Glimcher, the realtor who holds the option to buy the land
and a construction timetable.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the owners, will be more circumspect about Los
Angeles than any other prospective city because of the experiences
with the Rams and Raiders. ``If we return to Los Angeles, it's
critical the situation does not fail,'' said Roger Goodell, the
NFL's vice president of development.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's biggest edge is the stadium. The league's No.1 goal is
to have every team in the league playing in a new or near-new
stadium. The four teams that have pulled the plug _ Rams, Raiders,
Browns and Oilers _ left for new or renovated stadiums and big
up-front bucks. The only protection a city has is its willingness
to make a sizable donation to the NFL coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Cleveland. One day it has the Browns and a fanatical
following. The next, it's without a team and, a few years later, a
new owner has to pony up a $535 million expansion fee. Ovitz is
willing to play the game because after years in Hollywood he's used
to it and does it well.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum can't compete because, in part, it's not new.
Kings owner Ed Roski could show the league a zillion sketches of a
renovated Coliseum, but the owners still acquaint it with the
departure of the Rams and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   And when Roski takes the stage, he will do so without L.A. Mayor
Richard Riordan (he'll say hello via videotape), without his hockey
partner, Philip Anschutz (who is too busy buying soccer teams) and
without Peter O'Malley (who the NFL once thought would be a swell
partner). The NFL is simply not going to turn over the nation's
No.2 market to someone this shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   An existing team is another matter. Five teams want a new
stadium _ Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, New England and Arizona _
and the situations in San Francisco and Buffalo are worth watching
because stadium plans are notoriously shaky. Don't be surprised if
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill starts getting cozy with Roski and the
New Coliseum group reciprocates. Arizona ranks last in the league
in attendance. That might be the only way the Coliseum beats Ovitz
to a NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens today. We'll know by Wednesday whether any of the
locals get two thumbs up.

L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF UNDERGOES SURGERY AFTER FALL IN BATHTUB
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Tonight in story refers to Oct. 27. Corrects

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block underwent
surgery Monday to remove a blood clot from his brain that developed
after he fell in the bathtub at his home over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Block's hospitalization came just one week before the
culmination of the 74-year-old sheriff's toughest re-election
campaign in which rival Lee Baca repeatedly questioned Block's
health and fitness to serve in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four-hour operation was successful and completed without
complications,'' said Dr. Srinath Samudrala, assistant professor of
neurological surgery at USC University Hospital, who issued a
statement on the sheriff's condition following the operation Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheriff Block tolerated the procedure well and is
recovering,'' Samudrala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to speculate on the length of his hospital
stay or recovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Block's wife, Alyce, who was in the hospital during the
operation, compared her husband of 52 years to the Energizer Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know how gutsy he is. When the battery does run
down, I replace it,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Block's campaign consultants spent Monday preparing
contingency plans should his health deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are unchartered waters when something like this happens.
People in the campaign feel strongly about completing the campaign
like he is here,'' said Joe Scott, a consultant working on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Undersheriff Jerry Harper would fill in for Block at
a fund-raiser tonight hosted by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D.-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund-raising events are going on as scheduled,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a longtime public relations professional, said his
business cards advertise that he handle's crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought crisis management would take on ... capital
letters. No one has been through anything like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Shallman, another consultant for Block, said the campaign
would continue regardless of whether the sheriff is still in the
hospital Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to let it slip away to someone he has no faith
in,'' Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects Block to make a full recovery, much like he
has from other ailments in the past.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether voters will be more concerned about the sheriff's
health and his ability to serve four more years, Shallman said even
if Block eventually has to give up the post, a new sheriff
appointed by the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors would be better
than Baca.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, god forbid, something should happen to the sheriff, any
number of people could step forward to be a much better future
sheriff than Lee Baca has offered himself to be,'' Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   Block has been locked in a fierce battle to retain his job
against Baca, a former department regional chief who in June forced
Block into the first run-off to lead the nation's largest sheriff's
department since he was elected in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Baca announced late Monday that he would suspend all personal
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect and concern for Mr. Block, his family and the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, I will not make any public
appearances as a candidate, nor attend scheduled debates until the
condition of Mr. Block is known,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have directed my campaign staff to alter as soon as possible
my media advertising so it no longer makes reference to Mr. Block.
My prayers are with Mr. Block and his family. I wish him a full and
speedy recovery,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Flores, a campaign consultant for Baca, said a radio spot
focusing on Block's previous health problems would be pulled and
that new radio ads would not mention Block. However Baca's media
campaign will continue.

COYOTES PUT ON SHOW FOR BOSS, BURY AVALANCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Bobby Smith wasn't planning on being at McNichols Arena
on Monday night. But after Valley thunderstorms canceled his flight
to Anaheim to see Sunday's game against the Mighty Ducks, the
general manager for the Coyotes decided to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Was he ever glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, shaking off a tough loss in Dallas and a disturbing
tie in Anaheim, jumped all over the sliding Colorado Avalanche and
pounded the former Stanley Cup champions, 5-1, in their best effort
so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a feeling it was going to be a good night for his
club. When asked before the game if he was concerned about the
Coyotes' 2-2-1 start, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not. I like the way this team is playing . . . I'm
very optimistic about things right now. Very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was every reason to feel that way Monday, as the Coyotes
shelled goalie Patrick Roy and a Colorado defense that was missing
a few key players.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Keith Tkachuk led the way with two goals and an assist,
and the Coyotes also got goals from Jeremy Roenick, Rick Tocchet
and Cliff Ronning to beat the Avalanche for the second time in two
weeks after going 0-7-1 against Colorado since relocating to
Phoenix from Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a legitimate reward for the way our guys have been
playing the last nine periods,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``It
was nice to see them have a game where they were able to score some
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Jimmy Waite, meanwhile, was nearly perfect in his first
start of the season, stopping every shot he faced until Keith Jones
finally snapped the shutout on the power play with 3:21 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have stopped that shot,'' Waite said. ``It's a little
frustrating (losing the shutout), but I'm happy with the win. . . .
I didn't see too many shots (he faced only 20), but I'd like to
have all my games like that, it would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Coyotes' largest margin of victory since they
defeated Anaheim, 5-1, on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Coyotes now have scored 10 goals in two games
against the team they couldn't seem to beat. Even more amazing, the
goalie who never seems to lose to them, is in one of the worst
slumps of his career. Roy had owned the Coyotes. In 21 previous
games against the franchise, he was 18-1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Just like their past two games in Dallas and in Anaheim, the
Coyotes jumped to the early lead. But this time they just kept
pouring it on.
</P>
<P>
   The Tkachuk-Roenick-Dallas Drake line got it started four
minutes into the game when Tkachuk zipped a one-timer from the top
of the left circle that went through Roy's pads. Drake and Roenick
got the assists.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick made it 2-0 at the 9:44 mark as Phoenix finally
converted on the power play, ending an 0-for-9 drought. The Coyotes
added another one, when Ronning beat Roy on a pass from Tocchet
midway through the second. With 31 seconds left in the period,
Tocchet stuck a dagger into the Avalanche, putting the Coyotes up,
4-0, by wristing in a feed from Ronning.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk added to the deluge with his second goal and fourth of
the season at 5:49 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how he is when he gets on one of those rolls,''
Schoenfeld said of Tkachuk, a two-time 50-goal scorer. ``They
usually last a couple of months.'' &QL;

ISLANDERS FRANCHISE SINKING FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ To be fair, it was the night the New York
Yankees ended their sweep of the San Diego Padres, so a lot of Long
Islanders understandably opted to sit in front of their
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   But that same night last week at Nassau Coliseum, an
embarrassingly small crowd _ fewer than 3,000 _ turned out to watch
the Edmonton Oilers beat the New York Islanders, who play host to
the Kings tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Official attendance was ``not available'' according to Islanders
officials, who probably would somehow manage to count to 16,297 if
they had a sellout, but couldn't count to 2,800 when their building
was 80 percent empty.
</P>
<P>
   The ``crowd'' was the latest sign of decay for a once-proud
franchise that captured four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980-83.
The low turnout, however, shouldn't have come as a huge surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Islanders haven't made the playoffs since
1994, and their best and most exciting player _ scoring ace Zigmund
Palffy _ remains an unsigned, restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Islanders owners tried, and failed, to get the
Coliseum condemned as unsafe before the season began. Now Islanders
management is asking fans to turn out to watch a team that tried to
move out of a building the franchise's owners call unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a marketing nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   The days of Denis Potvin, Bryan Trottier and Mike Bossy seem
distant, though Islanders coach and general manager Mike Milbury is
maintaining some optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have won every game,'' said Milbury, whose
team is 3-4. ``There's no doubt in my mind we can compete with
anybody _ anybody we've seen so far, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   No end in sight?: In less than three months, Wayne Gretzky will
turn 38. He has just begun his 20th season in the NHL. Nonetheless,
there are signs that Gretzky is going to continue to play for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking me,'' said Gretzky, who has seven
points in the New York Rangers' first eight games. ``My kids ask
every day. I honestly don't know. I do know if I decide to quit, I
won't tell anybody until there's about a month to go in the season.
I don't want a farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing my agent, Mike Barnett, and I argue
about. I've had victory laps for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers coach John Muckler said, ``He walked into the practice
rink the other day and said, `Who do I complain to about my ice
time? I'm not getting enough.' I'd just played him 28 minutes on
back-to-back nights. Believe me, he's still having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfair criticism: When Phoenix's Keith Tkachuk rushed out of
practice recently, refusing to sign autographs, he incurred the
wrath of several fans, one of whom wrote a letter that was
published in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The letter referred to Tkachuk as ``the biggest jerk in the
game'' and a ``disgrace to the sport and the Phoenix Coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Tkachuk was rushing to a Phoenix hospital, where
his wife, who was five weeks pregnant, was having a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on except me, and I didn't even
know how bad it was until I got there,'' said Tkachuk, whose
exhibition season holdout hadn't endeared him to Coyotes fans in
the first place. ``Being a hockey player was the least on my mind
that day. What was important, what is important, is my family,
first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxi driver: When the Kings were at Florida last week, several
of their broadcasters wanted to go to practice the day before the
game. They told their cab driver to take them to the National Car
Rental Center, the Panthers' new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Either misunderstanding or not familiar with the corporate
takeover of professional sports, the driver instead took them to
the rental-car area at the Fort Lauderdale airport.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, when the Kings move into their new arena, it is
almost inevitable that some poor sap will be taken by a taxi driver
to an office-supply store.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and sober: The Kings visit New Jersey on Wednesday, and
it's nearly a year since Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko had his last
drink. He underwent alcohol rehabilitation last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fun drunk, never got too rowdy,'' Daneyko said. ``But
I knew my problem was deep inside. I felt empty. I'd be lonely all
the time even if I was surrounded by lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko said he carries an article about the late Mickey Mantle
in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take it out every couple of months and say, `Gee, that
sounds like me,' '' Daneyko said. ``I wasn't an everyday drinker
then, but I knew I would be when I quit. I also read where Mickey
said he wasn't close to his family because of his drinking. That
was me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: San Jose opened Thursday's game against Chicago
with two goals in the first 47 seconds, the fastest anyone had done
that to the Blackhawks in nearly 18 years. The Sharks then settled
for a 2-2 tie. Chicago coach Dirk Graham benched veteran defenseman
Chris Chelios for 7 minutes after the Sharks' first goal. ``I don't
have to sit Chris Chelios for him to understand what's going on,''
Graham said. ``I did that for a while because I thought some of our
other players were better prepared. We'll do that with any player
we think is not ready to play _ whether it's Chris Chelios or
anyone else.''... Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk had the winning goal and
an assist in his first game back in the lineup, which came six
months to the day after he suffered injuries requiring
reconstructive surgery on both knees when checked by San Jose's
Bryan Marchment....
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick on having four wisdom teeth extracted:
``It was a piece of cake. They put you out, you wake up, and you
chew on one side of your mouth a little bit and drool a lot. No big
deal.''... Pittsburgh defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, returning to
the lineup following a knee injury, was asked if he expected
opponents to target the injured area. `My whole body is a
bull's-eye,' Kasparaitis said.

A TIGHT SQUEEZE AT ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Seat 101 in Row 17 at the Rose Bowl looks
harmless enough.
</P>
<P>
   But that seat, and the thousands like it, has been drawing mixed
reviews since the UCLA football team opened its home season five
weeks ago. There just doesn't seem to be enough leg room for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Like his friends, Chris Bartold, a 19-year-old biochemistry
major at UCLA, had his legs draped over the seat in front of him on
Saturday when the Bruins played Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The seats) looked nicer,'' said Bartold, who is from Woodland
Hills, ``but when you actually sat down, it was not comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the popular opinion in the student section, where
Bartold was sitting. But across the stadium, H.M. Wammack and his
wife Beth could not have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   The Wammacks, who live in Glendale, have been season-ticket
holders since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful because you're not touching your neighbors
anymore,'' Beth said. ``How can you complain about seats like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said people have
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have written to me,'' Dalis said. ``Some say
they are not going to renew their season tickets next year (because
of the new seating). But a lot of time people get upset and say
those things, and then they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Jacobs, the Rose Bowl general manager, came up with a
33-point plan in 1993 to modernize the 75-year-old stadium. Seats
were put at the top of the list. Despite hosting four Super Bowls
and a World Cup, the Rose Bowl had only bleacher seating prior to
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-decade, when there were seeds of interest in luring an NFL
team to play in the Rose Bowl, new seats were a priority. When the
NFL deal fell through, Jacobs still wanted to make the stadium more
fan-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a college facility,'' he said. ``Our goal is to be the
best college facility possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A $6 million seat renovation project began in February. It
wasn't finished until August (there was a a delay when the first
batch of seats were, ironically, too small in width). When the
installation was complete, Rose Bowl capacity had decreased from
100,807 to 92,000. There are about 60,000 of the new seats.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Rick Purdy, associate athletic director at UCLA,
expressed concern about moving season-ticket holders' seats for the
new configuration. After the season's first month, he found out
what people were really concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear I had about people being concerned about their
location was much less than I anticipated,'' he said. ``What
certainly has been more of a problem has been the comfortability.''
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of the Rose Bowl simply cannot afford seats
with more leg room, Jacobs said. There won't be another project to
increase the length between the rows of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said the ``vast majority'' of season-ticket holders have
been pleased with the new seats. When the choice is less stress on
the back or increased leg room, the new seats are winning by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much better on your back,'' said Jeff Scanlan, one of
the dozens of UCLA game-management officials who work home games.
``On the bench seats, my knees go into the person's back, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said during the Texas game, there were about 60
complaints. The attendance that day was 73,060.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's less than 1 percent,'' he said. ``If you talked to
99.99 percent of the people that come here, they would tell you
those seats are very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are complaining _ people who are 6-foot or taller or
severely overweight _ are being accomodated. Ushers like Scanlan
are letting people who cannot fit into the seats sit in the
handicapped sections that were also created in the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The students who pay $6 to sit in the student section don't like
the new seats for another reason: In the bleachers, more fans than
actually fit can occupy a row. In many cases, fans were packed in
like sardines.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said that was a common problem around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you got in, you were locked in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said there may have been unrealistic expectations for fans
when they heard last summer that new seats were being installed in
the Rose Bowl. Even he equated ``new'' with ``roomier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the logical thing for people to think,'' he
said. ``For people who are 6-2, 6-3... it's tough. I don't deny
it.''

ANKLE STORY CHANGES AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The mystery surrounding Dallas Drake's ankle injury
seems to grow wackier by the day.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Coyotes announced that the right wing would miss four
to six weeks after suffering a fracture during a freak mishap in
the final seconds of a recent practice. Two days later, they
announced the medical staff had made a mistake, that tests
eventually revealed it was simply remnants of an old injury.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but before Monday's game against the Colorado Avalanche,
Drake said he doesn't remember having suffered a fractured ankle
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did, I don't remember it hurting me very much because I
can't remember missing a bunch of games,'' Drake said. ``Who knows?
Maybe I was born with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake said the ankle felt sore both during and after Sunday's
2-2 tie at Anaheim. But it won't be enough to keep him out of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he said. ``Not after getting such great news. I was
ecstatic when I got the call from (team trainer) Gord (Hart).
Christmas came early for me that day. I was jumping for joy. I was
home alone and just started going nuts. My dog thought I was
whacked.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Waiting for No. 1 &QL;  &QL; 
Veteran left wing Greg Adams, who signed as a free agent this
summer, is still searching for his first goal in a Phoenix uniform
after six games. The off-ice officials inadvertently credited him
with one last week in Dallas, but it was reversed and given to
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has only one assist and is a minus-4, but General Manager
Bobby Smith isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've been quite pleased with Greg Adams,'' Smith
said. ``He is probably our best forward in terms of hockey
sense.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Nasty Nik &QL;  &QL; 
Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who was given the night off Monday,
doesn't back down when an opposing player strays into his territory
and tries to take a few liberties. The 25-year-old Russian proved
that again Sunday in Anaheim, when he drew a roughing minor for
retaliating against Stu Grimson after the Mighty Ducks' enforcer
plowed into him early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin had 22 penalty minutes last season, which ranked
among the league leaders for goalies. &QL;  &QL; 
Slapshots &QL;  &QL; 
Center Jeremy Roenick took a hard slapshot off the foot in the
final moments of Sunday's game, but X-rays proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   Center Cliff Ronning reached one milestone Sunday by appearing
in his 700th NHL game, and he's approaching another. He needs two
goals to reach the 200 mark.

NG MURDER TRIAL OPENS WITH CHILLING VIDEOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ Two women who were among Charles Ng's
alleged murder victims took center stage at his trial Monday _
appearing on chilling videotapes in which they are bound,
terrorized and threatened with sexual enslavement or death.
</P>
<P>
   In one clip, Ng taunts his victim and uses a knife to cut off
her bra. As the sequence was shown in the courtroom, several
members of the mostly female jury blanched.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also was shown a short clip in which Ng's alleged crime
partner, Leonard Lake, describes his plan to capture young women
and hold them as sexual slaves in special cells built in the
basement of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed in their opening
statements that the murders Ng is accused of were the product of a
hideous plot, but they differed on who committed them. Ng's
defenders said the slayings were Lake's work and that Ng was not
directly involved. Prosecutors portrayed Ng as a planner and
willing participant in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Proving which version is true will be complicated by the fact
that Lake committed suicide in 1985, shortly after he was arrested
by South San Francisco police at the beginning of the
investigation. Nevertheless, his presence will be felt in the
courtroom in coming days through portions of his diary and homemade
videotapes that will be introduced as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As 12 jurors and six alternates listened intently in a courtroom
on the 11th floor of the Orange County Courthouse, both sides
argued that the victims _ seven men, three women and two children _
were ``collected'' in accordance with the ``Miranda Diaries,'' a
journal Lake wrote over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 12 people disappeared off the face of the earth,'' said
state Deputy Attorney General Sharlene Honnaka, ((cq)) who is
prosecuting Ng with Calaveras County District Attorney Peter Smith.
``Leonard Lake and Charles Ng planned and committed the murders
charged in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the victims were the unwilling stars of horrific homemade
videotape clips Honnaka played for jurors during her opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Kathleen Allen, her hands tied tightly behind her back,
stares wide-eyed as Lake, who is off-camera, gives her an ultimatum
in a voice devoid of emotion: agree to become a slave to Lake and
Ng or ``we will probably put a round in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't go along with this, we're going to take you into
the bed, tie you down, shoot you and bury you,'' Lake says as the
young woman sits in obvious terror.
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, Lake tells a bound Brenda O'Connor, ``You
will work for us, you will cook for us, you will f_ for us . . . or
we'll take you outside, rape you and shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   After O'Connor agrees, Ng, stripped to the waist, walks into the
frame of the videotape, tears off the red-and-white baseball shirt
she is wearing, then uses a large folding knife to cut off her
brassiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cry and stuff like all the rest of them,'' Ng says as
he unties her hands, ``but it won't do you any good. We're pretty
cold-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kelley, an assistant Orange County public defender who
is representing Ng, portrayed the crimes as solely the work of
Leonard Lake, a man he said was obsessed with ``The Collector,'' a
psychological thriller written by British novelist John Fowles.
</P>
<P>
   He read passages from Lake's diaries that show his fixation on
the book and his determination to follow its lead by collecting his
own group of sexual slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of this project, the excitement, the thrill if
it succeeds _ even the excitement if it fails and I get caught _ is
very attractive,'' Kelley quoted Lake's journal as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unsettling video clip was played for jurors by
Ng's own lawyers. In the short segment, Lake, sitting in a recliner
chair, calmly and dispassionately describes his plan to enslave
young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is an off-the-shelf sex partner,'' he says, his
face devoid of expression. ``I want to be able to use a woman any
way I want. And when I'm bored . . . I want to be able to simply
put her away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley acknowledged that prosecutors will present a mountain of
evidence showing that the 12 victims were kidnapped and killed but
argued that none of it is directly connected to Ng.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Lake is believed to have killed at least
four other people, including his own brother, during a two-year
period when Ng was being held in a military prison in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that Lake killed all the victims himself, Kelley said
Ng may have known about Lake's crimes but did not help him commit
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that Charles Ng is an angel,'' Kelley said.
``He's certainly not that. That's apparent. But he's charged with
murder here, remember _ ending people's lives, not cutting off
their clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening statements were almost anticlimactic, considering
that it has taken 13 years for the case to come to trial. The
prosecution took only 45 minutes to outline the evidence it hopes
to present, and the defense side took only five minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon, the first of what promises to be a parade of
witnesses took the stand, and the prosecution began to reconstruct
the history of the case for jurors.
</P>
<P>
   As described in testimony by two South San Francisco police
officers, the string of homicides came to light in June 1985 as the
result of a bungled attempt to shoplift a vise from a building
supply store in South San Francisco. Ng, who was trying to steal
the tool, got away, but Lake was detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   They found that Lake was using the driver's license and credit
cards of Scott Stapley, who was later identified as one of the
murder victims. The license plate on his vehicle was that of Lonnie
Bonds Sr., another alleged victim, and the car itself belonged to
Paul Cosner, a man who had disappeared from his San Francisco home
seven months earlier.
</P>

   After officers arrested him and took him to the South San
Francisco police station, Lake killed himself by swallowing a
cyanide capsule. Investigators found evidence in the car he was
driving that helped them track Lake and Ng back to a small compound
in Calaveras County, where they began to uncover evidence of the
slayings.

   After Lake's capture, Ng made his way to Canada, where he was
arrested after trying to steal merchandise from a Calgary
department store. He was confined to a Canadian prison for the
attempted robbery and was extradited upon his release in 1991. &QL;

IN DEAL, FONG PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR GAY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI, MARK SIMON  
 and JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong, reeling from reports of
his financial link to one of California's most virulently anti-gay
and anti-abortion groups, signed a unique pledge of support Monday
for a list of major gay-rights issues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unprecedented written agreement came after gay Republican
groups threatened to pull their endorsements of Fong, endangering
the state treasurer's carefully wrought image as a moderate
alternative to Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to clear the record,'' said Kevin Ivers, a spokesman
for the national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political group that
negotiated the pledge with Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The California Log Cabin Republicans considered dropping their
endorsement of Fong but are pleased by his new promise of support,
said Mark Patrosso of San Jose, the group's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pledge he made today was a reconfirmation'' of his support
for gay issues, Patrosso said. ``Both Matt Fong and Log Cabin are
`big tent' Republicans, and . . . under the big tent, the
(Traditional Values) Coalition is also there.''
</P>
<P>
   When reports surfaced Sunday that Fong had donated $50,000 to
the Rev. Lou Sheldon and his Traditional Values Coalition,
political insiders were stunned that Fong could support a group so
opposed to gay rights that it advocated quarantining people with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sheldon's group would put people like me in concentration
camps,'' said Ron Hill, a San Francisco health commissioner with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to limit the damage, Fong signed a one-page
agreement Monday in which he promised to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Maintain or increase federal AIDS research funding.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oppose the Republican-backed Hefley amendment, which would
have overturned a White House order barring job discrimination
against gays and lesbians in federal employment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Back a measure that would include sexual orientation as a
basis for non-discrimination in employment, except for small
businesses and religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Support the nomination of James Hormel, a gay San Francisco
philanthropist, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   -- Back a variety of domestic partner issues, including housing
non-discrimination and health insurance and retirement benefits for
gay and lesbian partners.
</P>
<P>
   -- Support federal hate crime legislation that would require
states to report hate crimes against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge my support on these issues in the U.S. Senate as
outlined above,'' Fong said in the document, which was signed and
dated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials argued that the signed agreement was nothing
unusual and merely ``codified'' verbal assurances Fong had given
gay Republicans in August, when they first endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take this opportunity to make our positions very,
very clear so that everyone could see that Matt Fong is a man of
his word,'' said Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to reach Sheldon for comment Monday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Fong's donation to Sheldon, revealed in the San Francisco
Examiner on Sunday in the last week of a nip-and-tuck Senate race,
has created a serious political detour for the GOP state treasurer.
Fong held a news conference in San Jose Monday to tout his
endorsement by Silicon Valley high-tech leaders but ended up facing
a battery of questions about his financial support for Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with everything Lou Sheldon does,'' he told
reporters. ``I don't always agree with the Log Cabin Club,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who has called Sheldon a longtime friend, said he donated
the money from his leftover 1994 campaign funds after being assured
that it would be used only for a poll on a proposed initiative
banning same-sex marriages in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Art Torres, who heads the state Democratic party, said he
wants the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether the
donation to Sheldon's organization was directly linked to the
strong placement Fong received in the Christian organization's
slate cards, which focused on his support for issues the coalition
favors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the $50,000 donation, raised during Fong's
earlier state treasurer campaign, violated laws prohibiting the use
of state campaign funds in a federal election.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party strategist Bob Mulholland branded it ``a
complete laundering operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 ``California Voters Guide'' published by the
Traditional Values Coalition, while not specifically endorsing
candidates, contrasts their views and emphasizes such high-profile
issues on the conservative agenda as abortion, gay marriage and
school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her supporters gleefully piled on as Fong tried to
limit the damage from the financial disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Fong's support for Sheldon's group shows how far out of step he
is with most Californians, Boxer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer took her re-election campaign to a Santa Monica women's
health clinic, where she and feminist author Gloria Steinem charged
that Fong was helping drive people in the state apart by backing
Sheldon's organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``His support for a group that calls abortion murder doesn't
help bring us together and find a common ground,'' Boxer told about
30 sign-waving supporters in the parking lot behind the cramped,
single-story clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday's fatal shooting of an upstate New York doctor who
performed abortions makes the women's choice issue even more
important in the Senate campaign, Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Schmidt said, ``Matt Fong is a unifier able to work
with people from all sides of the issues, and he will fight bigotry
and intolerance with his dying breath.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, a coalition of community groups demanded
Monday that Fong take back his donation to Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Fong has aligned himself in secret with the most
reprehensible group,'' said Episcopal Bishop Otis Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wong, a San Francisco City College commissioner, said
Asian American groups plan to contact Fong's backers in the local
Asian community to ask them to rethink their support.
</P>
<P>
   The support of Sheldon, he said, ``encourages the kinds of
actions that prey on minorities, women . . . and the
disenfranchised.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Press need to change attitude on Glenn mission
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The press run-up to John Glenn's second space ride tells us
something about the nation's passage since his first ride 36 years
earlier. What it tells us is not altogether pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days before NASA lights the fuse on Glenn's
rocket, coverage has finally begun to warm to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But for months after Glenn's participation was announced, the
news coverage _ especially though not only television's _ treated
the mission with the kind of deep-seated suspicion usually reserved
for vagrants seen hanging around playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The mission could have been an occasion all along for some low
key national pleasure at the prospect of what promised, at a
minimum, to be a crackling good story _ epic, even, like one of
those ancient sagas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a hero stands to bring his own adventure full circle
within his lifetime. The triumph of rash youth will be resolved in
a coda of aged accomplishment. A supposed impossibility is to be
unmasked as possible after all. A brave step into the unknown
evolves _ as at the first we could only hope it would _ into an
excursion into the nearly commonplace. The two generations of the
space age travel together in an adventure that binds the younger to
its source in an act of human as well as technological continuity.
Few torches have ever been so intimately passed.
</P>
<P>
   In olden days, at hearthsides and around campfires, poets would
have sung these themes into long skeins of wonder. These days, our
TV anchors, who tutor our attitudes, were having none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Glenn just a creaky old politician using his office to
muscle his way into a mission where he has no good business?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't these ``experiments'' he allegedly will participate in
only cover to excuse his presence? And doesn't the fact that a
health reason caused one experiment to be dropped prove his
unfitness? And since he and NASA won't say what the reason is,
what's being covered up here?
</P>
<P>
   Just how much taxpayer money is being wasted so this freeloading
pol can catch a joy ride? Aren't workaday folks being skinned for
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   And don't you suppose this is all a stunt by NASA to rip off
some free publicity from honest journalists who've stopped paying
the agency much attention? The real game is to squeeze more money
out of Congress, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Journalism has gone from being willing, bless it, to stand
against the popular mood when the mood turned ugly or foolish to
being unwilling join the popular mood even when the mood is benign
and wanting the best. Our credentials, we sometimes seem to think,
lie not with a healthy skepticism but with a cranky contrariness.
Everyone has to be patted down for weapons, rummaged for ulterior
motive, parsed for prevarication.
</P>
<P>
   We are not, by God, going to let anybody get away with anything,
including a good time.
</P>
<P>
   When John Glenn first went up, even journalists held their
breath and hoped. When it was said he would up up again, we sucked
our teeth and curled our lip.

NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM PUTS `CRITTERS' FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
Exuberance and optimism _ rare among wildlife advocates in these
days of anti-environmental legislation _ bounced off the walls of
the conference center at Keystone, Colo., for four days last week.
Managers of the nation's wildlife refuges and top officials from
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency in charge of the
refuge system, came together to discuss the future of this precious
network of federal wildlife lands and waters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the USFWS, called the meeting
historic, the first time all the refuge managers have ever been
gathered together. ``We will be setting the direction of the system
and unifying the 514 refuges,'' she added. More than 800 federal
employees and nearly 100 members of conservation groups attended
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 _
one of the few congressional ``improvement acts'' in recent years
that actually improved anything _ provided the impetus for the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The act, based upon President Clinton's 1996 Executive Order No.
12996, states that the mission of the refuge system is to
administer its network lands and waters ``for the conservation,
management and where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife,
and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for
the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clark expressed it, ``The act puts `critters first.''' Only
the 93-million-acre National Wildlife Refuge System has that
mandate from Congress. The other public lands agencies have
different priorities. On our refuges, wildlife comes first. That's
a first.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark, in terms of legislative authority, ``the act
set the goals and made the agency equal to all the other public
land agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The act does more. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior
to ``ensure ... the biological integrity, diversity, and
environmental health of the System.'' And for the public, the act
gives a priority to ``compatible wildlife-dependent recreation''
like hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, education
and interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clark's agency and refuge managers must set objectives and
issue regulations in order to implement the refuge system act. The
act gives them two years to accomplish these goals.
</P>
<P>
   President Theodore Roosevelt started the refuge system in 1903
when he set aside Florida's Pelican Island to protect nesting brown
pelicans from plume hunters. From that tiny beginning, the system
has spread across the nation. There are wildlife refuges in every
state. For example, Wyoming has seven refuges on 77,000 acres;
North Dakota has 65, accounting for nearly 300,000 acres;
Washington state has 22 refuges on 178,000 acres; Maine has nine on
47,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent USFWS figures, the refuge system attracts
more than 32 million visitors each year and brings more than $400
million into surrounding communities. Some community leaders
recognize this and form productive partnerships with their local
refuge officials to help maintain a quality wildlife experience for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt raised that theme during
his speech at the conference. He urged refuge managers to work with
conservation groups, community leaders and landowners to expand
good wildlife management principles across refuge boundaries. ``We
don't want refuges to be isolated islands,'' he said, ``Water
issues affect almost all refuges and threats to refuges often come
from outside the refuges.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant theme in Babbitt's speech was his advocacy
for a more inclusive ecological thinking, one that stretches far
beyond the confines of the refuges. He recommended the formation of
partnerships with non-governmental entities to help transform that
ideal into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt used the occasion to take a firm but provocative stance
on building new roads: ``As long as I am secretary of the Interior,
I'll see to it that no road goes through the Izembek wilderness
(Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska). Roads are the single
most destructive agent to the wilderness. We have to stop slicing
and dicing the wilderness with roads. If Izembek gets a road, no
wilderness is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Alaska congressional delegation pushed hard for
legislation to authorize a road through the Izembek wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 1997 NWRS act seems to grant Babbitt the
authority to halt any future road building in refuges.
</P>
<P>
   The 104th was perhaps the most anti-environmental Congress in
recent history. Dan Ashe, USFWS assistant director for Refuges and
Wildlife, explained how the refuge act managed to get enough votes
to pass in that atmosphere: ``When members of the National Rifle
Association and the Defenders of Wildlife walk into a congressional
office together and ask for the same thing, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ashe, hunting and fishing rights on refuges became
the focus of the bill for members of Congress. It's a potent
combination.
</P>
<P>
   And the NWRS act will make a difference to the general public.
Anne Marie LaRosa, outgoing manager of the Seedskadee National
Wildlife Refuge in southwest Wyoming, said the legislation will
allow the agency ``to focus on the visitor's enjoyment of solitude
and view of wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already know how precious wild lands are to one's
spiritual sense of connectedness with self, with nature and with
the universe. Let us hope the refuge system grows and fulfills its
deep promise. We can all share the optimism.

 &HT;    Dean Acheson left a large American footprint on the world
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACHESON: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World,
by James Chace. Simon &AMP; Schuster; 512 pages; $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at that fellow,'' said Sen. Hugh Butler. ``I watch his
smart-aleck manner and his British clothes and that New Dealism in
everything he says and does, and I want to shout, `Get out. Get
out. You stand for everything that has been wrong with the United
States for years!' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about Dean Acheson. Sen. Butler, it goes without
saying, was a Republican of his time _ the 1950s _ and place _
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was only frantic. Rep. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., was crude,
and Richard Nixon earned his medal for right-wing invective by
calling Adlai Stevenson a graduate of ``Dean Acheson's Cowardly
College of Communist Containment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long view, it's clear that Nixon, like most of Acheson's
critics, was misinformed. Acheson was no Stevenson supporter. But
what did the son of a Connecticut Episcopal bishop do to make
people hyperventilate so?
</P>
<P>
   He helped sell the Lend Lease program that saved Britain in
1941. He was an architect of the Marshall Plan, which saved Europe
from communism after the war, and of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, which kept it saved. As president, Nixon heartily
approved of NATO; later, Ronald Reagan practically claimed his
party invented it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still are not so sure about another Acheson
accomplishment, although it enriched many of their supporters _ the
world trade and monetary system set up after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the claim on the dust jacket of James Chace's
biography _ that he ``created the American world'' _ goes over the
top, the title of Acheson's autobiography _ Present at the Creation
_ is indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   So, again, what got his enemies so aroused? We won the Cold War,
didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was his mustache and the British clothes. And his
education at Groton, where he almost flunked out, and Yale, where
he partied away his time, rowing boats with Averell Harriman and
listening to Cole Porter noodle on the piano. Young Mr. Acheson
doesn't seem to have buckled down until he got to Harvard Law and
met Professor Felix Frankfurter.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurter sent Acheson ahead of himself to the Supreme Court
as clerk for Justice Louis Brandeis. From there, although he
occasionally tried to practice law, his interest and the excitement
of the jobs kept pulling him into public service. Serving with
people of the quality of Gen. George Marshall would, of course,
make public service attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Acheson was a big fan of Harry Truman, who made him secretary of
state. Truman was a big fan of Acheson. Considering Truman's time
and place, that could make them an odd couple. But both of them
understood and respected the republic and their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans couldn't stand Truman. They hated Franklin
Roosevelt, too, but Acheson could restrain his enthusiasm for FDR.
He found FDR devious and too reliant on charm. Of course, FDR fired
Acheson when he opposed the president's plan to manipulate the
price of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the reason Acheson had enemies was because he didn't
coddle fools. And then, as now, there were more than enough fools
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Chace, a Bard College professor and author of a half-dozen books
on foreign policy, could have livened this biography with more of
Acheson's contemporary caustic comments. As it is, there are barely
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The book is generally admiring, although Chace does criticize
Acheson for some things. He writes, for instance, that when Gen.
Douglas MacArthur tried to conquer Korea without watching out for
the Chinese Army, Acheson seemed mesmerized. The Chiefs of Staff
also sat, mouths agape, until the Chinese charged and MacArthur
retreated, blaming Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Acheson was a surer hand with Europe than with Asia,
and he devoted too little attention to Latin America and Africa.
But the issue during his years on the bridge of state was whether
there would be a war between the superpowers and, if not, what
would replace it.
</P>
<P>
   There was no war, and Acheson played the major role in putting
the substitutes in place. That they were still there when the
communist empire went into probate suggests that Acheson, whatever
his critics said, got a lot of things right.

 &HT;    Sly comic touch turns into something else
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE EXTRA MAN, by Jonathan Ames. Scribner's; 333 pages; $23.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Ives wants to be a young gentleman. He has read The
Razor's Edge and Brideshead Revisited and has moved on to
Wodehouse, Wilde, Mann and Fitzgerald and has come to the
conclusion that he wants to be like the characters in their books,
except without the drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Louis is neat, he is polite, he writes thank-you notes, he
shaves every day. He is ripe for membership in some kind of
literary salon, if only somebody would start one. Louis has come to
New York, not to start a career, not to become successful, but to
bask in its aura.
</P>
<P>
   Louis has lived rather too much with fiction and too little with
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   This beguiling, quietly disturbing novel by a gifted young
writer introduces Louis _ and us _ to Henry Harrison, who needs
someone to share the rent in his hovel. These two eccentric eunuchs
become roommates of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is a writer, working on a sex comedy about the Shakers,
making eds meet by teaching at a community college that sounds
nearly as disreputable as him. He is perpetually impoverished,
hasn't paid taxes in years, is of an uncertain age and uncertain
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's probably untouched by human hands, even his own.
He dances attendance on a succession of elderly women with homes in
Palm Beach, so he at least has a place to get out of the winter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a harder job than it sounds, because you have to be
eternally vigilant. Elderly women fall down a lot. If they fall
down too hard, they can die. Or they can get an infection in their
hip replacement, and where are you then? Stranded in Palm Beach
without money for food or plane fare.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is Quentin Crisp run through a blender, but that is to
trivialize Ames' achievement here. There are a lot of Henry
Harrisons in the world, quiet wrecks who spend their lives visiting
friends and dispensing light entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of The Extra Man is a two-hander in which Louis
lobs questions and Henry hits them over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like Fitzgerald?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course . . . His prose is like cocktail music. But there
won't be any more Fitzgeralds. You need an all-male environment . .
. the Muslims might produce a Fitzgerald. They're good at
separating the sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this, after Louis asks Henry why everybody is so crazed about
sex:
</P>
<P>
   ``People have too much to eat. They don't have the survival
problem which would keep them sane. We need to cut the rations.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry eats well only during the winters in Palm Beach, where he
can average four dinners and three cocktail parties a week. With
some discreet doggie-bagging, he can get by without ever buying a
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Louis is fascinated by this outre character, worships him. Louis
is in the grip of a particularly damaging kind of literary fantasy,
in which he sees himself as a moon for someone else's planet, a
character in someone else's story.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually, Louis likes men who dress in women's clothes. In a
funny/sad scene, Louis even tries on an unflattering outfit
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, both these men are in limbo. As a transsexual tells
Louis: ``You're not really straight, you're not really gay. You're
straightish.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several antecedents for this story _ Of Mice and Men
and Harold and Maude, among others. Sex is not the issue;
incompletion is. All these books are about two crucially damaged
people who come together to form a stronger unit.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound pompous orstuffy, but The Extra Man is neither.
It starts out as high comedy _ in the age of There's Something
About Mary, an endangered species _ but it evolves into something
else.
</P>
<P>
   Henry moves from a stand-in for Auntie Mame, a larger-than-life
theatrical turn bristling with campy one-liners, to a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Ames lets us see the desperation beneath the brittle surface,
and we come to appreciate Henry for his twisted gallantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all inherit something,'' he tells Louis. ``I inherited a
mind. They inherited money. I inherited a certain charm . . . and a
joie de vivre, which is nice to have. I give them wit and
conversation and they give me food. It's a fair exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames' novel is too funny to be called compassionate, too dark to
be considered uplifting. But in Henry and Louis, Ames has created _
or transcribed _ two of the most startlingly human characters in
recent fiction.

 &HT;    Photographer: `I never became adept at understanding fashion'
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His assignment: Go to New York and Milan and Paris and London
and shoot clothes for The Washington Post. He didn't know which
outfits were important, so he shot them all, just in case. Four to
six rolls of film per fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lucian Perkins began watching the people who sat beside the
runway. When he had a split-second to spare, he started shooting
them.
</P>
<P>
   This was a decade ago, before Kate Moss and House of Style.
Photographers could line up along the runway. No crouching at the
end of it under another guy's armpit, like now. Designers even let
him stay backstage during shows.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a book of Perkins' photographs, called Runway
Madness (Chronicle Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   It has, for example, Naomi Campbell in curlers. Good luck
getting that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess about one or two years ago, she started having people
with her to tell photographers not to photograph her,'' Perkins
says. ``It was really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure how long he will keep shooting these things.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has to. Perkins won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for a
story on poverty in a Washington, D.C., family. He was Newspaper
Photographer of the Year in 1994 and won World Press Photo of the
Year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His big interest is Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion gave him his first book.
</P>
<P>
   He's no clotheshorse himself. ``I usually just buy khakis,'' he
says. ``Nothing exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he likes the exciting designers _ Todd Oldham, Issac
Mizrahi, Betsey Johnson and her somersaults on the runway. Those
who put on a good show.
</P>
<P>
   The most boring: Calvin Klein. ``His models have a total blank
expression on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The last good photo he got from a Calvin Klein show was around
1987, when the Somali-born Iman was still modeling. It's in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Others in there: RuPaul with a videocam, Donna Karan in dorky
glasses, and a row full of surly fashion editors, with Vogue's Anna
Wintour right in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the models hardly smile either during shows. After a
decade, Perkins still doesn't understand why. With all those
cameras?
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me,'' he says. ``They walk out there looking like,
`I don't want to be here, leave me alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day he will.

 &HT;    Roth scores points in his 22nd novel
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 65th year, Philip Roth has written his 22nd novel. I
Married a Communist is a very good book _ brisk, sad and, in spots,
wildly funny. Roth expertly juggles characters, cultural sociology
and what seems to be a veiled response to ex-wife Claire Bloom's
cause celebre about their marriage, Leaving a Doll's House.
</P>
<P>
   Sentence by sentence, idea by idea, I Married a Communist could
have been written by no one but Philip Roth; it's a virtual
anthology of the concerns that have animated his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, American writers concerned about the Jewish
experience had social or class concerns _ Henry Roth's Call It
Sleep, an avatar of the proletarian novels of the '30s, was
typical.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1959, when he arrived with Goodbye, Columbus, Roth, and a
few others like Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud, brought the
literary Jew into the middle class. And then Roth went the others
one better and sexualized him.
</P>
<P>
   For several generations of writers who had spent their lives
emulating Hollywood moguls by finessing their Jewish identity,
books like Columbus and the uproarious Portnoy's Complaint, Roth's
commercial and cultural break-through of 1969, were a tsunami of
eros.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's subjects have always been Jews, Sex and Making It, if
possible all three at once. And just like Budd Schulberg, who wrote
What Makes Sammy Run?, Roth has been accused of giving aid and
comfort to the enemies of his people _ an early version of
political correctness, here masquerading behind racial paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Roth has always ignored the criticism and gone his own way.
There was a furiously inventive satire of the Nixon years called
Our Gang, a surreal, marginal Kafka take-off called The Breast. I
also have happy memories of a book called The Great American Novel
that nobody seems to remember, but contains one of my favorite
opening lines: ``Call me Smitty.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming after anything but American Pastoral, Roth's masterpiece
of last year, I Married a Communist would be a triumph. The two
books are structurally similar _ essentially long monologues about
the tragedy of a man who is already dead as the book opens.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, that man is Ira Ringold, a New York leftie who
becomes a radio star after World War II under the name Iron Rinn.
Ira fronts a show called The Free and the Brave, in which various
episodes of American history are dramatized.
</P>
<P>
   When Ira's not before the microphone, he's capitalizing on his
resemblance to Lincoln by visiting schools and other public places
in full 1863-era regalia, giving an anti-capitalist spin to
Lincoln's words.
</P>
<P>
   But Ira is destroyed by the confluence of the Red Scare, his own
single-minded obstinacy, and the woman he self-destructively
chooses as his wife, Eve Frame, a former silent film star and
anti-Semitic Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The man who tells the story is Ira's 90-year-old brother Murray,
a schoolteacher who has his life derailed by proximity to his
brother. The man he is telling the story to is Nathan Zuckerman,
Roth's alter-ego of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   With rather more dead-pan wit than his bawdy nature usually
allows for, Roth appropriates the title of a grotesque, thankfully
forgotten 1950 Red Scare movie produced by Howard Hughes. The movie
is a metaphor for the insanity of the period. Hughes used the
project as a litmus test; if a director refused the atrocious
script, he was graylisted or blacklisted; if a director accepted,
he was politically OK, but the project was taken away from him and
handed off to the next man on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual victim, the man who actually made the movie, was
Robert Stevenson, who did what he was told and ended up directing
Mary Poppins. The movie was impossible to take seriously even in
1950, but despite the silly title, Roth isn't after bleak sarcasm
or even crazed farce. He's going for writhing anguish.
</P>
<P>
   The blacklist period is like the American Revolution _ wonderful
material, but for some reason, rarely touched. Roth brings the
tenor of the times back: Norman Corwin's hortatory radio plays,
FDR-worship, Paul Robeson standing tall, the novels of Howard Fast,
the ardent belief in a coming society of the proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Ira is a true believer, a take-no-prisoners Commie who talks
about Churchill the same way he talks about Leo Durocher _ a
no-good bastard beyond redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Although I Married a Communist is not a particularly large
novel, it contains multitudinous ideas, and some wonderful extended
riffs.
</P>
<P>
   There's Murray Ringold's taxonomy of Jewish types beyond the
angry Jew: ``The inappropriate-laughing Jews, the
I-love-everyone-deeply Jews, the Momma-and-Poppa-were-saints Jews,
the I-do-it-all-for-my-gifted-children Jews, the
I'm-sitting-here-listening-to-Itzhak-Perlman-and-I'm-crying Jews,
the entertaining Jew of perpetual punning, the serial Jewish
joker.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's Murray talking about the psychology of informing:
</P>
<P>
   ``When before had betrayal ever been so destigmatized and
rewarded in this country? It was everywhere during those years, the
accessible transgression, the permissible transgression that any
American could commit. Not only does the pleasure of betrayal
replace the prohibition, but you transgress without giving up your
moral authority. You retain your purity at the same time as you are
patriotically betraying _ at the same time as you are realizing a
satisfaction that verges on the sexual with its ambiguous
components of pleasure and weakness, of aggression and shame: the
satisfaction of undermining.''
</P>
<P>
   A Nixon-hater of long standing, Roth can't resist a diversionary
but delightful screed in the new book about Nixon's funeral, where
Murray ticks off the list of repulsive mourners, especially
``sparkly Dan Quayle, looking as lucid as a button. The heroic
effort made by that poor fellow: always staging intelligence and
always failing.''
</P>
<P>
   I Married a Communist continues Roth's remarkable resurgence of
the past decade. In the '70s and '80s, Roth occupied himself with a
series of books involving Nathan Zuckerman. There are those who
love them, but I find them turgid and heavy _ joyless,
post-modernist word games about identity, a strange detour for a
writer whose great gift is satire and antic realism. But in this
decade, Roth turned a corner and went back to bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote Patrimony, a passionate, moving memoir about his
father's long dying, followed it with Sabbath's Theater and
finished it off with American Pastoral. This is an astonishing
trilogy for a writer of Roth's age, when even the best writers
begin to coast on their reputations and backlist.
</P>
<P>
   Of these books, I'll put my money on Patrimony and American
Pastoral as lasting works. Sabbath's Theater is too extreme in its
sexuality and too scabrous in its characterizations to ever be
embraced by a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of book that, had it been written by someone 30
years younger _ David Foster Wallace or T. Coraghessan Boyle _ it
would have been praised for its brave disinterest in anything
approaching middle-class mores. But I get a sense that people in
their 20s and 30s aren't interested in Roth _ 15 years of the
Zuckerman books cost him a generation of readers.
</P>
<P>
   As for American Pastoral, it deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize
for fiction, up against some heavy competition _ Don DeLillo,
Thomas Pynchon, etc. It was a slight departure for Roth, because
the central character, one Swede Levov, is far more sweet-natured
than most Roth protagonists, as well as far more passive. He's a
nice guy, not exactly a richly populated category in Roth's books,
and it costs him everything.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Ringold is no Swede Levov, which is where I Married a
Communist falls a bit short of its predecessor. He's a humorless
ideologue, and like most of that all too-common breed, he verges on
the tedious. Ira's rage, doctrinaire Communism and narcissistic
inability to see the big picture guarantees that he will hit the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Ira's brother Murray is a wise riot, another of those funny,
verbal old Jews that Roth channels at will, and his analysis of why
his long-dead brother never left his wife carries a devastating
charge of pity and resigned compassion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's dissatisfied, but by and large not leaving is what
people do. Especially people who've been left themselves. Come
through what you two came through, and you value stability very
highly. Probably overvalue it. The hardest thing in the world is to
cut the knot of your life and leave. People make ten thousand
adjustments to even the most pathological behavior. Why,
emotionally, is a man of his type reciprocally connected to a woman
of her type? The usual reason: their flaws fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like any prolific artist, Philip Roth has had flops both
aesthetic and commercial, but he's also sent ripples across the
cultural pond.
</P>
<P>
   Roth gave writers like Joseph Heller emotional leave to deal
with the issues of religion and rage. Likewise, Woody Allen's dips
into misanthropy that are always so off-putting to what's left of
his audience _ Stardust Memories, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and,
especially, Deconstructing Harry _ couldn't exist without the
example of Roth's characters flailing in a sea of self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Art, of course, is cross-pollination, and Roth's tone owes a
good deal to the free-form monologues of Lenny Bruce, with both men
putting special emphasis on the terrible things mothers do to their
sons. Indeed, most of Roth's books tend to revolve around the
accumulating horror found in a badly matched family unit.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Roth's 22 novels seem to me to form a teeming
portrait of what it means to be alive in the latter half of 20th
century America, of the inherent failure of the American dream,
especially the part about ``pursuit of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy's complaint turns out to be, more or less, that nobody
understands him. Roth's people are alienated and, ultimately,
alone. That Roth has managed to spend 40 years telling stories of
desperation and panic without spinning out of control, always
maintaining a tight hold on his art, is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   I Married a Communist proves again that Roth remains the champ,
the best writer we have.

 &HT;    50 reasons to hate the '50s
 &HT;    Staff report
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the new movie ``Pleasantville,'' two
colorful, modern teens slip into life with a black-and-white,
small-town '50s TV family. They find it all pretty darn dreamy
until, gasp, reality hits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the '50s weren't as cozy as we've been told.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, sometimes they were downright awful.
</P>
<P>
   So to get in the proper mood for ``Pleasantville,'' we've come
up with 50 REASONS TO HATE THE '50s (in no particular order).
</P>
<P>
   1. When you wanted to change channels on your TV set or turn up
the sound over your father's snoring, you had to get up and use the
knobs on the set. There were three channels from which to choose,
if your antenna could pick up all the stations.
</P>
<P>
   2. Buddy Holly was putting Texas on the rock 'n' roll map when
he decided to try to fly through an Iowa snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   3. The really cool look of a cigarette dangling from lips or
waving in one's hand was jeopardized when a committee of experts
appointed by the American Heart Association and the American Cancer
Society reported the link between smoking and lung cancer as a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   4. To gas up your car, you had to wait for some guy to come out
of the station to pump it for you. And he was always asking dumb
questions such as, ``Check those tires, mister?''
</P>
<P>
   5. There were few seat belts and no airbags to protect you when
fast, heavy, two-tone cars with fins crashed into each other.
</P>
<P>
   6. Boxing was like a real sport, without ear-biting.
</P>
<P>
   7. Fresh vegetables were pretty much limited to lettuce and
potatoes. Everything else cooked by your mom came from cans or
frozen blocks. Even some meat and lots of fruit came in cans.
</P>
<P>
   8. Disneyland opened in California, forcing parents who
otherwise could have taken vacations by themselves to pack along
the kids, who chanted, ``We want to see Mickey'' after watching
TV's ``The Mickey Mouse Club.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Charlton Heston was our history teacher, showing us what
Moses and Ben Hur were really like.
</P>
<P>
   10. Bras were pointy, and 18-inch waists were achieved through
the miracle of girdles.
</P>
<P>
   11. Ketchup was a big deal, so was Jell-O. Your mother even
seemed to combine the two in something wiggly and red that came out
of a mold and was called tomato aspic.
</P>
<P>
   12. A ``gourmet'' food revolution gave us escargot, fondue and
souffles.
</P>
<P>
   13. Bomb drills at school were stupid, as if huddling under a
Formica lunch-room table would save you from incineration or
radiation poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   14. If you were a kid, and you wanted to do something fun, you
had to get permission from both of your parents, since both of them
lived with you.
</P>
<P>
   15. If you wanted to listen to a 45 rpm record, and the record
player your parents bought at Sears didn't have the right spindle,
you had to stick one of those plastic thingies in the hole to make
it fit on the turntable.
</P>
<P>
   16. There were no videos, so if you wanted to see a movie, you
had to go to a theater, which had one screen and one movie for
about a month. Unless it offered a double feature.
</P>
<P>
   17. The big controversy on the radio was: Who's better? Pat
Boone or Elvis Presley?
</P>
<P>
   18. In ``girls'' basketball, the guards weren't allowed past
midcourt because people thought running was hard on women.
</P>
<P>
   19. You had to wait an hour after lunch to go swimming, or you
would seize up from cramps and drown. That was true because that's
what your mother told you.
</P>
<P>
   20. The McCarthy era, which had nothing to do with Jenny
McCarthy, ruined the promising careers of government officials,
Hollywood writers and broadcasters as a senator from Wisconsin
found Communist sympathizers everywhere he looked.
</P>
<P>
   21. Ovaltine came in one flavor, and it wasn't even Diet.
</P>
<P>
   22. Look-alike suburbs boomed almost everywhere and led to the
decay of some perfectly good cities.
</P>
<P>
   23. Texas A&AMP;M was all-male.
</P>
<P>
   24. Kids who had just learned where all the states were on a map
got thrown a curve when Alaska and Hawaii were added to the Union.
</P>
<P>
   25. With the collapse of ``The $64,000 Question,'' we learned
that all those TV quiz shows that we imagined as a way to get rich
were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   26.That insipid tune about the hills being alive with the sound
of music was launched on Broadway and would not stop being sung for
years and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   27. No voicemail or answering machines existed to screen your
telephone calls, but then without telemarketers there weren't so
many calls coming in. Party lines meant you had to wait your turn
to call out.
</P>
<P>
   28. Women stayed home, took care of the kids and cooked a lot of
unhealthy stuff without the benefit of microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   29. Only boys got to wear Army boots.
</P>
<P>
   30. Petticoats were almost as great an inhibition to sex as
pantyhose in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   31. Richard Nixon earned a decent enough reputation as vice
president under Ike.
</P>
<P>
   32. With no birth control pills, men were supposed to be
responsible for avoiding unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   33. The Korean War taught us absolutely nothing about messing in
a civil war between the north and south of an Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   34. Harsh, smelly, frizzy permanents made hairstyling a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   35. Fluoride was the vile stuff that the dentist swabbed on your
teeth instead of hidden in toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   36. Saddle shoes, bobby sox and poodle skirts were what passed
for fashion in high school.
</P>
<P>
   37. Ernest Borgnine won an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   38. Aquamarine was a popular interior decorating hue.
</P>
<P>
   39. Milton Berle was the funniest thing on television, and he
sometimes wore a dress.
</P>
<P>
   40. Sexual repression meant J. Edgar Hoover could wear a dress
only in his home, but we didn't know that until many years later.
</P>
<P>
   41. Perky hygiene filmstrips were shown in schools, even
college.
</P>
<P>
   42. Children were still taken out of school in warm months, were
forbidden to go swimming in summer and were hidden away in small
towns to protect them from a mysterious disease called polio.
</P>
<P>
   43. Women were called girls, broads, dear and, if they didn't
give up their careers when they got married, they were chased
around the proverbial desk at work.
</P>
<P>
   44. Your mom was convinced calves liver was a necessary part of
your diet.
</P>
<P>
   45. Unless you lived in a city with a large Italian population,
spaghetti came in a Franco-American can and pizza was tough to
find, let alone get delivered to your house.
</P>
<P>
   46. It took a long time to call a telephone number because you
had to switch between letters and numbers and turn that rotary dial
with your finger.
</P>
<P>
   47. Butch wax and Brylcreem made men's hair disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   48. Haircuts were cheap at the barbershop, but you got what you
paid for. Otherwise you had to endure a parent who thought anyone
could cut hair with scissors and -- razor.
</P>
<P>
   49. The African American population was treated separately and
unequally when it came to schools, buses, hotels, water fountains,
voting, housing, jobs and almost everything else. 50. You couldn't
educate yourself about adultery, incest and the Ku Klux Klan by
watching daytime television.

 &HT;    eniors enjoy improved lives by keeping active
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sneakers squeak as guys in their 20s and 30s sprint up
and down the basketball court, passing, shooting, high-fiving _ and
in a few cases _ huffing and puffing. But Richard Miller is hardly
breaking a sweat. Which is noteworthy because, at age 75, he's been
running longer that most of his pals have been breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Ivano Newbill, a former Georgia Tech star who played last year
with the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and often is one of Miller's
teammates, is in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rebounds. He hits jump shots. If there was a league for
people 70 and older like the NBA, he would be the Michael Jordan,''
Newbill says.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's not alone. As the United States prepares to send a
77-year-old astronaut, Sen. John Glenn, into orbit, millions of
ordinary older Americans are likewise attending to physical
pursuits once thought for youngsters only.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is 6-foot-2, weighs in at a trim 183, and he plays
despite health problems. ``I'm recovering from two cancers, but
nobody knows it,'' he says. ``Out here I'm a player, not a
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   He shows up three times a week at the YMCA in east Cobb County
for pickup games with guys of all ages, sometimes even teenage
stars of area high school teams.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago he broke his right wrist ``after a guy charged
me.'' But Miller, like Glenn, is more than willing to take chances.
Maybe eager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with older people is, they give up,'' says Miller,
a divorce with four children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can outrun most of them. I'm not going down without a
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This Y and many other health clubs are packed daily with men and
women who qualify for senior-citizens discounts, but don't act the
part. Here, Fred Poore, 62, is on staff, a stocky, muscular man who
specializes in weight training for older folks. He assists people
such as Les Petherick, 68, a retired Navy pilot whose biceps bulge
as much as those young jocks' on TV health shows.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have been inspired by Glenn's upcoming spaceflight,
it's been television and heavily promoted health campaigns pushed
by agencies such as the National Institute on Aging that have made
older people more aware of the benefits of exercise, says Elaine
Cress of the Exercise Sciences &AMP; Gerontology Center at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has been a major player in the NIA's push, supporting its
agenda in Congress for more than a decade and demanding increased
funding. By maintaining the hard body he had as America's first man
in orbit 36 years ago, as well as a high public profile, he's also
become a role model for the geriatric set, a very visible example
that it is possible to stay ahead of the Grim Reaper on life's
ever-accelerating treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Increased physical activity, not just scientific breakthroughs,
is a major reason Americans are living longer, with the average
lifespan rocketing from 69 in 1960 to 76 today. In the last
Peachtree Road Race, which attracted 55,000 runners, 1,061 were 60
or older, and 138 older than 70, says Julia Emmons of the Atlanta
Track Club, which puts on the event. Those numbers are increasing
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Pilgrim, a 47-year-old executive with the state Department
of Human Resources who's coordinated the Georgia Golden Olympics
for years, says more and more people are competing each year.
Contestants range from 55 to their 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown that aging doesn't mean you're over the hill,''
Pilgrim says. ``Fifty-five or 60 is no longer the end of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, at the Golden Games in Warner Robins, 560
people participated, and some qualified to attend the national
Golden Olympics next year in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 85 and old enough to be over the hill,'' says Marvin Loyd
of Brookhaven, one of the participants. ``But I qualified to run in
the 5- and 10k (kilometer) races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to doctors, and they say I'm in great shape. I ran the 5k
in 30 minutes flat, just slightly under 10-minute miles. I make it
to nationals just about every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyd hasn't stopped running since he was a track star in high
school. He says he's almost as fast as he was in 1944, when he
sprinted over the beaches and hedgerows of Normandy after D-Day. He
also claims he can outrun two of his three children _ and both of
his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you get old _ and I don't feel old _ it's clear that
physical fitness is good for the mind, body, soul and spirit,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy L. White, a relative youngster at 61, has been competing
in athletic events since high school. He now teaches phys ed at
Palmetto Elementary School in south Fulton County and runs at a
track daily. He's been competing for years in the Golden Olympics
and any other age-group events he hears about. His specialty: the
pentathlon, a combination of long jump, discus, javelin, triple
jump and a metric-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get old,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude toward staying physically active is no anomaly,
says Douglas Kleiber, head of recreation and leisure studies at
UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are still playing golf and tennis at 80,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many elders do fall by the wayside physically.
</P>
<P>
   Many, Kleiber maintains, have been indoctrinated by a culture of
``ageism'' that stresses youth and devalues the elderly. ``Not as
many older people do physical activity as they could,'' Kleiber
says.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, chronic health problems move people from
treadmills to recliners.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of adults older than 65 report no physical
activity at all, according to the American Medical Association, and
38 percent suffer chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend is toward more activity, and it's showing up in
various ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disability rate as we increase in our numbers of older
people being active is actually declining,'' UGA's Cress says. ``We
are seeing a decline in heart disease. Hypertension is getting
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn is a motivator,'' she adds, ``but the real motivator is
that people don't want to go live in some nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that workouts benefit older folks abounds:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average lifespan for Americans has soared from 66 for
males and 73 females in 1960 to 73 for men and 79 for females.
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of 101 men and women ages 60 to 83 found that regular
aerobic exercise for four months increased heart and lung function
up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of 8,000 Japanese-American men ages 45 to 68, begun in
the mid 1960s, found recently that five hours a day of moderate to
heavy activity reduced the incidence of heart disease by 17 percent
and the death rate from heart disease by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Tufts University study of people 60 to 72 who trained with
weights found that most were able to boost the strength of their
hamstring muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiber hopes Glenn's mission will help scientists gain more
control over aging.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says, after only a few days of weightlessness,
astronauts lose up to 10 percent of their muscle tissue. But will
Glenn lose bone and muscle mass more rapidly, because he is older,
or more slowly, since he already has lost some mass with aging? The
answer could provide clues about how to treat bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people such as Helen Moore will continue to
fight aging on their own. The 90-year-old Atlantan goes to tai chi
classes twice a week and practices daily in her home, flailing her
arms and legs like a karate expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clears your mind. Your body feels better. It can make you
feel positive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Or Iris Sandham, 72, of Snellville, the state's champion
horseshoe tosser for several years running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk. I run. I bowl two, three times a week,'' she says. ``I
have a room full of trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a horseshoe court in my basement and throw the heaviest
you can have, 2 pounds and 10 ounces. I play against men in the top
class and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Harrell, 76, of Eastman has always been active, but Glenn's
trip has inspired her to new heights. In a couple of weeks, she
plans a trip to Kitty Hawk, N.C., where the Wright Brothers first
flew, for a flight of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of John Glenn,'' she says. ``Least I can do is a
little hang-gliding.''

 &HT;    '60s idealism drives Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Please call me back on the other
line,'' Peter Yarrow says with a hint of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the call has arrived on the business phone in
Yarrow's New York apartment. And when you're in the business of
promoting the world's most successful folk trio _ Peter, Paul &AMP;
Mary _ things can get, well, busy.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 38th year, Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary remains more than a
throwback to the long-haired idealism of the '60s: It's a thriving
institution. The trio _ composed of Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and
Mary Travers _ just released its 20th album, Around the Campfire, a
collection of favorites that's designed to encourage fans to sing
along. Its most recent PBS special, Lifelines, garnered an Emmy
nomination. And it continues to speak out on a variety of causes,
from championing the rights of strawberry pickers in California to
supporting the peace process in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   How does the 60-year-old Yarrow account for Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary's
enduring popularity?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater value being attached to people who defined
the folk renaissance of the '60s,'' he says. ``Some of us are
passing away, like John Denver (whose Leaving on a Jet Plane the
trio turned into a No. 1 hit in 1969). Others are not able to sing
with the same kind of energy and impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But what it really comes down to, Yarrow adds, is celebrating
that '60s idealism. ``I think in a world that's increasingly
homogenized, there is a greater value (being placed) on people who
made very individual statements and who did create a stream of some
kind of innovative efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary's ``stream'' was part musical, part
political. Founded in the creative cauldron of the Greenwich
Village '60s folk scene, the trio provided a sweet voice to an era,
turning songs like Bob Dylan's ``Blowin' in the Wind'' and ``Don't
Think Twice, It's Alright'' and Pete Seeger's ``If I Had a Hammer''
into unlikely radio hits. And that's to say nothing of its classic
original, ``Puff, the Magic Dragon,'' which climbed to No. 2 on the
pop charts in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Critics described the group's sound as ``two cellos and an
angel,'' with Yarrow, a one-time Ivy League psychology major, and
Stookey, a budding stand-up comic, providing the mellow backdrop to
Travers, the Village veteran with the airy soprano. ``It was all
intuitive,'' Yarrow says of the trio's signature vocal blend.
</P>
<P>
   But for Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary, music was also the means to a
message. From its inception, the group was at the forefront of the
political protests that shaped the '60s. In 1963, it marched with
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in Selma, Ala. In 1969, Yarrow
co-organized the anti-Vietnam War March on Washington _ and the
trio sang for the half-million people who gathered for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrow says you can't separate the singing from the social
causes. ``You feel in somebody's voice the seriousness of their
concerns,'' he explains. ``The fact that we have a sense of mission
is fundamental to our survival. There is not a group in the world
that has reached the kind of acclaim we did that is still together
in its original form.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you throw out the term ``nostalgia act'' to Yarrow, don't
expect a polite response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been nostalgia at all,'' he says of the trio's
appeal. ``There are four generations that come to hear us sing. A
lot of them remember when they first heard the songs, but an equal
number have just recently experienced them.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's history can be traced on Around the Campfire, which
includes vintage recordings of such Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary favorites as
``Puff, the Magic Dragon,'' ``Leaving on a Jet Plane'' and ``If I
Had a Hammer'' as well as four new tracks. The idea, says Yarrow,
is not so much for people to listen, but for them to take an active
part in the musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was the Pete Seeger idea of getting America
singing again. That's such an important tool for recreating a
connection at a time when we are besieged by extraordinary
problems,'' he says, before citing a litany of figures relating to
violence and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But can singing a folk song really change the world? Yarrow
still thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It embraces your heart and reactivates your sensitivity to
friends and family,'' he concludes. ``In its own way, it's an act
of consciousness.

 &HT;    65 is just the start of a new lifetime
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ Last week, in a fit of ``fogo'' (fear of
growing old), I was bellyaching about a friend's 4-year-old
grandson who'd climbed onto my lap, taken my face between his
hands, looked me square in the eye and declared, ``You're really
getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Good taste dictated I couldn't dump the kid on his backside, nor
could I suggest his parents ground him until his 42nd birthday.
Dignity spared the moment. But that didn't stop me from writing
about it and now, thanks to a reader named Jeanne in Florida, I'm
feeling a whole lot better. Here's what she had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time I knew a very depressed lady. Her time was
up. Life was over. Her chest sagged, her tush was flabby, thighs
had relocated somewhere around her ankles, jowls ruffled around her
neck, and her crow's feet had turned into ostrich claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five. Her birthday stared her square in her now
dim-sighted, faded blue eyes. She exercised, but the flab, bags,
and sags wouldn't budge. She dieted. As she got slimmer, the
wrinkles got deeper. Life was not good. The sunshine was gone. Only
dark clouds on the horizon.
</P>

 &HT;    High school students lose their lockers
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANGER, Texas _ Students hoping to skip out on a few moments of
class in Granger can no longer use the time-honored excuse that
they left something in their locker.
</P>
<P>
   That's because school officials removed the lockers at Granger
High School this summer in an effort to clean up hallways, reduce
noise levels and trim the number of students tardy to class.
Administrators say they'll never go back to using lockers again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere and environment are so much more conducive to
learning,'' Principal James Bartosh said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that's playing out across the state, as school
administrators look for ways to keep schools safe and teach
students to plan ahead. But it's also a program that's not popular
with many students, who like having a place to stash their
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Tana Loving, 16, who is involved in several extracurricular
activities at Granger High, says she simply can't carry everything
she needs. ``You have all this stuff you need to put somewhere, and
there's nowhere to put it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from a concept instituted by a middle school in
Victoria, Granger administrators removed the lockers hoping to
increase student responsibility. The two districts are among about
a dozen in Texas that don't have lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students would have to be organized when they left the
house,'' Bartosh said. ``They would have to think about the day and
plan ahead instead of rolling out of bed and coming to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advantages quickly became clear at Granger, a 1A high
school with about 140 ninth through 12th-graders. Students no
longer gathered by their lockers to socialize, meaning fewer were
late to class. Tardies dropped by two-thirds, and without the
banging of metal doors, the hallways grew quieter.
</P>
<P>
   That lull surprised Peter Reese, who graduated from Granger last
year and recently dropped by the campus. ``We would slam the locker
doors on purpose,'' he said. ``The teachers went crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft problem has been almost eliminated since lockers were
taken out, and school officials no longer worry as much about
students bringing drugs, alcohol or other contraband to school.
``They don't have the place to put it,'' Bartosh said.
</P>
<P>
   The district even quit contracting for drug-sniffing dogs, which
by law can only search lockers and cars.
</P>
<P>
   To make the concept work, the school had to buy an extra set of
textbooks to keep in the classroom. That way, students could have
one book at home, and another while they were at the campus. But
some classes have not received the extra books yet, leaving
students to lug classroom editions back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Textbooks have been a problem, but it's a one-time problem,''
said Superintendent Gus Hollomon.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of buying extra books is no more than the cost of
maintaining the 240 lockers, many of which had been vandalized or
broken, he said. The discarded lockers are piled in a parking lot
outside the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years of education, never have I seen anything that
changes things for the positive like taking out lockers,'' Hollomon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the system probably wouldn't work at larger schools, said
Julian Shaddix, executive director of the Texas Association of
Secondary School Principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some advantages, but you have to consider the
disadvantages,'' Shaddix said. ``It's much easier to do that in a
small school, where the building is not large and the students
don't have far to go. You take a large high school and you're
talking about a hardship on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin public schools, individual campuses can decide whether
or not to use lockers. While all the high schools use them, many
middle schools do not, said Catenya McHenry, district spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Covington Middle School stopped using lockers three years ago.
``We found lockers to be a hindrance to instruction rather than an
asset,'' said Principal Bergeron Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Dobie Middle School quit using them for security reasons, said
Principal Patrick Patterson, who believes it's easier to search
backpacks for contraband than lockers. ``We've been able to secure
the building a little better and clear the halls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to convince students they don't need someplace to
store their books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love having lockers,'' said Granger sophomore Jillian
Pauley, 15. ``It hurts my back to carry a backpack, and I don't
like having to carry books because sometimes I don't need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Lisa Wolf, 17, says her calculus class has a classroom
set of books, but none for students to take home. ``It's really
hard because we don't have a book to refer back to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And lockers or not, students will socialize in the hallways,
said sophomore Jessica Repa, 15. ``They say it's going to keep us
from being late, but we still hang out in the hallways and
bathrooms anyway. We're still late,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bartosh says some students simply aren't planning ahead
enough. ``Some kids, they're just not finding all the best ways to
do things,'' he said. Even those who carry backpacks carry them
only briefly between classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're carrying it around 16 minutes a day,'' he said. ``If
you go to college, you're going to carry that much weight for a
longer time. You might as well get used to it now.''

 &HT;    Declining interest rates can threaten retirees
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declining interest rates can be a major threat to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Often retirees depend on investment income right now _ not
growth in years ahead _ to pay their living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they wanted to invest for growth, they can't risk taking
a loss from which it would take years to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many retirees tend to be ultraconservative, clustering
around safe investments like certificates of deposit and government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   That is why they get worried when interest rates drop, as they
have in recent months. At the most recent peak, six-month
certificates of deposit were paying, on average, 5.89 percent
interest in April 1997. Late last week, Bank Rate Monitor put the
national average at 4.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough of a plunge to make even the most timid investor
look for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are options out there. But investors will have to accept
some changes in their investing patterns to get to them. For one
thing, it may require moving money from an old, familiar bank that
sells CDs to a different manager, perhaps a mutual fund or a stock
broker.
</P>
<P>
   For another, you may in all likelihood have to bow to the
ironclad rule of investing: If you want to make more, you have to
risk more. The table suggests just how extreme the levels of risk
can get.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to take big, big risks. Investment experts
suggest a number of investments that might be good replacements for
CDs:
</P>
<P>
   _ CDs from other banks. Bank Rate Monitor keeps frequently
updated lists of the best available rates. You can check the Web
site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .bankrate.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bonds. Unless you are an experienced investor with a lot of
money, the best idea is to stick with a mutual fund or unit
investment trust. These alternatives give you a professional
manager and a diversity of investments that would be hard to match
buying individual bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Look for low-cost fund managers that won't eat up too much of
your income, and stick with high-quality bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk bonds'' will give you a higher yield, but there's a
reason why they're called junk. Don't depend on them for safe,
current income.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at the current yields from the Vanguard family of
funds, check out http://www.vanguard.com
</P>
<P>
   /daily/pricesyields.htm-- on the Internet. On Friday, the yield
on a total-market bond fund was 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, a certified financial planner with Financial
Vision Advisors in Atlanta, recommends unit investment trusts
rather than mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning is that bond buyers are looking for a guaranteed
yield and a guarantee they will get their principal back when their
bonds mature. But a mutual fund buys and sells bonds every day,
with the result that both yield and maturity dates change
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   A unit investment trust, by contrast, buys a given set of bonds,
holds them until they mature, then cashes them in and pays off the
investors. When you buy shares in the trust, you know exactly what
your interest payments will be and when you will get your principal
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For interest rate protection, I would 'ladder' several of them
with different maturity dates,'' Smith said. ``That gives you some
protection against changes in interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Unit investment trusts are usually sold through stock brokers or
financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   One other possibility is closed-end mutual funds specializing in
municipal bonds. A closed-end fund owns a given set of securities
and sells shares in that portfolio. If investors have their doubts
about the portfolio, the fund will trade at less than its fair
market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (bond funds) trade on yields,'' noted Steve Goldberg,
author of a recently published book on mutual fund investing.
``With a high-quality fund, it will trade at a discount. You can
almost always find a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks. The risk vs. reward trade-off can be more daunting in
the stock market. But there are some stodgy corners of the market
that emphasize current income and are not as flighty as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred stocks, for example, have a pre-set dividend yield.
That is as close to a guarantee as you will get in the stock
market. The dividend also comforts investors when the market gets
crazy, meaning the price of the stock usually will not vary as much
as other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks are another area to look into. The utility
companies tend to be steady performers, appealing to investors
because they have steady dividends rather than promises of future
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Again, mutual funds are the best alternative for those without
much experience.

 &HT;    65 is just the start of a new lifetime
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ Last week, in a fit of ``fogo'' (fear of
growing old), I was bellyaching about a friend's 4-year-old
grandson who'd climbed onto my lap, taken my face between his
hands, looked me square in the eye and declared, ``You're really
getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Good taste dictated I couldn't dump the kid on his backside, nor
could I suggest his parents ground him until his 42nd birthday.
Dignity spared the moment. But that didn't stop me from writing
about it and now, thanks to a reader named Jeanne in Florida, I'm
feeling a whole lot better. Here's what she had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time I knew a very depressed lady. Her time was
up. Life was over. Her chest sagged, her tush was flabby, thighs
had relocated somewhere around her ankles, jowls ruffled around her
neck, and her crow's feet had turned into ostrich claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five. Her birthday stared her square in her now
dim-sighted, faded blue eyes. She exercised, but the flab, bags,
and sags wouldn't budge. She dieted. As she got slimmer, the
wrinkles got deeper. Life was not good. The sunshine was gone. Only
dark clouds on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, on a day like any other, eight weeks before this
deplorable birthday was to arrive, the postman came at noon.

junk mail and bills, was an envelope from the

court, passing, shooting, high-fiving, and _ in a few cases _
huffing and puffing. But not Richard Miller. At 75, he's been
running longer than most of the others have been living, which
makes him not only a valued player, but also a role model. It's
happening everywhere _ gyms are full of older people. (Hendrick,

 &HT;    Grim reaper? no, writer gives 'em laughable joker
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ A public apology to the several people who got
scared when some idiot made up like the Grim Reaper crept up behind
them while they were touring Universal Studios in Orlando:
</P>
<P>
   I'm the idiot, and I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   As for the far greater number who simply laughed, I'm even
sorrier. You paid $30 or $40 for a jolt of terror, and all you got
was a short snort. But you can take any further complaints to
Universal's publicity department, which should have known better.
</P>
<P>
   After making movies like Dracula, Frankenstein and The Creature
From The Black Lagoon, it's hard to believe Universal allowed me to
stumble across the fine line between horror and hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm afraid I permanently erased it with my one-night
role in the month-long pageant of fear billed as Halloween Horror
Nights VIII.
</P>
<P>
   My assignment is to be one of 450 costumed ``scare-actors''
(pronounced like characters with an ``s'' in front) who are divided
among the park's five haunted houses and the outdoor theme areas.
My territory is the streets of New York, which strikes me as one
place the walking dead would have to work hard to get noticed, much
less frighten anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Grim Reaper, I gather, is a one-size-fits-all persona that
can be easily grafted onto guest performers. You've seen the
character many times: the tall, bony figure in black carrying a
scythe.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, that doesn't sound like short, wide me. ``Leave it to
the make-up artist,'' I'm told. Amy Klaus, working her fourth
Halloween at Universal, sets right to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can make my face scary?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' she says, a bit too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if my beard will detract from the Reaper's ghastly
visage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make the beard work,'' she says. ``All I have to do is
whiten it up.''
</P>
<P>
   I think about the white beard and the black robe. Suddenly, I'm
picturing myself as the Ayatollah.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Amy about 35 minutes of paint-and-putty work to make me
look sufficiently decayed. She adds a last-minute gash oozing
gelatinous blood over my left eyebrow before the hooded frock is
lowered over my head. I stumble over the hem on my first step.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the make-up makes me no taller, but it is making my
face itch. I wonder if this stuff's been tested on live people as I
unconsciously scratch at my caked-on wound. The look on Amy's face
proves that I can indeed scare someone.
</P>
<P>
   She has me oozing again in a jiffy, and I fold my hands together
as one of the entertainment directors instructs me in the subtle
art of ghoulery. A silent ghoul is more effective than a chatty
one, he says, although it's OK to throw in a moan, groan or even a
hoarse ``Help me!'' But simply staring at people long enough can
give them the heebie-jeebies, and when all else fails, try sneaking
up behind and startling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just don't touch anyone,'' he says. ``And don't let anyone
touch you.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of lawsuits, it seems, is too scary even for
Halloween. I'm crushed to learn that also means no scythe.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be tough, but I assure everyone I'm ready and
follow the publicity team into a corridor connecting the rooms that
serve as the scare-actor make-up center.
</P>
<P>
   I got the personal treatment, but the working ghouls are moving
swiftly along a paint-and-prosthetics assembly line. Fairly
normal-looking, 20-to-30-year-old men and women walk in one door
and come out looking like the cadaverous offspring of Klingons and
Marilyn Manson. There's not a Dracula, Wolfman or Frankenstein
monster in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those characters don't scare people any more,'' I'm told.
``We're too sophisticated today.''
</P>
<P>
   This is giving me second thoughts about the Grim Reaper routine,
but it's too late. We're out the door just as the crowd is
building. It's dusk, and the turn-of-the-century brownstone facades
are looking especially eerie in the last, low streaks of
pink-orange light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' the publicity rep tells me. ``People are paying to
be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   I walk straight toward a couple rounding a corner. I think I
look menacing. They smile and nod as though we're small-town
neighbors passing along Main Street. I walk past them toward two
young women, glaring into their eyes. They look at me as though I'm
crazy and step swiftly out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to try another couple standing in line for one of the
haunted houses, but this time from the side. I manage to get within
a few feet before they spot me. They both scream! Then, almost
immediately, their screams turn to laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this funny?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if they're trying to answer me or if they're
commenting on my ridiculous appearance, but I do know they're not
speaking English. They continue to point and laugh as I move down
the line, and their laughter is annoyingly contagious. With the
entire line chuckling and pointing, I retreat to confer with the
Universal team.
</P>
<P>
   Their unanimous opinion: I'm too nice. ``Even if you're not
smiling, people can tell you're not mean,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I buy this. Even though the sun is going down, it's
still 80-some degrees and I'm wearing a wool cloak suitable for
arctic excursions. Every time I breathe, I get a nose full of
make-up dust, and the goo on my forehead is starting to melt into
my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm feeling meaner by the second. ``Let me try this again,'' I
say.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the entertainment director's advice that burly guys are
the ones most likely to get spooked. I walk up behind the burliest
guy I see and grunt. He apparently mistakes the Grim Reaper for
Friar Tuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless you father,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another group dissolves in laughter. I turn and spot a woman
sitting on a bench. I sneak up behind and utter my one sure-fire
scare line: ``Boo!'' She looks, she screams, and then she shouts at
me in Spanish. I smile and move quickly on.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of my tour, I succeed in scaring only a handful of
people _ all from behind, all foreign. The Reaper, I decide, must
have some mystical, xenophobic power. The Universal rep sets me
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not their holiday,'' she reminds me. ``People from other
countries aren't used to seeing anyone dressed up like this.
Americans see it every year.''
</P>
<P>
   They're done seeing me. A hired ghoul would head to the make-up
room for a fresh coat of slime and a short rest before the next
performance; they're on for four sets a night, 19 nights, at about
$7 an hour. I'm ready for a good scrubbing, but I'm not quite ready
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   With my eyes burning from the soap and make-up, I'm escorted
through a fog-machine mist for a haunted house tour so I can see
how the real scare-actors get screams. A publicity rep leads me
through a dark, narrow maze of shadows, flashes and screeching
echoes.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps her eyes fixed on the floor and screams when a
menacing figure jumps into her path. I'm scanning the dark recesses
when a slasher leaps out and swings his blade toward my head. I
look him in the eyes and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Serves him right, I think, and not just because it happened to
me.
</P>
<P>
   I might scream at a monster whose only weakness is a stake
through the heart or a silver bullet, but I just can't get worked
up about one who's afraid of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   `Fear of unknown'
</P>
<P>
   a Universal feeling
</P>
<P>
   Costumes and characters change with the times, but the essential
element of terror is timeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of the unknown,'' explains Jerry Abercrombie, who heads
the creative team behind Universal Studios' holiday horror pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Film-quality sets and make-up blur the distinction between
reality and illusion, but there are many means of subtle
manipulation that keep people on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snakes in the trees are really air hoses, so they not only
move, you feel something uncomfortable,'' Abercrombie says. Slime
along the walls of the haunted houses is really food-grade
cellulose thickener used in soups, but the imagination makes it
seem far creepier.
</P>
<P>
   Howling music, musty odors and sudden blasts of heat are also
part of the formula. ``We disorient you,'' Abercrombie says.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important ingredient is darkness. ``You fear what
you can't see,'' he says. ``You fear what goes bump in the
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   To enhance the effects, the corridors narrow, and the ceilings
drop, adding claustrophobia to the jitters. And, of course,
strange-looking creatures are suddenly illuminated and then vanish
in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are funneled through the houses at a swift but measured
pace in groups of nine, reacting predictably to the three scares in
every room. Abercrombie tunes the entire show to the 18-35 age
range of horror movie audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It's all harmless, of course, and everyone knows that, but most
people willingly suspend common sense in return for a good shiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to be scared,'' Abercrombie says.
</P>
<P>
   SCARY TIP
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to spring for professional makeup this
Halloween, or just feel like being creative, the kitchen is a good
place to start. Lots of possibilities are obvious: spaghetti, for
example, works equally well as worms and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup artist Amy Klaus offered this recipe for Halloween blood:
Karo syrup and red food dye. She likes the bright, glistening
appearance, although others add chocolate syrup to deepen the
color. Amy's special tip: Add some oatmeal for a professional,
coagulated look.

 &HT;    Is testing killing education?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I imagine an alarm went off somewhere in the Texas
education firmament. Maybe a ground sensor signaled a satellite
which triggered a probe which launched an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And I figure Mrs. Mansfield is in a heap of trouble _ ground
zero _ for bringing a piano into her sophomore English class last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Alert. Alert. Incoming missive: ``Class does not correspond to
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills.'' Scramble. Code purple. To
the bomb shelters, children.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I couldn't get my son to share in the gravity. To
him, it was ``the best day I've had at Waco High.'' What? And not
accomplish a TAAS objective?
</P>
<P>
   The class guest was Kurt Kaiser, Waco's world-renowned Christian
music composer. He's penned 200 songs including contemporary
favorites like ``Tell It Like It Is'' and ``Natural High.''
</P>
<P>
   For my son it was a special treat to hear a professional
composer discuss his craft and plink some keys. Kaiser allowed the
students to do some plinking and composing as well. This connected
with the 15-year-old composer I know. He has original tunes and
lyrics criss-crossing in his head in search of fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Having someone like Kaiser on hand to discuss a lively art is
not uncommon for Mrs. Mansfield, who's taught generations in Waco
schools. In these nine weeks her fifth- and sixth-period class has
traveled far and wide, including Shakespeare's haunts and those of
the ancient Greeks. It's an honors course merging history and
English.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS. TAAS. Wherefore art thou?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously any direct connection between TAAS and composing music
is strained. We cannot have this, of course. We want our children
filling in bubbles _ tests and sample tests about where Ps go, and
Qs. All that matters ultimately is those bubbles. Funding,
reputation, careers, success, failure. They're all on the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right. This isn't your average class. Obviously, Mrs.
Mansfield _ Sharon is her name _ exercises some license in teaching
composition or history. And thank goodness she does.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Mrs. Mansfield. There are some teachers in Texas who can
only dream in Technicolor. They feel themselves shackled, the
grindstone of ``TAAS objectives'' spinning before them, a device
designed to sharpen only the serioulsy dull.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not alone. Kent State professor James Delisle, in
Teacher Magazine, writes about a sabbatical teaching South Carolina
fourth- and fifth-graders and the stifling weight of the Basic
Skills Assessment Program _ South Carolina's TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 90 minutes each morning for five days, students in grades
2-5 stopped learning and began bubbling in circles, an arduous job
in itself for some, whose chubby fingers tried mightily to color
within the lines, a task not yet mastered with big-page coloring
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The real thing, of course, is preceded by practice tests, and
rote drilling, and formulas for acing the test. In Texas
elementaries, the formulaic approach to passing the TAAS writing
portion produces abominable repetition, replete with compelled
counting of lines and words. It's not writing. It's regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, it passes TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   So, you might ask, in this environment, what business does a
songwriter have in an English class? After all, how many
songwriters do we need? What's the cost-benefit ratio?
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forfend that we should inspire children by the muse, by
the senses, by human potential that knows no percentile breakdown
and can't be quantified by the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for making my son's day, Mrs. Mansfield and Mr. Kaiser. I
hope this doesn't cost anyone his or her job.

   ``OPERA'S DYNAMIC DUO.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Even
for La Scala, home to the world's most factious opera fans, the
booing suffered by soprano Renee Fleming and tenor Marcello
Giordani was remarkable. During the first act of ``Lucrezia
Borgia,'' Fleming sings a showy aria while the tenor lies sleeping.
From her first note, a group of men in the La Scala's nosebleed
seats began to boo her loudly. But Fleming finished her trills and
roused her partner for a duet _ only to discover that the conductor
had fainted. Take about a disaster. Find out how out how two of
opera's shining stars survived this performance _ and how they
intend to scale the heights this fall _ in this profile from W

   ``OPERA'S DYNAMIC DUO.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Even
for La Scala, home to the world's most factious opera fans, the
booing suffered by soprano Renee Fleming and tenor Marcello
Giordani was remarkable. During the first act of ``Lucrezia
Borgia,'' Fleming sings a showy aria while the tenor lies sleeping.
From her first note, a group of men in the La Scala's nosebleed
seats began to boo her loudly. But Fleming finished her trills and
roused her partner for a duet _ only to discover that the conductor
had fainted. Take about a disaster. Find out how out how two of
opera's shining stars survived this performance _ and how they

   GLENN-AGING (San Francisco) _ The remarkable thing about
septuagenarian John Glenn's impending rocket ride to space is that
it's not remarkable at all, according to specialists in aging and
several residents who are older than America's oldest astronaut. By
MICHAEL DOUGAN.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SENATE (San Francisco) _ Republican Senate candidate Matt
Fong has told gay Republicans that if elected he would work to pass
a wide range of federal gay rights laws _ even though he gave

and ZACHARY COILE.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   THAI-ECONOMY (Bangkok, Thailand) _ More than a year after the
financial meltdown began in Thailand, observers say they see signs
of recovery. As Thailand restructures its economy according to the
dictates of the International Monetary Fund in return for a $17.2
billion bailout, there is plenty of work for U.S. lawyers and
bankers. By DAVID ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ People are asking whether it's time to
get back into the stock market after it has inflicted so much pain.
Honestly, the market is sending signals to investors who have fled
that this is a good time to step back in. By PAMELA YIP.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSPAPER-APPOINT (San Francisco) _ Stephen C. Johnson has been
named vice president of circulation for the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which oversees advertising, circulation and printing for

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-POSTERS (Undated) _ Movie posters have become big
business, though not for today's films. The big bucks go to
decades-old movie paper items _ usually 27-by-41-inch posters or
``one sheets,'' but also photo stills, oversized color ``lobby
cards'' and other posters. By BRUCE WESTBROOK.
</P>
<P>
   HOFFMANN-OPERA-REVIEW (Houston) _ Vocally, Jacques Offenbach's
opera ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' is unusual: A few singers portray a
multitude of main characters in great tests of musical flexibility
and dramatic versatility. Using stories by 19th-century German
writer and composer E.T.A. Hoffmann, French librettist Jules
Barbier created a web of revelations aimed ultimately at allowing
listeners to see Hoffmann's life from many perspectives. By CHARLES
WARD.
</P>

   PHANTASM-FILM-PROFILE (Undated) _ As Angus Scrimm sees it, the

least in his mind,'' Scrimm said of the black-clad villain bent on
populating Earth with reanimated corpses. By BRUCE WESTBROOK.
</P>
<P>
   LION-KINGII-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a movie makes $772 million
worldwide, wins two Oscars, and becomes the top-selling video of
all time (at 30 million), making a sequel is a no-brainer. But the
surprise of ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' is that this
follow-up to 1994's ``The Lion King'' is being offered here solely
on video. By BRUCE WESTBROOK.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID-PET-TRICKS (Houston) _ The mood wasn't right for Josie,
the slow-dancing poodle. Babe, a Jack Russell terrier dressed in
Yankee pinstripes, couldn't perform a perfect back flip. And Aman,
a 14-foot python, didn't know what to do beyond clinging closely to
his owner. Yes, it was difficult to tell the stupid pet tricks from
the stupid human tricks at ``Late Show With David Letterman''
auditions. But it was fun trying. By MIKE McDANIEL.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-REPORTING (New York) _ Four television networks will pay a
combined $17.6 billion over the next eight years for the privilege
of televising National Football League games. For broadcast
reporters, the partnership is forgotten. Ask any network personnel
who work the trenches and they'll tell you which league is the most
difficult to cover. By PETE DOUGHERTY.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-FLUTIE (San Francisco) _ The Buffalo Bills have won three
straight games under Doug Flutie's command, since Rob Johnson
injured his ribs. They have gone from 0-3 to 4-3. They are fun to
watch. Flutie bedevils opponents and bewitches everyone else. By
GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Have you noticed that everybody
running for office this year seems so-o-o-o sensitive? Oh, sure,
you've heard some chatter about issues in this year's election
season. Frankly, though, most candidates seem more interested in
portraying themselves as victims of mean, nasty, unprincipled
opponents bent on sullying their reputations. By DAN LYNCH.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 27. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top news is divided between the upcoming midterm election
and the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today leads with its new poll finding the Republicans and
Democrats in a virtual dead heat in their contest for Congress. The
New York Times goes with the eruption of a financial squabble
between Democrats campaigning for seats in the House and Senate on
the one hand and the White House and the DNC on the other. The
Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times lead with Slobodan
Milosevic's carefully conducted withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo province in the face of Tuesday's NATO airstrike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The USAT lead states that the paper's latest sampling gives the
Republicans a 2 percent edge among likely voters, which is within
the poll's 4 percent margin of error. (And the margin of error is
given in the second paragraph, although the number of adults in the
sample is in the 13th paragraph.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper, 47 percent of those surveyed say
policies proposed by the GOP Congress would lead the country in the
right direction, while 70 percent say President Clinton's policies
would lead the country in the right direction. The paper takes this
to mean voters like the balance of a Democrat in the White House
alongside a Republican-controlled Congress. (Of course, there are
two other possibilities left unmentioned: 1) a significant number
of people think the two parties are leading the country in the same
direction, and 2) voters are incoherent.)
</P>
<P>
   USAT provides further interpretation when it quotes a GOP
pollster's comment, ``A few weeks ago, this election looked like a
baked Alaska. Now it seems to be more like rice pudding,'' and
finds this to mean ``Voter excitement has dimmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times lead details ``unusually bitter'' feelings expressed
by several Democratic candidates desirous of eleventh-hour cash
that the party high command is instead putting money into erasing
party debt and the launch of Al Gore's presidential campaign.
Candidates apparently also feel that party officials have
discouraged donations by making dire predictions of a loss of as
many as 25 Democratic House seats. The comment Rep. Charles Rangel
is quoted as directing towards the Democratic party chairman, Roy
Romer, sums up the mood: ``Keep your money and shut up your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The WP and LAT leads (and the NYT off-lead) say that over the
weekend a detailed negotiating session between Milosevic and top
NATO officials resulted in the Serbs' pledge to withdraw 4,500
police troops and two-thirds of the Yugoslav army units. The paper
says that as of early Tuesday, a U.S. diplomat reported up to 4,000
troops had left the area. The Post also says that at one point NATO
caught some Serb tanks heading in the wrong direction. But once
confronted, the Serbs turned them around. The LAT says Milosevic
``has probably done enough to escape airstrikes for now....'' In
the wake of the pullback, the NYT notices a harbinger of the
region's next problem: the reemergence of Albanian freedom
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal front-page news box and USAT's Money
front report that the government has sued Time Warner, charging
that the company has misclassified hundreds of full-time employees
(many of them writers and photographers) as free-lancers, wrongly
denying them benefits in the process. The Journal notes that the
suit marks the first time the Clinton administration has officially
weighed in on the increasingly contentious issue of holding down
employment costs by outsourcing work to those not considered
full-time. The paper says the government's move could extend well
beyond Time Warner, and mentions another company that might get
cross-haired: Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half into the Microsoft trial and a paper has
finally done a piece on the oddity of Bill Gates not testifying in
person. Even though he is the personification of the company, an
inside WP story observes that defense lawyers might have viewed him
as so ``prickly and combustible'' as to undermine his own case.
</P>
<P>
   The paper quotes one lawyer who once questioned the world's
richest man live: ``At one point he just started screaming, saying
that what the (FTC) staff was doing to his company was
socialistic....(T)hen he got angrier and called it communistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Several readers found Monday's mention of the LAT lead story
about how California was lagging in its share of federal education
funds a bit brisk. They were right. The piece posed a number of
issues that cried out for further attention. It stated that ranking
31st in federal funds per pupil meant that somehow California was
not getting its ``fair share.'' Well, ideally every state's per
pupil amount should be the same, and failing that, one should
expect fair per pupil spending to follow something like a
bell-curve distribution, with most of the states over time
clustering around the middle of the pack. So 31st really isn't that
bad. And is it right for a paper to promote local interests that
hard anyway? Shouldn't the LAT ask first if for instance, the kids
in Mississippi need the money more?
</P>
<P>
   All the papers report that Monday a computer problem halted
trading at the New York Stock Exchange for about an hour. The
papers give precise accounts of the standstill with one glaring
exception: none mentions the brand of computer that failed. Is this
lazy reporting or a gentleman's agreement not to hurt any computer
company's stock price?

REPORTING ON THE NFL REQUIRES A STRONG OFFENSE  
 NFL STILL HOLDING REPORTERS TO SIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four television networks will pay a combined $17.6
billion over the next eight years for the privilege of televising
National Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of sideline reporting, the partnership is
forgotten. Ask any of the handful of network personnel who work the
trenches _ at least in the broadcasting sense _ and they'll tell
you which league is the most difficult to cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far, the NFL is the most restrictive,'' said ABC's Lesley
Visser, a veteran in the sidelines game who now fills the role on
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think because you're a rightsholder you'd get a little
more access,'' said Bonnie Bernstein, in her first year of work for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the level of cooperation has improved. Sideline
reporting, a long-time staple of many college, NBA and baseball
telecasts, was given approval grudgingly by pro football only a few
years ago. Even then, it was on a highly restricted basis.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has opened up to the point of allowing network reporters
on the field, as long as they aren't stationed between the 20-yard
lines. They are not permitted to interview coaches on camera but
they can try to get a quick comment, which they can relay to
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've opened up a lot the last couple of years,'' said Mark
Wolff, lead-game producer for CBS. ``We've made some proposals to
them that they'll take under consideration next year, but that
doesn't preclude us from following the stories going into the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Armen Keteyian, sideline reporter for the lead CBS game each
week, spent eight years with ABC News, reporting on hard-edged and
issue-related sports stories for ``World News Tonight.'' Those may
feel like the good ol' days compared to what he faces now in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear anything in the huddles,'' Keteyian said.
``There's no access to the coaching staff. There's really no access
to the trainers. My main thing is to get interesting information
from the coaches coming off the field and going on the field. Maybe
two or three other times during the game I'll provide not
analytical insight, but reporting information that I was able to
dig up during the days prior to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of the on-field reporter is to provide information the
announcers in the press box can't get. Much of it is related to
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things happen on the field, I should try at least to get
in close proximity to the players who are involved,'' said ESPN's
Solomon Wilcots, a former defensive back for the Cincinnati
Bengals. ``I can overhear conversations, I can see things being
done and have a better understanding of what's happening than the
guys upstairs in the booth. Then I'm to relay that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcots scored in one of his early broadcasts when he followed
injured New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn into the tunnel
during an exhibition game. Wilcots was the first to report that
Sehorn's knee injury likely ended his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him get off the cart and try to walk on that leg
going into the locker room,'' Wilcots said. ``He was very unstable,
very unsure of himself. He looked at me. I asked him, `How's the
knee,' and he didn't want to answer my question, but he gave me
that look. As a former player, I know that look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to come on and say, `He's done,' but I said
I've talked to Jason Sehorn and he was very unsure and he had to be
helped inside. Later, because of the report I had given earlier in
the game, we were all waiting for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcast field, nailing that report can be akin to
intercepting a Brett Favre pass and running it back for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite that good,'' Wilcots said. ``I felt great, but
that's my job.''

IN BIRTHPLACE OF FINANCIAL CRISIS, OPTIMISM EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ As a metaphor, nothing could be starker:
Towering, isolated support columns, marching across the cityscape,
connected to nothing, going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   These columns are the bones of an unfinished elevated rail and
road system for this congested hothouse of 10 million people. Its
construction came to a screeching halt when the Asian fiscal crisis
began last year. The authorities in Thailand vow to resume
construction of the badly needed $3.2 billion transportation
project, but they don't say when.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, a southeast Asian nation of 60 million people, is
Ground Zero for the financial crisis that began July 2, 1997, when
Bangkok devalued its currency, the baht.
</P>
<P>
   That move quickly and unexpectedly set off a round of
devaluation in other countries, shaking world financial markets,
causing rampant currency speculation, spooking investors and
inspiring neighboring Malaysia to impose controls on the outflow of
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 16 months after the meltdown started, observers here
say they can see the first signs of recovery. As Thailand
restructures its economy according to the dictates of the
International Monetary Fund in return for a $17.2 billion bailout,
there is plenty of work for U.S. businesspeople. Lawyers and
bankers are especially busy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Donovan, president of New York-based Donovan Consulting
Group, said he went to Bangkok to help the Bank of Thailand
restructure its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, hunkered down in the riverside Shangri-la Hotel,
arrived in July, intending to stay two weeks. He's been living in
the hotel ever since. ``Business here moves like the traffic,'' he
said, alluding to the Thai capital's notorious snarl of autos,
scooters, coughing trucks and fuming buses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Donovan declines to say exactly what he's advising the
Bank of Thailand to do, he makes it clear in words and gestures
that it's serious business. Snapping off the filters from his
cigarettes, Donovan chain-smokes as he talks, saying of his
company, ``We generally show up when you've had a meltdown. We're
the last people you ever want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   While asserting that Thailand has a long way to go to match
international business procedures and standards, Donovan praised
the year-old government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai: ``From
where they were 18 months ago, it's really a different country.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas D. Mancill, who joined the Bangkok office of the
international law firm Deacons Graham &AMP; James in August as a
consultant on debt restructuring, said that Thailand is just now
writing effective foreclosure and bankruptcy laws. It is also just
starting to meet international standards of accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing right now in Thailand is some debtors have the
ability to pay, but have decided not to pay,'' Mancill said. ``If
their competitors are paying their debts, the non-payer can
undercut them by 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Thai parliament is writing legislation with
sharper teeth to regulate commerce, Mancill said. ``It's a
challenge,'' he said of his job as an expatriate American lawyer.
``The law is changing before your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   All these changes are aimed, of course, at sparking a recovery.
``The signs are there that we have probably touched bottom,'' said
David Hendrix, an executive vice president with the Bank of Asia
and a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading indicators are good. The stock market is better.
Interest rates have come down, and there is pent-up demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix predicted possible growth in the gross domestic product
in the second or third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bouncing baht, worth 25 to the dollar when Thailand devalued
it, went as high as 53 to the dollar. Recently, it has been running
at 39 to the dollar. As a consequence, doing business in Thailand
is a decidedly up and down experience.
</P>
<P>
   At Horizons International Accents, a San Francisco accessories
company that imports 80 percent of its products from Thailand,
proprietors Jeffrey Walsh and Mona Sheerr say the fiscal crisis has
both helped and hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of devaluation of the baht, we can buy everything
cheaper,'' said Walsh, who visits Thailand four times a year, but
``there's a downside to the upside.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: some skilled carvers who sculpt wooden animals that
Horizons sells to Gumps, Neiman-Marcus and Bloomingdale's are
leaving the trade because they can't earn a living anymore, raising
concerns about product quality.
</P>
<P>
   Horizons, a 12-year-old company with a warehouse in Daly City,
Calif., and showroom in High Point, N.C., operates in what Sheerr
calls ``the medium to high end'' of the market. An elephant head
carved from wood and given a fine finish can command $300 from an
upscale American retailer.
</P>
<P>
   But, with demand for cheap Thai goods running high, just getting
adequate supplies of shipping containers from multinational
shipping lines can be a problem, Sheerr and Walsh say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no stability, and we have no security,'' Walsh said.

ALL'S FAIR IN POLITICS AND WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Have you noticed that everybody running for
office this year seems so-o-o-o sensitive?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, you've heard some chatter about issues in this year's
election season. Frankly, though, most candidates seem more
interested in portraying themselves as victims of mean, nasty,
unprincipled opponents bent on sullying their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for example, Republican Gov. George Pataki refuses
to debate Peter Vallone, the New York City Council speaker. This is
not, the governor assures us, because Pataki is so far ahead that
it would be strategic insanity to endanger that lead. No, it's
because Vallone, a Democrat, said something unkind about the
governor in a magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who literally wept in front
of television cameras six years ago after his then-opponent, Robert
Abrams, called him a fascist, is now deeply wounded that Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, keeps calling him a liar. This guy
is a real putzhead, says the sensitive D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this is tactics. It's about rallying the
sympathy vote _ or, at least, about erecting a screen or moral
outrage to avoid confronting opponents directly. Every once in a
while, though _ even though they're politicians _ some of these
people do deserve a little sympathy. That's when their families get
dragged into it. John Sweeney, Republican candidate for New York's
22nd Congressional District _ the seat being vacated by House Rules
Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon _ is furious because one
Democratic county chairman in his district wrote a letter to a
newspaper over the weekend demanding that Sweeney answer a nasty
rumor about Sweeney's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has been the target of an unremitting stream of vile
rumors ever since he got into this thing. Most of them accuse him,
essentially, of being a guy who works too hard at having a good
time in life. They were first brought up by the forces of the
conservative primary opponents that Sweeney handily trounced in
September. They got little press attention then _ and, candidly,
deserved even less. But this letter to the editor from Saratoga
County Democratic Chairman Tom Bayly added one rumor that hadn't
seen print before, namely, that Sweeney's estranged wife had
obtained an order of protection against him. Betty Sweeney
immediately staged a news conference to deny that and to denounce
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Bayly said Monday, ``I'm an American. I have a right to
ask the man who would be my congressman to clear up something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The key element of all this, though, is that Sweeney views that
public question not as legitimate curiosity on the part of one
county chairman but as a planned tactic of his Democratic opponent,
Jean Bordewich, to smear him in the campaign's final week. Not
true, Bordewich says. She didn't know Bayly was going to do that.
That's right, Bayly says. He's a county chairman, and he didn't ask
her permission.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this has been a genteel general election
campaign. Bordewich and Sweeney are both moderates, candidates
about 15 degrees apart on the issues. He hasn't criticized her, and
her only real complaint about him has been that Sweeney is a
lifetime political operative _ a guy who has devoted his entire
career to working within the machinery of the democratic process.
As political attacks go, that's fairly tepid stuff. In this case,
though, Sweeney says he was essentially accused of beating his
wife, which isn't true, and he didn't like the fact that this was
one charge that his kids asked about. This one, Sweeney says, was
personal. Political pro or not, he's taking it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Which illustrates, essentially, that democracy is a contact
sport, and that everybody feels the pressure as election day draws
near. I saw Peter Vallone Monday morning. How's it going, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven days, 12 hours and 47 minutes to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. And counting.

BUFFALO BILLS AND THE MAGIC FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Supermarkets had to start rationing Flutie
Flakes almost as soon as they came out, one box per customer. The
grocers couldn't keep them in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast treat was released only in Buffalo and Boston, but
there could be a national market developing for the flakes, just as
there could soon be a national infatuation with the Little
Quarterback Who Could.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills have won three straight games under Doug
Flutie's command, since Rob Johnson injured his ribs. They have
gone from 0-3 to 4-3. They have become an endearing amalgamation of
misfits _ a Rust Belt town, a chronically frustrated franchise (see
Super Bowl, losers) and a shunned quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, they are fun to watch. Flutie bedevils
opponents and bewitches everyone else. On Sunday night, he turned a
30-14 win over Carolina into a piece of pure theater.
</P>
<P>
   He scooted and twisted and spun and wriggled. He threw long,
tight spirals, and little soft rainbows that touched down exactly
where they belonged.
</P>
<P>
   It was all remarkable, even if you didn't know the background _
how the NFL had little patience for the 5-foot-10-inch (in heavily
padded stockings) quarterback, and how Flutie was exiled for eight
years in the Canadian Football League. And how he added six
Canadian MVP trophies to the Heisman he won in college before a
team south of the border deigned to offer him a backup job.
</P>
<P>
   The only history anyone needed was a sampling of NFL football
this year _ dull, plodding, uninspired. There are about six or
seven good teams, the commentators say, and they are being
generous. Watching is an exercise in tedium. A 30-14 game? Where's
the remote? Then along comes Flutie, full of surprises, an
original.
</P>
<P>
   Against Jacksonville a week ago, he was rushed by a huge
defensive lineman who blocked his view _ exactly what the scouts
and coaches feared when they said he could never make it in the
NFL. Flutie jumped into the air as if to look for a receiver over
the defender's head. The big man froze, thinking the quarterback
had flung a pass. Flutie came down, ball still in hand, and started
running into a nice stretch of open field. The play gave new
meaning to the term ``pump fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Carolina, he looked as quick as ever. Two days after his
36th birthday, he could still make defensive linemen dive and miss.
</P>
<P>
   One Panther, obviously frustrated, hit him late on a play,
dragging him down like a ragdoll. A Buffalo lineman came over to
protect him, to retaliate. Flutie popped up from the turf and
wedged himself between the two giants, practically disappearing
from view, engulfed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly, the Buffalo lineman backed away. The pipsqueak
had prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, on the Bills sideline, coaches and players
grinned in spite of themselves. These were not the smug grins of a
contented winner. They were the smiles of jaded people witnessing
something fresh and different.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie isn't the only comeback quarterback this season. Randall
Cunningham, forced on sabbatical the year before last, has been
revitalized at age 35 in Minnesota. Steve DeBerg, 44, shook off
formaldehyde to start Sunday for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But those two had their chances before. And neither of them
looks microscopic in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, the Bills meet Miami, coached by Jimmy Johnson, who
has a history with Flutie. Back in 1984, when Johnson was a coach
on the move at the University of Miami, his Hurricanes lost a
nationally televised spectacle to Boston College. Flutie ended the
game with a touchdown pass widely remembered as the greatest
collegiate football play not involving a member of the Stanford
marching band.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins prepared to meet Buffalo in an earlier game
this fall, Miami's coach bridled at questions about that
14-year-old loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't the only team we lost to,'' Johnson said of
Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had met up with Flutie since, he said: ``Well,
I never coached Canadian football, so no.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Flutie loses one game, he could be back on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, he is a phenomenon. His Flutie Flakes, put out by
a specialty food company in Pittsburgh, promise to raise a ton of
money for his foundation to fight autism, which afflicts one of his
children. The cereal has become a collector's item, part of the
Flutie legend, which is as large as he is small.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dalton, of the Bills public relations staff, tells a story
with a hint of myth to it.
</P>
<P>
   A Bills employee drove to the airport on an errand last week,
left the company car at the curb illegally for a minute or so, came
back and found a police officer writing a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The employee tried to plead with the officer, who wouldn't
budge. Then the policeman noticed the Bills' staff sticker on the
car. The team employee sensed a change of heart. He waited for the
officer to ask for good seats to the next home game. But that
wasn't the sort of graft the officer had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make this go away,'' he reportedly said, ``if you can
get me two boxes of Flutie Flakes.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Too old to trick-or-treat, too young to drive
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is the statute of limitations on Halloween? At what age are
you supposed to cede the streets to the little kids and take your
place behind the front-door candy bowl?
</P>
<P>
   The National Halloween Standards Commission says
trick-or-treating should cease at age 12. The National Organization
of Costume Manufacturers says 28. The World Toilet Paper Marketing
Association and National Egg Council say 21.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, I'm making that up. Parents facing this question are on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   I've always dreaded this decision. Every year I'd think about it
when the late-wave trick-or-treaters arrived. The late-wavers
aren't usually too elaborate in costuming. They arrive with a sack
and a little bit of green sprayed into their hair at right about
the time you are calling it a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are costumed as Troubled Youth,'' they seem to say. ``We
personify your fears about what your kids will grow into once
they're in middle school. Make us offerings of candy and we will go
away for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   And I do. It's a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In person and at the door, however, they are not quite that
articulate. They just stand there, a quarter-embarrassed to be
going through a ritual that's too fun to give up easily.
</P>
<P>
   They usually just say ``hey,'' and hold out their bags.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the last trick-or-treater of the night was a
kid in baggy shorts and a large T-shirt _ the universal
middle-school male costume _ and about as tall as I am. His one
concession to costuming was a plastic Tweetybird mask hanging down
around his neck with an elastic tie.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't strike me as the Tweetybird type. He seemed to have a
5 o'clock shadow, but maybe that's just how he looked by the light
of a plastic, battery-powered pumpkin. I took his mask to be in the
spirit of cheap irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he announced himself.
</P>
<P>
   I made a mental note to have a talk with my kids in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is a few years later and kids are ambivalent. They
are at the age when they wish they could both drive and
trick-or-treat. An age in which girls can be stylish among their
peers wearing lipstick and those plastic barrettes that have a
poodle stamped on them and are soft enough to chew on if one gets
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Everything older and younger looks simultaneously better at that
age. Only the present seems lousy.
</P>
<P>
   I'd tell them they are too old for this and threaten to draft
them for Halloween door duty but they are not sure whether to
believe me. I am threatening the natural order of holidays as they
have always lived it. How can you be too old for trick-or-treat but
too young to sit at the big people's table at Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   The kids suspect my lack of holiday spirit enters into my
puzzling suggestion that they need to change their usual plans. And
it's true, I do not much like Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   It makes arts and crafts demands I cannot satisfy. Lawn
decoration to me means I bring the lawnmower inside. The scariest
costume I've come up with from the kids' point of view is what I
would buy them for school if I were left in a store unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   And I am constitutionally unable to estimate candy demand.
Either I give kids individual M&AMP;Ms at the door by way of rationing,
or I'm left with a sticky and moldering candy pile until
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in the spirit of scientific inquiry, I dispatched a small
hill of post-Halloween candy corn, by biting off one section at a
time _ white yellow, orange _ to see if the colors tasted any
different. They don't. My plan to pass off the white candy-corn
tips as a delicacy was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Week-old Halloween candy can make you do these things. It's a
recognized legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my anti-Halloween bias does make me too quick to suggest
other plans for the night. I going by these impartial rules:
</P>
<P>
   _ Any kid who, without the aid of costume, looks scary coming at
you in the dark is too old for trick-or-treating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kids who are mortified at the thought of being photographed in
costume must move to candy distribution duties.
</P>
<P>
   I don't make the rules, I just enforce them.

 &HT;    MAKING TRACKS ACROSS EUROPE: A standout in Monte Carlo
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Joe Murray has been traveling around Western
Europe by train. This is one in a series of stories.)
</P>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ I sit in the outdoor cafe in the shadow of
the Casino du Monte Carlo surrounded by the beautiful people of
Monaco. If I am ever to stand out in a crowd, this is the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I think I could get to like these folks who drape themselves
with silk scarves and cashmere sweaters looped loosely about the
neck. Silly me, I wore a tie.
</P>
<P>
   If I had it to do over again I'd have worn sunglasses and a deep
tan.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the beautiful people don't look all that beautiful to
me. The ladies, in particular, look as if they may have stayed out
in the sun too long _ say about 50 years too long.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. They still have that rich sheen about them. Maybe
it's the same thing, being pretty rich.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rich are different from you and me. They live in
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   All about me is much ado, hugging and kissing and carrying on
with great flourishes of foreign verbiage, such is the ritual of
their assembling with those of their own kind, as if they are all
long-lost brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   If they notice me at all, no doubt, it is to wonder, ``C'est le
bastard at zee family reunion?''
</P>
<P>
   I envy them their fellowship and wish I could join in their
conversation, or at least listen in.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but the French language. It is music to the ear, poetry to
the eye but a tanglement to the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   I like what Mark Twain had to say about it: The French speak
beautifully. They just don't spell very well. Or was it the other
way around?
</P>
<P>
   These days I get a bit confused in my English as well.
</P>
<P>
   I took a car down from Nice, which is just up the road if any
place was ever just up the road.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was as advertised, breath-taking. Indeed, I gasped
every couple of minutes as the driver propelled us along the
twisting two-lane road through mountain tunnels and zigzag curves,
to deliver me at the doorstep of the casino by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful day in the world's richest neighborhood, a
Kodachrome kind of day when sea and sky blend at the azure juncture
of the horizon, each bluer than the other as you look from one to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   I celebrate my being here in my own small way.
</P>
<P>
   Though I usually refrain from drinking, I am having a glass of
white wine, and though I usually refrain from eating meat, I am
having a plate of oysters, which is followed by a tureen of the
best French onion soup the world has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   (Something about those French onions that beats the heck out of
anything out of Vidalia, Ga., or Noonday, Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe later I'll smoke a Monte Christo and sip a cup of cafe au
lait, anything to prolong the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, too, I'll drop in at the casino for a bit of baccarat in
the private rooms.
</P>
<P>
   If they stop me at the door to ask my name, I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name is Bond,'' I'll reply. ``Bubba Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   At which point the music will rise to a crescendo, not the 007
theme but ``Foggy Mountain Breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Am I dreaming? Of course I am. Like every country boy, I've been
dreaming about this kind of place all my life.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, leaving the cafe, I catch myself singing under my
breath ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the good ol' boy who broke the bank at Monte Carrr-lo.''

 &HT;    Texas politicians venture out onto the Web
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Mindy Tucker listens for the sound of the
political future, she hears millions of screeches _ the screeches
of modems all over Texas logging onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see a time, not so far away, where Web sites are
a permanent part of any and all campaigns,'' said Tucker, deputy
communications director of Gov. George W. Bush's re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7 million people connected to the Internet in
Texas, the Web is quickly becoming the newest pulpit for candidates
preaching the word. More candidates than ever are using
communication tools such as e-mail and Web pages to further their
political platform.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts predict the 2000 election will be the first
election deeply affected by the Internet, impatient, trailblazing
candidates are testing the Web with the hope that being in
cyberspace will translate into votes.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national survey done by Campaigns and Elections, a
trade publication for the political industry, 63.3 percent of
candidates polled said they already had a Web site, with another
20.7 percent saying they expected to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor-in-chief of Campaigns and Elections, added
that more Republicans than Democrats have sites and that
Republicans were spending more on the design of their sites.
Candidates on the East Coast were more likely to have a campaign
site than those elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a site doesn't so much say whether a candidate is
technologically hip as it answers to the general population whether
or not a campaign is connected to the real world,'' said Jonathan
Coopersmith, an associate professor of history at Texas A&AMP;M
University. Coopersmith's academic focus is on how technology
affects politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shafer, deputy editor of Slate, an online political
magazine, agreed with Coopersmith but said he's not seeing
sophisticated use of the medium yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still waiting for a political entrepreneur to combine a
potent message with the right Internet technology and connect with
voters,'' Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush and his Democratic opponent, Gar-- y Mauro, have
Web sites that approach the potential seen by experts. Bush's Web
designer based his technologically advanced site on one maintained
by brother Jeb Bush, Republican nominee for governor of Florida.
Jeb Bush's site is considered one of the best on the Web and cost
his campaign $26,000, one of the most expensive political sites in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's site includes up-to-date poll information and
multimedia clips, including a five-minute biographical video and
the campaign's television commercials, all on a nifty, easy-to-use,
light-up menu. The site also provides direct access to the campaign
by posting direct -- -mail links to Bush and campaign
administrators, and a secure link to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the governor's site was put together for $4,000,
``roughly the price of one television commercial.'' The money was
spent on the site's slick design, and campaign workers now update
it for no cost. To date, the site has been visited by more than
60,000 users, which is a trickle compared with news sites such as
CNN.com, which attracts more than 200,000 users a day.
</P>
<P>
   But Faucheux said a true tally of users and the site's
effectiveness in reaching voters won't be possible until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to interpolate how many people are using these
sites'' because use is building steadily and likely won't peak
until Nov. 3, Faucheux said. ``After the election, we'll have a
better idea of who and how many were using the sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush site has raised more than $3,000 in online donations,
which Tucker said is below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns want to raise enough money online to pay for
their sites, Fa-- cheux said. If they succeed, online campaigning
is basically free.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaign site, designed by a few Web-savvy campaign
workers, cost the campaign nothing and is updated in-house. The
site includes interactive links to pages telling how to volunteer,
where to donate to the campaign and how to get in touch with Mauro.
John Hannah, Mauro's press secretary, said the site has been used a
lot, though he won't give specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been used mostly for information purposes and not
specifically for raising money, though it does provide phone
numbers on how to donate to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities inherent in such a cheap, powerful tool will
be especially attractive to candidates of the future. A Web-savvy
intern using a basic Internet connection can create and maintain a
political site on the Web for about $25-$50 a month. With campaign
finance reform around the corner, Shafer predicted, candidates will
be driven to use the Web as a campaign tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this big hue and cry that there's too much money in
elections,'' said Shafer from his Washington office. ``But one of
the reasons there is so much demand for cash is because television
time is so expensive. The Web is this incredibly low-priced
alternative. Next to television, it's almost costless.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether voters are ready for a cyberspace
campaign. Faucheux thinks they are, but to a limited degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this medium will never supercede television or radio, if
done in the right way it can effectively disseminate information
and mobilize voters,'' Fa-- cheux said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Price, a business development manager for Austin Title who
surfs the Net seven days a week and votes in every election, said
he has never looked at a political site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for more straight news than political advocacy,''
Price said. ``Besides, when you combine the skepticism everyone has
towards politics and the distrust we have towards the Internet,
it's a double whammy. You've got to question the source and be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Slate editor Shafer sees another problem with campaigning on the
Web. The Internet is vast, and it's easy for a campaign site to get
lost in the universe of World Wide Web addresses alongside the
millions of personal, sports and pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shafer, time won't solve this problem, but money
will. Shafer's solution lies in online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are certain sites, like a lot of the popular news
Web pages, where you can buy banner ads which can pinpoint users in
certain ZIP codes,'' Shafer said. ``Campaigns will need to purchase
these focused ads and deliver them in such a compelling way that
people will click through the banners to get to the actual site,''
thus delivering tightly targeted audiences to campaigns and
improving the effectiveness of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even with political skepticism and distrust of the Internet
slowing advancement, both Shafer and Coopersmith think online
campaigns will play an essential part in the 2000 elections. That
year, Shafer predicted, the Internet will yield at least 10 percent
of grass-root donations, and getting the word out about candidates
will be done primarily through -- -mail. He went on to predict that
we are only four years away from voting by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Coopersmith was a little more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 is when you'll see the true birth of Internet campaign,''
Coopersmith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a presidential year, so the money will be there to
really advertise the sites. More importantly, the candidates will
have the benefit of two years to learn more about the Internet and
build on their experience, resources and the public's interest.''

 &HT;    Reviews of Texas political web sites
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the Internet's popularity growing by the
day, politicians are beginning to post Web sites and take advantage
of the medium to campaign. Here are a couple of exemplary sites and
the addresses of the Democratic and Republican parties' sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ www.Bush98.com _ The best campaign Web site in Texas (top
right). The site, which was put together for $4,000, has all of
Gov. George W. Bush's speeches and television commercials. It also
includes -- -mail links to him and a how-to on donating money to
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.Mauro.org _ An amazing effort for a site that cost nothing
(bottom right). This site posts Garry Mauro's positions, photos
from the campaign and a Q&AMP;A that is periodically updated with
readers' inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.TexasGOP.org _ This site is the official home of the Texas
Republicans. Here, you can access all Republican Web sites. You can
also check up on races and make contributions to the party.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.TxDemocrats.org _ The official home of the Texas
Democratic party is not as impressive as the Republican Web site,
but it is just as informative and gives all available direct links
to Texas Democratic candidates.

JUDGE THROWS OUT POLICE BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawyers for environmental protesters say they
will appeal the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused law enforcement
officers of using excessive force by applying pepper spray directly
around the eyes of nonviolent demonstrators who refused to leave
private property.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Cummings, a Berkeley lawyer representing the protesters,
said Monday that the ruling would increase the use of the caustic
chemical by the police and chill civil protest. He said he would
appeal the order.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Delaney, an attorney for the law enforcement officers in
Humboldt County said the decision was well reasoned and vindicated
officers who had dabbed the pepper spray liquid around the eyes of
demonstrators. It was not ``some rally point to use more'' of the
spray, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San
Francisco came in a case that had drawn international attention
after the airing of videotapes of law enforcement officers wiping
the liquid around the eyes of crying protesters. The demonstrators
had locked themselves on private property in the Northern
California county in 1997 to protest logging of ancient redwood
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters then sued the Humboldt County Sheriff's
Department and the Eureka Police Department, claiming the use of
excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But in what attorneys for both sides said appeared to be the
nation's first ruling to condone such use of pepper spray on
nonviolent civilians, Walker concluded the officers had acted
reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper spray (made from cayenne pepper and called OC for its
chemical name, oleoresin-capsicum) is generally used to subdue
suspects who are resisting arrest and threatening public safety.
The spray has been linked to more than 40 deaths in California,
usually involving suspects who are mentally ill or intoxicated with
illicit drugs, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the Humboldt County case, a jury deadlocked 4-4 in August,
and a retrial was set for Nov. 16. But at the defendants' request,
Walker dismissed the suit, saying no reasonable jury could find the
officers had acted improperly.
</P>
<P>
   While noting it was usually up to a jury to decide whether
officers had used excessive force, Walker said judges may assume
that role when there was ``but one reasonable conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncontroverted evidence presented at trial,'' he wrote,
``unequivocally supports the conclusion that the officers acted
reasonably in using OC as a pain compliance technique in arresting
plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers did not threaten or use deadly force, or even
employ a significant level of physical force,'' he said. ``Rather,
the force used was merely the infliction of transient pain without
significant risk of physical injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stemmed from three incidents in September and
October 1997, when Humboldt County officers swabbed the liquid
around the eyes of anti-logging protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the demonstrators trespassed on private property
and locked themselves together using ``black bears,'' welded pieces
of heavy pipe through which they could join arms and resist arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, officers cut the pipe to remove the protesters, but
the cutting tools posed a risk of slicing their arms and shooting
sparks that could cause fire, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the videotapes of the incidents, which were played at
trial, Walker said the officers had first pleaded repeatedly with
the protesters to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the officers always rinsed the eyes of the
protesters with water after they were unlocked to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Noel Tendick, 21, said he was shocked by the order.
``That's contrary to what much of the nation felt ... what we felt
... what half the jury felt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Jones, executive director of Bay Area PoliceWatch, called
Walker's refusal to let a jury retry the case outrageous. He said
he feared the ruling would prompt other police departments to
directly apply OC.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU lawyer John Crew, however, said that though he disagreed
with the ruling, it appeared to narrowly apply to circumstances
surrounding the logging protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement should not be mistaken and think the court has
given the green light to using pepper spray on all nonviolent
protesters involved in civil disobedience,'' he said.

   Cute scarecrows and spooky ghosts are among October's crop of
characters in new children's books. Other standouts include an
impressive world atlas and a collection of touching stories about
friendship written by and for kids. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE LITTLE SCARECROW BOY &QL; 
 &UR; Margaret Wise Brown; illustrated by David Diaz (HarperCollins,
$15.95)
</P>
<P>
   This scarecrow coming-of-age story is set in a brightly colored
cornfield with autumn hues of gold, orange and brown and green. The
tale begins with father teaching son the finer points of scaring
crows. One morning, the boy sneaks past his sleeping parents and
runs to the cornfield, where he makes his debut as the scariest
scarecrow in the land. Proud Papa, watching from a distance, then
takes the boy home for a celebratory breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, best known for penning ``Goodnight Moon,'' wrote this
story in the 1940s. HarperCollins has published it for the first
time as a picture book, with bold and amusing illustrations by
Diaz. For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 10 MINUTES TILL BEDTIME &QL; 
 &UR; Peggy Rathmann (G.P. Putnam, $16.99)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for wacky?
</P>
<P>
   Just after an oblivious Dad with his nose in a newspaper
declares it's 10 minutes till bedtime, the boy's pet hamster
welcomes a family of visiting hamsters at the front door and gives
them a tour of the house. The boy and the hamsters get a nighttime
snack, brush their teeth, get their jammies on and settle in for a
story _ when billions and jillions more hamsters show up, clogging
the hallways with their vehicles and the bathtub with their rafts,
boats and lounge chairs.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticks on, the boy gets a bit worried and finally
screams: BEDTIME! The hamsters scamper away, and still clueless Dad
tucks his son in bed. Guaranteed giggles, by the author of ``Good
Night, Gorilla.'' For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A GIFT FOR ABUELITA: CELEBRATING THE DAY OF THE DEAD &QL; 
 &UR; Nancy Luenn; illustrated by Robert Chapman (Northland, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   This touching story about Rosita and her ``Abuelita'' _
grandmother _ is multilayered in meaning and quite literally in its
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The plot revolves around the Day of the Dead, the Hispanic
community's memorial celebration that usually takes place between
Oct. 31 and Nov. 2. Rosita loses and mourns her grandmother, then
heals herself by making preparations with her family to honor the
memory of ``Abuelita.'' memory. The text, in English and Spanish,
is both culturally and emotionally instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix artist Chapman's extraordinary work reflects the colors
and styles of the Mexican-American culture. His process involves
creating handcrafted molds from which paper casts are made, dried
and painted. The pieces then are photographed against tile
backgrounds. ``Magnifico!'' For ages 4-8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THANK YOU, MR. FALKER &QL; 
 &UR; Patricia Polacco (Philomel, $16.99)
</P>
<P>
   Trisha looked forward to going to school so she could learn how
to read. But when she opened a book, all she saw were wiggling
shapes. Other kids made fun of her, and she started to feel
different. By the time she reached fifth grade, she felt totally
stupid, and she hated school.
</P>
<P>
   Along came a new teacher, Mr. Falker. He raved about Trisha's
artwork, and held it up for the whole class to admire. He protected
her from kids who teased her. And one day, after school, he figured
out why Trisha couldn't read: She was dyslexic. Mr. Falker worked
every day with Trisha until the world of reading opened to her.
</P>
<P>
   This autobiographical tribute to the special teacher in
Polacco's life is a real-life demonstration that non-readers not
only can become readers, but can go on to become published writers
who also can draw! Kids facing similar challenges will feel
inspired. For ages 6-10.  &QL;

 &UR; Edgar Allan Poe; illustrated by Gilles Tibo (McClelland &AMP; Stewart,
$5.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``But we loved with a love that was more than love _ I and my
Annabel Lee. With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted
her and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe's classic ode to love and loss is beautifully depicted in
the soft paintings of Quebec artist Tibo, who created two children
playing in the tide, with gliding sea gulls, blue sky and fickle
seas that eventually claim Annabel Lee. Her death is handled with
grace, and the poem's message is that the two children remain
connected in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The book was named to American Bookseller's Pick of the List
when it first was published in 1988. Now, it has been redesigned
and issued in paperback at a lower price. For ages 8-11. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; EVEN STEPHEN &QL; 
 &UR; Johanna Hurwitz (Beech Tree Books, $4.95)
</P>
<P>
   This is the perfect middle-grade read for youngsters with
perfect older brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny adores Stephen, who is smart, popular and athletic. She
wants to be like him, but feels she'll never measure up. One day,
tragedy strikes, and Stephen fails in his attempt to save the day.
Though the failure is no fault of his, Stephen becomes depressed
and withdrawn. Sunny empathizes with her brother and figures out
how to help him. The story teaches good lessons about family,
understanding, self-esteem and growth. For ages 8-11. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GREAT GHOST STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; Selected and illustrated by Barry Moser (William Morrow &AMP; Co., $22)
</P>
<P>
   Curl up by the fireplace and get ready to get scared with this
collection of _ naturally _ 13 ghost stories by such masters of
suspense as Arthur Conan Doyle, Joyce Carol Oates, Bram Stoker (of
``Dracula'' fame), and H.G. Wells. These tales cover the terrain of
terror: haunted houses, the spirit world, and plenty of bodies. Not
for the easily spooked. For ages 8-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC WORLD ATLAS FOR YOUNG EXPLORERS &QL; 
 &UR; (National Geographic Books, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Aerial views of the continents, every conceivable type of map,
and photographs of world wonders ranging from the Lost City of the
Incas to the Grand Canyon are depicted in this comprehensive
collection published by the prestigious National Geographic
Society.
</P>
<P>
   The atlas contains information on every continent's physical
features, societies, economic and creative activities, and
political subdivisions. Fun facts that accompany each map help
students find information on various world regions, such as highest
mountains, longest rivers, most populous cities and major products.
People pictures put a human cast on global diversity, from Ninga
tribal drummers in Africa to bicyclists jamming China's busy
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Visually mesmerizing, the 176-page, large-format book would make
an ideal gift for adventurous spirits. For ages 8 and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE STONE SOUP BOOK OF FRIENDSHIP STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by William Rubel and Gerry Mandel (Tricycle Press, $8.95)
</P>
<P>
   These tales about friendship are special because of who wrote
them: authors between the ages of 8 and 13 who contribute to
``Stone Soup,'' a literary magazine by and for young people. These
best picks on the topic of friendship from the magazine's past 25
years are inspiring examples for all writers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Winds of Africa,'' 13-year-old Abbie Gunn sets her
story about tested friendship in the African savannah. ``Dandelion
Seeds'' captures a moment familiar to all of us: blowing dandelion
fluff. ``On the Headland'' begins with a girl and her dog walking
along the Maine coast: ``The Headland was gray and deserted, almost
sinister, with the heavy silver clouds gathered overhead.'' The
girl and her dog are headed toward trouble that day, but a handsome
stranger pulls them to safety. For ages 8-12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SNOW, SNOW: WINTER POEMS FOR CHILDREN &QL; 
 &UR; Jane Yolen; pictures by Jason Stemple (Boyds Mills Press, $16.95)
</P>
<P>
   This slim volume of poetry and stunning photos will put you in
the mood for winter. The diverse scenery includes snow-covered
Colorado Rockies, ice-covered rivers, ice-tipped branches and a
roaring snowmobile. Yolen, author of nearly 200 books, collaborated
with her photographer son to produce this work that will appeal to
young poets and snow fans. For ages 10-12. &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE CLINTON ENIGMA &QL; 
 &UR; David Maraniss (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17)
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss covered Bill Clinton for the ``Washington Post,'' wrote
a biography of him and became one of television's talking heads
when the Monica Lewinsky affair took over the news. Here he
dissects Clinton's Aug. 17 speech _ the infamous non-apology _ but
not before he grouses at length about the fact that Clinton refused
interviews with him when he was researching the biography ``First
in His Class.'' He tries to portray Clinton as evasive but sounds
so petty that you begin to think Clinton was smart to avoid him.
This slender volume, in which the author manages to plug his next
book repeatedly, is for those among you who are hungry for more
analysis of Clinton's troubles, more informed comment on his psyche
and more effort to keep the spin alive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TWINS &QL; 
 &UR; Ruth and Rachael Sandweiss (Running Press, $27.50)
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world has birthed twin books, and they are so
alike that it's embarrassing. This one (on the cover is actress
Jill Hennessy, late of television's ``Law and Order,'' and her
sister, Jacqueline) arrived two days before its soul mate, ``The
Book of Twins'' (Delacorte, $27.50) by Debra and Lisa Ganz. Yes,
twin authors and twin prices, and inside more of the same: actress
twins, doctor twins, police officer twins, twins who married twins,
pole-vaulting twins, belly-dancing twins, Bosnian twins, Siamese
twins, sets of twins in which one sibling is in a wheelchair, twins
whose siblings have died (with photos of the solitary survivors,
gazing into the distance). Both volumes have forgettable text and
too many photos in which everyone is laughing heartily. Another
coincidence: The oldest twins in each were born in 1904. Isn't it
eerie? If we dropped one book on the floor, the other would surely
feel its pain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GOD OF THE RODEO &QL; 
 &UR; Daniel Bergner (Crown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   ``The rodeo, to us, is kind of like making a good cake,'' Warden
Burl Cain told Bergner. ``Some of the ingredients by themselves
wouldn't be fit to eat. But you put them all together and you have
a nice cake.'' A nice cake _ there could not be a less appropriate
description of the rodeo at Angola, Louisiana's maximum-security
state penitentiary, where the ``ingredients'' were men incarcerated
for murder and rape with little or no chance for parole. When
Bergner first spoke to Cain, he was writing an article about the
rodeo _ a brutal event with obvious gladiatorial overtones _
for``'' ``Harper's'' magazine. With time, the story became a book
project, Bergner and Cain became enemies (Cain wanted a portion of
the book's proceeds in exchange for Bergner's continued access to
inmates), and Bergner's search came to include his own ``visions of
redemption.'' The result is a chilling portrayal of prison life and
a humanizing portrait of brutal men. Bergner's efforts to give his
story the deeper meaning than that is superfluous. Angola and the
inmates who spend their lives there are meaningful enough. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; JOURNEY TO BELOVED &QL; 
 &UR; Oprah Winfrey (Hyperion, $40)
</P>
<P>
   The star and chief financier doesn't usually write the movie
tie-in, so this has more than the usual clout behind it. It's a
handsome book, with somber photographs taken by Ken Regan on the
set of ``Beloved.'' The text, except for a brief essay by director
Jonathan Demme, is a first-person account by Winfrey, much of it
from a journal she kept during filming. There's no escaping the
fact that it is a self-congratulatory endeavor _ we would like to
tell you to save some money and buy a copy of Toni Morrison's novel
instead. And yet. Winfrey describes the Saturday long ago when she
read ``Beloved'' in one sitting. She was so moved that she set out
to find the author and get film rights, but she could not reach the
publisher on a weekend and she had no luck when she tried to get
Morrison's number through other people. Finally, she looked in her
copy of ``Beloved'' and found mention of the town where Morrison
lived, then called the fire department there and asked them to
contact Morrison with her intentions. Later, when it was time to
talk money, Winfrey told her attorney to give Morrison whatever she
wanted. The day she signed the check, she says ``was one of the
happiest days of my life.'' This is not just about a movie but
about a novel's hold on one of the most powerful women in the
world. That's not a bad story in itself. All good books should be
so lucky as to have Oprah Winfrey read them on a Saturday
afternoon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BIG LEAGUE, BIG TIME &QL; 
 &UR; Len Sherman (Pocket, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Here is the story of Bank One Ballpark and the Arizona
Diamondbacks, set against the larger issue of Big Bucks in
Baseball. Don't be put off by Sherman's early sentences, which
invoke the stars, the planets, the universe and the Big Bang, not
to mention those jazzy clouds over Arizona (``long, elegant, pastel
swirls inside swirls, wispy puffs of pure white cotton candy;
flat-bottomed, multicolored mushrooms rising into the
stratosphere''). The author quickly settles down into a more
straightforward account of how big league baseball came to the
desert via ``the most powerful man in Arizona,'' Jerry Colangelo,
with help from fawning government officials and overzealous media.
If you followed the story as it was happening, you won't find
surprises here.  &QL;

CLANCY NOT HIS COLORFUL SELF IN `RAINBOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
RAINBOW SIX 
Tom Clancy (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $27.95) 
 
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madmen want to destroy the world, and it's up to an elite team
of supertroopers to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the plot to some half-baked TV movie of the week,
and that's the sad part. It's actually the very boiled-down plot of
Tom Clancy's latest 740-page effort, ``Rainbow Six.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, summing up any 700-plus-page work in one sentence
will result in some gross oversimplifications. The longer version
of the plot summary is that ex-CIA agent John Clark, a character
familiar to Clancy fans from previous novels (particularly
``Without Remorse'') is named to head up an international task
force, called Rainbow, created to fight terrorism. Clark has the
highest, or ``six,'' position, hence ``Rainbow Six.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is called into action three times _ in Switzerland,
Germany and Spain _ all in close succession, prompting concern
among the protagonists. Meanwhile, an American billionaire has his
biotech company develop a strain of the Ebola virus that's
untreatable by any means of conventional medicine. The company has
the only vaccine, too.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the billionaire and his legion of faithful
followers are zealous environmentalists who are preparing the virus
for its unleashing at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Their
plan is to kill 99 percent of the human population, which, give or
take a few 10 million, is how many people are hostile or
indifferent toward the environment.
</P>
<P>
   After the humans are gone, nature will take over, allowing
Mother Earth to heal herself. The billionaire and his legion of
faithful followers will repopulate the world, teaching the children
to care about the planet. And it'll all happen, too, unless an
elite team of supertroopers can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   See, Clancy novels never used to elicit such sarcasm. Since his
first novel, ``The Hunt for Red October'' (decorated Russian Navy
officer defects using prototype Soviet submarine), Clancy has posed
original, yet seemingly plausible, questions. What if a warhead
from a downed fighter plane got into terrorists' hands (``The Sum
of All Fears'')? Or if the United States and Japan again went to
war (``Debt of Honor'')?
</P>
<P>
   But after picking on the Soviets, the IRA, the Japanese and the
Iranians, Clancy seems to be running out of enemies in his
fictional world. Not only is his latest question _ what if biotech
engineers used a virus to commit mass genocide? _ unoriginal by
technothriller standards, it's unoriginal by Clancy standards.
</P>
<P>
   In his last novel, ``Executive Orders,'' Iran tried to unleash a
milder form of ``Rainbow Six's'' Ebola virus on the United States.
And, if you want to get picky, terrorists in ``The Sum of All
Fears'' attempted to use another globally seen sporting event, the
Super Bowl, to make its statement, like the bad guys in ``Rainbow''
use the Olympics to make theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the trademark of all Clancy novels, detail, takes a hit.
The billionaire builds a gigantic complex, complete with airstrip,
on 20-plus acres in the middle of Kansas for the selected survivors
to live in, and no one, including the press, notices.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the environmentalists move in, they repeatedly use
Hummers to go from the building to the horse stables. If they care
so much about the environment, why do they needlessly pollute the
air with a Hummer, when a bicycle seemingly would suffice?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Clancy does keep us informed of the latest
gadgetry _ such as a device that tracks people by the
electromagnetic field generated by a human heart, and a
cell-phone-jamming contraption that foils the plans of one team of
terrorists. But then, who needs gadgets when Clancy's cardboard
characters are the kind who never miss and always get their men?
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other authors, Clancy's name alone will sell books.
But where previous efforts used a spectacular climax to reward the
reader for enduring the dictionary-size heft, this one merely
fizzles out.  &QL;

JIM HARRISON CATERS TO FANS' APPETITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
THE ROAD HOME 
Jim Harrison (Atlantic Monthly Press, $25) 
 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is easy to forget that in the main we die only seven times
more slowly than our dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather curious outlook on life, but one that suits John
Northridge II in ``The Road Home,'' the latest novel by Jim
Harrison and his first full-length novel since ``Dalva'' 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   To his family and the people who know him, Northridge is
something of a monster, or at least half-crazed. But his journals,
through which we get to know him, reveal someone else _ a
semi-serious art student, a man with a healthy attitude toward
money and the spending thereof (even if he has rather questionable
methods of making it) and a hearty eater with a voracious appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you knew he'd have that last. This is a Jim Harrison
book, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, author of ``Legends of the Fall'' and ``Julip,'' among
many other things, manages to work a good deal of food into
everything he writes. (His late, lamented food column, ``The Raw
and Cooked'' in ``Esquire,'' was a special treat. The man had gout,
for goodness sake. Who besides Henry VIII gets that?)
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's journals make up just a part of the book, which
takes us from the early part of this century on through the late
'80s. We also hear from Nelse, his great-grandson given up for
adoption; Naomi, Northridge's daughter-in-law; Paul, his son; and
Dalva, Northridge's granddaughter and Nelse's mother (as well as
the subject of Harrison's previous novel).
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's sheer force of larger-than-life personality has
rubbed off on all of them in varying degrees, so that all are at
least in part that particular type of character found only in good
books and bad movies: the learned rogue. All are equally at home
cleaning a fish or quoting Aristophanes.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing Harrison's love of food, perhaps it's useful to look
at the novel as a five-course meal. No appetizers here _ the novel
kicks off with Northridge's journals, which are far too meaty to be
considered anything other than the main course.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is a half-Sioux with an abiding respect for native
cultures. His good horse sense and strong arm-twisting have brought
him money and land. Yet he believes he has the soul of an artist
and indeed studied art for a time. He married the sister of his
true love; he fathered two sons, one killed in the Korean War; he
conducted affairs both business and sexual seemingly all over
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   However, although compelling _ ``. . . there is nothing quite so
destructive as an artist acquiring common sense before he has
utterly blown up the world of his perceptions and acquired the
grace to put it back together again,'' he writes _ Northridge's
journals are almost too rich and gamy, like a too-large serving of
veal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelse, Northridge's great-grandson given up for adoption, is a
wanderer of the first order. For years, he has traveled the
country, studying nature by living in it and, naturally, keeping
journals. He has determined to reunite with his natural mother,
Dalva, and does so. Hard-headed, hot-headed and claustrophobic (one
reason he sleeps outside so much), his section is like a spicy
enchilada _ tasty, but a little goes a long way, and it can bother
you hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the most normal of the lot, owing to her not being
blood kin of Northridge, is Naomi. Her story is like a good dose of
cilantro _ it's clean and unobtrusive, and just the ingredient to
freshen things a bit. A teacher nearing retirement, she has at
least as much love for nature as her grandson Nelse, but lives in
the real world, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't keep her from sharing a bed on occasion with Paul,
her late husband's brother. How to describe his contribution to the
tale? A bland wine, perhaps? Paul is a geologist and a bit of a
traveling man himself, although not to Nelse's extent.
</P>
<P>
   To call Dalva's narrative dessert captures its delight but not
its weight. Great changes have taken place for her, not the least
of which are meeting the son she had never known and getting laid
off from her job as a social worker; more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Here Harrison's writing is at its best. ``We certainly don't
know how old we are unless we remind ourselves,'' Dalva thinks.
``For a half hour or so I was five, lacking only my bright red
boots, and little Ruth tagging along beside me, squealing `hundred'
for how many times she wanted to be pushed in the tire swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tale encompasses the ambitious scope of the entire book _
gain, loss, life, death, the burdensome but beautiful weight of
family. And to a large degree she is what makes the meal ultimately
so delicious. &QL;

planet. He is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and
brimming with stories of the old days. Like O'Malley, many of those

JOHNSON NAMED VICE PRESIDENT FOR CIRCULATION AT SAN FRANCISCO
AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stephen C. Johnson has been named vice president
of circulation for the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which
oversees advertising, circulation and printing for the San
Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson comes to the agency from Pittsburgh, where he was
president and chief executive of Thomson Newspapers' strategic
marketing group in Pennsylvania and Ohio, an area that includes six
daily and four weekly newspapers owned by Thomson. He was
previously corporate vice president of circulation for Thomson's
143 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was born and grew up in the San Francisco area, and
began his newspaper career as a truck driver for the Oakland
Tribune. After military service, he returned to the Tribune and was
named to positions with increasingly greater management
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   His role in launching the Tribune's Eastbay Today led to his
being promoted to senior distribution executive for the Gannett
Satellite Information Network to complete planning the launch of
USA Today, which began publishing in 1982. He then spent six years
in various positions for Gannett Co. Inc. before returning to
California to work for the San Bernardino Sun and then the Los
Angeles Times, where he was circulation manager for six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has been active in the newspaper industry and
with university journalism and marketing programs. He and his wife,
Robin, have two teen-agers, son Eric and daughter Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's appointment was announced by Steven B. Falk, president
and chief executive of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson succeeds Stephen T. Hearst, who was recently named vice
president and general manager of the Hearst Corp.'s Sunical Land &AMP;
Livestock division and its San Francisco Realties division.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. owns the Examiner and 11 other daily
newspapers.

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit, some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch. The
local record store, which may have been down the street from a
segregated hotel, had yet to stock a Beatles album.
 &HT;    Had the astronaut possessed a more powerful periscope than he
did, he still could not have picked out a St. Louis arch or a World
Trade Center to serve as a guidepost below. Not even Telstar, the
early communications satellite, was in the heavens to block his
path. The capsule's progress through the skies was relayed by
teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride. When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there
was actual ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 &HT;    Today Glenn's return to space carries enormous public-relations
value to NASA _ this is the biggest manned-space story in years.
Nonetheless, Glenn sticks resolutely to medical-research terms in
discussing his mission's origin and meaning. And his wife Annie,
who will be watching him lift off, says that ``he's always wanted
to go'' back into space.
 &HT;    Yet after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his interest and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    Only when you walk behind Glenn, or fix your gaze on his right
eye, slightly more hooded than the left, can you credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70. It's a good thing he is too
_ or he might not have got his assignment.
 &HT;    Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in 1997 at
age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of Glenn's
going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the space
program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went into
politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition. ``If World War II hadn't come along,''
Annie Glenn says, ``he was either going to be a medical doctor or
go into medical research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way,
comes his chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings. Some 1960s rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case. During most of the original astronauts' missions, the
center was still under construction for space personnel being
transferred from Langley Research Center in Virginia.
 &HT;    These days, the new astronauts among whom Glenn spends time are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says. ``They're better educated and they're deeper into
science.''
 &HT;    They're also more diverse than the brush-cut, all-Protestant
test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along with Pedro
Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the STS-95
crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years ago
became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out among the Original Seven astronauts _
famously raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men
thought they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is
doing his best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's
``John,'' not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago. Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that he
will wear. He knows that 10 days of weightlessness, some of it
free-floating, may induce not only a loss of muscle and bone but
also nausea _ certainly more of it than he ever had the chance to
experience during five hours strapped into the seat of Friendship
7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return adds only to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral have for months been booked
solid for Oct. 29. And whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's
flight will also begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the
movement of civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger: the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    When the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the science and
public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the shuttle's rocket
boosters. This is especially so for the minority of Americans old
enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those oldest citizens
whose physical needs are the official justification for Glenn's
place on the flight.
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''

 &HT;    They're also more diverse than the brush-cut, all-Protestant
test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along with Pedro
Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the STS-95
crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years ago
became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out among the Original Seven astronauts _
famously raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men
thought they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is
doing his best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's
``John,'' not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago. Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that he
will wear. He knows that 10 days of weightlessness, some of it
free-floating, may induce not only a loss of muscle and bone but
also nausea _ certainly more of it than he ever had the chance to
experience during five hours strapped into the seat of Friendship
7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return adds only to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral have for months been booked
solid for Oct. 29. And whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's
flight will also begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the
movement of civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger: the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    When the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the science and
public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the shuttle's rocket
boosters. This is especially so for the minority of Americans old
enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those oldest citizens
whose physical needs are the official justification for Glenn's
place on the flight.
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''

 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as
We Know It. The Internet's very own survival movement was born.
 &HT;    Scott Olmsted, a 20-year programming veteran, who lives in San
Diego, has known about the Y2K bug since the 1980s, but he never
gave it much thought until early 1997, when he received a
snail-mail flyer from Gary North, a historian and early leader in
the Y2K preparedness movement. After reading it, Olmsted remembers
feeling a vague sense of dread.
 &HT;    But as a rational guy and student of decision analysis _ the
science of logical decision making in the face of chronic
uncertainty _ he didn't jump to any conclusions. Instead, he went
online to do some research.
 &HT;    As he pored over Web sites and news clippings, Olmsted felt
himself moving through the same psychological stages endured by
people confronted with fatal illness: denial, fading into anger,
leading to a deep depression that culminates in a sense of
acceptance.
 &HT;    ``I'm still not 100 percent sure that the world's coming to an
end,'' he admits. ``But the idea that I may want to get out of town
for a while is not such a long shot. It's enough to make me want to
prepare.''
 &HT;    Olmsted has decided that the only real fix for the Y2K problem
may be to pack up and move to a patch of land 75 miles from his San
Diego home.
 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    For the few of us into computers at Horace Mann in 1982, the
computer room on the third floor of Tillinghast Hall was the
greatest place at school. With its lead-paned windows overlooking
the football field, its polished floor and rows of terminals in
tidy rows, the computer room existed as our private library and
club room.
 &HT;    During free periods, when other kids might go outside to play
touch football or gossip in the cafeteria, I could be found
upstairs at a terminal, playing games and programming with my
friends. There, amid the silence, interrupted by the clicking of
keys and the soft tapping of chalk on the blackboard, we competed
fiercely to be the best programmers. It was a place where things
happened quietly, but explosively.
 &HT;    Pranks were a natural part of the room. I'd written programs
that fooled seventh-graders into thinking our shared computer, a
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11, was conscious. Others had
found ways to fool skilled programmers into thinking the computer
could no longer add properly (2 + 2   5!).
 &HT;    Creativity ran rampant. The walls were covered with elegant
``ASCII art'' _ pictures of Snoopy and the New York skyline we'd
made from collections of letters that from a distance assembled
themselves into an image. A few had mastered the eight-pen color
plotter, learning to produce marvelous geometric shapes, swirling
vortices and rippling landscapes.
 &HT;    The computer room was also a safe haven, a family of sorts. We
were mostly boys _ though a few girls spent time there _ and many
of us came from families with divorced parents.
 &HT;    I faced turmoil at home, living between my mom and dad,
separated from my sister. Another boy, Misha, faced such acrimony
at home as his parents underwent a particularly bitter breakup that
he threw himself into programming with relentless intensity,
eventually creating an after-school business writing programs for
Wall Street corporations and earning enough money to pay for
college himself.
 &HT;    In the computer room, all the worries of the real world faded
away, replaced by the exhilaration of the quest, a gleeful sense of
discovery and the joy of being best at something.
 &HT;    I was exposed to a remarkable computer curriculum, and nearly
everything I know about computers and technology comes from those
years on the third floor of Tillinghast. My friends and I were
among the first at our Bronx, N.Y., school, and in America, to have
computers at home. At 13 I owned an Atari 800 with 48K of RAM;
another pal, Jeremy Bozza, had an Apple II; Misha had a TRS-80;
others had Commodore 64s and VIC-20s.
 &HT;    It was a unique time, the Golden Age for computer and kid. The
machine was available to us unconcealed, stripped to its component
parts, at the same time when most adults barely understood what we
were doing. The evolution of the machine briefly matched the
evolution of our adolescent selves, becoming a vessel and partner,
a co-conspirator in our coming of age.
 &HT;    One of the rare adults who did understand computers was our
teacher, Mr. Moran. He was a big man with a red beard, red hair and
heavy forearms like a lumberjack's. His eyes were luminous
gray-blue, and he always wore silver glasses, which softened his
appearance, giving him an intelligent presence, as if he noticed
everything. He existed in my mind as a descendant of Vikings, a
benevolent warrior, at the helm of our ship, guiding the room
through waters of knowledge.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran left Horace Mann in 1988. Today he doesn't teach kids;
he teaches adults through the Global Knowledge Network, an outfit
that provides continuing education to corporate employees. For Mr.
Moran (his first name is Ed, but I still find it impossible to call
him anything but Mr. Moran), who has taught for 23 years, computer
education has shifted from learning how to program to a form of
digital bricolage where prewritten subroutines are linked together
to form programs.
 &HT;    Computers are now infinitely more powerful than they were when I
mastered them. They're also far more opaque. For a kid now, getting
beneath Windows 98 or Mac OS 8.0 is nearly impossible. Our priority
has shifted to teaching people how to be Power Users: dexterous at
using software, rather than creating it.
 &HT;    But using computers ``out of the box'' is a lot easier than it
used to be. Clicking on an icon requires less study than going into
a Basic programming environment. These ``friendlier'' systems have
broadened access and turned what was mostly a hobbyist subculture
into a part of mass culture.
 &HT;    What is lost is the idea that kids can ever learn to understand
computers, or that any of us, as computer users, can have
fundamental control over what they do. We're supposed to know how
to use the tools, not make the tools.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran taught us to make things, using the elements of
computing as our tools. The notion that we would become merely
educated consumers would have seemed ludicrous and unworthy as a
goal. I grew up feeling I really understood computers.
 &HT;    Back in the early 1980s, when computer education was in its
infancy, student-crafted software was essential to the curriculum.
Schools nationwide hadn't begun to invest in computer courses, and
few companies provided software environments for teaching below the
university level.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran, through organic evolution, trial and error, created
an open system, both in the way the computer functioned and in the
social fabric of the computer room. The machine and the kids
existed in symbiosis, each a part of the other.
 &HT;    Without the student system administrators writing programs,
updating software, managing the younger students, answering their
questions, Mr. Moran would have been incapable of being teacher,
guide, administrator and sometimes policeman. More important,
centralized control by one teacher was antithetical to the ethic of
exploration and gleeful discovery fostered by access to computers.
Mr. Moran recognized this and promoted a communal ownership of the
computer system.
 &HT;    This whole philosophy reflected the belief that for kids to be
well-educated, responsible citizens in the digital age, knowing how
computers worked would not be enough. Their education would be
incomplete without a genuine understanding of the moral and ethical
questions brought up by information technology. Who owns software?
Where does someone's electronic property or territory begin and
end? At what point do shared systems become public?
 &HT;    I couldn't have expressed these convictions outright back then.
They were ingrained in us as we went. As was a certain pride _
encouraged by Mr. Moran without any fanfare _ in what we were
accomplishing. We were not covering well-worn paths in our
learning. We were striking out, sometimes wildly, into a
little-known territory.
 &HT;    While I don't program anymore (the last time I programmed was in
1993, when I wrote databases for a management consulting company),
the experiences I had at home with my Atari and in the computer
room with Mr. Moran and my classmates have given me a perspective
that, no matter how opaque and turbocharged computers become, lets
me use them without feeling bewildered and dominated.
 &HT;    When I entered the computer room, as a student, I felt the
future was hidden there, waiting to be discovered. Today there are
moments between people in that room that stick in my mind as
permanent testaments to the kind of learning we experienced.

 THE STORY OF `FURBY,' the MOODY FURBALL

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over archrival Mattel. In three days
he planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in
his 25 years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week, Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the big toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, astonishingly
late by industry norms.
 &HT;    Hasbro execs understood how to manufacture and market action
figures like G.I. Joe, but when it came to technology, they were
clueless. Early in the 1990s, Hasbro funneled a reported $45
million into a virtual-reality project before abandoning it. In the
1980s, the videogame business bankrupted Coleco, the maker of
Cabbage Patch Kids and ColecoVision, and nearly brought Mattel to
its knees.
 &HT;    But the recent success of toys containing microprocessors, from
Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has buttressed the belief
that technology will be the industry's savior. While earlier
generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive to a
child, the newer ones insinuate themselves into their owner's life
in sometimes alarming ways.
 &HT;    Some schools banned virtual pets because children were more
focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying attention to the
teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids began to mourn
digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like Furby, which
exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate themselves
even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a secret language,
playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    The technology is increasingly invisible. No instruction manual
is necessary and children can have what they most desire: the
perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    The industry is betting that this technological-psychological
alchemy will yield some hits. Without them, the industry slumps.
When Toys ``R'' Us announced earlier this year that its
first-quarter earnings had dropped 35 percent, it blamed the plunge
in part on the absence of a hit toy to bring in shoppers.
 &HT;    What makes this dependence on hits and fourth-quarter sales even
scarier is that hits can come from any corner of the industry.
 &HT;    Witness the Beanie Babies craze, which was perpetrated by Ty
Inc., a little-known, privately held Illinois company. The giants
of the industry _ Mattel and Hasbro _ have been scooping up the
adventurous, independent toy companies in the hope that
consolidation will increase their odds of bringing a few hits to
market every year.
 &HT;    Such was Hasbro's thinking when it acquired Tiger Electronics.
Based in a nondescript one-story office park north of Chicago,
Tiger, according to its new parent's first-quarter report, would
help provide Hasbro with ``a platform for future earnings growth.''
 &HT;    Founded in 1978 by Rissman and Roger Shiffman, the company
originally made low-tech items such as Mickey Mouse phonographs,
but it eventually began to branch out into handheld electronic
games and learning aids. The company's first breakout hit, tied to
the release of ``Home Alone,'' was the Talkboy, a voice digitizer
used onscreen by Macaulay Culkin.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him.
 &HT;    The company seemed concerned that if the inventor, whom I'll
call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may increase the fees he
demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    An earlier version of Furby was manually controlled with dials
and came to life like a puppet. This Furby uttered not a chirp from
its yellow beak. But, according to Eric, the finished Furby would
be able to play games, communicate with other Furbies via infrared
signals, learn English by means of positive reinforcement and teach
a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue). No two Furbies would
share the same personality or react to stimuli in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    Shiffman wanted to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in '99
or 2000, the way other companies traditionally would. Its category
_ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz lingo _ had already shown
its potential, having grown 223 percent in 1997 over the year
before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category looked like the hot one.
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy companies
to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can heavily
discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, begin to formulate opinions about which toys will be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    Furby was a winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart committed, on the
spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire production run. Everyone
wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated success. By now, so sure is
Tiger of Furby that at one point, it planned to require retailers
to order other, less-hot toys from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    Since the toy fair, Furby's ears have gotten smaller, to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, is ironing out the Furby Communication
Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies will talk to each other
through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and Sims are also trying to fabricate Furby's history _
what they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby
needs a context to explain where the creature came from, likely to
be explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger aims to mark the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. Closer to Thanksgiving, a contest on the Cartoon Network
will give children who learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy this Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over archrival Mattel. In three days
he planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in
his 25 years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week, Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the big toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, astonishingly
late by industry norms.
 &HT;    Hasbro execs understood how to manufacture and market action
figures like G.I. Joe, but when it came to technology, they were
clueless. Early in the 1990s, Hasbro funneled a reported $45
million into a virtual-reality project before abandoning it. In the
1980s, the videogame business bankrupted Coleco, the maker of
Cabbage Patch Kids and ColecoVision, and nearly brought Mattel to
its knees.
 &HT;    But the recent success of toys containing microprocessors, from
Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has buttressed the belief
that technology will be the industry's savior. While earlier
generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive to a
child, the newer ones insinuate themselves into their owner's life
in sometimes alarming ways.
 &HT;    Some schools banned virtual pets because children were more
focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying attention to the
teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids began to mourn
digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like Furby, which
exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate themselves
even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a secret language,
playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    The technology is increasingly invisible. No instruction manual
is necessary and children can have what they most desire: the
perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    The industry is betting that this technological-psychological
alchemy will yield some hits. Without them, the industry slumps.
When Toys ``R'' Us announced earlier this year that its
first-quarter earnings had dropped 35 percent, it blamed the plunge
in part on the absence of a hit toy to bring in shoppers.
 &HT;    What makes this dependence on hits and fourth-quarter sales even
scarier is that hits can come from any corner of the industry.
 &HT;    Witness the Beanie Babies craze, which was perpetrated by Ty
Inc., a little-known, privately held Illinois company. The giants
of the industry _ Mattel and Hasbro _ have been scooping up the
adventurous, independent toy companies in the hope that
consolidation will increase their odds of bringing a few hits to
market every year.
 &HT;    Such was Hasbro's thinking when it acquired Tiger Electronics.
Based in a nondescript one-story office park north of Chicago,
Tiger, according to its new parent's first-quarter report, would
help provide Hasbro with ``a platform for future earnings growth.''
 &HT;    Founded in 1978 by Rissman and Roger Shiffman, the company
originally made low-tech items such as Mickey Mouse phonographs,
but it eventually began to branch out into handheld electronic
games and learning aids. The company's first breakout hit, tied to
the release of ``Home Alone,'' was the Talkboy, a voice digitizer
used onscreen by Macaulay Culkin.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him.
 &HT;    The company seemed concerned that if the inventor, whom I'll
call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may increase the fees he
demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    An earlier version of Furby was manually controlled with dials
and came to life like a puppet. This Furby uttered not a chirp from
its yellow beak. But, according to Eric, the finished Furby would
be able to play games, communicate with other Furbies via infrared
signals, learn English by means of positive reinforcement and teach
a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue). No two Furbies would
share the same personality or react to stimuli in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    Shiffman wanted to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in '99
or 2000, the way other companies traditionally would. Its category
_ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz lingo _ had already shown
its potential, having grown 223 percent in 1997 over the year
before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category looked like the hot one.
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy companies
to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can heavily
discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, begin to formulate opinions about which toys will be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    Furby was a winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart committed, on the
spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire production run. Everyone
wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated success. By now, so sure is
Tiger of Furby that at one point, it planned to require retailers
to order other, less-hot toys from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    Since the toy fair, Furby's ears have gotten smaller, to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, is ironing out the Furby Communication
Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies will talk to each other
through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and Sims are also trying to fabricate Furby's history _
what they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby
needs a context to explain where the creature came from, likely to
be explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger aims to mark the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. Closer to Thanksgiving, a contest on the Cartoon Network
will give children who learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy this Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

CHANGING COURSE: WITH THE COLD WAR LONG THAWED, NASA HAS FOUND A
NEW FOCUS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The embryonic NASA of John Glenn's heyday as a Mercury astronaut
in the early 1960s pushed the envelope of human spaceflight, boldly
teaching itself to pilot in a treacherous new realm and eventually
to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged space program of today has long retreated from
the lunar frontier and focused itself instead on filling the gap
between the Earth and moon with a less glamorous international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   The two very different eras converge late this month when Glenn,
now 77 and in the twilight of a lengthy U.S. Senate career, soars
once again into space for a nine-day mission aboard the space
shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn made history when he became the first
American to orbit the Earth, his only flight in five years with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. His encore will make
him by far humanity's oldest emissary in space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's solo Mercury flight established that an astronaut could
cope with a nervous system turned upside down in the absence of
gravity, retain sharpness of vision and be able to make decisions
necessary to control and fly a spacecraft into unexplored
territory.
</P>
<P>
   With his second flight, Glenn plans to again play the role of
medical subject, though not pilot, on behalf of an emerging
scientific premise that there is a medical link between the
physical stresses of space flight and those of aging.
</P>
<P>
   His latest contribution, the senator believes, may awaken an
aging national populace to the need for more research into the
ailments shared temporarily by healthy young astronauts and the
elderly. They include weakened immune and cardiovascular systems,
brittle bones, balance disorders and trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go back up,'' Glenn said in January as his
four-year, behind-the-scenes campaign in Washington to fly again
bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Cheered by the throngs who lined New York's Wall Street for a
ticker-tape parade and by a joint session of Congress after his
three orbits of the Earth, Glenn believes his hero status prevented
him from taking another mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming, a shock almost,'' Glenn said of the
outpouring that dwarfed anything that contemporary shuttle crews
receive. ``There would be people crying along the street, sobbing
and wiping their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tenuous times we were living in, the competition
with the Soviets,'' Glenn said of the early '60s-era
boisterousness. ``We look at that now and think, oh well, the
Soviets are down the tubes and that was bound to happen. But we did
not know that then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dog-eat-dog,'' Glenn recalled. ``Americans had begun to
doubt themselves as far as leadership in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   America's space program sprung to life in the aftermath of the
October 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, by
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was striding toward a decade of political
assassination, racial strife and protracted combat in Southeast
Asia. The threat of nuclear annihilation from a face-off between
the United States and the communist Soviet regime loomed profoundly
over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Soviets could launch a satellite on a rocket, they could
replace it with an atomic bomb aimed at the United States,
policy-makers reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the economy was robust as America entered the
1960s. The three-martini lunch was fashionable. Families gathered
before their televisions to watch ``Wagon Train'' and ``Bonanza,''
a pair of westerns whose themes celebrated a vibrant, young nation
settling its rugged frontier. On the dance floor, the rage was the
Twist, an aerobic oscillation in which the participants went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this invigorating chaos, the United States was also going
to the moon. Unprecedented in its risk and ambition, the expedition
was intended to reveal a national might and grace greater than its
superpower rival.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade of the '60s opened, the United States was clearly
behind in the space race. The Soviets followed their success with
Sputnik by launching the first human, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who
circled the Earth once on April 12, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   America's first space traveler, the late Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
followed Gagarin less than a month later with a more modest
suborbital lob that spanned just 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, then-President John F. Kennedy spoke to Congress,
directing the nation to place an astronaut on the moon by the end
of the decade. The goal was achieved in July 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The program was called Apollo and was structured to build on the
accomplishments of Glenn and his Mercury colleagues and those who
participated in a second program called Gemini.
</P>
<P>
   The moon quest galvanized America. Kennedy battled with
lawmakers for the privilege of increasing NASA funding, not cutting
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment was one of anticipation, expectancy and one of
doubt; one of wanting proof the United States could compete with
the Russians in space,'' said Christopher Kraft, who served as the
NASA flight director for Glenn's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tremendous days, particularly the flight of John
Glenn,'' he said. ``There was a tremendous feeling of
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (shuttle) flight of John Glenn has rekindled a spark that
was there a long time ago. He has inspired people,'' Kraft said.
``They are inspired by his intestinal fortitude. No matter how
trite that might seem, it's true.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ They have trained and rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   They have planned their order of appearance, their scripts, the
choreography, even the clothes they will wear today when they stand
before 31 NFL owners and plead for an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   No detail is too small. ``Does this suit make me look fat? Do
these shoes go with these socks? Does this tie say, `We're Houston
_ take us?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston contingent of NFL dreamers has descended upon Kansas
City for today's NFL meetings. The theme it hopes to deliver was
best described by ownership hopeful Bob McNair when the Houston
stadium-financing plan was finalized last week: Houston has steak.
Los Angeles has sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to go right now,'' said Steve Patterson, who
helped coordinate the NFL pitch and has been in the middle of
stadium-financing negotiations from the start. ``We will build the
first and so far only retractable-roof, natural-grass football
stadium in the world. It will be the greatest stadium in the world.
It will be in the heart of football country _ football-crazy
country. We've got the commitment. We've got the resources. We've
got tremendous support and infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the Houston group does not have is time. Or the LA
sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it has made up ground recently, Los Angeles is behind
Houston on virtually every front when it comes to presenting a
viable expansion package. But, oh, that sizzle. It tempts the NFL's
palate.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there is a rock-solid stadium proposal _ dotted I's
and crossed T's, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles has two proposals _ the one by former
super-agent and Walt Disney executive Michael Ovitz and the one
headed by Ed Roski, which is endorsed by the LA city council and
calls for the complete redesign of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there is public support and, more important,
governmental support. The way Mayor Lee Brown, McNair, County Judge
Robert Eckels, sports authority chief Jack Rains and Patterson came
together on the deal last week was hugely impressive. Individually,
each represented entirely different interests. One might have
believed it difficult for these five powers to agree on what to
order for lunch, much less a $310 million stadium. But they did it.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Ovitz and the Coliseum partners have divided
loyalties with their NFL pitches, which on paper are equally
impressive but also equally riddled with holes, financing
shortcomings and political flash points.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything, while Houston has voiced support for a
return of the NFL, a recent Los Angeles Times poll indicated that
nearly 60 percent of Southern Californians do not consider having a
football team important to them. Nearly 70 percent said they would
not support using public funds to build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, this looks like it should be a simple choice
for NFL owners _ Houston over Los Angeles. Steak over sizzle. But
this is Los Angeles sizzle, which cannot be underestimated. It is
flash and cash.
</P>
<P>
   It is why the Houston group will be hoping to swoop into KC
today and persuade the owners to make a quick decision regarding
expansion, giving Houston what it is ready to provide. Football.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners want it done fast, too. Concerned about scheduling
problems that the 31st team _ Cleveland _ will give the league next
year, some are pushing for a 32nd team to begin playing as early as
2000. This is great for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But other owners are listening to the sizzle and are being
swayed by the pomp, not the circumstance. They see the glamorous
stars involved in the Ovitz group _ Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner,
Jerry West and Magic Johnson _ and are wowed.
</P>
<P>
   They're thinking about the difference a Los Angeles NFL team
would have on television negotiations in 2004, compared to the
effect a Houston team might have.
</P>
<P>
   They realize Los Angeles might not be ready right now, but if it
can be ready in a couple of months _ six months, maybe even late
next year _ it could be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we want an NFL team in the second-biggest market
again, no question,'' Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said.
``There's no need to rush it.''
</P>
<P>
   For LA, there is no need at all. It is the sizzle. In fact, even
before these meetings opened, Ovitz criss-crossed the country
visiting NFL owners, showing them plans and designs for his
proposed Hacienda stadium in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz brought here those same drawings and computer-generated
images of the 78,000-seat stadium, which would be the centerpiece
of a 160-acre NFL Disneyland of sorts, with a giant mall,
entertainment center and Spanish-style stadium complete with a
church tower and bells that ring for every touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It is impressive sizzle, no doubt. All McNair, Patterson and Co.
can hope for is that when in Kansas City, the NFL owners do like KC
folk and crave steak.

UNDATED: it's true.``
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the Cold War long over, the competition that once
justified large federal expenditures on space is absent. As
inheritor of the old Soviet space program, Russia has worked with
the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada for the the
construction of a new orbiting laboratory that would specialize in
the kinds of medical studies and other kinds of research that Glenn
now champions.
</P>
<P>
   While NASA's feisty administrator, Dan Goldin, urges his
employees to think, ``faster, better, cheaper,'' first the White
House, then Congress cuts the agency's annual spending. In
response, NASA labors to keep its pledge of a new station afloat as
its financially strapped Russian partners struggle to meet crucial
commitments to its success.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet and then Russian influence that winds through four
decades of U.S. space objectives frustrates many of NASA's
strongest supporters, who think the agency has become too much an
arm of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s, we were storming heaven. We had a space program
that was going someplace,'' said Robert Zubrin, a 46-year-old
Colorado-based engineer, author and space activist.  &UR;  &LR; His
fourth-grade class watched on television 37 years ago as Kennedy
announced plans for a human expedition to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   He and his schoolmates tuned in again as Glenn lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to be on the moon by 1970. We were going to be
on Mars by 1980. We would be on our way to the stars by the turn of
the century,'' Zubrin recalls. ``It was an incredible invitation to
adventure to every kid in the country. Learn your science and you
could become part of pioneering many new worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly bought into that, and I think millions of young
people of my generation did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building a space station is not bold enough for Zubrin, whose
passion is Mars.
</P>
<P>
   His 1996 book, ``The Case for Mars'' lays out a rationale for a
10-year effort to reach the Red Planet with American explorers and
then colonize it. Zubrin proposes a low-cost effort that would
exploit the resources available on Mars to produce life support,
food and rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The book also includes a political strategy for obtaining a
presidential commitment after the turn of the century. Unless
America, either on its own or with the most capable international
partners, begins to colonize space, its past accomplishments are
likely to become no more than historical footnotes, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin is among a dozen serious contestants for the X-Prize, a
$10 million offering to the first privately financed team to launch
humans into space with a reusable rocket. As a small aerospace
contractor to NASA, he is developing equipment for future unmanned
Mars probes that could demonstrate a capability to produce rocket
fuel from the planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe, however, that it takes more than the inspiration
that surrounded Kennedy's call to the moon during the early 1960s
to sustain human space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War nearly a decade ago unalterably changed
the equation for its justification, contends Alex Roland, who
chairs Duke University's History Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apollo program worked magnificently as Cold War
propaganda,'' said Roland, who worked as a NASA historian during
the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole space program, and the reason for putting astronauts
in space at all, was part of the Cold War struggle. A lot was
riding on it,'' Roland recalled. ``If (the Soviets) really could do
things in this exciting realm sooner and better than we could, the
suggestion was that the Red Star might be rising.''
</P>
<P>
   With its victory, America may have lost the principal
justification for further investment in human space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is now all by itself in pioneering this
field. That adds weight to the question of what is the urgency?''
said Roland. ``Does it make any difference whether we have a space
station now or 30 years from now, whether we sent people to Mars
now or 50 years from now or 100 years from now?
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot make a compelling case why we have to spend this
money now,'' he said. ``Your budget gets eroded and that
fundamentally is what has happened to NASA.'' &QL;

JOHN GLENN: A HERO RETURNS TO SPACE 
 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grand Central Station stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, in living rooms around the globe, were glued to
radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   And outside John Glenn's childhood home in New Concord, Ohio,
concerned friends and neighbors and hundreds of anxious reporters
waited on shifting feet, ruining Clara Glenn's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several minutes of nothing,'' remembers Lloyd
White, Glenn's best buddy since third grade and best man at his
wedding. ``The whole town was out there and we didn't know if he
was burnin' up or what.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, Alan Shepard forced a calm tone, repeatedly
calling his fellow astronaut: ``Friendship 7, this is Mercury
Control. How do you read? Over.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a communications blackout of four minutes, 20
seconds, during which the world prayed that the capsule's heat
shield had held, a familiar, enthusiastic voice pierced the static:
``Loud and clear. How me?''
</P>
<P>
   The control center sighed in relief; the crowd in Ohio erupted
in cheers. The first American in space asked the first American to
orbit the Earth: ``How are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, pretty good,'' replied the grand master of understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day _ Feb. 20, 1962 _ America has never been the
same. And John Glenn, the first of us to snap a picture of the
Earth from space, the first to witness four sunsets in one day, and
the last, some have said, of the great American heroes, has barely
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it showed on him at all,'' says Rex Hoon, who
has known Glenn since he was making model airplanes in grade
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been one to overestimate his importance,'' agrees
Harold Kaser, who went to church with Glenn as a boy and played
football with him in college. ``He's just a good, ordinary
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like the people who know John Glenn, the fighter pilot,
the astronaut, the millionaire, the politician and, now, the
astronaut again, as a nice, smart kid from a sensible Presbyterian
family whom everyone in town called ``Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of America, John Herschel Glenn Jr. is anything but
ordinary. And as the 77-year-old retiring senator prepares for his
long-awaited second space voyage &UR;  &LR; this week, his hero status
appears as solid as it was four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a time when NASA launches the space shuttle six or seven
times a year, when construction is about to begin on an
international space station, and when millions have seen images of
the Martian surface beamed home by the robot Sojourner, the average
person on the street would be hard-pressed to name a single current
astronaut or more than a couple of the 12 men who have walked on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they continue to embrace Glenn, who spent only five years
with NASA and logged less than five hours in space. His ticker-tape
parade down Wall Street still holds the record for the most paper
flung from New York City skyscrapers. His space capsule sits in the
Smithsonian beside the Wright Brothers' plane and Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. His fan mail has barely let up,
and he can't walk from point A to point B without someone
requesting an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn's launch approaches, authorities in Florida are bracing
for an onslaught of beach campers around Cape Canaveral. Motels and
trailer parks near Kennedy Space Center have been booked since last
spring, &UR;  &LR; and Mattel is introducing John Glenn action figures (one
dressed as a senator, one as an astronaut) and a toy Friendship 7
capsule. And while Glenn implores his fellow crew members to call
him ``just John'' and insists his only mission aboard Discovery
will be scientific research on aging, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
has declared Glenn his personal hero. He concedes he's counting on
the aging senator to remind Americans ``that this is a nation where
we take on bold tasks and are not afraid of risk, that this is a
place where dreams come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Glenn took his position atop the Atlas rocket in his
tiny spacecraft 36 years ago, he was considered a hero by many who
saw him as the ideal American: a polite, straight-laced kid from
rural Ohio who honored his schoolteacher mother and his plumber
father.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps veteran of World War II and Korea had flown 149
combat missions and, in the last nine days of fighting, shot down
three Russian MiGs along the Yalu River, earning numerous medals.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he continued to risk his life as a test pilot and
in July 1957, he made the first transcontinental flight to average
supersonic speed, flying from Los Angeles to New York in three
hours, 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His selection in 1959 as one of the seven Mercury astronauts
would by itself have secured him a healthy reference in American
history books.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could have predicted what Goldin now calls one of
America's ``defining moments.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Glenn climbed out of his capsule that day and watched
a crewman paint the outline of his space boots on the deck of the
rescue ship Noa, it was clear he was stepping into a new world.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the enormity of what Glenn had accomplished was
incomprehensible to those still in awe of Lucky Lindy's 1927 solo
nonstop flight across the Atlantic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's friend Kaser remembers that in the days following the
orbital flight he couldn't stop thinking about his parents' horse
and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me longer to go to town and back as a kid than it took
John to circle the Earth three times,'' he says. ``That's how far
we had come in such a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Russians had beaten Glenn into orbit. To
Americans, that could not have been more beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the United States had a fighting chance of
catching up in the Space Race and fulfilling President Kennedy's
pledge of being first to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   And Glenn, that smiling, redheaded, freckle-faced, all-American
boy next door, became the ultimate symbol of what a free country
could do if it tried hard enough. The dream doors were flung wide
open as Glenn encouraged children to do their homework and inspired
future space voyagers and scientists to explore the great unknown,
seek out beings from other worlds, colonize Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a hero, you have to have a cause and stand up for it,''
says Kaser. ``You have to have certain principles to defend and
promote. You have to have an interest in what's good, not just for
yourself, but for other people. You give of yourself relentlessly
and wholeheartedly. You know yourself and you know what you stand
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is all of those things and more,'' he says. ``Some people
have even said John is the last true American hero. I do not agree.
I think there will be others _ I hope there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that hope, in an age when countless sports figures, movie
stars and rock singers soar to hero status one minute only to be
toppled the next, is what prompts Americans to cling to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra says heroes may have been
easier to create in the early days of the space program, when
American society was more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did dumb things, like getting traffic tickets, or racing
down the Gulf Freeway in Corvettes,'' Schirra recalls of his days
in Houston. ``But I think the public was more understanding than
they are today. I mean they tear people apart so fast (now) it's
unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard for a kid to pick up a hero because I'm not
sure what generates a hero these days,'' he says. ``There are
heroic things done by firemen, policemen, lifesavers _ all kinds of
events like that. But they're dropped within hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason John Glenn the hero has survived so long _
weathering the relatively minor storms of the Keating Five scandal
and a disastrous run for the presidency that left him holding a
multimillion-dollar campaign debt _ is that Americans continue to
view him as an ordinary guy who did his best and accomplished
extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   History books cite his achievements in space and in politics,
but his friends point to his devotion to his wife and children, and
to the fact that he's never forgotten where he came from. Glenn
says he keeps his dad's plumbing wrench on his Senate office desk
to remind him of his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He and Annie frequently fly home to New Concord to see how the
high school football team is doing, to shake hands with
fourth-graders promoted to middle school and to join friends for
hot fudge sundaes at their favorite ice cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he has contributed an enormous amount to his country,
and that will be the thing that stands out,'' says Sam Speck,
president of Muskingum College, the Glenns' alma mater in New
Concord where they now serve on the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more than that, he took the best values from a rural
community, the idea of telling it like it is, of treating people
decently no matter who they are, of working hard, of loving your
fellow man and loving your country, of helping those less
fortunate,'' he says. ``He'll be remembered for living a life of
simple virtue in a time when simple virtue is often hard to come
by.''
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn himself is posed the hero question, he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm the same person who grew up in New Concord,'' he
says. ``I don't wake up every morning thinking, `I gotta be a hero
today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't me,'' he adds. ``It would have been the same if it
had been ... anyone on that particular flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps he explained the John Glenn phenomenon years ago. In
``My Own Story of the Orbit,'' published by Life magazine in the
spring of 1962, the 40-year-old astronaut reflected on the
overwhelming throngs greeting him upon his return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked at all those faces and waved and smiled, when I
really felt much more,'' he wrote. ``Here they were, identifying
with me, and I was identifying with them _ right back.'' &QL;

UNDATED: joining up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days later, Glenn, who already had his private pilot's
license, enlisted in military flight training and was sent to
Corpus Christi, Texas. As soon as he earned his wings and was
commissioned into the Marines, he took a train home and married
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all dressed up in his Marine uniform,'' recalls White,
who served as Glenn's best man in 1943. ``He looked at me and said,
`What do you think of this ol' clown suit?' I can still see him
standing there with a great big grin on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   He flew 59 missions in the South Pacific during World War II and
requested combat duty again during the Korean conflict. By then,
the Glenns had two children, Dave and Lyn, whose names were painted
on his F-86 Sabrejet along with Annie's. He flew 63 missions with
the Marines and another 27 as an exchange pilot with the Air Force.
He received the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and was
awarded the Air Medal with 18 clusters.
</P>
<P>
   After combat duty, he moved his family to the Washington, D.C.,
area so he could become a test pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1957, he flew from Los Angeles to New York in three
hours, 23 minutes _ the first transcontinental flight to average
supersonic speed. During the flight, he laid a supersonic boom over
his hometown, prompting phone calls to his parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny must have dropped a bomb,'' a neighbor lady told his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, Glenn was picked off a New York street
by a TV recruiter to appear on CBS-TV's ``Name That Tune'' paired
with a 10-year-old fellow redhead, Eddie Hodges. They shared a
$26,000 jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess looking back, he stood out,'' White says of
Glenn's early career. ``But we never thought he'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was becoming an astronaut. Glenn was the oldest
of the Mercury team, and he was considered the front-runner in a
friendly competition among the seven astronauts to be first in
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really disappointed that he didn't get chosen,'' White
says.
</P>
<P>
   But while Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom blasted off ahead of him,
Glenn drew the mission that would make him the first American to
circle the globe. The orbital flight, Feb. 20, 1962, was the day
Americans became convinced they could catch the Russians in the
great space race.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 40-year-old Glenn was finally launched, there
had been 11 delays; he had suited up four times, spending several
hours waiting in his tiny capsule before the mission was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to get the thing going,'' Glenn recalls.
``People think somehow that you're under such great tension, that
you're suffering some way, or that you're almost looking at this as
a suicide mission or something, and it wasn't that way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One such delay, on Jan. 27, 1962, has become as much a part of
NASA lore as Shepard's hitting a golf ball on the surface of the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The story, made famous by Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff''
and the movie by the same name, begins as Glenn waits in his
capsule at Cape Canaveral and quickly flashes to the front lawn of
the Glenn home in Arlington, Va., where the media has descended,
hoping for a word from the worried wife.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn, who has struggled with a severe stutter since
childhood, is terrified at the thought of stammering on national
TV.
</P>
<P>
   After the launch is canceled, the vice president of the United
States demands to come inside the house, cameras in tow, to comfort
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   She refuses to open the door.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyndon Johnson curses, word goes back to Florida: Get John
Glenn on the line to order his wife to play ball. Instead, Glenn
picks up the phone and tells Annie she doesn't have to open the
door to anybody. ``And I will back you up all the way, 100
percent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn has since overcome her disability. Earlier this
year, as John and Annie celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary,
Glenn told reporters the secret to their happy marriage was
learning to stand by each other in hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what partnership is all about,'' he said. ``It can't
all be ticker-tape parades.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Glenn's first mission was to put a man into orbit
and see if the human body could endure weightlessness for a few
hours. The science was basic: Glenn read an eye chart periodically
to make sure the shape of his eyeballs wasn't changing, affecting
his vision. He ate a squeeze tube of applesauce and kept it down.
</P>
<P>
   After one of seven planned revolutions, the capsule began to
drift. He took over manual control from the autopilot and was
actually flying the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The test was cut off after three orbits by ground controllers
worried that an inflatable cushioning device between the capsule's
aft bulkhead and its heat shield had deployed prematurely. The
world held its breath, hoping the heat shield had remained in
place, as Glenn made a fiery descent back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   After splashing down in the Atlantic near Grand Turk Island, a
NASA psychiatrist asked Glenn to fill out a form that ended with
the question: ``Was there any unusual activity during this
period?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't resist it,'' Glenn said. ``No, I wrote, just a
normal day in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after meeting the Kennedys, riding in victory parades and
delivering a speech before a joint session of Congress, Glenn
seemed relatively unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenns returned to New Concord for a parade that drew about
75,000 revelers. As the high school band played ``When Johnny Comes
Marching Home,'' John and Annie rode through town in a convertible,
waving and calling out to all their old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my kids said, `He called you by your nickname!' and I
said, `Of course. He knows me,' '' says Harold Kaser, who went to
Glenn's church and played football with him at Muskingum. ``They
were very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was a private _ town only _ reception at
Muskingum's new gymnasium that would be named for the astronaut.
Each family on the local gas meter list got two tickets. A speaker
introduced John Glenn as ``the embodiment of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, his friends insist, John Glenn didn't change a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we changed,'' says White. ``When he was an astronaut, I
didn't really know how to handle it. I felt like he was untouchable
almost. But that was a sensation in me. He was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he became a senator,'' White adds, ``then I felt more
comfortable _ like he was a human being now, not a God.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's political career brought early disappointments. Before
his first run for the U.S. Senate got off the ground in 1964, Glenn
slipped and fell, hitting his head and causing dizziness that put
him in the hospital for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually retired from the Marines and settled in Houston,
where he worked as a NASA consultant and as an executive with Royal
Crown Cola, a job that made him a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he ran for the Senate again and was defeated in the
primary. On his third attempt four years later, however, he carried
all 88 counties in Ohio, and in 1980, was re-elected with the
largest margin in state history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Glenn made a run for the presidency that many describe
as disastrous. The candidate summed it up this way: ``I humiliated
my family, gained 16 pounds and went millions of dollars into debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``it was an exhilarating experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the campaign debt and the fallout from a scandal
in which Glenn was investigated but never charged over questionable
campaign contributions from convicted savings and loan magnate
Charles Keating, Glenn's friends have urged him to retire and come
home.
</P>
<P>
   But when Glenn does retire from politics in January, he will
have served 24 years and will leave a nearly spotless record of
leading the Senate in technical and scientific matters, of helping
prevent the spread of nuclear arms and of demanding the cleanup of
contamination at nuclear production plants.
</P>
<P>
   And he's been a dutiful ex-astronaut, says George Diller, a
spokesman for Kennedy Space Center, recalling Glenn's actions after
the Challenger explosion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Glenn got word of it, he could not get here fast
enough,'' Diller says. ``The fact that he showed up so fast showed
how much he still cared about this place. It was not lost on
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some have derided the upcoming flight as a political
payoff or a publicity stunt, many credit John Glenn for inspiring
their own careers and for his undying quest to push himself further
and farther.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn was coming up in little New Concord, Ohio, ``he
believed in a cause,'' says his friend Kaser. ``He wasn't aimless
or wandering around. He was always forward-thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's like that now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks to the future.'' &QL;

   RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. _ For those who grew up in the '60s, the
names of the first astronauts had a magical quality _ Alan Shepard,
Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Wally Schirra, Scott Carpenter, Gordon
Cooper, Deke Slayton.
</P>
<P>
   They emerged at a time when Americans still believed we could do
just about anything. The nation wanted heroes, NASA needed them to
foster enthusiasm for the space program, and the men of the Mercury
program delivered the goods.
</P>
<P>
   With Glenn stirring memories of that glorious past as he
prepares for a return trip to outer space at age 77, the views of
his three surviving Mercury cohorts range from skepticism to envy
to enthusiastic support.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra, 75, shakes his head at the whole event, and says he
can't understand why any hotshot pilot would want to be a mere
passenger _ even in space. To ``get in the back'' as he puts it,
would be a little demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I told him, `Don't do that John _ you're going to
embarrass all your fellow test pilots for having given away your
command, essentially,' '' Schirra said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn may downplay the public relations benefits of the flight,
but Schirra is convinced that is NASA's reason for allowing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary, but I really think NASA needs the
publicity,'' Schirra said. ``And it's obvious ... it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper thinks the ``science angle'' has plenty of validity.
Glenn's flight is an unusual opportunity for the medical world, he
said, because of the baseline of information scientists have
available on the Ohio senator dating back to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us, all through the space program, nobody had ever
had the amount of physical scrutiny that we all had,'' Cooper said,
adding that many astronauts still go back to NASA for annual
physicals. ``So we've got a real long record of medical history on
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Carpenter both confess to being a little envious of
Glenn. And they'd strap themselves back onto a rocket in a red-hot
minute, front seat or back, if the destination were Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Are they too old? Clearly, they aren't ready to concede it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think of myself as old now, but I sure thought it
was old age when I was in my 30s,'' says Cooper, chuckling. At 71,
his walk is a little stiffer than the ``Gordo'' who was the
youngest of the Mercury fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, 73, wouldn't mind being the second elderly astronaut
behind Glenn, just as he was the second American in orbit behind
him. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think the opportunity John has to do some meaningful
scientific work is there,'' Carpenter said. ``And I envy him the
chance to do that. If something of lasting significance comes out
of it, we may fly other geriatrics like John, and I'll be first in
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the original class have died, the most recent
being Shepard, who passed on at age 74 this year after a long
battle with leukemia. Grissom, 40, was killed in the flash fire in
January 1967 that claimed the entire crew of Apollo 1 during
training. Slayton, who never flew a Mercury mission because of a
heart condition, succumbed to a brain tumor in 1993 at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   When you walk down the stairs into Schirra's Rancho Santa Fe
den, the memories from nearly 40 years ago return in waves of
photographs lining the walls. There are the seven astronauts being
introduced to the nation in 1959. There are the Kennedys. There are
the rockets, the impossibly tiny space capsules, the space suits.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra may poke fun at Glenn for pursuing ``one last ride,''
but his roomful of mementos demonstrates that he has never really
left the space program behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us haven't,'' Schirra said. ``You can't let loose of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke that Glenn was going back into space,
Schirra's phone began ringing and hasn't stopped. ``It's amazing
how it's caught the public's imagination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra says he has explained to Glenn in pretty plain terms
that he doesn't approve of his flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I
think there's some interest in aging,' '' Schirra recalled Glenn
saying. ``And I said, `Then why don't we talk about Story
Musgrave?' He's had five or six flights, and a lot of data.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave reluctantly retired from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in September 1997 at the ripe old age of 62,
after being told he was too old to fly any more missions.
</P>
<P>
   And while Glenn touts the value of studying the effects of
spaceflight on the elderly, Schirra is equally convinced that the
primary motivation is the joy of the flight itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more ride,'' Schirra said. ``I can't defend him on the
science angle. &QL;

GROWING WINGS: FROM HIS RURAL OHIO ROOTS, GLENN WAS ALWAYS A
STANDOUT 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CONCORD, Ohio _ Forget that Boy Scout image you read about.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it may actually be true that the legendary John Glenn _
first American to orbit the Earth, decorated veteran of two wars,
millionaire businessman and four-term U.S. senator _ doesn't drink,
smoke, fight or cuss.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts weren't good enough for Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kinda rowdy,'' remembers Lloyd White, Glenn's
lifelong friend. ``So Johnny and I started our own club when we
were 11 or 12. About every kid in town was in it. We got together
and had a big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glenn's strict, Presbyterian, dry (then and now) hometown _
population 2,000 _ a big time for the Ohio Rangers consisted of
swimming in the Muskingum River, sleeping out in tents and making
model airplanes every chance they got. To earn merit badges, they
waded through knee-deep snow and climbed 80-foot trees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 77, with about half of his high school classmates and
nearly half of his Mercury astronaut buddies gone, Glenn is still
climbing. On Thursday, he is scheduled to take his second ride into
the great unknown, becoming the oldest human in space and, NASA
hopes, igniting memories of his glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go back up again,'' Glenn says, ``but as
the years went by, I thought those hopes had gone glimmering a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The section of Interstate 40 that connects Cambridge _ where
Glenn was born on July 18, 1921 _ and New Concord _ where he moved
with his parents a couple of years later _ is known as the John H.
Glenn Highway. The street by Glenn's boyhood home is named
Friendship Drive after his space capsule; the local high school and
the gym at the college are named for him.
</P>
<P>
   New Concord is an idyllic rural village about 75 miles east of
Columbus. It's a place where, White says, ``everybody in town is
your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No smoking, no drinking, no dancing, no cards,'' White
remembers. ``It was a great place for kids to be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice little town, but it wasn't the sticks,'' says
Lorle Porter, a local historian at Muskingum College, Glenn's
Presbyterian alma mater. ``There were lots of missionaries who had
been all over the world, coming home. There was more of a
cosmopolitan atmosphere than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, Glenn, whom everyone called ``Bud'' or
``Johnny'' to separate him from his dad, the local plumber and car
dealer, earned extra money on a paper route and raised rhubarb to
sell from a wagon.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Glenn's grades were good, but not outstanding.
His mother, a former teacher, thought he could do better if he
devoted a little less time to socializing and sports. A star center
on the football team, Glenn was the only athlete in his high school
to letter in three sports _ football, basketball and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of his junior class, had the lead in the senior
play, and sang tenor in the glee club. Every Memorial Day, Glenn's
father, a World War I bugler, performed Taps at the local cemetery.
John stood on the bridge near his home and played the echo on his
trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1939 yearbook, Glenn was dubbed ``busiest'' and
``all-around popular boy.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Glenn begged his parents to stop at the airport to
watch takeoffs and landings. He took his first airplane ride when
he was 8 or 9, sitting next to his dad in the back of a small
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up and circled around Cambridge, Ohio,'' he remembers.
``I was fascinated with flying from then on and I built model
airplanes as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Glenn's hobby threatened to lead him into a dangerous
profession, his parents balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sick when he took up aviation,'' Glenn's father would
later tell the Columbus Dispatch. ``It was just like taking him out
and burying him, we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, when Glenn became a test pilot, he would fly his
jet home. John and Clara Glenn would hear him buzz New Concord,
signaling them to pick him up at the airport in nearby Zanesville.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors to the town often stop the police, whose
uniforms include a Friendship 7 patch on the shoulder, to ask
directions to the John Glenn museum, Porter says. There isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't call attention to yourself here,'' she says.
``That's bragging. It's not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is the same. ``It's still hard to get it in his head that
we want to do a John Glenn museum. That shocks him.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same guy who shot up both hands when reporters asked
which of the original seven astronauts would be first in space? And
sent his physical exams to NASA every year since retirement? And
lobbied relentlessly for a second ride?``
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go from selling rhubarb to where he is unless you're
ambitious,'' Porter says. ``With the outside world, pressing
himself forward is OK, but this is his home.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Johnny Glenn and Anna Margaret Castor, the
daughter of the town dentist, were engaged in the crib.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a time in our lives when we didn't know
each other,'' Glenn told Columbus Monthly magazine this summer.
``Everything we've been through, we've been through together.''
</P>
<P>
   They were actually engaged while attending Muskingum. It looked
like John might graduate from college and settle down with Annie,
maybe eventually take over his dad's plumbing business.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 7, 1941, John was on his way to Annie's senior
recital when he heard on the radio that the Japanese had bombed
Pearl Harbor. After she played ``Be Still My Soul'' on the organ,
he told her he was joining up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``John went off into politics,'' Schirra said. ``So John,
obviously, from a political/PR standpoint got a flight. Whether he
earned it or not ... I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local joke they have at the country club here ... is why
don't they send Strom Thurmond up there if they want an old fogy?''
Schirra laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper contends that the flight presents an opportunity to
compare how Glenn's 77-year-old body will react to an orbital
situation similar to the one he experienced when he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch will be a lot easier and the reentry will be a lot
easier, but (it's an) almost identical orbital situation, except
he'll have a lot of room,'' Cooper said. ``It'll be interesting to
see what changes in the cardiovascular system there have been ...
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Even four decades ago some of the other Mercury astronauts were
never quite sure what to make of Glenn. Military men of the old
school didn't go in for publicity, but Glenn was drawn to
microphones and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, John was very astute at public relations, very
knowledgeable of it and enjoyed it,'' Cooper recalls. ''He didn't
miss an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And Glenn's gravitation toward the spotlight rubbed some of the
astronaut corps the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes there was some of that here and there,'' Cooper
said. ``There were a few who probably didn't enjoy his trying to be
the spokesperson for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it never bothered me much,'' Cooper continued.
``We were kind of like a bunch of brothers. We were then and we
still are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of us who didn't always agree with John,
but we agreed with him on most things. He's certainly a wonderful
person, you know, a great sense of humor. And we all razz one
another mercilessly _ whenever the opportunity arises,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was practically canonized by the nation after his orbital
flight and something about his personality kept him slightly apart
from nearly everyone except his good friend Carpenter. He just
wouldn't ``cavort'' with the other guys, as Schirra put it.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter says he has no idea why his friendship with Glenn has
always been stronger than the others, adding, ``you choose your own
friends according to your own yardstick _ that's just the way it
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see each other frequently and the camaraderie and `esprit
de corps' endures,'' Carpenter said. He has no reservations about
Glenn making this flight, and can't judge the value of the public
relations it will generate.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is motivated by simple curiosity, Carpenter believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to bring back some new truths. That's what we all
want from experimental space flight like this. So I understand his
motivation very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says he gets the chance to talk to the current crop of
astronauts from time to time, and says some of them may be a little
envious of the strength of the space program that grew underneath
the original astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's very discouraging now to be an astronaut, when
you think of how ... little we are progressing in space,'' Cooper
said. ``We're going to wind up watching the Japanese or the Chinese
or the French go to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we will participate in an international space
station, which would be a great thing because it would bring
together a lot of countries.'' Cooper said. ``But we should already
be back on the moon with a permanent lunar base.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress continues to be very balky about funding the space
program, Cooper said. So he concludes that NASA can definitely use
whatever positive publicity is generated by Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has gone through all these big cycles,'' Cooper said.
``At the time of the Mercury and the Gemini programs, NASA was the
master of PR (public relations).
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've put out in the past 30 years has been garbage,
frankly,'' Cooper said. ``Midway through the lunar landings, NASA
decided they were the only game in town and didn't have to work
very hard at maintaining public support for the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the public interest has not waned, because every
day I get a stack of mail that high _ every single day, and every
one of us does,'' Cooper said. ``So that tells me that the public
interest is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the kids who write in, that's probably the question
they ask the most _ when are we going to get back to the moon? When
are we going to Mars?'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra says there were four reasons that the early space
program grew and succeeded
</P>
<P>
   ``One, we had a committed young president, which is an oxymoron
today,'' Schirra said. ``We had a blank check, and the Cold War
(which turned the conquest of space into a defense issue), and that
was a big thing people forget. And then we had people of an age
where they could actually produce what they wanted _ engineers,
technicians, scientists, astronauts, and we all blended together
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen again, that fourth category, but the other
three, the commitment's gone,'' Schirra said. ``Nothing grand will
happen in this space program without a national commitment, and a
national commitment starts at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left NASA in 1970 and worked for years in Walt Disney's
research and development division. He's currently president and
chief executive officer for Galaxy Aerospace Management Inc., a
company engaged in retrofitting old aircraft as well as designing
new ones. He lives in Van Nuys, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra left the space agency in 1969, has had a lucrative
business career, and still enjoys public speaking. He lives in this
small community just north of San Diego, where many of his old Navy
buddies also retired.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter has had perhaps the most adventurous post-NASA life,
holding the title of both astronaut and aquanaut. He joined the
Navy's Sealab program after leaving the space program in 1967 and
lived in the experimental station on the ocean floor for 30 days.
He works as a consultant on ocean and space technology programs,
and has developed still another career as a fiction writer.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, each of the Mercury astronauts were assigned
duties in connection with their comrades' flights, usually working
in tracking stations at far-flung areas of a world where
communications satellites were a novel concept.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when Glenn blasts off, what's left of the old
astronaut corps will be at Cape Canaveral, Fla., but in a different
capacity. Schirra, Cooper and Carpenter will all be doing
television commentary on their old pal's flight.
</P>
<P>
   When Schirra was interviewed by the Chronicle, he said Shepard
had been quite ill but was hoping to be there to see Glenn's
launch. Less than 24 hours later, his good friend would be dead.
</P>
<P>
   But in Schirra's den that morning, his stories of the glory days
often began with the first American in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shepard and I lived for teasing.'' Schirra said. ``And Gordo
does, too, but Shepard and I are a little faster. We live for
gotchas.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how the first American in space pulled one of his
favorite ``gotchas'' on the first American in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our favorite stories Shepard and I tell, Al got a new
Olds convertible when they lived in Houston,'' Schirra said,
leaning forward conspiratorially. ``This was after Mercury _ we'd
been transferred to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming down to our house for some kind of meeting and
Al and Louise (Shepard) were in their convertible, driving down
this big highway, the Gulf Freeway. And Al was apparently going a
little bit faster than the speed limit, and got pulled over,''
Schirra continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman asked for his driver's license. Al didn't have it.
He asked for registration _ new car, he didn't have it. And the
policeman said, ``Oh, I recognize you Col. Glenn _ go ahead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schirra was pounding the table and laughing at this point in the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I laughed so hard about that and poor old John was just
furious,'' &UR;  &LR; when he found out he'd been blamed for Shepard's hot
rodding. &QL;

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1962, when John Glenn flew around the world three times in
that Friendship 7 capsule, I was conducting a search for heroes.
Glenn showed up at exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted better role models for my kids. They were then 11 and
9, and the people they admired didn't seem so admirable to me.
</P>
<P>
   My son was a disciple of Mickey Mantle and some long-haired drag
racer whose name I forget. My daughter was in love with a rock 'n'
roller. Maybe he was Elvis. Along about that time I remember
reading those two words, Elvis Presley, and I thought they made up
the dumbest name ever hung on a little baby. I said then that
nobody answering to a name like that would ever amount to anything.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted my children to have solid citizens for role models.
Mickey Mantle was good about hitting home runs, sure, but his
personal life wasn't so nice. And long-haired drag racers were
disgusting to me. At that time I was much smarter than I am now,
and I was able to judge the character of people by the length of
their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Then here came John Glenn, who climbed into that little capsule
stuck on the top of a rocket and let them shoot him 162 miles high
and he whizzed around the planet for three orbits and came blazing
back into the atmosphere and landed with a glorious splash in the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   I told my kids, Look, here's a genuine hero for you. Forget your
beer-guzzling athletes and your hip-grinding musicians and your
greasy-headed race-car drivers. John Glenn has done something no
American has ever done, and he has risked his hide to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I said, he has taken us across the threshold of a
new frontier. (I did a good deal of lecturing in those days, before
my children got so big I couldn't make them sit still to listen.)
He has opened up a horizon, and ushered us into the Space Age.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds cornball now, as it did to my children in '62, and
yet I still believe it.
</P>
<P>
   A great thing about Glenn was that he looked like a hero. He had
that college halfback appearance, not pretty but not ugly, either.
And he had short hair.
</P>
<P>
   Also he'd already proven he had the right stuff. A combat pilot
in two wars, with something like 150 missions.
</P>
<P>
   But to me personally, the greatest thing about Glenn was this:
He and I were almost exactly the same age. Born in '21, less than
two months apart.
</P>
<P>
   My campaign to make Glenn a hero to my children was not
successful, but he has remained heroic to me. Not as a politician
but mainly for that historic ride he took in the capsule 36 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about laying your life on the line for your country. I
doubt there's ever been full public understanding of the grave risk
Glenn was exposed to on that mission. Even now, being shot into
space on a rocket amounts to an experimental test flight, so
imagine all the unknowns that went up with Glenn in that Friendship
7 capsule.
</P>
<P>
   I've always admired the way he talked about those risks. When he
was back home safely and doing all the interviews, I remember a
reporter asking him what would have happened if the capsule's heat
shield had failed, on reentry. That was pretty close to what space
exploration reporters call a sick question.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, if the heat shield had failed, Glenn would have been
fried. But he grinned and answered like this: ``It would have been
a bad day at Black Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, that was Roy Rogers talking. It was just the way we want
our heroes to talk about risk and danger. We needed that then, when
we were feeling inadequate to the Russians on space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   If there's politics involved in Glenn's ticket to ride on this
Oct. 29 mission, it doesn't make an ounce of difference to me. His
going up there, when both of us are 77, is like me going along as
well.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Glenn is in better physical condition than I am. I sure
hope so. I figure the launch will be the toughest test for him,
with all those G's pressing on his brave old heart. But once he's
in orbit, why can't a 77-year-old guy float around in a weightless
environment as easy as any pink-cheek rookie?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be a news story if this old guy performed better in
a weightless environment than the young people?
</P>
<P>
   Then finally I've decided not to be embarrassed by this thought,
which I'm unable to resist:
</P>
<P>
   What if John Glenn returned from space younger than when he
left? &QL;

   TEXAS-HAMBURGERS (Houston) _ What the croissant is to France,
what goulash is to Hungary, what pickled herring is to Sweden, the
hamburger is to Texas. It's a symbol, a necessity, and a triumph, a
part of the cultural patrimony so tightly woven into the fabric of
Texas life that Texans themselves do not even remark on it until
they are presented with the gray-tinged, underfurnished,
suspiciously geometric hamburger that the rest of America lives
with. By William Grimes.

ONE-TRICK PONIES: `LETTERMAN' SHOW LOOKS TO HOUSTON FOR STUPID
FEATS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The mood wasn't right for Josie, the slow-dancing
poodle. Babe, a Jack Russell terrier dressed in Yankee pinstripes,
couldn't perform a perfect back flip. And Aman, a 14-foot python,
didn't know what to do beyond clinging closely _ very closely _ to
his owner.
</P>
<P>
   Double-jointed Matt Grantham felt sure he could crush an egg
between arms twisted wrong-side out, but a test with several Grade
A's proved eggsactly the opposite. And John Ware's chainsaw
impression sounded suspiciously similar to his small-airplane
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was difficult to tell the stupid pet tricks from the
stupid human tricks at ``Late Show With David Letterman''
auditions. But it was fun trying.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Molloy's cockatoo, Zsa Zsa, provoked laughs and applause
as she flipped herself upside down and stood on her head resting on
Terry's hand. Jennifer Cooney's German shepherd, Juliet, amused as
she crawled, combat style, underneath five chairs. And Kim
Hentschel's border collie, Whisper, amazed as she did crazy-8s
through Kim's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid Pet Tricks/Stupid Human Tricks coordinator Bill
Langworthy patiently watched as each of 25 tricks were performed _
or sometimes only attempted. He was in town scouting for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Jenkins' dancing bird, an African gray parrot named Baker,
wouldn't boogie on cue, so Langworthy suggested they come back
later for another try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you tried shooting M&AMP;Ms into your mouth?'' he asked of
Dante Rodriguez. Dante's ``skill'' was flipping a penny by
``popping'' his thumb, but Langworthy wanted something more. So out
Dante went in search of candy.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Kidd, Sherrie Brogdon's parrot, was singing like an
opera star out in the hall, but when it was time to enter the
studio and audition, he turned prima donna. ``Maybe if everybody
sang along,'' Sherrie suggested to the few onlookers on hand. Sure
enough, the bird responded with gusto, belting out ``Singin' in the
Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even Langworthy, can predict who will make the show.
Those who auditioned Saturday will have to wait until a ``Late
Show'' producer reviews the tryout tape before learning if they'll
appear on one of next month's shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave likes normal people doing odd things, and he likes big
dogs, especially golden retrievers,'' Langworthy said. But weird
people and small dogs have also made it to ``Late Show.'' The only
criteria are that acts be ``safe, funny, original and of no use to
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Langworthy is prepared for acts to freeze up during tryouts. Of
course, if you go stiff at audition, it's not likely you'll do well
in front of a national audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   So Rosie the rat, who failed to run an obstacle course, and
Chelsea the wirehaired dachshund, who didn't go as nuts as usual
when an ironing board was produced, should not wait by the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Dubby Perry, on the other hand, might be getting a call. Perry,
a lawyer's videographer from Lufkin, Texas, presented a feat
Langworthy said ``was nothing like I've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry can make three empty beer cans stick to his balding pate,
then he can down a brew and add the empty to his head. It's quite a
sight to see.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought you were the one with talent.

FILM POSTERS LEAP IN VALUE AMONG COLLECTORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much is that poster in the window?
</P>
<P>
   It may cost you nothing _ or one day it could be worth hundreds
or even thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If it's for a film such as ``Antz,'' now playing in theaters,
you might pick one up for free by politely asking the theater
manager, or perhaps later buy it from a specialty dealer for around
$20.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like a classic horror or sci-fi film poster, open
your vault. Those can cost many thousands of dollars, and often are
sold only by big auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   With current films, such posters, or ``one sheets,'' are often
tossed away after a movie leaves town, or they're taken home by
theater employees. Usually they're torn or faded, anyway,
especially if they've been displayed outside.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever the adage ``Today's trash becomes tomorrow's
treasure'' holds true, it's with movie posters.
</P>
<P>
   They have become big business today, though not for today's
films. The big bucks go to decades-old movie paper items _ usually
27-by-41-inch posters or ``one sheets,'' but also photo stills,
oversize color ``lobby cards'' and other sizes of posters called
``inserts'' (14-by-36 inches) and ``three-sheets'' (41-by-81
inches).
</P>
<P>
   ``The old horror films are beyond the reach of most
collectors,'' said Gene Arnold of Houston, owner of Arnold Movie
Poster Co. His business is not a store but a mail-order outfit,
though you can call at 713-524-9000 or check out the Web site at
www.movieposters.com.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said original posters for 1933's ``King Kong'' and 1931's
``Frankenstein'' and ``Dracula'' cost $150,000-$200,000 per poster,
``and that's if you can find them. There's probably just a handful
in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for such scarcity, beyond simple age, is the fact
that posters before 1945 were recycled as part of war drives.
</P>
<P>
   Also, posters weren't widely considered collectibles until the
1960s. ``They were thrown away by carloads,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, most have had a gradual rise in popularity and
price. In the last 10 years, though, many have skyrocketed as
auction-house bidding has sparked interest and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just oldies that are rising in value. Some relatively
recent films are becoming what Arnold calls ``cult classics,''
generating a fever of fan interest and ``escalating dramatically''
in price.
</P>
<P>
   Among such films he names ``Chinatown,'' ``The Sting,'' ``Cool
Hand Luke,'' ``Ocean's Eleven,'' ``The Wild Bunch,'' ``The
Magnificent Seven,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the ``Rocky'' films and`` Breakfast at
Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago you could buy `Breakfast at Tiffany's' (the
poster) for $35-$50, but it's selling now for about $1,000,''
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other recent films, obvious choices such as the hit ``Star
Wars,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``Alien''and ``Indiana Jones'' also draw
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Sci-fi and horror do especially well, Arnold said, and horror
sells all year long, not just around Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But collectors have varied interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come from all walks of life,'' said Kathleen Connaughton,
who owns Hollywood Frame Gallery, 2431 Bissonnet, with husband
Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our clients, a computer programmer, is building a
terrific film noir collection,'' she said. ``Another is a huge
Hitchcock collector.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Arnold say more and more young people are joining the
hobby, which attracts several hundred collectors in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Many attend Stargazer, a movie poster show that's promoted here
each March by Houston collector/dealer Robert Cullen. (The next
Stargazer is March 13-14; call 713-365-0266 for information.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great market here, and we draw dealers from all over
the country,'' Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   While many items are moderately priced, a one-sheet of
``Jailhouse Rock'' sold for $3,500 at last year's show.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen and Arnold attribute the rise in interest among young
people to vintage-movie channels such as TNT, TMC and AMC.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really stir the pot for old movies,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I credit the growth in young fans 100 percent to them,''
Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger fans also buy posters for current films, like
``Titanic'' or ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Connaughton said. (The
original ``Titanic'' poster costs around $50, while reprints go for
about $20.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of collectors do start with the newer stuff and then get
into the older stuff as well,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent ``Swingers'' was the Frame Gallery's best seller last
year, thanks to revived interest in swing music and Frank Sinatra,
Connaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   As for starting a ``serious'' collection, she advises fans to
begin with '70s movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good place for young people to go,'' Connaughton
said. ``You had `Star Wars,' `Grease,' `Jaws,' `The Godfather,'
`Rocky,' `The Exorcist,' `Chinatown' _ you can just go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jaws'' poster is big, going for $150-$200, based on
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' has an illustration, not a photo, and older posters had
even more artwork and stylism, produced when studios had art
departments for such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older posters are works of art,'' Connaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the original `Touch of Evil' poster up beside the
reissue poster, and people were blown away by the original,''
Connaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   Often such art also has personal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you grew up loving '50s sci-fi movies. Let's say you
also appreciate a good robot. Your poster of choice? ``Forbidden
Planet'' _ what else?
</P>
<P>
   As an anniversary present, Houstonian Tom Seiler's wife bought
him an original poster from the 1956 movie, which they had fully
restored and framed. It now hangs proudly in their den.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like owning a piece of 1956,'' Seiler said. ``It's got a
classic robot on it _ Robby the Robot _ with Anne Francis in his
arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today's photo-based posters, this one is fully
illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like owning a rather limited art print,'' Seiler said,
``and the design of the robot is special. It's a classic movie
robot. The same guy designed the `Lost in Space' robot years
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Such posters often need restoration not just due to age but
because for decades they arrived in theaters flat and folded,
leading to creases and tears. Today's posters arrive in rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of specialists around the country handle restorations.
Arnold doesn't do them, though his son, Dan, restores lobby cards.
</P>
<P>
   Restorations can be expensive in themselves _ just as frames can
cost as much as the material they display. But for fans of
movie-poster art, showing off a prize is a large part of its
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Fans' interests vary widely, with some seeking certain stars
while others hunt genres such as horror, titles such as ``Gone With
the Wind,'' studios such as Disney or even subjects such as
courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sold a lot of stills to a law firm in Boston that's
going to decorate its new law offices with courtroom scenes,''
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   But old posters are still the biggest draw. The most expensive
ever, Arnold said, was for 1932's ``The Mummy'' with Boris Karloff.
It sold in auction for almost $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole new market has developed in the last 10 years,'' said
Arnold, who began trading and selling posters as a hobby in 1965
and has sold posters full-time for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten very competitive, and much more expensive,'' he
said. ``So many celebrities buy now that regular folks just can't
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's still a lot of fun, and it's remarkable that
something once considered as momentary enjoyment has become such
lasting art.'' &QL;

VIDEO-ONLY `LION KING' SEQUEL A ROARING SUCCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a movie makes $772 million worldwide, wins two Oscars, and
becomes the top-selling video of all time (at 30 million), making a
sequel is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   But the surprise of ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' is that
this follow-up to 1994's ``The Lion King'' is being offered solely
on video. It arrives Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the film will get a wide theatrical release, followed
by a video campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, video makes more sense, since ``The Lion King II''
(not rated, closed-captioned, $26.99) lacks the first film's
sweeping visual majesty and the feel of big-movie ``event.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Disney's five other video sequels to its animated hits,
the creators came from Disney's TV animation studios, in this case
in Australia, Canada and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They deliver quality movements and characterizations yet far
less lush background detail, and soft-focus is overused.
</P>
<P>
   But in other respects this 80-minute film is top-drawer, from
its voice-actors (with many from the original) to its story (mixing
rehashes with new spins) to its superb new songs and orchestral
score.
</P>
<P>
   In a repetitious opening scene, the circle of life continues as
Simba, the lion who came of age in ``The Lion King,'' presents his
own offspring and future heir to the Pridelands he rules.
</P>
<P>
   She's Kiara, destined to lead one day as queen. But like so many
Disney princesses _ in ``Aladdin,'' ``The Little Mermaid'' and
``Pocahontas'' _ she'd rather follow her heart.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to eventful adventures in the desolate Outlands and
an unlikely friendship with Kovu, the young lion who's successor to
his wicked father, the first film's Scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lion King II'' then plays out somewhat like ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' as the bonding cubs try to unite their warring prides.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new voice talents, Neve Campbell (``Scream'') plays
Kiara and Suzanne Pleshette is the one-dimensionally evil Zira,
Scar's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Returning are Matthew Broderick as Simba; Robert Guillaume as
baboon Rafiki; James Earl Jones as fallen king Mufasa, heard in
spirit; Nathan Lane as wise-cracking meerkat Timon; and Ernie
Sabella as clueless wart hog Pumbaa.
</P>
<P>
   The last two alone make the movie worth watching. Whenever the
story sags with sentiment, their dependable comic relief is fun and
enlivening.
</P>
<P>
   It's most needed at story's start, when the film is alarmingly
regressive.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first movie's broad-based family appeal, this one
begins with such a cuddly, fuzzy-wuzzy, precious approach that it
merits a surgeon general's warning about insufferable sweetness.
Thankfully, this bent soon subsides as baby Kiara _ who sounds like
a mall rat _ reaches adolescence and acquires a wider worldview.
</P>
<P>
   Among the film's strong songs, ``We Are One'' is a stirring
affirmation of interspecies harmony and ecological ideals, while
``Love Will Find a Way'' is a romantic and pretty duet. (Other
performers often do the singing.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also the inevitable Busby Berkeley-style big production
number, but it's a winner. In ``Upendi,'' rhinos, zebras, ostriches
and hippos form a conga line, like some mad revival of
``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   These come from several composing teams; the first film's Elton
John and Tim Rice had no input. The original's Mark Mancina again
provides arrangements, using similar African rhythms and tribal
chants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the true circle of life is how much and how often Disney
successfully recycles its own material. But its biggest animated
hit ever has provided territory worth revisiting. &QL;

NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO GET IN THE GAME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People have asked me whether it's time to get back into the
stock market after it's inflicted so much pain.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, the market is sending signals to investors who've fled
that this is a good time to step back in.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, the market was up seven straight days.
</P>
<P>
   Investment experts said the time is ripe to buy stocks because
major decisions by policy-makers have made stocks attractive and
stocks also are at good prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also said another dip in the market is possible
this month, so be picky about where you put your money and be
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would classify this market as an early bull market in the
making,'' said Hamilton Lewis, a Houston money manager and
technical analyst, who studies stocks using trading data such as
volume and price trends to make predictions.
</P>
<P>
   When stocks fall now, the magnitude isn't as severe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lows begin to get higher and that automatically tells you
that money is beginning to sponsor these stocks that were hit at
one time,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is generally defined as a 20 percent drop in
stocks. Depending on who's asked, that definition sometimes is
expanded to include a drop over an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone down the stairs, we've hit the basement and we're
beginning to climb the stairs again,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Market's response encouraging &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another optimistic sign is that major decisions by policy-makers
have boosted investor confidence, said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at investment firm First Albany in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board recently cut interest rates, and
Japanese officials have finally voted to use public funds to bail
out Japan's sick banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really encouraging was the response of the financial
markets,'' Johnson said. ``The markets responded positively and
that's what you see at the bottom of a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is telling investors that there's good news to offset
the bad arising from the Asian financial crisis, said Henry
Lartigue, chief investment officer at Chase Bank of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saying to investors that although Asia is part of the
equation, it is far from all of the equation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As you look at what stocks you should be investing in, keep in
mind that the last shall be first.
</P>
<P>
   Investment professionals said investors should consider putting
their money in the stocks of small and middle-sized companies
because the market's decline has beaten them up so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been hit hard and historically when the Fed eases,
small- and midcaps do better because credit is easier and they can
grow,'' said Ed Larsen, chief equity officer at Aim Capital
Management, a mutual fund company in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the last 11 times that the Fed has cut interest
rates, a year after the rate cut, small stocks gained an average
37.8 percent, compared with an average 24.8 percent for large
stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
September is the cruelest month &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many investors think October is the worst month for stocks, but
it's not. It's actually September, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, market swoons do occur in October.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many investors sell their losing stocks to take a
tax loss they can use to offset profits.
</P>
<P>
   And money managers get rid of their losers before preparing the
year-end statements they give to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Many large stocks also are still expensive, relative to
companies' ability to deliver the earnings growth investors expect,
Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to pay more for a future stream of earnings
because inflation and interest rates are low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, corporate earnings are expected on average to have
fallen about 2 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same
time last year, and they may even be flat next year, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can't grow at the double-digit returns that it used
to have until the earnings improve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this environment poses a classic opportunity because
you'd be investing _ ``buying low'' _ when everyone else is
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is to buy at the end of October declines to take
advantage of the market rally that usually follows and can last
through January.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are entering the best time to own stocks,'' Larsen said.
``All the gains in a year are made between November and March.''

BACK IN BLACK: ACTOR RESURRECTS `PHANTASM' CHARACTER WITH MORE
LIVES THAN A CAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Angus Scrimm sees it, the fiendish Tall Man of ``Phantasm''
fame is simply misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think he's like a civil servant, just doing his job _
at least in his mind,'' Scrimm said of the black-clad villain bent
on populating Earth with reanimated corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Like many horror heavies, the Tall Man is killed but returns
again and again. Similarly, Scrimm has returned to the same role
for two decades. The 6-foot-4 actor has played the Tall Man ever
since the first ``Phantasm'' made an impact in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the No. 1 hit in Paris for most of that summer,'' he
said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Don Coscarelli, ``Phantasm'' was a weird
mix of funeral homes, dimensional gateways, crawling alien fingers
leaving trails of yellow goo and flying metal spheres drilling into
brains.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Tall Man, an overly ambitious mortician, with
his minions of tiny slaves in monks' robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantasm'' was followed by sequels from Universal in 1988 and
1994. ``Phantasm II'' had a major theatrical campaign, and
``Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead'' went straight to video.
</P>
<P>
   Working independently, Coscarelli has made a third sequel,
``Phantasm: Oblivion,'' new on video (Orion, rated R, priced for
rental).
</P>
<P>
   Scrimm isn't the only one to return. The Tall Man's good-guy
foes have also stayed the course, aging 20 years in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Phantasm: Oblivion,'' Reggie Bannister and Bill Thornbury
play Reggie and Jody, as they have in each film. Michael Baldwin, a
teen in the first film, has played Mike in all but the second
picture. He's assailed by the Tall Man with the bullying cry
``Boy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the second film, Universal wanted a hunk (in the Mike
role) and cast James Le Gros,'' Scrimm said. ``He's the only
`Phantasm' cast member who's broken through to the semi-big time.''
</P>
<P>
   (Le Gros has made more than 40 films, including ``Singles'' and
``Born on the Fourth of July.'')
</P>
<P>
   Scrimm says job doldrums have influenced other stars' repeated
returns to the ``Phantasm'' fold. With the series' disjointed
scripts, it's certainly not the plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have to hold out for a little more money, but it
hasn't been difficult to get us,'' Scrimm said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet luck and loyalty also are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These movies are great fun to make,'' said Scrimm, 72, who has
often watched crews make yellow alien blood out of yogurt and food
coloring. ``And we all love getting back together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantasm: Oblivion'' underscores time's passage. In
flashbacks, it shows scenes shot for the first film that were never
used but are known to fans via the rumor mill. One such scene has
Mike hanging the Tall Man from a tree with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the years, that had become almost legendary because
nobody had seen it,'' Scrimm said. ``It was deleted because the
Tall Man was killed off too many times in the picture. I've lost
count how many times I've been killed over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Using such old footage enabled Coscarelli to shoot ``Phantasm:
Oblivion'' even more cheaply than usual. (His biggest budget was $3
million for ``Phantasm II.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Don had to use his own money to get it off the ground, so he
devised a script using the old footage, meaning he only had to
shoot a little over an hour of new material,'' Scrimm said. ``But
the color quality had really held up, and I think he did it rather
cleverly.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent video reissue of the original ``Phantasm'' (MGM, rated
R, $9.94) adds still more unused footage. ``It's got two or three
scenes that aren't in any other `Phantasm,' '' Scrimm said. ``They
kill the Tall Man in another way!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Phantasm: Oblivion,'' Scrimm finally gets to show a
different aspect of his character, perhaps his true nature. In a
time-travel scene set during the Civil War, he's a kind, solicitous
inventor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing evil is great fun, but I was really pleased to show my
nice side,'' Scrimm said. ``When I appear at fan gatherings, people
often say, `You're so nice.' Then I scare them by saying, `Oh, this
is just my public persona. The Tall Man really is me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can follow ``Phantasm'' films via their website at
www.phantasm.com. But Scrimm's relatives won't be joining them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few of my relatives will watch these films,'' he said. ``With
the increasing violence in average films today, I don't know why
some people still say, `I won't go see a horror film.' You see more
gore in `Saving Private Ryan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for the loyalists, Scrimm feels ``Phantasm's'' appeals ``are
its unique combination of horror, fantasy and science fiction and
the fact that it deals with death _ not in the slasher way, but
with the actual subject of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Tall Man, in many respects, is the grim reaper.'' &QL;

ADVENTURES IN SINGING: MULTIPLE `TALES OF HOFFMANN' ROLES DEMAND
FLEXIBILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vocally, Jacques Offenbach's opera ``The Tales of
Hoffmann'' is unusual: A few singers portray a multitude of main
characters in great tests of musical flexibility and dramatic
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   A bass-baritone presents the four villains who rob Hoffmann of
his four loves. A soprano matches that by singing each of those
loves. A mezzo-soprano plays the role of Hoffmann's friend, who
turns out to be his muse. Even servants of the villains and
protagonists in Hoffmann's sad stories are sung by the same tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Using stories by 19th-century German writer and composer E.T.A.
Hoffmann, French librettist Jules Barbier created for ``Les Contes
d'Hoffmann'' a web of revelations aimed ultimately at allowing
listeners to see Hoffmann's life from many perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   His infatuation with Olympia is slightly perverse, for she turns
out to be a doll who ultimately is destroyed. His love for the
singer Antonia is real but thwarted by her death. His liaison with
the courtesan Guilietta, whose lover Hoffmann kills, ends when she
goes off with another suitor.
</P>
<P>
   At the opera's end, Barbier lets the audience realize that the
three women are aspects of Hoffmann's current love, the opera
singer Stella. Alas, he loses her, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple roles require singers with a certain
devil-may-care adventuresomeness _ especially the soprano.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston Grand Opera revives ``Hoffmann'' Friday in its
co-production with Australian Opera, audiences will hear such a
daredevil: Spanish soprano Maria Bayo, who will sing all of
Hoffmann's four loves for the first time in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Bayo will join Mexican tenor Ramon Vargas (Hoffmann), American
bass-baritone Dean Peterson (the villains) and American
mezzo-soprano Beth Clayton (Niklausse/Muse). Vjekoslav Sutej will
conduct members of the Houston Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the diminutive Bayo (pronounced BUY-oh) radiates two
images: the international opera star and the down-to-earth human
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I step on the stage and people want a performance of a
diva, I give it to them,'' said Bayo, whose only other American
appearances have been a Metropolitan Opera debut and New York City
recital debut last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I step off the stage, I'm a normal person,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Her stages include Paris' Opera de la Bastille and the Vienna
State Opera, where she has sung Antonia in ``Hoffmann.'' These
days, they are typical stops, far from the place that gave her such
a sense of stability.
</P>
<P>
   She hails from a small agricultural town, Fetaro, in the
province of Navarra in northern Spain, where everyone knows almost
everything about everybody. ``Too much,'' she quipped, adding the
Spanish word for gossip.
</P>
<P>
   For one month each year she is at home in Pamplona, the
provincial capital, where she visits with friends, enjoys drives
around the Navarra countryside, and goes out to restaurants with
her husband, an instructor of Basque folk music at the University
of Navarra.
</P>
<P>
   There were no musicians in her family. Her father, who had a
vineyard and grew fruit, did have ``a beautiful tenor voice'' but
he sang only for family on social occasions. Like Luciano
Pavarotti's father, he still does _ at age 75.
</P>
<P>
   From her father, Bayo, 40, inherited both a naturally
well-developed voice and an affinity for singing. ``I feel my
passion started with the passion for music of my father,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain about a career, she started parallel tracks of study
at the University of Navarra in Pamplona: music and preschool
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not think about studying singing, but when Edurne
Aguerri a singing professor in the school heard me, she said I had
a voice with a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   She later studied in Barcelona, and finally at a
``Musikhochschule'' in Germany. Her preparation was finished in
1988, when she won first prize in Vienna's Belvedere Competition,
one of the most important singing contests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her Bastille debut occurred in 1991, when she sang Susanna in
W.A. Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' It was the culmination of
her breakout into international opera that year, she said. ``El
finito'' _ the final step.
</P>
<P>
   The list of conductors she has worked with contains many
important names: Claudio Scimone, Riccardo Chailly, Michel Plasson,
Giuseppe Sinopoli, Sir Colin Davis and, for Baroque operas, Rene
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Her repertoire includes the standard works and
less-often-performed ones such as George Handel's ``Julius
Caesar,'' Vincenzo Bellini's ``I Capuleti et i Montecchi'' and
Claude Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande.'' She proudly sings
``zarzuelas,'' the unique Spanish form of light opera.
</P>
<P>
   As her voice matures, becoming a little heavier and darker, she
is beginning to sing more dramatic roles. Next season, she makes
her San Francisco debut as Mimi in Giacomo Puccini's ``La boheme,''
moving on from the more coloratura role of Musetta. She also
performs Liu in Puccini's ``Turandot'' for the first time, at the
gala reopening of the Liceo Opera House in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling testament to Bayo's gifts is her friendship
with the great Spanish mezzo-soprano Teresa Berganza, who lives
north of Madrid. Berganza has become both an adviser and friend,
Bayo said.
</P>
<P>
   She met Berganza through friends soon after her career began to
explode. She went to the mezzo's home and sang. ``From that moment
on, we've been friends,'' Bayo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to have two or three persons who can help
you to maintain your focus,'' she said. Berganza has done that
through insights gleaned from her own international singing career.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the advice would seem predictable: Never force herself
to sing, never sing a role that doesn't fit her voice. Other
nuggets might not be so obvious: Never give every last ounce of
herself in a performance, for maintaining a reserve can keep the
performance from seeming nearly out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, Berganza reinforced that natural instinct
Bayo inherited from her father. The mezzo said: Be true to
yourself. &QL;

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 &HT;    
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

Father'')

ASTRONAUT GLENN BECOMES A SYMBOL OF `SUCCESSFUL AGING' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The remarkable thing about John Glenn's
impending shuttle ride into space is that it's not remarkable at
all, according to some specialists in aging and a few people who
are older than America's septuagenarian astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the 77-year-old senator from Ohio, is scheduled to return
to space on Thursday along with six other crew members of the
shuttle Discovery. It was 36 years ago that Glenn, riding a
telephone booth-sized Mercury capsule atop a thundering rocket,
became the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have called the shuttle mission a publicity stunt. NASA
retorts that Glenn, who is retiring from the Senate this year, will
participate in valuable experiments on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should his age be considered a deterrent to space travel.
Indeed, that is a misconception that stems from antiquated ideas
about growing older, said Bill Haigwood of the Buck Center for
Research on Aging in Novato, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an image about what old people should and shouldn't
be, and it derives from a time when people didn't live to the age
they do today,'' he said. ``Sometimes people in their 60s and 70s
who have taken good care of themselves are in better condition than
people in their 30s and 40s who have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Paola Timiras, 75, grasps that notion clearly. She is a
professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley who
maintains a full teaching and research schedule, and regularly
travels to professional conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Her specialty is the biological aspects of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very good for Mr. Glenn to go,'' she said. ``It
makes sense for someone who has dedicated part of his life to that.
That's why I'm still working here at the university _ because I
like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Glenn was typical of many older Americans who were
maintaining their fitness levels in later years. ``The fact that he
is in good health represents the trend in prolonging life span,
which has been characteristic of this century,'' Timiras said.
</P>
<P>
   She calls it ``successful aging.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, ``He's just a kid,'' said Bill Godward, 85, after
arriving in his downtown San Francisco law office still aglow from
a morning workout at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Godward travels each day from his San Francisco home to the
downtown office of Cooper Godward law firm and logs a full day of
work. ``I'm a trustee of a lot of trusts,'' he said. ``I've
outlived all my clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Godward, who joined the firm in 1941, said he had never
seriously contemplated retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in my 30s, I used to commute with a guy who could
hardly wait to turn 60 and retire,'' he recalled. ``I thought:
`What an awful life. Why doesn't he do something else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Should Glenn subject himself to the rigors of launch and
recovery?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Godward said. ``You should do what you want to
do.''

<P>
   MODERN-ART (New York) _ What does modern mean? Is it purely
historical, as in Ancient, Medieval and Modern? Or is it a
lowercase valedictory applied temporarily to things that are deemed
new and irrefutably contemporary _ that is, a designation that is
outgrown, rather like being a freshman in high school? Furthermore,
is it possible for a museum of modern art to accumulate a
collection and still remain involved with modern art as it evolves?
A critic's notebook by Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MILLET-VANGOGH-EXHIBIT (Paris) _ At first sight, the new show at
the Musee d'Orsay in Paris suggests a bizarre attempt to
resuscitate a neglected 19th-century French painter by exhibiting
him alongside a rather more famous name. In truth, the idea of
uniting Jean-Francois Millet and Van Gogh is far more interesting.
Since the Dutchman looked to the Frenchman as a role model,
Millet's life and work serve as a mirror that reveals much about
Van Gogh. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY (Boston) _ In the moral universe, especially the one that
postdates the Holocaust, remembering is almost always enlisted on
the side of good, and forgetting on the side of bad. But in a
symposium ``The Claims of Memory,'' held at Boston University over
the last few days to celebrate Elie Wiesel's 70th birthday, it was
memory's difficult skirmishes _ battles where it has clashed with
artistic freedom, with morality, with fact, with survival, with
writing, with sanity _ that were evoked. By Sarah Boxer.

   HONG KONG _ Asia's economic meltdown that began last year was
the first domino in a worldwide tumble in emerging markets that
fueled fears of recession from Frankfurt to New York. But it is
also Asia that many economists now believe will lead the way to
global recovery.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 months, currencies, stocks, and growth have
tanked across this once fast-growing region, bringing unemployment,
bankruptcy, and hunger for tens of millions of people across a
continent that is home to 60 percent of the world's population.

   But in the last few weeks _ almost as quickly as the Asian
crisis began with the crash of the Thai currency on July 2, 1997 _
confidence has started to rebound here as Asian shares and
currencies have rallied, with investors bringing money back into a
region that was seen as poisonous just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the Asian stock pickup to last week's cut in
US interest rates and passage of a bank bailout in Japan, the
region's largest economy. And many are eager to view October's good
news as a portent of the bottoming-out of the regional crisis and
the start of a recovery cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But others who have watched sky-high share values and the
world's highest growth rates go up in smoke over the last year
remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of a rushed recovery is that reforms of conditions
that brought on the Asian crash _ cozy relations between government
and business, staggering levels of debt, lax lending practices, and
an inflated property market _ might now fall by the wayside. What's
more, pressure on Asian governments to spend their way into
recovery could bring short-term gain at the cost of long-range
deficits and shortfalls in monies needed for bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Duhamel, chief executive of Boston-based State Street
Globe Asset Management in Hong Kong, explains: ``Asia has been hit
tremendously in the last year, so relative to the rest of the
world, it's starting to look better.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the latest rally is hardly proof that Asia's
tiger economies are about to land on their feet. To the contrary,
he said, ``I would call this `dead cat bounce.'''
</P>
<P>
   The image of a spike in Asian share values before markets settle
down to previous lows is a frightening one. But it is one supported
by the fact that the ``fundamentals'' of regional economies _ the
strength of banks, ease of raising capital, diversity of business
opportunities, levels of education _ haven't changed in three
weeks. Yet somehow, the mood has. The larger question for Asia is
whether this month's rally is sustainable, and whether it deserves
to be sustained if serious reforms have not yet been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, the Indonesian rupiah _ Asia's worst-battered
currency, which has shed 80 percent of its value against the dollar
since last summer _ recovered 43 percent as of Friday. The
long-suffering Japanese yen has picked up 14 percent. Hong Kong's
stock index _ so shaky two months ago that the local government
intervened to buy $13 billion in shares _ hit a five-month high
yesterday, up 30 percent so far this month. Tokyo's Nikkei index,
which on Oct. 8 hit a 13-year low, was up 7.2 percent this month as
of yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the International Monetary Fund, which for the last year
has meted out harsh words and tough medicine with its rescue
packages, this week declared Indonesia's decline ``bottoming out''
and praised its reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for
International Development, recently told a World Economic Forum
conference in Singapore that the worst of the Asian crisis was
probably over, but cautioned that dangers remain in North and South
America. Fear of that contagion effect is probably what spurred the
US Federal Reserve Board's surprise 0.25 percent cut in interest
rates last week, a move that boosted Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cut helped loosen credit to spur investment, encourage
the buying of shares, and halt the ``feedback effect'' from the
Asian crisis onto the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Verin, head of Asian equity trading for Credit Suisse
First Boston, said that because ``Asia was first into the problem,
people think it'll be the first out. I think that's a little
naive.'' The rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index of nearly
2,000 points in a week earlier this month was ``unbelievable,'' he
said. ``A week before you couldn't give that stock away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe Asia may be bottoming out, but Guonan Ma,
regional economist for Salomon Smith Barney, cautioned that ``it's
one thing to bottom out and another to recover. ... There is a way
to go before meaningful recovery'' _ something he and many others
forecast for the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis began last July with the collapse of
currencies, massive debt default, bank system collapse, and the
halting of growth. Duhamel says Asia has probably proceeded now to
a second stage, with the stabilization of currencies, the easing of
interest rates, and the beginning of bank bailouts. But the region
is far from the crucial third stage: a return in domestic demand, a
crash in real interest rates, a rise in inflation to encourage
consumer spending, and a rise in corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lingle, author of ``The Rise and Decline of the
Asian Century,'' warns that interest rate cuts could have an
unwanted negative effect. Artificially low interest rates allowed
free-flowing credit that fed ``bad investment choices'' and
overheated economies that precipitated the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One danger is that Asia will try to stimulate domestic demand
solely through interest-rate cuts and government spending. For a
healthy and sustainable recovery, countries would have to
restructure ailing banks and eliminate bad investment and lending
practices that brought on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of reform so far is not terribly convincing. Japan
has taken the better part of a decade since its economy slumped to
come up with a bank reform package and has yet to stimulate
domestic demand to the extent many think is necessary. Malaysia
imposed capital controls to keep out speculators rather than deal
with internal weaknesses. Cartels and nepotism remain in Indonesia.
Many trumpeted reforms to China's state sector have been put on
hold because of unemployment worries. In Thailand, not one of 353
companies identified for debt restructuring last summer has yet
sealed a deal.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Thailand _ the first to fall into crisis and the first
to genuinely embrace IMF bailout conditions _ is seen by many as
likely to be the first to emerge. Also praised is South Korea, seen
as having looked inward for ways to restructure rather than
postpone reform or blame outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL END)
</P>
<P>
   One indicator of how well an economy is recovering is occupancy
in hotels that serve business travelers. Joanne Watkins, director
of communications for Shangri-La, the largest Asia-based hotel
chain, says occupancy is sharply up in the hotel's Bangkok
property, while it is weak in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers warn that because of volatility and sudden liquidity in
Asian markets, next week could bring a reverse of the recent gains.
``As much as the downside was too extreme,'' Duhamel said, ``this
upside is too extreme also.''

ANOTHER VIEW OF PILGRIMS' LEGACY TO BE ALLOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ The main parties in the dispute over the
Thanksgiving protest in Plymouth last year _ town officials,
police, the United American Indians of New England _ agree about
the significance of the controversial settlement reached there
Monday: It is historic and potentially precedent-setting.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it bodes well for a peaceful Thanksgiving Day in the
nation's hometown this year remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Although Native Americans have protested the Thanksgiving
celebration and annual ``Pilgrim's Progress'' reenactment in
Plymouth for 28 years, the settlement marks the first time town
leaders have officially recognized an alternative interpretation of
Pilgrim behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the town has publicly said, `We invite
the Native Americans to gather in Plymouth and to march,''' said
Eleanor Beth, Plymouth town manager. ``We've acknowledged that they
have a right to tell their side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, both protesters and police were cleared of
wrongdoing in last Thanksgiving's angry confrontation, in which 25
Native Americans were arrested during their annual protest near
Plymouth Rock. Police were accused by the demonstrators of using
excessive force, including pepper spray, to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the settlement reached last week, protesters agreed
not to sue the town for injuries received. Town officials
authorized $100,000 for education about Native American history,
$20,000 to pay the United American Indians of New England's legal
fees, and $15,000 for two plaques presenting Indian views of
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, Thanksgiving has been ``a celebration of Pilgrim
mythology,'' said Moonanum Roland James, an Aquinnah Wampanoag.
``By this agreement, our story becomes part of official
Plymouthdom.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group expects a large turnout for its Day of
Mourning demonstration Nov. 26, which will be held from noon to 3
p.m., and he hopes it will be peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But patrolman Paul Boyle, a spokesman for the Plymouth Police
Brotherhood, said police feel betrayed by town officials who
negotiated the settlement _ and they doubt the demonstration will
occur without problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that it's not going to be a very good
Thanksgiving,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Police feel the settlement's concessions, monetary and
otherwise, ``give people the mistaken impression we did something
wrong,'' Boyle said. They intend to force town leaders to rescind
the settlement. ``We'll stay in their face for as long as it takes
to redeem our reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also believe town leaders are ``extremely naive'' if they
expect UAINE members to keep their word.
</P>
<P>
   Police ``want local Native Americans to tell about their
plight,'' said Boyle, explaining that they typically have been
peaceable. He described UAINE, by contrast, as a group of ``a few
Indians and a lot of other radical activists who travel around the
country supporting each other at their protests.''
</P>
<P>
   According to James, UAINE is a loose organization that he
co-leads with Mahtowin Munro, a Lakota Sioux, and they act with
advice and approval from a council of elders consisting of two
Wampanoags and one Penobscot Indian. They have no membership list
or meeting structure, but convene and act in the Indian way: by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The group was formed in 1970 by James's father, Wamsutta Frank
B. James, a Wampanoag who headed a now-defunct club called the
Federated Eastern Indian League.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the 350th anniversary of the Pilgrim arrival in the
Americas, Pilgrim descendants had planned a state dinner in
Plymouth, and invited Wamsutta James to speak there. He agreed, but
when planners saw an advance copy of the talk, they decided it was
too inflammatory, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970 speech, the elder James had written, ``The Pilgrims
had hardly explored the shores of Cape Cod for four days before
they had robbed the graves of my ancestors, and stolen their corn,
wheat and beans.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Massasoit, the great Sachem of the Wampanoag,
knew these facts, yet he and his people befriended the settlers of
Plymouth Plantation ... We welcomed you, the white man, with open
arms, little knowing that it was the beginning of the end; that
before 50 years were to pass, the Wampanoag would no longer be a
free people.''
</P>
<P>
   James refused to revise his speech and did not attend the
dinner. When word spread that his talk had been suppressed, he and
others declared Thanksgiving to be a National Day of Mourning and
gathered on Cole's Hill in Plymouth to express their grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators at that first gathering formed UAINE. In
addition to sponsoring the Day of Mourning each year since then,
group members also speak about native history at schools and
colleges, demonstrate against what they consider racist mascots for
sports teams (such as the Cleveland Indians), and support Native
Americans whom they believe are unfairly victimized by the US
government _ such as Leonard Peltier, an Ojibwa-Sioux wrongly
convicted, they say, of shooting two FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 locals attended a recent Plymouth selectmen's meeting
to protest the settlement, and about 30 police picketed outside
town hall, Beth said.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Ryan, a UAINE supporter who says he was injured in
last year's melee, said he expects as many as 3,000 demonstrators
this year _ compared to about 400 last Thanksgiving _ and that the
observance will be peaceful if police behave lawfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't project the future,'' Boyle countered. ``But we'll be
there and we'll be prepared for whatever happens, just as we were
last year.''

ASIA FELL FIRST, AND IT MAY LEAD THE RECOVERY

   HONG KONG _ Asia's economic meltdown that began last year was
the first domino in a worldwide tumble in emerging markets that
fueled fears of recession from Frankfurt to New York. But it is
also Asia that many economists now believe will lead the way to
global recovery.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 months, currencies, stocks, and growth have
tanked across this once fast-growing region, bringing unemployment,
bankruptcy, and hunger for tens of millions of people across a
continent that is home to 60 percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks _ almost as quickly as the Asian
crisis began with the crash of the Thai currency on July 2, 1997 _
confidence has started to rebound here as Asian shares and
currencies have rallied, with investors bringing money back into a

POLITICAL CURRENTS ARE SHIFTING ALONG THE OHIO RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSON, Ky. _ You could call the Ohio River the boulevard of
divided government, a crooked, meandering waterway that nature sent
west and south from what is now Pittsburgh into the Mississippi at
Cairo, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi may have won the literary battle, and Vicksburg
and New Orleans cinched its central role in the Civil War, but it
is to the Ohio that the eyes of politicians have turned in this
decade of change marked by the contradictory successes of Bill
Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The president's famous postconvention bus tour with running mate
Al Gore in 1992 followed the Ohio closely, and for reasons that
involved a great deal more than the pictures. In the end, largely
because of his ability to run strong outside the large, Northern
cities and especially in the areas near the river, Clinton took
five of the six states that touch it. Both times, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois supplied him with 79
electoral votes, and he forced George Bush and Bob Dole to spend
money to hold Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But these same states have four of the Republicans' 32
governors, and the Gingrich revolution swept through the region
four years ago, toppling incumbents and winning open House seats,
all but one of which were held in 1996. The Senate seats are among
the most closely contested in the country, with the current lineup
of seven Democrats and five Republicans almost certain to change.
Three of the Republicans' best chances for gains are in Kentucky,
Ohio, and Illinois. And the Democrats are counting on former
governor Evan Bayh to get a seat in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky _ where Wendell Ford, a Democratic senator for 24 yers,
is retiring _ is pivotal. It is also an excellent example of how
the results next week will hinge on local factors and personality,
not grand concepts of government. The current, slight edge to
replace Ford goes to GOP Representative Jim Bunning _ a mean,
ornery man, as mean and ornery as when the Hall of Fame pitcher was
throwing sidearm for the Phillies and the Tiger in the '50s and
'60s. Bunning, whose district is by the river in East Kentucky, was
near this quiet river town the other day snarling at the press and
even at questioners in his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning's campaign _ rolling in money largely because of his
big-bucks sponsor, Senator Mitch McConnell, who also runs the
national Republican Senate effort _ has flooded the state's
airwaves with ads. His opponent, Democratic Representative Scotty
Baesler, whose district is in central Kentucky, is hanging very
close but is still underfunded. Down the stretch, however, Bunning
and his ads have become the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At first, most people laughed when Bunning put up a commercial
showing Beasler wildly haranguing a get-out-the-vote revival to the
strains of Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries.'' But lately,
questions of taste as well as nativism have arisen. And those
questions became much louder over the weekend when Bunning began
attacking Baesler for supporting free trade agreements, using
Mexican and Chinese voices to make a point normally associated with
labor Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Bunning-Baesler battle is also significant because it has
put each of their House seats in serious play. Ironically, though
both contests are close, the slight edge goes to the Democrats,
though the main issue in Bunning's district appears to be the
falsely embellished military record of the Republican in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, however, is Exhibit A in the dramatic Republican
realignment that occured in House districts along the river in the
'90s. When the decade began, Republicans held but two of the 16
congressional districts that touch the Ohio. Now they have seven,
and the question is how many more they will get. What's more, five
of the nine seats the Democrats hold are in western Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, where it is still barely legal to be a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The trend began with Bunning, who won an open seat in 1986 when
a veteran Democrat, Gene Snyder, retired. In the '94 earthquake,
Republicans won this district and the one next door to the East
when another longtime Democratic stalwart, William Natcher,
announced his retirement and then died; and they got the
historically Democratic Louisville area in '96. Four more seats
went Republican in southern Ohio in '94, from Cincinnati east to
Marietta, and the Democrats got only one of them back in '96 and
are in a too-close-to-call fight to keep that one this year.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Illinois, the two river districts have been
represented by conservative Democrats. In the southwest,
Representative Jerry Costello has had to struggle to keep a lead,
but the Republicans may have a shot at the seat vacated by
Representative Glenn Poshard, a nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the heavily rural Indiana seat from which
Democratic foreign policy guru Lee Hamilton is retiring. And the
Democrats are at best 50-50 in trying again to unseat '94 freshman
John Hostettler just across the river from here, who runs to the
right of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the muddled, close national picture, the Republicans
(best case) could net two seats more out of the region and become
the River Majority; or, somewhat less likely, the Democrats (best
case) could net two themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, Clinton carried fully 13 of these 16
districts. The economy that worked for him is less of a factor
today. Local issues and personalities are what matters, along with
the spread of suburbs and the rapid rise of the right along the
river.

   I typed the words ``pet peeve'' in last week's column, I
realized that this  &UR;  &LR; overworked phrase has become one of mine.
There was no quick way around it, though, so I gritted my teeth and
wrote on. And a few days later, I got an e-mail response from
reader Jim Langell that made my stylistic sacrifice worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When were all the peeves domesticated?'' he asked. ``They are
always `pets.' Are there no peeves running wild or at least kept
outside with the rest of the livestock?''
</P>
<P>
   He probably didn't expect an answer, but in fact there is one:
The peeve is an American breed, created here around the turn of the
century by ``back formation'' from the much older peevish
(``querulous, irritable; exhibiting petty vexation''). Almost
immediately, people made pets of their favorite peeves; a 1919
jargon dictionary defines pet peeve as ``the thing that provokes
you the most.''
</P>
<P>
   (Both halves of the phrase, as it happens, sneaked into the
language by a secret route: ``derivation unknown,'' says the OED of
both pet and peevish. The same is true of pet in the sense of
``huff'' _ ``She went back to the house in a pet'' _ though it
seems to be unrelated to the animal pet.)
</P>
<P>
   To earn its status, of course,the pet peeve has to hang around
and bother its owner, like a cat that can't decide whether it wants
to come in or go out. (The cat is ``it'' because it's a
hypothetical, nameless cat; Spike or Rose, real cats of my
acquaintance, would be called ``who,'' just like people.) Passing
peeves are just moments of irritation; the pet ones need to be
cosseted and fed in order to live a long and fruitfully annoying
life.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why would anyone who enjoys language want to
keep such a pet? You may be a cat person or a dog person or a bird
person, but does anyone want to be thought of as a peeve person _
someone who walks this temperamental pet around town, letting it
bore and bother everyone it meets?
</P>
<P>
   Editors can't help themselves, of course; Language peevishness
is an occupational hazard. In hopes of achieving consistency,
newspapers and book publishers adopt a ``house style'' _ ruling on
whether it's ambience or ambiance or there's a hyphen in babysitter
_ and sometimes such arbitrary choices settle into institutional
habits and finally into ``rules,'' however dubious their origins.
(One widespread newsroom rule _ a ban on using over to mean more
than _ began as the unexplained dictum of a 19th-century newspaper
editor. Many others, like the rules against splitting infinitives
and ending sentences with prepositions, were invented by early
usage arbiters who thought that maybe, if they legislated carefully
and thoroughly, they could tidy up English into something more neat
and Latinate.)
</P>
<P>
   But for the ordinary citizen, too much awareness of such things
can be a burden. A peeve is a critter that snaps and scratches, not
something warm and furry to curl up with. Renaming it is not good
enough: What we need to do is reduce the peeve population, and
spend our time with more rewarding companions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one suggestion: Many a pet peeve can be defanged by close
study of its origins. Go to the library and check out the past of
your most treasured language peeves. Some, you will find, are not
really ``wrong'' at all, or have become standard English since you
went to school.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have like what you learn: Nobody will force you to use
``hopefully'' as a sentence adverb, any more than you have to get
your nose pierced. But the more history you learn, the less you're
likely to feel that the end is near, that our doom is come upon us,
languagewise. Yes, there are real mistakes, and it's OK to notice
them, but they're just mistakes, like wearing unmatched socks _
they're not proof that civilization is in decline. Some of them
will one day be acceptable, even fashionable (and maybe you will
get your nose pierced); others will die in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Most language peeves, though, turn out to be less absolutely
``wrong'' _ and far more interesting _ than their owners suspect.
Find out why try and find it is arguably as respectable as try to!
Explore the surprising history of dived and dove! A collection of
former peeves, now well groomed and obedient, will be much more
entertaining than they were as mere vexations.
</P>
<P>
   This new and improved animal deserves a new, more cheerful name,
as well. Until something better comes along, I'm calling it the pet
un-peeve _ or PUP, for short. Who wouldn't trade those tired old
peeves for some linguistic puppy love?

EMBRACING THE GHOSTS OF SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a nation so in love with its history, America has never
quite known what to do about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a dozen or so decades since the ``peculiar
institution'' bent and nearly broke the back of this nation, nearly
136 years since hundreds of thousands of blacks tasted the freedom
denied them by the architects of American independence nearly 90
years before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, slavery remains America's sorrow song, its melancholy
refrain a haunting echo in our relentless racial discord. It is a
wound still raw and tender, a scar that cannot fade if only because
many Americans, both black and white, have chosen to ignore it
rather than tend to its bitter, painful core.
</P>
<P>
   All the slaves are dead, and we do not have their voices to
remind us of their lives before emancipation. Yet during the past
year, whether by design or coincidence, several high-profile films,
books, and television programs have offered varied examinations of
slavery. Among the notables are the long-awaited screen adaptation
of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``Beloved,'' and
the six-hour PBS documentary, ``Africans in America: America's
Journey Through Slavery,'' which concluded last week. Also on PBS
and concluding yesterday was Masterpiece Theatre's two-part ``A
Respectable Trade,'' which dramatized England's role in the
trans-Atlantic slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Not since ``Roots'' _ the award-winning television miniseries,
and the Alex Haley bestseller on which it was based _ made Kunta
Kinte a household name in 1977 has slavery so permeated the
national consciousness through popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is fortuitous the way these things happen, but I
think there's probably something larger going on,'' said Ira
Berlin, a history professor at the University of Maryland and one
of the nation's foremost scholars on slavery. Berlin has two
worthwhile books released in recent weeks: ``Many Thousands Gone,''
a history of the first two centuries of slavery in North America,
and ``Remembering Slavery,'' in which he, along with Marc Favreau
and Steven F. Miller, compiled interviews conducted in the 1930s
and 1940s with former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably has to do with an attempt to wrestle with the
question of race, and an understanding that somehow, if you're
going to come to terms with race, you've got to address slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   During the civil rights movement of the 1960s and early 1970s,
attention was refocused on slave life and antebellum America,
especially through the works of scholars such as John W.
Blassingame. Whereas heightened black consciousness nudged the
issue toward the forefront then, some believe events such as the
Rodney King beating in 1991, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the O.J.
Simpson trial, and, earlier this year, the racially motivated
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man in Jasper, Texas,
served to highlight the chasm between the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is a pervasive and perennial question, and it's not
something we've dealt with particularly well,'' Berlin said. ``So,
we see these periods when people try to grapple with it, and one of
the outcroppings of that attempt to address it is an attempt to
understand something about its origins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved,'' one of the year's most anticipated films, stars
Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover as former slaves trying to make a
life in post-Civil War Ohio, but still in the thrall of slavery's
lingering horrors. It's the second major film in less than a year
to deal with slavery. In December, Steven Spielberg unveiled
``Amistad,'' his retelling of an 1839 slave-ship revolt. That film
is available on video and pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping into theaters on the same day as ``Beloved'' but with
far less fanfare was ``Shadrach.'' John Franklin Sawyer plays
Shadrach, a 99-year-old former slave who returns to the Virginia
plantation of his birth to die, in the film, which stars Harvey
Keitel and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary literature is also part of the move toward
analyzing slavery and its legacy. ``Shadrach'' is based on a short
story by William Styron, who also wrote ``The Confessions of Nat
Turner.'' One of the most acclaimed books of the year is Russell
Banks's ``Cloudsplitter,'' a historical novel about the life of
John Brown, the Connecticut-born abolitionist and martyr who
believed himself an instrument of the Lord whose mission was to
eradicate slavery by any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's nonfiction finalists for the National Book
Award are ``Slaves in the Family,'' Edward Ball's provocative
dissection of his own family's history as slave owners, and the
descendants of slaves he now counts among his kin; and Henry
Mayer's ``All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of
American Slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all of the historical explorations are so
serious-minded or reverent. Perhaps the most controversial (not to
mention unfunny) TV shows of the new season is ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a UPN entry featuring the life of an
African-English butler at the White House, which is occupied by a
libidinous Abraham Lincoln. The NAACP has accused the program of
trivializing slavery for cheap laughs. UPN has temporarily pulled
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' until after the November sweeps. A network
spokesman said the show has not been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The writers and producers of ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer'' may have viewed comedy as a spoonful of sugar to help
the bitter medicine of slavery go down. Wrongheaded, perhaps, but
it speaks to the difficulty many have in dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a language to talk about slavery. It's a subject
of enormous reticence; people are afraid they're going to embarrass
themselves, they're afraid they're going to reveal something about
themselves, whether it's ignorance or anger or stupidity, or
something which will be construed as racist,'' Berlin said. ``It's
a very difficult subject for people, and that they're groping at
what is a very difficult and sensitive subject is a probably a
healthy sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Turner, author and director of African-American and
African studies at the University of California at Davis, said
attention to slavery is evidence of ``people trying to grasp these
issues, and to grasp this episode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah sounds so sincere when she talks about wanting audiences
to understand the horrors of slavery, and what it could drive a
woman to do,'' she said. ``People are eager to present that; now
whether audiences are yet ready to embrace it is another
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believed ``Amistad'' would be a critical and commercial hit
for Speilberg on the level of his 1993 Holocaust opus,
``Schindler's List.'' The positive reviews were there, but the
audiences were not. For its opening last week, ``Beloved'' came in
fifth, behind such unchallenging fare as ``Practical Magic,'' and
``Bride of Chucky.'' ``Beloved'' was showing in fewer theaters and
had a higher per-screen average, but most expected the film to
garner more than the $8.1 million it did. Last weekend, the film
dropped to seventh, and earned $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of American culture right now across the board moves
away from serious issues,'' Turner said, ``and race and slavery are
serious issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating any presentation of slavery, whether as a book or
film, are the extreme feelings of discomfort they raise for both
whites and African-Americans. Some blacks shy away from films
detailing their oppression and victimization, while some whites
shun movies that lay blame for this nation's racial problems on
their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they know what they're going to see when they see
a movie about slavery,'' said Turner, who also taught at the
University of Massachusetts-Boston. ``Whites have often told me
they feel like when the subject of slavery comes up, there's an
implicit blame of them, that they're somehow connected to the
enslavers of the 19th century, and that makes them feel bad. So,
they don't read the books and they don't go to the movies. ``You
can watch a movie like `Schindler's List' and not have to ever
worry about being associated with being a Nazi,'' she said.
``Whereas some people might feel if you are white, you can't go to
a movie like `Amistad' and not be associated with the institution
of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes, Berlin said, have reflected a kind of ``moral or
historical immaturity.'' Yet the current trend may portend a long
overdue ``willingness to talk about things which have been denied
or are unspeakable,'' although the result of such remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it'll end up doing anything in a positive way;
it may, in fact, make things worse,'' Berlin said. ``It cuts all
kinds of ways with people being embarrassed by slavery, being
shamed by slavery, being afraid that someone is going to present
them with a kind of moral bill for this.''

A CALL TO ACTION FOR RETIREES , FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (also moving under l coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jimmy Carter was 56 when he lost his job, and with a
life expectancy of another quarter-century, he was suddenly
confronted with a vexing question: What to do with the rest of my
life?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought about retirement much. It's hard to have
exalting ambition after leaving the White House,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Plains, Ga., a farming hamlet with ``600
neighbors,'' Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, ``went through a
careful analysis about what we had learned, what our interests
were. We considered our frustrated dreams from earlier in life, and
we began to explore different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, of course, spent the next 18 years as one of the most
vigorous former presidents in history, mediating international
conflicts, monitoring elections, channeling aid to the Third World,
building homes for Habitat for Humanity, teaching, and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Now his 13th book, ``The Virtues of Aging,'' is just out. Part
of the Library of Contemporary Thought series by the Ballantine
Publishing Group, it is a call for older people to turn their
retirement years to useful purpose. Carter expanded on the theme in
an interview yesterday as he set out on a book-signing tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging,'' Carter said, rebuts the suggestion by
former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm that the elderly should make way
for younger generations and not try to extend their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slouching into retirement, Carter says those who are
preparing to leave the work force should ask themselves the same
sort of questions he and his wife asked themselves in the winter of
1980. ``Do you still have an interest in life? Do you still
exercise? Do you still grow a garden? Do you still ride a bike? Do
you still go bowling? Do you still read books?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any recommendations for President Clinton, who
will be only 54 if he completes his term, Carter said: ``I think
President Clinton should do whatever he chooses. He's a lawyer. I'm
not. He was a professor at the University of Arkansas when I first
met him. I'm in my 16th year as a professor, teaching six hours a
month. He could be a full-time professor. He's eloquent and
intelligent; he could write books. He might want to run a
foundation to explore different interests he didn't complete as
president. He and his wife, together, could have an unlimited
opportunity to do challenging things.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Carter advises voluntarism and an active
schedule. As he writes in the book, ``Why not expand our sights
instead of restricting our lives and accepting the lowest common
denominator of a dormant existence?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother, known as ``Miss Lillian,'' dramatized this
approach by joining the Peace Corps when she was 68 and maintaining
a busy lifestyle until her death at 85.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is 74, yet looks as fit as he did when he pitched for a
softball team that beat up on a squad of reporters almost every
afternoon during that magical summer of 1976 he captured the
Democratic nomination and went on to win the White House. He is
accomplished at fly-fishing and learned to ski when he was 60. He
and his wife play tennis and jog regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to retire, the former president is turning to a new
intellectual pursuit, a novel set during the Revolutionary War.
``It starts off in Philadelphia, then moves to North Carolina and
then to Georgia,'' he says. ``The main character is located 30
miles west of Augusta where, coincidentally, my ancestors lived.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure historical accuracy, Carter is reading extensively
about the Revolution. ``It puts me back in college,'' he says. ``I
went back to college, in fact, to learn to write poetry as an
off-campus student'' a few years ago. ``I was assigned books to
study. I'm doing the same thing now with creative writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is not ready to reveal the book's title, but believes he
will become the first president to produce a novel.
</P>
<P>
   His 71-year-old wife, a partner in many of his activities,
collaborated with him on one book, ``Everything to Gain: Making the
Most of the Rest of Your Life.'' Carter vows he will never do that
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We undertook the book with full anticipation that it would
bring us together. But, seriously, it was the closest we came to
separating,'' he says, remembering the project with a frown. ``When
you have two strong-willed people, you can agree on 98 percent, but
the other 2 percent becomes paramount. Our memories were different.
I had vivid memories of our first date; her recollection was quite
different. It got to where we couldn't communicate except by
writing ugly notes back and forth on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Their editor, Peter Osnos, finally brokered the disagreement by
deciding whose versions of their life together would wind up in the
book. ``Some paragraphs have an `R' by them, others have a `J',''
Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging'' is pure Jimmy. With its quaint
aphorisms and upbeat philosophy, it is a testament to the values of
work, love, and religious faith and reminiscent of the little
campaign book that launched his presidential campaign, ``Why Not
the Best?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he approaches the prospect of failing health and the
inevitability of death, Carter shows no signs of slowing down and
says he has no sense of depression. The oldest of four children, he
has outlived his siblings, who all died from pancreatic cancer.
``That was the most negative part of my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Camp David Treaty, signed 20 years ago, is his
legacy, Carter prefers to talk about his accomplishments as an
older man. ``We've been remarkably gratified by life in Plains. In
July, Rosie and I led the effort to bring the black and white
communities together by building two swimming pools, a bathhouse, a
basketball court, and a recreation center. It was inundated with
children, white, black and Mexican kids,'' he said, and his face
crinkled with his famous smile, still toothy after all these years.

A DEPRESSING DIAGNOSIS FOR THE NEWS MEDIA

   WHAT THE PEOPLE KNOW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freedom and the Press &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Reeves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University Press, 128 pp., $19.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, nearly everyone from Washington Post media
critic Howard Kurtz to former U.S. News &AMP; World Report editor James
Fallows has written a book offering a foul-smelling tour of the
journalistic sausage factory, revealing how gossip, spin, and
speculation have become crucial ingredients of the news. To the
swelling ranks of the journalism Jeremiahs, add the name of Richard
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, a former New York Timesman and noted columnist, author,
and academic, is the latest to wax bearish on the news media in
``What the People Know: Freedom and the Press,'' a book based on a
lecture Reeves delivered at the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, reading ``What the People Know'' is a little like
going to your doctor and listening to a half-hour description of
complicated diagnoses before hearing the fateful words: ``You've
got six months to live.'' There is no mistaking Reeves's pessimism
throughout the book, but one can always turn straight to his last
chapter to learn the prognosis. ``Were it a person, journalism
would be diagnosed as depressed,'' he writes. ``Changes in
technology and ownership, declining public interest, low morale
among reporters losing faith in their own journals and broadcasts,
and impaired public trust seem to have put the press on the wrong
side of history, at least for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``What the People Know'' avoids the perils of
droning pendantry. It is fast-moving and full of history and
anecdotes. (Once in a while, the anecdotes are less than
revelatory, as in a pointless recollection by the author of
badgering a Newark cop about a cat in a tree during his cub
reporter days.)
</P>
<P>
   Reeves wisely spends much of his energy focusing on the kind of
corporate corruption of journalism that has not really permeated
the consciousness of an American public willing to believe every
conspiracy theory about the media except the most dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American press is tougher on government than on business
for obvious reasons that should be regularly repeated,'' he notes.
``Corporations own newspapers and television stations, government
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   The book skewers Los Angeles Times publisher and Times Mirror
CEO Mark Willes, the former General Mills executive who came to be
called ``The Cereal Killer'' as he shuttered papers, slashed jobs,
and knocked down the wall between business and editorial functions
while carving out a reputation as the savior of the Times-Mirror
stock price. By tempering some of his more flammable
pronouncements, Willes has learned how to soften the tough press
coverage that greeted his ascension to publisher last year. But he
gets no such reprieve from Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   To push his point, the author compiles a list of top editors _
The Philadelphia Inquirer's Eugene Roberts, Bill Kovach of the
Atlanta Journal and Constitution, and Shelby Coffee III of The Los
Angeles Times _ who have ``fallen or been pushed out, basically for
insubordination in the face of fiscal managers.'' In fact, Reeves
gets so disconsolate that he wonders whether journalism won't
ultimately be forced to find a safe haven from the bean counters in
the world of nonprofit foundations and educational institutions, a
scenario so gloomy even he tends to discount it.
</P>
<P>
   The book's next most important argument is that journalism's
post-Watergate assault on government came with a price. ``We took
down politicians and politics, without pausing to think that maybe
we would go down with them, like mating eagles falling from the sky
with their claws locked together,'' Reeves writes. And now (to vary
the avian imagery) the chickens have come home to roost. Having
labored tirelessly to convince citizens that Washington is
incompetent and irrelevant, journalists seem stunned that the
country isn't nearly as fixated on an inside-the-Beltway sex
scandal as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Considerably less compelling is Reeves's attention to a series
of oft-heard laments about modern journalism: the turning of
reporters into celebrities; the degradation of television news; and
the journalistic shortcuts encouraged by the sheer speed of modern
media technology.
</P>
<P>
   And what's most depressing about the book are Reeves's attempts
to prescribe relief for the news business. ``A little less polling
and `Gotcha!' and a little more judgment and perspective.'' ``Be
common scolds.'' (He even says ``It's a dirty job but somebody has
to do it.'')
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like a halftime pep talk given by the coach of a
football team losing by four touchdowns. Maybe journalism really is
in the dire straits that Reeves suggests it is.

neighbors,'' Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, ``went through a
careful analysis about what we had learned, what our interests
were. We considered our frustrated dreams from earlier in life, and
we began to explore different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, of course, spent the next 18 years as one of the most
vigorous former presidents in history, mediating international
conflicts, monitoring elections, channeling aid to the Third World,
building homes for Habitat for Humanity, teaching, and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Now his 13th book, ``The Virtues of Aging,'' is just out. Part
of the Library of Contemporary Thought series by the Ballantine
Publishing Group, it is a call for older people to turn their
retirement years to useful purpose. Carter expanded on the theme in
an interview yesterday as he set out on a book-signing tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging,'' Carter said, rebuts the suggestion by
former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm that the elderly should make way
for younger generations and not try to extend their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slouching into retirement, Carter says those who are
preparing to leave the work force should ask themselves the same
sort of questions he and his wife asked themselves in the winter of
1980. ``Do you still have an interest in life? Do you still
exercise? Do you still grow a garden? Do you still ride a bike? Do
you still go bowling? Do you still read books?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any recommendations for President Clinton, who
will be only 54 if he completes his term, Carter said: ``I think
President Clinton should do whatever he chooses. He's a lawyer. I'm
not. He was a professor at the University of Arkansas when I first
met him. I'm in my 16th year as a professor, teaching six hours a
month. He could be a full-time professor. He's eloquent and
intelligent; he could write books. He might want to run a
foundation to explore different interests he didn't complete as
president. He and his wife, together, could have an unlimited
opportunity to do challenging things.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Carter advises voluntarism and an active
schedule. As he writes in the book, ``Why not expand our sights
instead of restricting our lives and accepting the lowest common
denominator of a dormant existence?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother, known as ``Miss Lillian,'' dramatized this
approach by joining the Peace Corps when she was 68 and maintaining
a busy lifestyle until her death at 85.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is 74, yet looks as fit as he did when he pitched for a
softball team that beat up on a squad of reporters almost every
afternoon during that magical summer of 1976 he captured the
Democratic nomination and went on to win the White House. He is
accomplished at fly-fishing and learned to ski when he was 60. He
and his wife play tennis and jog regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to retire, the former president is turning to a new
intellectual pursuit, a novel set during the Revolutionary War.
``It starts off in Philadelphia, then moves to North Carolina and
then to Georgia,'' he says. ``The main character is located 30
miles west of Augusta where, coincidentally, my ancestors lived.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure historical accuracy, Carter is reading extensively
about the Revolution. ``It puts me back in college,'' he says. ``I
went back to college, in fact, to learn to write poetry as an
off-campus student'' a few years ago. ``I was assigned books to
study. I'm doing the same thing now with creative writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is not ready to reveal the book's title, but believes he
will become the first president to produce a novel.
</P>
<P>
   His 71-year-old wife, a partner in many of his activities,
collaborated with him on one book, ``Everything to Gain: Making the
Most of the Rest of Your Life.'' Carter vows he will never do that
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We undertook the book with full anticipation that it would
bring us together. But, seriously, it was the closest we came to
separating,'' he says, remembering the project with a frown. ``When
you have two strong-willed people, you can agree on 98 percent, but
the other 2 percent becomes paramount. Our memories were different.
I had vivid memories of our first date; her recollection was quite
different. It got to where we couldn't communicate except by
writing ugly notes back and forth on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Their editor, Peter Osnos, finally brokered the disagreement by
deciding whose versions of their life together would wind up in the
book. ``Some paragraphs have an `R' by them, others have a `J',''
Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virtues of Aging'' is pure Jimmy. With its quaint
aphorisms and upbeat philosophy, it is a testament to the values of
work, love, and religious faith and reminiscent of the little
campaign book that launched his presidential campaign, ``Why Not
the Best?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he approaches the prospect of failing health and the
inevitability of death, Carter shows no signs of slowing down and
says he has no sense of depression. The oldest of four children, he
has outlived his siblings, who all died from pancreatic cancer.
``That was the most negative part of my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Camp David Treaty, signed 20 years ago, is his
legacy, Carter prefers to talk about his accomplishments as an
older man. ``We've been remarkably gratified by life in Plains. In
July, Rosie and I led the effort to bring the black and white
communities together by building two swimming pools, a bathhouse, a
basketball court, and a recreation center. It was inundated with
children, white, black and Mexican kids,'' he said, and his face
crinkled with his famous smile, still toothy after all these years.

GOP SENATE CANDIDATE SAYS HE'LL PUSH FOR GAY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Matt Fong, who donated $50,000 to an
anti-homosexual group this year, has told gay Republicans that if
he is elected to the U.S. Senate, he would work to pass a wide
range of gay-rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to cool the controversy over his donation to the
Traditional Values Coalition, Fong vowed Monday to support a list
of federal gay-rights laws, including measures to protect gays from
job discrimination and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The promise, made in writing, persuaded the Log Cabin Club not
to withdraw its endorsement of Fong, who is in a tight race with
the incumbent Democrat, Barbara Boxer. The Log Cabin Club is a
national group of Republicans who are gay.
</P>
<P>
   Fong's effort came as Boxer ratcheted up her criticism of the
donation, which she linked to the recent beating death of a
homosexual student in Wyoming and the shooting death of an abortion
doctor in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hate group. You write a check to a hate group, you
are making a statement,'' Boxer told a news conference Monday night
with National Organization for Women President Patricia Ireland and
other women leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner reported Sunday that Fong had donated
$50,000 in campaign funds to the Orange County-based Traditional
Values Coalition, which is headed by the Rev. Lou Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon is a conservative Presbyterian minister who has likened
abortion to murder and once advocated quarantining people with AIDS
in ``cities of refuge'' to prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon also spearheaded a campaign in the Senate to scuttle the
nomination of James Hormel, a gay philanthropist from San
Francisco, as ambassador to Luxembourg. Sheldon argued Hormel's
appointment would advance what he styles as an immoral ``homosexual
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans privately had been lobbying the Log Cabin Club
to renounce Fong for the donation to Sheldon, who said he had used
it to fund a poll on a proposed state ban on gay marriages. But
after extracting the written commitment from Fong, the group
decided to stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are opposed to everything Lou Sheldon and the Traditional
Values Coalition stand for,'' Richard Tafel, executive director of
the Log Cabin Club, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the Republican Senate candidate had ``as good
or better position on gay and AIDS issues'' than many Democratic
candidates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the Democrats want to paint Matt Fong as an
extremist, he clearly is not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all gay Republicans went along. Monday, the San Francisco
chapter of the Log Cabin Club yanked its endorsement of Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter President Mike German said members were ``very much
concerned about his closeness to Rev. Lou Sheldon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland contrasted Fong's contribution to Sheldon's
anti-abortion group with Boxer's support for abortion rights.
Ireland said the donation was ``taking the mask off'' of Fong's
claim to be moderate on abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer went further, saying groups such as Sheldon's played a
role in the death of Matthew Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten and left to die in a presumed hate crime in Wyoming, and the
sniper killing last week of Barnett Slepian, an abortion doctor in
Amherst, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call abortion murder, as Mr. Sheldon has done, that
sends a signal,'' Boxer said. ``When you are saying people with the
AIDS virus should be quarantined and separated from the rest of
humanity, you are sending a signal. To give $50,000 to that group
for any reason is simply wrong and is encouraging that group to
stay in business and continue to publicize their hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Fong said he had no regrets about donating the
money to Sheldon's organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Lou is a friend,'' Fong said. ``We were working on
the Defense of Marriage Act initiative that he was contemplating.
It is an act that was supported in principle by President Clinton.
I support the defense of a traditional marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong accused Boxer of trying to distort his position on
abortion, and sought to portray her as an extremist for voting
against a bill to ban a type of late-term procedure that abortion
foes call partial-birth abortion.

CAPE COD OPENS ITS DOORS FOR TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to be a weekend to remember on Cape Cod _ an open
house like none before. Inns, bed-and-breakfasts, museum homes, and
private homes from Falmouth to Truro will be on view.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage Cape Cod House Tour will be held Nov. 6-8 and will
include 50 properties located throughout the Cape peninsula.
Several sites will have costumed hosts welcoming visitors, and
members of local historical societies talking about the historic
inhabitants and architecture. High school and college students will
be docents at each site.
</P>
<P>
   One $20 ticket is good for admission to all properties, and good
throughout the weekend. There's no rush _ take your time and savor
Cape Cod history. The tour runs from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. each day.
</P>
<P>
   In Chatham, one stop is at the Atwood House Museum, built by a
sea captain in 1752 and held by five generations on the family. The
Beechcroft Inn was built in 1828 as the Universalist Society's
Brewster church. After the congregation moved into a larger
meetinghouse (now the Brewster General Store), the Greek
Revival-style building was moved to its present location and
converted into an inn with 10 rooms, a dining room, a library, and
a fireside pub. Celeste and Bob Hunt are your hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Every stop is a treasure, providing revealing glimpses into Cape
Cod life from the past and the present. If you've never stayed in
an inn on the Cape, this is the time to discover what you've been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Wedgewood Inn, a magnificent property on Route 6A
in Yarmouth Port. The building has Greek Revival and Federal
touches and was built around 1812. In 1983, the entire structure
was elegantly refurbished by the owners. Milt and Gerri Graham are
the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   In Falmouth, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Bidwell will have their home
open for visits. The house features a grand spiral staircase, and a
round Cape Cod cellar under with a secret pantry stairway entrance.
After the visit, walk through Dean's Woods in the rear and view the
garden in the shape of Cape Cod, and before passing through the old
cemetery, do ask Mr. Bidwell to tell you his ghost story.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still 46 more story-filled places to stop by.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for this first regional tour are available now and on
the days of the open house at the Dan'l Webster Inn, Sandwich; The
Wayside Inn, Chatham; Ocean Edge Resort, Brewster; The Over Look
Inn, Eastham; the Augustus Snow House, Harwich; Puritan Clothing
stores throughout the Cape; and at the chambers of commerce in
Falmouth, Hyannis, Yarmouth, and the Cape Cod Chamber at Routes 6
and 132 in Hyannis (call 508-362-3225). Program books will be
available at these locations.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage Cape Cod Historic House Tour benefits Heritage Cape
Cod, established to promote a year-round appreciation of the
history, art, architecture, and environment of the Cape. Heritage
Cape Cod (508-888-1233) is a sponsor of the Cape's Heritage Week in
June, Maritime Week in May, and other events.

Halloween turns death into something to be feared and avoided, the
Mexicans embrace death by highlighting its place in everyday life.

A NEW TOUCH OF CLASS FOR LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year or so a new marvel materializes on the Las Vegas
Strip: a volcano, a pirate ship, a medieval castle, an Egyptian
pyramid, and even the entire city of New York, condensed into a
single casino. But this year's marvel adds a touch of class, Las
Vegas style, to the sparkling Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Bellagio is a $1.6 billion, 36-story megaresort
with a lot more than slot machines (although it does have 2,700 of
them) and gaming tables (although it does have 139). Here are some
of the things you'll find:
</P>
<P>
   _A $300 million collection of art, including paintings by
Gauguin, Mattisse, van Gogh, Cezanne, Warhol, and Sinatra (yes,
that Sinatra).
</P>
<P>
   _A 90,000-square-foot, glassed-in garden, whose displays will
change monthly and reflect the seasons. Some 111 horticulturists
will tend to the plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   _An 8 1/2-acre lake, meant to resemble Italy's Lake Como. But
Lake Como never had more than 1,000 fountains shooting water
designs up to 200 feet high to musical accompaniment. The
``shoreline'' features Tuscan villas with red-tiled roofs and comes
complete with a Florentine bridge.
</P>
<P>
   _A total of 120 acres, including the lake, gardens, fountains,
pools, and lushly landscaped grounds. Bellagio stands on the site
of the old Dunes resort.
</P>
<P>
   _A $70 million Cirque du Soleil production called ``O'' that
includes 68 divers, contortionists, gymnasts, and swimmers. A
1.5-million-gallon water tank is raised and lowered, allowing acts
to perform above, on, or below the water.
</P>
<P>
   _A total of 3,000 rooms, including 400 suites. Listed prices
range from $159 to $1,150, depending upon room or suite size, day
of the week, and season.
</P>
<P>
   _Twenty-three shops, 16 restaurants, and two wedding chapels.
</P>
<P>
   _A total of 8,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the resort is Stephen A. Wynn, who is closely
associated with transforming the slightly sinister image of the old
Las Vegas into something a whole lot cheerier. For more information

BEST JUVENILE CLASSICS HAVE LIFELONG APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name-dropping is a pastime for me. Quite by accident I have
rubbed shoulders with various historical Somebodies when they were
still nobodies, usually at very early ages; and by exploiting my
own memory, I exploit those long-ago associations, possibly
inflating them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my colleagues are impressed that I played tennis with
Richard Gonzales after the Christmas that brought him his first
racquet (the way it was spelled then) as the present for which his
mother paid one dollar. That was quite a few years before he
became, as Pancho Gonzales, national singles champion many times
over.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more intrigued that I double-dated with James Dean
when we were teen-agers. Or that in Army service during the Korean
War, I took basic training at Ford Ord with Clint Eastwood. And
other examples, all because I was in a certain place at a certain
time and because I possess a memory that gets me overrated for
intelligence and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't believe I've told anyone about my brief acquaintance
with Derek Bok, or have written about it. Many years before he
became president of Harvard University, Derek and I were pupils in
Mr. Donley's eighth-grade literature class at Ralph Waldo Emerson
Junior High in west Los Angeles. I was the better basketball
player, but Derek was smarter _ he already had intelligence and
intellect in abundance _ and our daily classroom hour became a kind
of duologue between Derek and Mr. Donley.
</P>
<P>
   There was the occasion when Mr. Donley was telling us about
Rudyard Kipling and remarked that ``The Light That Failed'' was
Kipling's only novel. Whereupon I raised my hand and asked, ``What
about `Captains Courageous'? Whereupon Derek Bok, without raising
his hand to be recognized, sneered that ```Captains Courageous' is
a juvenile.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew then that I was a juvenile and that Derek was one also,
but I had not known that a book could be a juvenile. Nor had I made
any distinction between ``Captains Courageous'' and some of the
``adult'' novels I was reading about that time _ George Sessions
Perry's ``Hold Autumn in Your Hand''; Daphne du Maurier's ``Hungry
Hill''; and Henry Bellaman's ``Kings Row,'' which was breathlessly
passed around in eighth grade as our literary introduction to real
sex.
</P>
<P>
   The point I wish to make is that the appeal of ``young adult''
literature is not necessarily restricted to children and
teen-agers. I believe I was 11, possibly 12, when I read ``Captains
Courageous,'' a super adventure (for myself) in which I became
Harvey, the hard-to-control protagonist, slightly older than myself
and soon to be tamed by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, when I had a 12-year-old son of my own, I
bought a ``Captains Courageous'' paperback for him to read. I don't
believe he ever did, but I reread it with genuine pleasure,
although no longer fortified by the identification factor. It
prodded me to read ``Kim'' _ another Kipling ``juvenile'' _ and
enjoyment was not diminished by my seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Louis Stevenson, too. ``Treasure Island'' and
``Kidnapped'' are targeted for young readers, perhaps boys
specifically, but readers of any age _ and any sex _ may be
captivated. For full-bodied characterization, Stevenson overshadows
even Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the seafaring ``Captains Courageous'': In America today
it seems better known as the movie that brought Spencer Tracy his
first Oscar. In today's Academy Award politics, Tracy's role of
Portuguese seaman Manuel would be graded as a supporting chore; and
protagonist Harvey was enacted by Freddie Bartholomew, who had
quite a run of literature's boy heroes _ as David Copperfield, as
Jack of ``The Swiss Family Robinson'' and as David Balfour in
``Kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1937 movie holds up as a movie, and the century-old
``Captains Courageous'' holds up beautifully as a ``novel,'' with
or without juvenile designation.

MISTER ROGERS'S OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD, BY THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATTAPOISETT, Mass. _ Buzzards Bay seems a logical location for
salty immersion and the ritual last swim of formerly summer. Since
the day is swathed in a chilling, morose gray, the rumpled sea an
oily green and the dank, deserted beach no place for blanket bingo
_ how could anybody resist?
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. As Halloween approaches, aren't buzzards the ominous
birds of choice? Alas, none of the bay's namesakes appears out of
the mist and drizzle to complete the mournful tableau, and wish us
splashers ill. Not even a funereal vulture or a lugubrious raven.
Too bad. Their loss. We'd brought gourmet bird seed for them from
the Mattapoisett bird-lovers shop called Wings &AMP; Things.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Just down the street are ghouls, goblins, and
wraiths aplenty at Mattapoisett's cherished Haunted House, an eerie
place that Stephen King would give a high approval rating. Cobwebs,
skeletons, witches, and other scary creatures abound on the
property of Joan and Paul Garib, whose fright delight of a frame
house has become a seasonal tradition. Nothing supernatural about
the Garibs, who appear friendly and welcoming, with no hint of
Addams family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come to expect this, and we like to do it,'' he
says. ``They come to the door to ask about the decorations, and
thank us for the scene, just as you have.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Aurelio, cautions, ``Don't tell them we went swimming
today or they'll think we're the ones into weirdness.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a word. Besides, Terry Aufranc, a local, is nudging us
toward the car with, ``Come on, it's time for breakfast at
Margaret's'' in neighboring Fairhaven. Don't want to get shut out.
It can get very crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. Lesley Bouchay in Margaret's kitchen
relentlessly turns out yummy crepe-thin Norwegian pancakes with
lingon berries, home fries, and Portuguese sausage. At one table,
Tom Kramer, a husky football player for Milton Academy, hopes the
pancakes come by the bushel, and says their fame has wafted as far
as his hometown, Hong Kong. Katie Smith, a waitress, says that's
nice, but he better not try paying in Chinese money.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasingly filled, Terry suggests a post-meal stroll around
``the original Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood,'' as she calls it. ``I
don't know if it's as famous as the pancakes _ or Channel 2's
Mister Rogers _ but it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   She's absolutely right. The Rogers in question was Henry
Huttleston Rogers, a Fairhaven boy who made good in a very big way
with Standard Oil around the turn of the century. His impressive
legacy, solidly imposing in brick and stone, is a couple of blocks
worth of striking architecture at the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   It's puzzlement at first sight. What's a Gothic cathedral doing
here anyway? Buttresses flying in Fairhaven? Gargoyles climbing a
soaring tower from which you can spy Martha's Vineyard?
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's nothing quite like it in America,'' says
Paul Almedia, the caretaker of this beguiling pile of cloudy
granite and limestone, the Unitarian Memorial Church. A generous
guide to its artistic glories, he says, ``It has been called the
finest example of 15th-century English Gothic style in this
country. Mr. Rogers, who grew up in the congregation, built it
between 1901 and 1903 as a memorial to his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Middle Ages are alive and well-resurrected in the sort of
monument that used to take medieval generations of artisans and
craftsmen to raise in Europe. Rogers got it done within Teddy
Roosevelt's first presidential term, importing Bavarian woodcarvers
to detail the oaken interiors and Italian sculptors to deal with
the marble and limestone. He studiously pursued marble, bringing in
green slabs from Switzerland, pink from France, yellow from Italy,
beige from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   An American painter, Robert Reid, brilliantly stained the
Tiffany glass windows in vivid scenes and colors: the Nativity
above the pulpit, and the Sermon on the Mount at the opposite end
of the nave. Almedia points out various residents of other windows
such as Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain), a pal of Rogers, and
Rogers himself as a knight holding a torch. If you build a church,
you should be able to leave a personal mark, right?
</P>
<P>
   Though the overpowering bronze doors, populated by numerous
saints and weighing 2 1/2 tons apiece, look hernia-inducing, they
move easily on their hinges.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers's neighborhood also includes Millicent Library, a tribute
to his daughter, and City Hall. You can't beat this city hall,
aesthetically at least. A red brick triumph of archways and a clock
tower, it was designed by the celebrated architect H.H. Richardson,
who did Boston's Copley Square masterpiece, Trinity Church, and
several Harvard buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Rogers, however, was responsible for another of
the area's renowned structures, the saloon called the Foxy Lady
just over the bridge in New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving town, we pause at Bob and Pat Clarkson's Fairhaven
Chowder House to look at Peter Duff's splendid sailing ship models,
enhancing the decor. There sits Spray, a small replica of the sloop
in which intrepid Joshua Slocum circumnavigated the globe between
1895 and 1898. It was in Fairhaven that Slocum found and rebuilt
the broken-down 37-footer, and where he ended the 46,000-mile
voyage, the first such solo.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio says, ``I read his book, `Sailing Alone Around the
World.' Marvelous. It must have been so peaceful without any
backseat driving.'' She looks purposefully at me.
</P>
<P>
   Peaceful enough is Mattapoisett, devoid of the summer invaders,
and no longer the ship-building hive of Herman Melville's time. In
1841, Melville shipped out on the whaler, Acushnet, that was
constructed here, gathering seagoing experience that would lead to
his ``Moby-Dick.'' Named (``Place of Rest'') by earlier residents,
the Sippican Indians, and later called the ``fair enchantress of
repose,'' by one author, the town at the moment fits those
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ned's Point Road, flanked by old, attractive summer homes, is
empty. Leading through a forest until the sea makes a sudden,
exhilarating,in-your-face appearance at the end, it halts at
whitewashed Ned's Point Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't so quiet the day one of the summerers, a young
boy, dumped a gang of eels in the midst of his mother's bridge
party. That was the troubled, unpredictable poet Robert Lowell, who
later would win two Pulitzer prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is serenity the product on weekend nights at the venerable
Mattapoisett Inn, across the street from the town wharf, where the
lounge was jumping and thumping to a good band called Snow Monkey
Plum a few evenings ago. You have to shiver your timbers once in a
while, says Marc Goddu, the innkeeper of 20 years whose
establishment must have witnessed more than a few homecoming seamen
having a whale of a rum time.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the ``oldest seaside inn in the nation,'' celebrating
its 200th birthday next year, the white wooden pleasure dome on
Water Street is fronted by porch and balcony that give drinkers a
fine view of the big boat-dotted drink. Put together to last by
Joseph Meigs, a skilled shipyards carpenter, it was first operated
by him as a general store and tavern.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled with her tools is chef Marlene Goddu, Marc's wife.
Lobster potato cake with melted brie, cappuccino mousse, and black
tie cookies are among her winners. The cookies, baked daily, come
in five varieties, such as tuxedo: black and white chocolate chunks
with hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're romantically inclined,'' she says, ``try our
`Decadent Feast' _ chateaubriand for two, champagne, and a
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're unromantically inclined,'' says Aurelio, ``come
swimming with us tomorrow morning. It's enough to make buzzards
seem warmhearted.''

LINING UP TO TAKE CREDIT FOR STRIDE RITE'S SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's amusing to watch the top executives now making their way to
the exits stepping on one another to take credit for ``the
turnaround'' at Stride Rite Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite: John Ranelli, the Lexington footwear maker's
number two man, who just departed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, hours after we reported in this column that Ranelli
was leaving because he was being passed over for the chief
executive's job, he paid a New York public relations firm to issue
a press release calling him the ``creator of Stride Rite's
turnaround plan.'' He said he planned ``to pursue other
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Stride Rite fired off its own release,
characterizing Ranelli as one of 11 members of top management who
``collectively'' developed strategy ``under CEO Bob Siegel's
direction.'' The release pointedly noted that the company will
record a $295,000 charge ``to provide for severance benefits
potentially payable to Mr. Ranelli over the next 12 months if he
remains unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Siegel himself is retiring to a lovely island off
Charleston, S.C., saying the turnaround is now far enough along to
allow him to leave. But if Siegel and other managers are feeling
good about the turnaround in a tough shoe environment, shareholders
who have stuck around probably aren't going to be able to retire to
island living anytime soon, not at least on their Stride Rite
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Siegel record: The stock was 19 when he started in December
1993 and is 9 today, just about where it was 2 1/2 years ago when
the company made the California Public Employees Retirement
System's list of worst performers.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, affable executive who made his name as the man who
put Dockers on the map for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., Siegel has spent
most of his five years at Stride Rite talking turnaround. But as
one senior executive put it last week: ``How long does a turnaround
take?''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel points out that footwear stocks have gotten hammered this
year. ``If one gets measured on the price of the stock, yeah, I'm
disappointed. But if one gets measured on fixing the ills, I feel
very good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Siegel was left with a company largely built around
one product, Keds. The plain white canvas sneaker helped make
Stride Rite one of the top-performing stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange in the 1980s, but when grunge replaced preppie neatness,
Keds's sales fell from $370 million in 1992 to $178 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Keds is finally moving again. In its quarterly report last
month, the company said the Keds division posted its strongest
performance in more than five years, with sales increasing 49
percent from 1997. Siegel looks for sales to hit $200 million this
year and predicts annual sales growth of 12 to 16 percent ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Stride Rite's third-quarter sales were up 17 percent
and net income jumped 56 percent. For the first nine months of the
year sales were up 5 percent, profits up 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those inside and outside the company give Siegel high marks for
making some key hires, in particular Joanna Jacobson, president of
Keds, and Diane Sullivan, who runs the licensed brands division.
But in the most basic of ways, Stride Rite is right where it began
when Siegel came on board: dependent on Keds for its success.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Keds, the company's high-end Stride Rite children's shoes
are in a low-growth business and its Sperry Top-Siders are losing
market share, analysts say. Overall, Stride Rite's margins remain
below industry levels, says Steven Ritcher, an analyst for Tucker
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's biggest initiative, licensing brands like Tommy
Hilfiger and Levi Strauss, has turned out to be disappointing.
While it has helped multiply the brands under Stride Rite's
control, it has proven no substitute for building brands that it
owns.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing deals are expensive and the margins tight. This
month Stride Rite announced it would abandon the Levi's line and
take a $3.2 million charge to pay for the move. The Hilfiger line,
while it could do $100 million in sales this year, has not lived up
to early expectations, particularly on the profit side.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing initiative is reminiscent of the decision by
Siegel's predecessor, Ervin Shames, to focus his energy on building
a state-of-the-art distribution center in Kentucky. While Stride
Rite fiddled, taking years to get the bugs out, angry customers
walked and the business burned. The lesson: This is shoes, not
brain surgery. Low-tech China does a pretty good job getting shoes
out.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel stands by the strategy. ``The Tommy license is one of the
best things we have done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite's new chief executive, however, is likely to focus
not on signing up more brands to license, but on leveraging the
balance sheet. With its strong cash flow and no long-term debt,
Stride Rite has plenty of room to borrow for an acquisition or to
expand its current stock buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the search for a new CEO, being run by the
executive recruiting firm Korn-Ferry International, say candidates
aren't exactly standing in line to run Stride Rite. Other shoe
companies are having the same problem attracting talent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the insiders, Jacobson, the Keds president, is said to
have taken herself out of the running because she has three
children and believed the next chief executive should have the kind
of strong financial background she does not have. Sullivan, like
Jacobson, is a product person, not a financial one.
</P>
<P>
   And then Ranelli, of course, is looking for his next
opportunity.

TACKLING THE GROWING PROBLEM OF REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago while working in public relations and marketing,
Katherine Greenough felt a strange tingling in her wrist. By
evening, her arm had begun to shake, and pains were shooting from
her hand to her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point I couldn't even bring a fork to my mouth, or cut
my own meat,'' says Greenough, who hasn't worked since. ``I could
not cook without pain. I could not open doors, use keys, or dry my
hair. Driving, especially parking, became painful. My whole life
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenough, 48, of Back Bay, has a repetitive stress injury, a
condition that strikes close to 300,000 people each year, according
to the US Department of Labor. Over the next five years, one in six
computer operators will develop a soft-tissue injury to the
tendons, muscles, nerves, or vascular system, reports the US
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Who suffers from RSI? Poultry workers, package handlers,
machinists, construction workers, meat cutters, computer operators,
telemarketers, journalists, cashiers _ anybody who uses certain
motions repeatedly over the course of a workday.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Greenough volunteers at the Massachusetts Coalition
on New Office Technology in Boston, a group of labor and
work-safety organizations that has spent the past few years
lobbying the Labor Department and OSHA for an ergonomics standard
that would govern everything from office-furniture design to how
often a worker is required to repeat a motion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a Republican Congress imposed a ban on funding
for an ergonomics standard, raising the ire of groups like the
coalition. The ban was lifted this year and OSHA is expected to
release a draft standard soon, but supporters now worry the measure
will lack the breadth to have any real effect on the RSI dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, members of the Massachusetts Coalition on New
Office Technology and injured workers held a forum and panel
discussion at the Unitarian Universalist Association in Boston
yesterday to voice their concerns, to circulate a petition
demanding OSHA include computer workers in its standard, and to
plan new strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want OSHA to say computer jobs must be included in the
standard,'' says Hillary Marcus, a spokeswoman for the coalition.
``We all know that many of the jobs today involve computers. You
can't find work today without using one. We also want to see a
draft of the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, 32,000 people are struggling to
live with some form of RSI, a condition that not only is difficult
to diagnose but also may take years to treat. OSHA estimates that
nearly half of all workers' compensation claims will someday
involve soft-tissue injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome. In
1994, the last year for which statistics were available, US
companies spent $10.8 billion on medical and other costs related to
RSI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Punnett, a professor of ergonomics and epidemiology at the
University of Massachusetts at Lowell, says computer workers can
take action by adjusting their work stations:
</P>
<P>
   _First, make sure your chair supports your back properly, and
that your feet are flat on the floor. Some workers may require an

THAT CHILL IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One lawyer notes a rise in the bankruptcy reports that come
across his desk. Another mentions the skittishness among developers
on big real estate deals around town, including the convention
center. A third cites softer housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the layoffs at big blue-chip companies like
Raytheon and Gillette. How much longer before firms in Boston's
large financial services sector follow the pattern of 5 percent and
10 percent layoffs that have occurred in London and New York?
</P>
<P>
   Is it too soon to be worrying about a recession in
Massachusetts? Yes, probably. Recessions _ as opposed to periods of
slower growth _ take far bigger shocks than seem to be working
their way through the system today.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has lived through three recessions in the years
since John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960 _ only three
recessions in nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The doozy was the one associated with the end of the Vietnam
War. Starting in 1970, unemployment climbed to nearly 7 percent. It
remained there until the oil price-induced recession of 1974 sent
it soaring to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those years that one heard stories of space scientists
driving cabs, of metal-working shops closing by the score, of half
of all carpenters leaving the state.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Massachusetts scarcely felt the recession of
1980-81. True, unemployment briefly touched 8 percent in 1983. But
it fell rapidly then to less than 4 percent and stayed there for
four years. In the 1980s New England experienced a degree of
prosperity that hadn't been seen since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The came the banking crash associated with the end of the
disinflation of the 1980s. This was Massachusetts's turn in the
rolling recession that had hit the Rust Belt and the Oil Patch in
turn; California would be next. The hangover was aggravated by the
extra dose of monetary stimulus that had been administered by the
Federal Reserve Board in the months after the 1987 market break.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks closed their doors; important computer companies
failed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 9 percent from 3 percent in
just a year.
</P>
<P>
   After 1992, however, job and income growth resumed at a steady
rate. Last year unemployment again fell below 4 percent.
Massachusetts in the 1990s has resembled Massachusetts in the late
1970s and 1980s: a vibrant economy riding a strong trend of
business investment to a confident consumer boom. Only the state's
social welfare system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   And the outlook now?
</P>
<P>
   Sara Johnson, research director for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in
Lexington, Mass., says the forecasting firm puts the probability of
a recession over the next two years at around 50 percent. If China
devalued its currency and the international situation got out of
hand, the odds would worsen. But if the Asian currency crisis
stabilized, she says, the United States could get away with two or
three quarters of 1 percent growth, followed by a new leg of
expansion. ``This doesn't look like other business cycles,'' says
Johnson, &UR;  &LR; referring to the usual burst of inflation followed by a
step on the monetary brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger Dornbusch, the peripatetic Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor, goes slightly further. Appearing as part of a
panel at the Catherine Stratton Lecture at MIT last week, Dornbusch
asserted that ``the Goldilocks economy (in which everything is just
right) is gone, but on balance we are going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   A newly competitive US economy has produced both low inflation
and a budget surplus, Dornbusch had argued earlier _ and that
budget surplus is now conveniently waiting to be raided. A race is
on between President Clinton and the Republicans to see who will
offer an anti-recession tax cut first. And the Fed is using
interest rate cuts to push down the dollar against the European
currencies, thereby forcing the Europeans to cut their rates. With
a little luck, these ``just-in time policy levers'' would give the
current expansion ``years of life.'' It is already the
second-longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   That chill in the air? In all likelihood, it is nothing more
than winter coming on. With luck, Boston and the United States may
not see another recession for another couple or three years. The 60
years of increasingly robust growth in New England that commenced
with the onset of World War II do not yet seem about to end.

LIKE MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a new problem. At least, that's what the giant drug
company Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn wants me to believe.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether I should even discuss this problem in
public. On second thought, after the Starr report and the Clinton
videotape, I fear I'll be called un-American if I hide behind a
veil of decorum.
</P>
<P>
   No, my problem has nothing to do with Viagra, thank you very
much. And no, I am not afflicted with homosexuality, a scourge
still beyond the reach of the drug makers but curable, according to
the religious right, by an overdose of faith. Nor do I suffer from
Tourette's syndrome, that little understood neurological disorder
that provokes an embarrassing array of jerks, twitches, and shouts
of obscenities, though some insensitive readers have suggested that
my columns exhibit all the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Since I've come this far, I might as well just blurt it out: I
tinkle too much.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's what I have learned lately from Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn.
I had no idea I had this problem until a few weeks ago when
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn started telling me in a jeering ad in major
publications. The ad attempts to shame me into begging my doctor
for a new drug called Detrol to control a perfectly human condition
hyped as overactive bladder. The ad scared me. After reading it, I
could barely look myself in the mirror. I thought that if sometimes
I gotta go, I mean really gotta go (and who doesn't?), then I'm not
a properly functioning citizen and need a drug to put myself right.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's headline screamed: ``Overactive Bladder Isn't Normal at
any Age.'' Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn wanted me to know that prodigal
piddling isn't just for old folks anymore. And that's not all. If I
relieve myself recklessly (and I confess that on occasion I have),
I should be warned that I am a deviant. Of course, Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn knew these gross insults begged the question: What, really,
is abnormal urination?
</P>
<P>
   The ad provided a checklist of five statements. If I answered
yes to even some of them then I had a problem. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   I frequently have a strong, sudden urge to urinate. (Yes, and
I've learned with age that jumping up and down and clutching at
oneself is not appropriate.)
</P>
<P>
   I often go to the bathroom more than 8 times in a 24-hour
period. (This is a tough call. Have you ever tried to count your
piddles in a given day? I asked my wife to help me keep track, she
declined. I asked my boss, he pretended not to hear. I asked a
woman on the street, she slapped me.)
</P>
<P>
   If, as one statement put it, I am not always able to hold on
until I reach a bathroom, that is a problem. But that's also quite
different from simply having a powerful urge, or needing to go
eight times a day.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the symptoms, I concluded that Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn
wanted to confuse me into thinking I needed a new drug. What an
economic proposition! If I pee, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn wants to make
sure that I pee right into their piggy bank. Nowadays a man can't
go without someone trying to make a buck off of it.
</P>
<P>
   I have one request for Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn: When I'm racked by
that overwhelming, crazy-as-a-loon urge to piddle, don't prescribe
me a pill _ find me a potty.

WHEN IT COMES TO YOGURT, SAVE THE CALORIES AND FAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ever doubted that people who shop in natural-foods stores
are different from people who shop in convenional supermarkets,
take a look at their yogurt-buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans have decided they would rather have a
little bit of fat in their yogurt, as well as in their cookies and
potato chips, people who shop in markets where they can buy organic
and additive-free foods still want fat-free.
</P>
<P>
   In natural-food markets sales of nonfat yogurt are up 3 percent,
according to a survey by Spence Information Services, a
marketing-research company for the natural-products industry; in
conventional supermarkets, sales are down 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the nonfat shoppers are missing, it seems, is the fat and
the calories. A tasting of nine plain, nonfat yogurts, two low-fat
yogurts and three full-fat varieties showed surprisingly little
difference, though the whole-milk yogurts were a little creamier.
</P>
<P>
   The nine nonfat yogurts were from Brown Cow Farm (one in New
York and two varieties from Brown Cow Farm of California),
Butterworks Farm, Colombo, Dannon, Horizon Organic, Stonyfield Farm
Organic and LaYogurt; the two low-fat ones were from Brown Cow of
New York and Colombo, and the three full-fat brands were Brown Cow
of New York, Dannon Organic and Stonyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The texture of plain, nonfat yogurts is generally firmer than
the full-fat because of added pectin, a thickening agent.
Butterworks Farm's yogurt was thinner than the others because it
contains no pectin. The creamiest, and therefore the best, of the
nonfat yogurts came from Brown Cow Farm of Newfield, N.Y., not to
be confused with Brown Cow Farm of California.
</P>
<P>
   While all yogurts provide a significant source of calcium (in
short supply in the American diet), plain, nonfat yogurt generally
provides more calcium than full-fat, low-fat and flavored yogurts.
One cup of the plain, nonfat yogurt contains 30 percent to 45
percent of the recommended daily intake. Full-fat and low-fat
contain 25 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The great advantage of the nonfat, plain yogurt over low-fat or
full-fat varieties is, of course, the levels of calories and fat.
For example, a cup of Stonyfield's whole-milk yogurt has 180
calories and 10 grams of fat, while its nonfat counterpart has 100
calories and no fat.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in calories between Colombo nonfat and low-fat is
not great: only 20. But the first has no fat while the second has 4
grams.
</P>
<P>
   All of the yogurts tested are made with live, active cultures of
beneficial bacteria, and the role of these cultures in health is
now better understood. By definition, yogurt must contain two
cultures: Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
</P>
<P>
   Other cultures are often used, particularly L. acidophilus and
bifidus. Stonyfield Farm, the largest maker of organic yogurt in
the United States, has introduced two additional cultures: L. casei
and L. reuteri.
</P>
<P>
   L. reuteri is the newest and, in terms of public health, the
most interesting. Clinical tests on humans and animals have shown
that L. reuteri provides some protection against certain harmful
bacteria like E. coli 0157H:7 and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   Kasi Reddy, the vice president for research and development at
Stonyfield, says that one eight-ounce serving daily offers this
health bonus.
</P>
<P>
   For people who do not want to know they are eating yogurt, there
are many ways to slip it into the diet: as a substitute for
mayonnaise, sour cream, milk or cream.The best way to find out how
much yogurt you can use to replace a high-fat ingredient is to
start with small amounts of each, increasing the amounts little by
little until you find a ratio you like.
</P>
<P>
   In salads, a little mayonnaise adds body and flavor: a good
ratio is twice as much yogurt as mayonnaise. If you are
substituting for milk or buttermilk, you can substitute cup for
cup.
</P>
<P>
   Yogurt can be used in cooking, though the beneficial effects of
live cultures are destroyed by the heat. But the benefits of
calcium remain the same, hot or cold.
</P>
<P>
   When yogurt is boiled, it separates. Adding a bit of cornstarch
to the yogurt before it is cooked prevents separation. For each cup
of yogurt, add one tablespoon of cornstarch. First mix the
cornstarch with a little of the yogurt to make a smooth paste and
stir into the remaining yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   With so little difference between nonfat and full-fat varieties
of yogurt, it makes more sense to save those extra calories and
grams of fat for occasional treats like sour cream and ice cream.
There, the difference is noticeable. &QL;

THE IDEAL BURGER IS IN THE GRIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so many other culinary pursuits, making a hamburger that
approaches the Platonic ideal means starting from scratch: the
juiciest, most flavorful burgers begin with meat that you grind
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is a fair amount of work for what is, after
all, casual food. On the other hand, it is relatively easy to do,
and there are real advantages: the meat will be fresher, since you
can select the cut and grind the meat just before cooking (juices
congeal, and flavor fades as the meat sits). And you can learn
exactly which texture pleases you most through experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The primary factors here are the cut of beef and the grinding
tool.
</P>
<P>
   The most important considerations about the cut are fat content
and flavor. You don't want a burger that drips fat when you squeeze
it, but neither do you want a dust-dry patty.
</P>
<P>
   So, the trick is to choose a cut with just enough fat to cook up
into a burger that is moist but not greasy. As for flavor, the
requirement is obvious; this totemic beef dish cries out for rich,
deep beefy flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The cut that best meets both of these criteria is the chuck,
which is basically the forequarter of the cow. Meat from the chuck
has about 20 percent fat, which is just the right amount to create
a perfectly juicy burger.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is relatively tough, chuck is also more flavorful than
more tender sections of the cow, like the sirloin or tenderloin.
And since grinding severs the connective tissues that cause chuck
to be tough, that characteristic is a nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool for grinding meat is the old-fashioned one: a
silver-painted steel grinder like the one my grandmother used to
bring out and clamp onto her wooden kitchen table when it was
burger time. Forcing the meat through one of these grinders gives
it a pleasantly smooth texture and integrates the fat and the lean
particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   But if you like a chunkier texture, you may prefer using a food
processor, which also does the job with considerably less effort.
The disadvantage of the food processor is that it can quickly turn
your meat to mush.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, it is best to have the beef semifrozen and to pay
close attention when grinding.
</P>
<P>
   To grind enough meat for four burgers, cut about one and a half
pounds of chuck into one-inch chunks, using a very sharp knife.
Place the chunks in a single layer on a tray or baking sheet, and
put it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes but no more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then, working with a third of the meat at a time, place the
chunks in a food processor fitted with a steel blade, and pulse
about a dozen times. At this point, the meat should be just
slightly more coarsely ground than store-bought hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   It should still have distinct chunks, but they should be small
enough so that they clump together. (You can stop pulsing as soon
as the meat begins to clump. After that, more whirs will make it a
finer texture; it's a matter of preference.)
</P>
<P>
   This process also works perfectly well for making burgers from
other meats. For turkey burgers, use boneless, skinless thighs,
which are higher in fat than the breast and more flavorful. The
best cut for ground lamb or pork is the shoulder. This is most
readily available as lamb shoulder chops and as the pork cut called
Boston butt.
</P>
<P>
   To form a patty that keeps its shape but is not a hard,
compacted mass, I like the method devised by Pam Anderson, the
author of ``The Perfect Recipe'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998). Take a
handful of the meat, form it into a ball by tossing it back and
forth between cupped hands, and then, while holding the patty in
one hand, push it gently into a patty shape with the tips of your
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cooking a burger, grilling over a hot fire is
the ideal way to get a crisp exterior and moist, juicy interior.
But the next best option is a cast-iron pan. Let the pan sit over
medium-high heat for two to three minutes to get good and hot, and
then put the burgers in to cook with no additional fat. An
inch-thick patty takes about four minutes a side for medium to
medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   For a cheeseburger, put a standard hard cheese like cheddar on
top about two minutes before the burger is done; softer cheese like
mozzarella can be added after the burger has been removed from the
pan. &QL;

FOUR HEAD INTO TRACK AND FIELD HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ind., Texas)  (lb) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dwight Stones, the stylish high-jumper turned television
commentator, has never been at a loss for words. Such was the case
Monday when he became one of four athletes voted into the National
Track and Field Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the limit on our acceptance speech?'' Stones asked
Craig Masback, chief executive of USA Track and Field, during a
telephone news conference to introduce the 1998 inductees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be treated to Dwight,'' said Francie
Larrieu-Smith, who joined Stones, her fellow 1972 Olympian, in the
Hall. She set 35 American records in distances from 1,000 meters to
two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were Jay Silvester, the first discus thrower to reach
220 and 230 feet, and Greg Foster, a hurdler who won the silver
medal at the 1984 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The inductees will be honored during the 20th annual Hall of
Fame ceremonies in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 3, which coincides with
USA Track and Field's annual meeting. The four will take their
place alongside some 120 athletes currently enshrined in the Hall
of Fame in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out, I just wanted to be the best athlete I
could,'' said Larrieu-Smith, 45, who is currently studying for a
master's degree in sports administration at the University of Texas
in Austin. ``I'm thrilled to be recognized by athletes and
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, 61, who competed in four Olympics. winning a silver
medal in 1972 and a bronze medal in 1976, described his induction
as second only to winning an Olympic medal. ``When I broke my first
world record, I didn't feel excitement but contentment and peace to
get a monkey off my back,'' Silvester said. ``In some way, I feel
the same with my induction into the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, 40, a world-ranked high-hurdler for 15 of 16 years from
1977 to 1992, said he watched last year as his friend and fellow
competitor Renaldo Nehemiah was named to the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping I could do the same,'' Foster said. ``Now that
it's come to pass, I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Stones, known affectionately among peers as ``the mouth'' and
known by fans for his Mickey Mouse T-shirts and Fosbury flop style
in the high jump, said track and field could use a few characters
like him to help boost its image and fan appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport can always use that _ a flashy athlete,'' the
44-year-old Stones said. ``People would show up just to boo me, but
that was fine with me because we were getting the crowds.''

WOMAN'S AGE DECEPTION PIQUES INTEREST IN TV SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't watch a lot of television. I have nothing against
television, for the most part. There is actually a lot of good
programming on television if one searches diligently. However, I
simply have too much to do to spend a lot of my time watching other
people do stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it, one hour of soap operas, Geraldo, or sumo
wrestling a day adds up to seven hours a week. That's 28 hours a
month or about 336 hours a year! You can do a lot with an extra 336
hours. That's 14 complete, 24-hour days!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, because I don't watch much television, I have never seen
the new, highly touted program called ``Felicity.'' The story line
is about Felicity Porter, a college student at the fictional
University of New York. She was supposed to go to Stanford but she
followed her high school crush to New York only to discover that he
doesn't know her from John Glenn. Even if I did watch a lot of
television, this premise does not appeal to me. Besides, it's
obviously a program for high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
   However, a startling revelation has piqued my otherwise
nonexistent interest in Felicity. Daily Variety, the news source
for the Hollywood set, published a story revealing that one of the
cast members lied about her age in order to secure her role. It
seems that TV actress and writer Kimberlee Kramer is a 32-year-old
woman and not the 17-year-old wunderkind that she pretended to be.
Now, because of Hollywood's well-known age bias, ``old'' Kimberlee
is being put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, I just had to look Ms. Kramer up on the internet. Sure
enough, she looks every bit the teen-ager. To complete her ruse,
she reportedly had false identification made up and talked a lot
about baby-sitting and her teen-age crushes. According to Kramer,
she couldn't even get any auditions when she told her real age so
she legally changed her name from Riley Weston and created a new
identity. Bingo! She gets a plum role on a new hit series. Whether
it's common practice in Hollywood or not, Kimberlee did tell a
falsehood to a lot of people. Upon being exposed, she said the most
incredible thing to Variety. She said, ``I take full
responsibility. I'm completely sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, I can't recall ever
hearing those words from a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she makes her last appearance on Felicity in a few
weeks and Disney is probably going to cancel her six-figure writing
contract, all hope is not lost for the youthful-looking actress.
She's receiving lots of media attention and new offers for roles
where it's OK to tell your real age.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, I might even watch that last episode. Nah, probably
not, but it's an interesting development anyway. Only in America,
right?

planet. He is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and
brimming with stories of the old days. Like O'Malley, many of those
who shared the anxiety, thrill and glory of the first Glenn flight
in 1962 are gathering here again to sip at the fountain of their
youth. For this moment at least, their years seem to decline in

ITALIAN ZUCCA: IT'S PUMPKINLIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go to central or northern Italy at this time of year and you're
sure to be offered tortelli (or other pasta) filled with zucca.
</P>
<P>
   Zucca is a pumpkinlike vegetable whose flesh, like that of
butternut or acorn squash, is dense, orange and somewhat sweet.
Zucca is cooked, then pureed with nutmeg, eggs and Parmesan to make
the filling. Crumbled amaretti (those wonderful individually
wrapped almond-flavored cookies) are frequently added to the mix, a
step that seems unusual in a cuisine more often known for its
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Tortelli con Zucca are normally bathed in butter and grated
Parmesan, and are unforgettably delicious.
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that making them is a serious project. But the labor
is almost all in the pasta part: the making of the fresh dough, the
cutting, stuffing and sealing of the individual tortelli. Preparing
the zucca is simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor and essential nature of pasta with zucca can be
captured in a 30-minute preparation that is admittedly a
compromise, but a pretty good one. In this version, you prepare the
zucca _ butternut squash is a near-perfect substitute _ and thin it
slightly so that the stuffing becomes a pasta sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The result is inside out, and not as attractive as tortelli, but
the flavor and texture are right there.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta with butternut-squash sauce also shows off those
ubiquitous, easy-to-store and incredibly inexpensive winter
squashes (usually less than 50 cents a pound) to great advantage.
Normally, they are baked or pureed as a side dish or soup.
</P>
<P>
   No one I know does either with any regularity, and there isn't
much beyond that. This dish provides a way to work them into the
fall repertory.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it's a recipe that features nutmeg, a highly
flavorful, generally enjoyed spice that doesn't make its way into
savory foods often enough. The combination of squash and nutmeg has
a surprising whiff of pumpkin pie about it that children especially
seem to like.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth remembering that some butternut squashes are sweeter
than others, and there's no way to predict this by appearance. But
since this sauce relies on sweetness for its character, if the
squash seems a little bland as it cooks, add about a teaspoon of
sugar. It will brighten the sauce's flavor considerably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PASTA WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound peeled and seeded butternut squash (start with a whole
squash weighing about 1{ pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound cut pasta, like ziti
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar, optional
</P>
<P>
   { cup freshly grated Parmesan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut squash into chunks, and place in food processor. Pulse
machine on and off until squash looks grated. (Alternatively, grate
or chop the squash by hand.) Set a large pot of salted water to
boil for the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add the butter or
oil. A minute later, add the squash, salt, pepper and about { cup
of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add water,
about \ cup at a time, as the mixture dries out, being careful not
to make it soupy. When the squash begins to disintegrate, after
about 10 or 15 minutes, begin cooking the pasta. While it cooks,
season the squash with the nutmeg, sugar if necessary, and
additional salt and pepper if needed.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the pasta is tender, scoop out about { cup of the
cooking liquid, then drain. Toss it in the skillet with the squash,
adding the reserved cooking water if the mixture seems dry. Taste,
and adjust the salt, pepper or nutmeg as you like; then, toss with
the cheese and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

THAT'S BOND, JAMES BOND, TIMES 20
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never said ``Never'': S.B. of Haltom City, Texas, called the
trivia line to note that a 20th James Bond film was omitted in a
recent answer: ``Never Say Never Again,'' starring Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   MGM, the producer of 18 Bond films and the in-progress ``Bond
19,'' doesn't count ``Never'' because it was filmed independently
of the studio. Producer Kevin McClory has some rights to the Bond
character and ``Thunderball'' script that stem from a legal battle
with Bond creator Ian Fleming. He exercised these rights by
remaking the film as ``Never Say Never Again'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The title played off Connery's longstanding response when asked
if he would ever return to the role: ``Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, MGM obtained a preliminary injunction against Sony
Corp.'s plans to make another Bond film based on rights it acquired
from McClory. McClory and other film executives are giving
depositions this month in the ongoing case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son was named after Andy Griffith. How can I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.D., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Griffith in care of the William Morris Agency, 151
El Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   According to his agency, the 72-year-old actor recently
completed filming ``Daddy and Them,'' a dark comedy with Billy Bob
Thornton as writer, director and performer. Co-stars include Laura
Dern, Ben Affleck and Jim Varney.
</P>
<P>
   The best source for information about Griffith is a fan club
devoted to his best-remembered series: The ``Andy Griffith Show''
Rerun Watchers Club. To join for a year and receive three issues of
its 24-page newsletter, send $12 to TAGSRWC, 9 Music Square S.,

<P>
   Q: How can I send a letter to Leslie Nielsen?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the ``Naked Gun'' and ``Airplane!'' star in care of
Bresler Kelly and Associates, 11500 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 510,
Los Angeles, CA 90064.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, 72, already has three films lined up for 1999 that
involve ships: ``Titanic Too: It Missed the Iceberg,'' ``Love Boat:
The Movie'' and ``2001: A Space Travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Another project that may be in the works is a ``Naked Gun''
sequel, Nielsen told a St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter in
December.

LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM FORT WORTH'S FIRST FILM FEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that runs longer than the Major League baseball
season is the film festival season. And unlike baseball, which
sometimes seems to never end _ that is, unless you were a San Diego
Padre, for whom it ended way too quickly _ the film festival season
does never end.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one major festival somewhere every month. In
September, there are four: Telluride, Montreal, Toronto and New
York. So, walking past the pile of empty popcorn boxes and
discarded programs where many have gone before is the Fort Worth
Film Festival, which had its inaugural run over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The opening night was the best and worst of worlds. The premiere
film, ``Rushmore,'' was easily one of the finest movies of this
year. ``Rushmore'' will get a limited run in New York and Los
Angeles at the end of the year to qualify for Oscar consideration;
it opens wide in early 1999. Director Wes Anderson's fluky comedy _
details keep popping up for days after you've seen it _ stars
actress Talia Shire's son and feels like a British film of the
'60s, complete with lifts from the mod era and Brit-pop score. But
there wasn't much of a turnout; a second screening Friday afternoon
also played to a small audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday night screening of ``The Birds,'' with star Tippi
Hedren in attendance, had difficulties, too. It's said that
projection problems at Caravan of Dreams brought the picture to a
stop several times. However, throughout the technical glitches that
are such a regular part of film festivals that they should be added
to the schedules, the crowds sat patiently and waited for things to
be righted. They did so even when the screening of ``Straight
Time'' was canceled because the print that showed up was flawed,
although word is ``Time'' co-star M. Emmett Walsh was a little
unhappy about it.
</P>
<P>
   At the screening of ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' screenwriter and
Fort Worth native Jim Hart dashed around the Palace 9 looking for
the projectionist because it looked as though the print was being
underprojected; it looked as dark as Dracula's soul.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival probably bit off a little more than it could
chew in its first year. Next year, a three-day run, instead of
four, would serve it better. For one thing, it would cut down on
the number of shorts programmed, many of which were a grim sit.
(And trying to slip out of the Caravan of Dreams in the dark is
like crawling through a mine field on your back.) There were a few
notable shorts, such as ``Accident,'' which had the foreboding of
``The Vanishing'' _ the original version. Or ``Phil Touches Flo,''
a hilarious little film about the dangers of playing with someone
else's dog.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's event, an outdoor showing of ``The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly,'' must have had only about 50 people or so. Too bad,
because it was a great idea. Momentum picked up by the end of the
festival, and venues with sparse crowds early on had bigger
audiences by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Too much was crammed into Thursday's party for Tippi Hedren _ a
cocktail party and then a light supper before ``The Birds,'' then
the movie, then a cocktail party after. Next year, they should
consider saving the biggest event for Saturday night, when more
people are free to attend. (Festivals often schedule the biggest
screenings for Saturday, and place a cocktail event before and
after the show, so that those interested can choose to attend one
or the other.) But the first year is almost always the shakedown
year, and as long as lessons are learned, things can only get
better.

A SWEET LESSON FROM MY GRANDMOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the third of eight columns by Francois Payard, the chef and
owner of Payard Patisserie and Bistro in Manhattan. Payard's
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.

<P>
   At my grandfather's pastry shop in Nice, there was always a
large selection of sweets that were called ``mamie cakes'' because
they were the favorites of that French city's grandmothers, the
``mamies'' who took up teatime as a daily treat.
</P>
<P>
   Any cake that didn't have cream, custard or mousse was a mamie
cake (it's pronounced ma-MEE, with the ``a'' as in mat).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until I was older that I learned that these mamie
cakes have a real name. Pastry chefs call them ``gateaux secs,'' or
dry cakes, and the category includes anything from a cookie to a
kugelhopf, the ultimate coffee cake. And as you'll see from this
recipe, the word dry has nothing to do with consistency or texture.
</P>
<P>
   This particular mamie cake _ it's really a tart, but my
grandfather always called it a cake _ is filled with fresh sweet
pineapple and is topped with a macaroonlike layer of coconut, the
``coco'' in the name.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the first cakes I learned to make (I started
making it for my grandfather when I was 13), and it's one I
continue to make, delighted to find it has fans of every age.
</P>
<P>
   The Coco-Mamie is made in a pate sucree, or sweet tart crust.
The crust, mixed in the food processor, is soft and crumbly and is
itself the stuff of great cookies. It's easiest to work after it's
been chilled.
</P>
<P>
   If crusts have frightened you in the past, try this one:
perfection is not required. In fact, unlike most crusts, this one
should be rolled fairly thick. And because the cake's topping is
spread all the way to the edge of the crust _ even beyond _ there's
no need to worry about the edges being exactly even. Certainly,
there's no fluting or fussing.
</P>
<P>
   The topping is made in a minute by hand. Baked, it will remind
you of the best coconut macaroons _ moist, chewy and not too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetness in this cake comes from the pineapple. If your
pineapple is great, your Coco-Mamie will be great. That is the key
to success. My first choice is pineapples from Costa Rica.They're
supersweet, and since I use the fruit in its natural state,
sweetness counts.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get a soft, golden pineapple with that wonderful
ripe perfume, you can try doctoring the best pineapple you can find
by sauteeing it in butter, a little sugar and the scraped-out pulp
of a fresh vanilla bean. Or in a pinch, you can use well-drained
canned pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   You may love this cake for the same reason my busy pastry-chef
grandfather did: while it's best the day it's made, it keeps for a
day. With a few Coco-Mamie cakes in the display case, he had time
to make perishable cream puffs; you may have time to invite Mamie
to tea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COCO-MAMIE CAKE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 2 hours for freezing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the crust: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, lightly beaten &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { small pineapple, cut into tiny dice, about 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   3{ tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups finely shredded unsweetened coconut (available in
health-food stores)
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, lightly beaten. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the crust, put the butter, flour, sugar and salt in
the bowl of a food processor, and process until the ingredients are
well blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the egg.
Process just until the egg is completely incorporated; you will
have a very soft, creamy dough. Remove the dough, flatten it out
into a disk shape, wrap it in plastic and freeze for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Butter an 8-inch round fluted metal tart pan, 1\ inches high,
with a removable bottom, and place it on a baking sheet. On a
lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a circle about [
inch thick. Fit the dough into the pan, and trim off the excess,
level with the top of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spread the pineapple evenly along the bottom of the crust,
and return the crust to the freezer for about an hour. At the end
of that time, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   4. To make the filling, blend the butter and sugar together,
working with a rubber spatula. Stir in the coconut, and when it is
well blended, incorporate the egg. Still using the spatula, spread
the filling evenly over the frozen pineapple, pressing down lightly
on the fruit to get the filling into the crevices. Spread the
filling all the way to the edge of the crust. Slide the cake into
the oven, and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is
baked through and the filling is golden brown and firmly set on
top. Transfer the cake to a rack, and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings. &QL;

`AMERICAN HISTORY X': THE DARKEST CHAMBERS OF A NATION'S SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertisements for the controversy magnet that is ``American
History X'' seem to be selling Edward Norton's buff physique,
savage scowl and swastika tattoo in equal measure. So they reflect
the film's bold but reckless synthesis of visual enticement and
rhetorical fever.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials,
this is an inflated yet gut-slugging film that dares to address
America's neo-Nazi culture with brutal candor. Its toughest images
stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing spins out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Having made his electrifying screen debut with an essentially
dual role in ``Primal Fear,'' Norton now plays a two-faceted
character with even more fury. He appears as the ideologically
double-jointed Derek Vinyard, who begins the film as a
hate-mongering skinhead only to undergo a total personality
transformation. Once Derek renounces his past (``Those guys, the
gang, that life _ I'm done with it!'') the film can consider the
lingering residue of bigotry. Not surprisingly (the executive
producer, Steve Tisch, was also a producer of ``Forrest Gump''), it
repudiates the same violence it initially exploited in shocking,
lovingly slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Though its story elements are all too easily reduced to a simple
outline, ``American History X'' has enough fiery acting and
provocative bombast to make its impact felt. For one thing, its
willingness to take on ugly political realities gives it a
substantial raison d'etre. For another, it has been directed with a
mixture of handsome photo-realism and visceral punch.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker of record is Tony Kaye, but he has renounced this
substantially re-edited version of his work. It's easier to
acknowledge the heady mix of flash and conscience that Kaye has
created, in a manner reminiscent of politically aware hyperstylists
from Michael Cimino to Spike Lee, than to know whether
suffocatingly melodramatic music, pensive water images and
lingering, super-tight close-ups were necessarily the director's
own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, someone has arranged the film's time frame
portentously enough to add extra heft to its slender story. As
written by David McKenna, ``American History X'' centers on a
racist killing that Derek commits with horrifying gusto.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of film that milks this violence furiously and
also tries to heat up this episode by watching Derek in a sexual
tryst just before the violence occurs. Though Fairuza Balk plays
his nose-ringed racist sweetie here, the rest of the film brims
with the tacitly homoerotic energy of its skinhead bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' saves the details of Derek's viciousness
for a shock later on. What it means to do, at first, is alternate
between black-and-white flashbacks of his fascist heyday and color
scenes of Derek after he has served brief prison time. The
contrasts between these scenes are strong enough to deflect
attention from the unlikeliness of Derek's about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vastly talented Norton plays him searingly well,
Derek is as thin a straw man as the story's other characters, who
are conceived as essentially passive products of their small-minded
environment. Or as Beverly D'Angelo, playing Derek's mom, says
while rubbing the shaved head of her firstborn, ``What did I do to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' provides a jumbled litany of factors
contributing to Derek's evil streak, as in a dinner-table
conversation about affirmative action with his father, a fireman.
(``America's about the best man for the job!'' his father heatedly
says.) The father's on-the-job death has also sent his son into a
fury, as has his mother's way of smoking and coughing,
deteriorating before Derek's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The film's pivotal figure is Derek's impressionable younger
brother, Danny, who has a spongelike interest in everything Derek
espouses. Danny, as played with wrenching vulnerability by Edward
Furlong, is the film's most blatant reminder that actions have
consequences, though this is something most viewers will already
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' creates several memorably savage episodes
that hammer home its cautionary ideas. They have been staged with
terrible gusto, as when Derek leads a raid on immigrant workers at
a grocery store, or in a killing sure to make even the most jaded
gasp. A black-and-white homosexual rape sequence has been so
strikingly photographed by Kaye himself that it makes up for the
facile nature of the film's prison interlude.
</P>
<P>
   Equally effective in that regard is a fine, funny performance by
Guy Torry as the black man who is bewilderingly eager to befriend
the hostile Derek but finally makes him see the error of his ways.
</P>
<P>
   Other performances are stagier, like Avery Brooks' turn as the
principal who declares: ``He learned this nonsense, Murray, and he
can unlearn it too. I WILL not give up on this child.'' Elliott
Gould plays the Jewish suitor whose presence at dinner with Derek's
mother is enough to send her son into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Suplee plays an obese, lonely loser whose white supremacy
is rendered ludicrous and pathetic. Stacy Keach plays the sinister
neo-Nazi ringleader with a taste for malleable young disciples, and
he speaks ominously of the way the Internet has become vital in
spreading propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   For all its glaring hyperbole, ``American History X'' knows
which raw nerves to hit.
</P>

   Editors, attention science and feature editors:
</P>
<P>
   We commend to your attention the following story, advancing
Thursday afternoon's launch of the space shuttle Discovery with
Sen. John Glenn aboard.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE-NOSTALGIA (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ There must be
something here that invigorates the likes of John Glenn and T.J.
O'Malley. Thomas J. O'Malley, known to missile colleagues as T. J.,
was the man who on the morning of Feb. 20, 1962, pressed the black
button to start the Atlas booster's engines and send Glenn on his
way in a Mercury capsule to be the first American to orbit the
planet. He is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and
brimming with stories of the old days. Like O'Malley, many of those
who shared the anxiety, thrill and glory of the first Glenn flight
in 1962 are gathering here again to sip at the fountain of their
youth. For this moment at least, their years seem to decline in
number like a launching clock, counting down instead of up. By John
Noble Wilford. (1400 words)

`HALLOWEEN TREATS': SPOOKY TREATS AND CRAFTS THAT DELIGHT

   Stumped for Halloween ideas? Being clever comes easily with the
help of ``Halloween Treats: Recipes and Crafts for the Whole
Family'' by Donata Maggipinto (Chronicle Books, $14.95). In less
than 100 pages, this colorful book covers everything from
pumpkin-seed candies for children to make, to pumpkin-based menus
and centerpieces for grown-up autumn dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ideas, like taking a rolling pin to marshmallows so
that they can be cut in the shape of ghosts to float atop excellent
homemade hot chocolate, or applying licorice string legs and
cinnamon candy eyes to turn chocolate sandwich cookies into
spiders, are winningly simple. Others, like adding a shade with
bat-wing cutouts to a flashlight, are not so easy, and require a
shopping trip to an arts and crafts supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maggipinto gives five pages detailed instructions for
carving an array of jack-o-lanterns, using squash as well as
pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with a list of kitchen and craft guidelines,
including safety tips that are useful, and not just when the
activity involves children. For example, readers are reminded that
pot lids should be lifted away at an angle to avoid injury from
escaping steam. Another good tip is to wash sharp implements one at
a time; do not put them into soapy water where they cannot be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recipes, you will also find one for candy apples that
are made with lady apples, which are so much easier for both
children and adults alike to eat than big ones. In ``Halloween
Treats,'' they are impaled on natural licorice sticks, which look
like twigs. But a tip, that the just-cooked caramel is dangerously
hot and should not be tasted, would have been useful.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the black risotto made with tapenade is barely gray,
most of the recipes are very good, notably the pork loin with
quince and apples, macaroni and cheese and pumpkin creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   I baked the chocolate cupcakes with cobweb icing twice. The
first time, following the recipe exactly, they were acceptable. But
unlike the fine devil's food cake in the book, they could have been
more chocolatey. And the weblike streaks were made by tinting some
of the icing with food coloring. When I made them again, I doubled
the cocoa from three to six tablespoons, and used chocolate ganache
instead of colored icing for the webs.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of adapting these recipes and crafts projects, many
of them, like the curried pumpkin soup or the hanging ``stained
glass'' candy decorations, can segue from Halloween to Thanksgiving
and even Christmas.

<P>
   Adapted from ``Halloween Treats'' by Donata Maggipinto &QL;

<P>
   Time: 2{ hours, including cooling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons softened unsalted butter, plus butter for baking
pan, if needed
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-process
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites, fresh or reconstituted dried
</P>
<P>
   3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Black or dark brown food coloring, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons heavy cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon cold unsalted butter in small bits, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 12 muffin-tin wells or
line them with fluted paper cups. In a medium bowl, whisk the
flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt together.
</P>
<P>
   2. Using an electric mixer, beat softened butter and sugar
together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and 2 teaspoons
vanilla. At low speed, beat in the flour mixture alternately with
the buttermilk in three batches.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins and bake about 20
minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer. If you are
hesitant about using raw egg whites, reconstituted packaged dried
egg whites, like Just Whites, can be substituted. Beat egg whites
at high speed until softly peaked. Add the confectioners' sugar,
remaining vanilla and one tablespoon of the orange juice and
continue beating until thick and shiny. The mixture should be
spreadable. Thin it with more orange juice if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   5. If using food coloring, transfer one-third of the icing to a
small bowl and tint it brown or black. Otherwise, combine the
semi-sweet chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and cook over
low heat just until the chocolate has melted. Remove it from heat
and beat it, adding cold butter bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   6. Transfer tinted icing or chocolate mixture to a pastry bag
fitted with a fine round tip.
</P>
<P>
   7. Spread white icing on cupcakes. Then, starting at the center
of each cupcake, pipe a spiral of the dark or chocolate icing over
the top. Using a small, pointed knife, drag the dark icing from the
center of the spiral to the edge of the cupcake. Wipe knife and,
moving it about 1/2 inch to the left or right, drag it from the
edge back to the center. Continue this process, working your way
around the cupcake. Repeat with remaining cupcakes.

FIRST, VAN GOGH'S MILLET, THEN VAN GOGH'S VAN GOGH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At first sight, the new show at the Musee d'Orsay
suggests a bizarre attempt to resuscitate a neglected 19th-century
French painter by exhibiting him alongside a rather more famous
name. In truth, the idea of uniting Jean-Francois Millet and van
Gogh is far more interesting. Since the Dutchman looked to the
Frenchman as a role model, Millet's life and work serve as a mirror
that reveals much about Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, van Gogh's name alone would suffice to draw crowds to
``Millet/Van Gogh'' just as it is doing to ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs''
at the National Gallery in Washington. Both exhibitions, which run
through Jan. 3, have also benefited from the closure for renovation
of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which has sent 70 paintings to
Washington and provided 27 of the 53 van Goghs on display here.
Millet, however, gives the Paris show an unusually strong theme.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition displays two dozen or so of Millet's paintings
and engravings alongside van Gogh's copies of the same works as
well as others inspired by Millet's pastoral themes. It also
records van Gogh's remarkable progress as an artist: his early
copies are clumsy; his later copies overwhelm the originals. Yet
his identity with Millet ran much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   He never met the French naturalist painter, but he was
immediately impressed when he came across his drawings and
engravings of peasant life at an exhibition in Paris shortly after
Millet's death in January 1875. Five years later, when van Gogh
himself decided to become an artist, he acquired copies and
photographs of some of Millet's work to assist his early drawing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, in 1882 van Gogh obtained a copy of Alfred
Sensier's new biography of Millet and it proved a revelation. Its
pages portrayed Millet as a man of piety, virtue, simplicity and
courage whose proximity to nature and peasants tilling the land
exuded a spirituality that spoke to van Gogh's own search for a
meaning to life. The Dutchman, who had turned away from the formal
Christianity of his pastor father, found a new pantheistic
father-guide in Millet. ``It gives me courage to read Sensier's
book about Millet,'' he wrote to his brother Theo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1883, now 30, van Gogh returned to Nuenen to live with his
parents, but his objective was to move closer to nature, indeed to
follow the rustic peasant life style that Millet supposedly adopted
during the final 26 years of life at Barbizon. In another letter to
Theo, van Gogh wrote that Millet ``desired nothing more'' than to
share ``the food, drink, clothes and sleep'' of the peasants. Soon,
van Gogh himself assumed the appearance of a peasant.
</P>
<P>
   To those who knew Millet in life, however, Sensier's account was
more hagiography than biography. Millet may have worn clogs and
simple clothes, but he enjoyed the company of artists and writers.
He had been poor, but not from choice, and in later years his
paintings sold well. He was presented as a man of fervent faith,
but he was apparently an agnostic. In brief, van Gogh was devoted
to a Millet who probably never existed.``If semi-truths pervade
Sensier's book, it is no less true that, using elements of the
biography, van Gogh created his own image of Millet, one into which
he projected a great deal of himself,'' wrote Louis van Tilborgh,
chief curator at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and one of the
organizers of this show. ``Van Gogh then supported his vision of
Millet through his careful selection of Millet's major works.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nuenen, van Gogh was able to find his own subjects among the
local peasantry, but his principal inspiration remained Millet. As
early as 1881, van Gogh had copied perhaps Millet's greatest work,
``A Sower'' (1850), and he would return to the subject triumphantly
years later, although his early version compares poorly with the
original. He also did his own variations of Millet's ``Potato
Planters'' and other farming scenes, struggling by his own
admission to capture figures in movement.
</P>
<P>
   Like Millet, van Gogh showed little interest in the faces of
peasant farmers, which often appeared blurred or in shadow. When he
did, as in ``Potato Eaters'' and two portraits of peasants, all
done in 1885, he painted them as physiognomically primitive, as if
``a resolutely animal expression,'' as van Tilborgh put it, brought
them closer to nature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884, having already declared Millet to be his ``father'' and
``eternal master,'' van Gogh wrote to his brother: ``For me, it is
not Manet, but Millet who is the essentially modern painter who has
opened the horizons for many others.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1886, van Gogh moved to Paris and Millet's influence
suddenly receded. The Dutchman discovered Impressionism and
befriended bohemians like Toulouse-Lautrec and Gaugin. His own
painting also changed radically, abandoning Millet's
mid-19th-century neo-classicism and somber colors for the thick
brush strokes and vivid colors that would make him famous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when van Gogh returned to the countryside, moving to Arles
in February 1888, Millet re-entered his life. He turned again to
Millet's themes, but he now attacked them with violent yellows and
blues that reflected the wheatfields and skies of Provence. He was
also ready to try his hand afresh with a new ``Sower'' series,
climaxing with one of his most dramatic works, showing a large sun
rising behind the darkened figure of a sower, with a gnarled and
blackened tree truck cutting across the entire image.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1889, increasingly aware of his mental instability, van
Gogh checked into a hospital at St.-Remy-de-Provence, but after a
break he resumed painting. Working from engraved copies, he
completed his own copies of a series of 10 oils painted by Millet
in 1852 called ``Work in the Fields,'' each showing some aspect of
peasant labor. During this period, he also painted ``Noon: Rest
from Work'' from an engraving of ``La Meridienne,'' which Millet
executed in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   ``The copies of Millet are perhaps what you do best,'' Theo
wrote to van Gogh at the time. ``They make me think that when you
start painting compositions of figures, great surprises will await
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with ``Starry Night'' (1888-1889), in which the gaslights
of Arles shimmer in the water of the Rhone, van Gogh seems to be
following his mentor, who painted a ``Starry Night'' above a
shadowy countryside in the late 1850s. Yet there is no evidence
that van Gogh ever saw a copy of Millet's version. Perhaps by then,
he was working purely on instinct. ``I have a terrible need for _ I
will use the word _ religion,'' he wrote to Theo nine months before
his suicide at in July 1890, ``so I go outside at night to paint
the stars.''

THE HOUSE BUILT ON WHITE ZINFANDEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. HELENA, Calif. _ Every prominent winemaker has one creation
of which he or she is particularly proud. Robert Mondavi has his
Reserve Cabernet, Francis Ford Coppola his Rubicon. And Bob
Trinchero has white zinfandel, America's most popular style of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious wine drinkers are uneasy about white zinfandel.
Like Philip Roth's suburbanites who downplay their modest urban
roots, many wine enthusiasts are pained to acknowledge that they
were once smitten by something so declasse as ``white zin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trinchero credits his creation with helping to popularize
wine in the United States by making it easy to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Trinchero, 62, is chairman of Sutter Home Winery, the
sixth-largest winery in the United States. It was built, he proudly
claims, on white zinfandel. ``The first batch come to about 250
cases,'' he said, sipping a glass of it at his headquarters here.
This year the winery will produce almost four million cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the experts wrote the wine off,'' he said, chuckling.
``They said it was a flash in the pan. They were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Sutter Home was a small winery specializing in
full-bodied traditional red zinfandels. In 1972, Trinchero was
looking for ways to give the wines even more intensity. ``So I took
one batch of juice and drained off about 500 gallons before
fermentation to increase the ratio of skins to juice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The juice of almost all red grapes is white; the color comes
from the skins. By draining off some of the clear juice, the
winemaker intensifies the color of what remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fermented the drawn-off juice, barrel-aged it, and sold it
as a curiosity in our tasting room,'' he said. When customers
complained that the wine was too dry, Trinchero began leaving a
small amount of natural sugar in it by stopping fermentation early.
``And that was it,'' he said. ``From that point on, we couldn't
make it fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For a name, Trinchero chose Oeil de Perdrix _ eye of the
partridge _ used sometimes in France for white, or almost white,
wines made from red grapes. When the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms demanded something in English on the label,
Trinchero added, ``A White Zinfandel Wine.'' Three years later, in
1975, he dropped Oeil de Perdrix.
</P>
<P>
   Trinchero and his younger brother, Roger, who is president and
chief executive, make no excuses for their relatively
unsophisticated wine. ``We've brought the pleasures of wine
drinking to millions of people who might be turned off of drier
wines,'' Bob Trinchero said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trincheros also see white zinfandel as a bridge between soft
drinks and more complex table wines. Less than 25 percent of
Americans ever drink any wine at all; only 5 percent drink it
regularly with meals.
</P>
<P>
   Most occasional drinkers prefer light, slightly sweet wine that
can be drunk cold, most of which is white zinfandel. Most of these
drinkers never move up to dry wines.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Sutter Home indicate that 60 percent of its zinfandel
customers stay with that style of wine. About 20 percent go to more
sophisticated, drier wines, and another 20 percent stop drinking
wine, said Stanley Hock, the winery's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Sutter Home winery was founded in 1874 by John Thomann, a
Swiss immigrant. In 1920, Prohibition forced it to close and it
remained so until 1947, when John and Mario Trinchero, Italians who
had first settled in New York City, bought it and began making wine
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a mom-and-pop operation, and we made all kinds of
wines,'' said Bob Trinchero, who is Mario's son. ``The local joke
was that the Trincheros had two tanks, one of red wine and one of
white _ and 52 different labels.''
</P>
<P>
   With 450 employees at three wineries in Napa County, Sutter Home
is no longer a mom-and-pop affair. But it is still a family
business. Bob's wife, Vera, is the company secretary and their four
grown children are all involved in the winery.
</P>
<P>
   The success of white zinfandel, now also made by dozens of
producers in California and Latin America, has led to other light
Sutter Home wines not quite meant for connoisseurs. Soleo is a
chillable light red; Portico is a line of three zinfandels with
added fruit flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1984, Sutter Home owned no vineyards. Since then it has
acquired 4,000 acres of vines and potential vineyard land in 10
California counties. In 1988, Sutter Home bought the Montevina
winery in Amador County and converted it into a producer of mostly
Italian varietal wines.
</P>
<P>
   With the release this year of a line of high quality wines, the
Trincheros, for the first time, will have its name on its bottles.
A 1995 cabernet and a 1996 chardonay bear the name M. Trinchero, in
honor of Mario.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are in the $15-to-$20 range, three to four times the
price of most Sutter Home offerings. ``We're doing it for
ourselves,'' Roger Trinchero said, ``and we're doing it for our
parents, who made it all possible.''

A READY RIOJA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martinez Bujanda Gran Reserva 1990, Rioja, Spain. About $26.
</P>
<P>
   Known best for its Conde de Valdemar wines, the Bodegas Martinez
Bujanda also produces a premium line of wines under its own name.
Principal among them is this Gran Reserva, made from 50 percent
cabernet sauvignon and 50 percent tempranillo, the best of the
native Spanish grapes.
</P>
<P>
   This full-bodied, well-structured wine comes from grapes grown
in Martinez Bujanda vineyards in northern Spain. The wine was aged
in oak for 32 months, then given an additional four and a half
years of aging in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, cabernet was banned in the Rioja
vineyards because it was not a local grape. But the cabernet
tannins add structure, or backbone, to the wine, a quality often
lacking in even the best Riojas.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a better balanced wine. Not surprisingly, after
eight years of preparation, it is ready to drink now.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walking home from the greengrocer along Ninth Avenue,
I pass from a sliver of Korea to outposts of Pakistan, Thailand,
Senegal and Puerto Rico in six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived in Hell's Kitchen for 15 years, I've learned to
measure the world in mere steps. I've also learned to stop and
smell the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the creeping Sohoization of west midtown, there is no
other street in the world that has as much diversity in its ethnic
fare.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to taste the flavors in their fresh-off-the-boat
state, you have to move fast.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization of Times Square has quickened the pace of
assimilation. Ninth Avenue is quickly becoming a test market, where
far-flung flavors are tamed and airbrushed for the mainstream.
Witness the new permutations of pizza _ halal, Korean, Mexican,
Indonesian and dozens of upwardly mobile, too-gourmet-for-you
pizzas _ that have appeared in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can still taste the unmanicured, most recently arrived
flavors, but you have to look south to the tiny storefronts below
42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The area is now able to support several home-style, steam-table
luncheonettes.
</P>
<P>
   At Kashmir 9 (478 Ninth Aven., near 37th Street), the curried
goats' feet and the lamb stewed with lentils are as homegrown as
the Pakistani videos and CDs for sale. The same can be said for the
Himalayas Restaurant (568 Ninth Ave., near 41st Street), home of
Pakistani pizza, where the spice and fire of the steam-table
samosas and the pakoras almost compensate for their oiliness.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans, primarily from the Pueblo region, are dominating the
piecework garment industry at the moment. And their peasant-style
cooking _ definitely on the heavy side _ has, in the last several
years, moved from pushcarts along Eighth and Ninth Avenues into
storefronts like Los Dos Rancheros Mexicanos (507 Ninth Ave., at
38th Street).
</P>
<P>
   With its pinball-like soccer machine in the front window and an
adjoining Mexican grocery, the place has become a community center.
Its inexpensive and delicious barbacoa de chiva (goat barbecue),
posole (hominy and pork soup) and moles have made the place popular
among food aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a steady trickle of South American expatriates has
given the avenue a new world of food. Amazonia (498 Ninth Ave.,
near 38th Street) is a trim storefront playfully festooned with
plastic vines and vivid flowers. It serves up Brazilian soup and a
selection of salads and sandwiches for the terribly hip crowd that
hides behind Ray-Bans during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the avenue, Cafe Brasil (746 Ninth Ave., near 50th
Street) opened over the summer with a wide range of healthy fresh
bebidas, or sweetened fruit juices. The cafe is owned by the same
people who own the three-year-old restaurant Rice 'n' Beans
(cheek-by-jowl at 744 Ninth Ave.), which has recently expanded its
slightly Americanized Brazilian menu.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old Chimichurri Grill (606 Ninth Ave., near 43rd
Street) is a trim little Argentine steakhouse. Who knows whether
it's Argentina's Italian influence or its cautious business-lunch
clients that set the tone. But the truffled mashed potatoes that
accompany the grilled Patagonian tooth fish are nonetheless
delicious, like most of the restaurant's Italianate cooking.
</P>
<P>
   And the concept seems to have been successful enough to inspire
other places. Being an enthusiast but by no means an expert in
Hispanic cooking, I defer to Hispanic magazine, which calls Pomaire
(371 W. 46th St., just off Ninth Avenue) one of the top three
Hispanic restaurants in New York City. This Chilean restaurant is a
fancy, night-on-the-town sort of place, and the sweet meat-and-corn
pie, the shell steak broiled with onions and fried eggs, and the
chicken, potato, squash and rice porridge are scrumptious and
soulful.
</P>
<P>
   There are American specialities, too, in the neighborhood. Soul
Fixins (371 W. 34th St.) offers credible down-home fried chicken
and fish, meatloaf and barbecue. Soul Fixins' sweet potato pie is
the best I've tasted in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun soul reigns at Chantal's Cajun Kitchen (510 Ninth Ave.,
near 38th Street), where the very, very hip join cab drivers, meat
cutters and neighborhood eccentrics to claim the five tables, pick
up plastic forks and dive into very well rendered chicken and
sausage gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   African cooking may well have mothered American soul cooking.
And Chez Gnagna Koty's African Restaurant (530 Ninth Ave., near
39th Street), its front window painted in vivid tempera, draws its
menu from Goree, an island in Senegal. The soft nuttiness of palm
oil pervades the stewy dishes like dakhine, or lamb stewed with
onions and beans in peanut sauce, and even the deep-fried oniony
cake made of black-eyed pea flour.
</P>
<P>
   A Pan-Asian influence is starting to leaven the formulaic
Cantonese bike-basket cuisine. Little Saigon Kitchen (374 W. 46th
St., off Ninth Avenue) serves among the best southern Vietnamese
fare in town, with a more pronounced Indian influence than in
northern cooking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lakuwana (358 W. 44th St., off Ninth Avenue) is, to the best of
my knowledge, one of only two places in the city to serve Sri
Lankan food, a melding of traditional Indian cuisine with Dutch and
Portuguese influences. The lentil soup with coconut, the
rice-flour-and-coconut pancakes called hoppers, which are used to
dip into curries, the roti enriched with grated coconut, and the
rack of lamb with black curry are extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants have improved over time. At Bali Nusa Indah
(651 Ninth Ave., near 46th Street), a slender, quiet and mirrored
place, the otak-otak (fish mousse with spicy peanut sauce),
perkedel jagung (corn and shrimp fritters), sop ikan laut jawa (a
spicy Javanese-style fish soup) and the nutty and powerfully
flavored but light-bodied sambals have grown from ordinary to habit
forming.
</P>
<P>
   The Filipino dishes at Ritz Lauren (537 Ninth Ave., near 40th
Street) are bright in the way this cooking should be and rarely is.
The Continental offerings, though, can be mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   For all the exotic outposts, the neighborhood also has something
for seekers of predictable quick business lunches and staid
pretheater dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described Tex-Mex Fresco Tortillas (766 Ninth Ave.,
near 51st St.) and the Cal-Mex Mama's Fresh Tortillas (857 Ninth
Ave., near 56th Street) are recently opened taquerias that evoke
the magic concept: amalgamated cuisine. This is not to say that the
tacos and burritos are not good; they are, and they are also
inexpensive and filling.
</P>
<P>
   A Thai restaurant explosion has also hit the avenue: at the best
of the recently opened places, Thai Jasmine (860 Ninth Ave., near
56th) and Chanpen Thai (761 Ninth Ave., at 51st Street), the food
is still tame; this is nothing you would find in a secret culinary
haven in back-alley Bangkok. These places seem to be doing some
intra-Asian amalgamating of their own: the Thai fish patties, tod
man, for instance, are difficult to differentiate from the
Indonesian version, and the chicken sate tastes almost the same as
the Pakistani grilled chicken kebab.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the spate of Mediterranean-style restaurants that have
opened along the avenue in the last several years don't recall any
specific old country as much as they pay homage to America's
current infatuation with any old country that serves pasta, pizza,
decent salads and grilled food.
</P>
<P>
   There is also room in Hell's Kitchen for fancier fare. Mitchel
London, the baker and Upper East Side caterer, opened Mitchel
London Foods (542 Ninth Ave., at 40th Street) two months ago and
dishes up a rotating menu, including Parisian-style breakfast
pastries, from his spare storefront in the shadow of Port
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Tiffany prices, after two months, he said, he can't
keep enough food in his shop. When I pass by on my way home in the
evenings, he is usually sold out, and he waves from behind an empty
counter, shaking his head and raising baffled eyes to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   What an ornery unpredictable hodgepodge of a neighborhood. How
could I even think of living anyplace else?

 &HT;    YELTSIN'S HEALTH HIGHLIGHTS RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-YELTSIN-1029.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The probable candidates to succeed Boris Yeltsin as
Russia's president:
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 54, leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   Background: Leader of the opposition in the Duma, parliament's
lower house, Zyuganov was dismissed as politically impotent after
Yeltsin defeated him in the 1996 presidential race. But Zyuganov's
clout has risen since the onset of Russia's financial crisis in
late August. He leads a fractured party, but his popular support
remains strong among the elderly and poor who have not benefited
from Russia's post-Soviet economy. Polls show he is the leading
candidate to replace Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62 mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   Background: The powerful mayor of Moscow is a nationalist who
enjoys strong popularity in Moscow and a reputation for fiercely
protecting the interests of his city and Russia's regional
governments. Luzhkov and Yeltsin mutually endorsed each other's
campaigns in 1996, but the mayor has distanced himself from the
Kremlin since the economic crisis erupted and sought to exploit the
current chaos to his political advantage. He is organizing his
presidential campaign and making political alliances with centrists
in the Duma, and suggesting that Yeltsin should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER LEBED, 48, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region and a
former army general
</P>
<P>
   Background: A tough-as-nails former paratrooper general with a
popular following among nationalists in Russia (he finished third
in the 1996 presidential balloting), Lebed has been one of
Yeltsin's most vocal critics. He has called for Yeltsin's
resignation, and suggested that Russia's army could revolt and its
regional governments could secede if the Kremlin does not move more
quickly to restore economic order.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, former prime minister
</P>
<P>
   Background: Chernomyrdin served as Yeltsin's prime minister from
December 1992 until March OF this year, when he was fired for
failing to fix the economy. He is a political moderate who once
headed the state natural gas monopoly Gazprom, but his credentials
are tarnished. In late summer, he struggled to win confirmation as
Yeltsin's choice again as prime minister. Facing defeat in
parliament, the unpopular Chernomyrdin was shunned in favor of
Yevgeny Primakov.

 &HT;    AILING YELTSIN TO UNDERGO TREATMENT AMID CALLS FOR HIS
RESIGNATION
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-BOX-1029.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Appearing increasingly ill and politically irrelevant,
President Boris Yeltsin was admitted Tuesday to a sanitarium a day
after doctors ordered him to cancel a foreign trip to meet with
European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the medical retreat outside Moscow, Yeltsin, 67, will undergo
``a course of restoration treatment.'' The duration of Yeltsin's
stay will depend on the schedule outlined by doctors, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Long plagued by heart problems and other health complications,
Yeltsin canceled a trip to Vienna suffering from what aides
described as ``unstable blood pressure and undue fatigue'' caused
by his refusal to stop working during his recovery from bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing Russian economic crisis and Yeltsin's poor health
have provoked public demands for his resignation and prompted
several prominent politicians to begin preparations for an election
to succeed him in 2000, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who would become acting
president if Yeltsin were incapacitated, took Yeltsin's place at
the Vienna summit with European Union leaders to discuss Russia's
deep economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's inability to attend was regarded in Moscow as further
evidence that his failing health has left him incapacitated and
unable even to carry out ceremonial duties.
</P>
<P>
   After the economic and political crisis erupted in August,
Yeltsin handed unprecedented authority to Primakov. Yeltsin became
``more of a figurehead in the background. Now, even his figurehead
status is in question,'' said Sergei Kolmakov, a political analyst
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation after his
reelection in 1996. Russian press have speculated broadly that his
current health problems could relate to his heart surgery, or a
history of heavy drinking or old-age dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Yeltsin's ailments have distanced him from
the day-to-day affairs of state and further eroded public
confidence in his ability to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Yeltsin cut short a visit to the Central
Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan after he stumbled during
a ceremony and experienced a coughing fit. He has appeared sluggish
on television, seeming to have difficulty even signing his name to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, despite efforts in recent weeks to portray Yeltsin
as engaged in the job, clearly feared a repeat performance in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   This visit ``would have been a litmus test observed by many
politicians and primarily by (Yeltsin's) opponents,'' said his
spokesman, Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
   The president was anguished over the decision but ``perfectly
realized that everybody would have concentrated on how he moves and
talks instead of following the agenda for the talks,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not want to take the risk because he was
rather upset by having read what the newspapers wrote about him
following his visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,'' Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has come not only from political adversaries, but
from traditional allies, too. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has
begun forming a campaign team for the presidency, this month
publicly questioned Yeltsin's ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``A temporary ailment is one thing, but if a person cannot work
and constantly perform his duties, it is necessary to find enough
will and courage to confess it,'' Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, a retired army general and regional governor
who also harbors presidential aspirations, also has called on
Yeltsin to step down for the good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Kremlin
aides were ``mocking'' Russians by insisting that Yeltsin has no
debilitating illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
on Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical examination and for
the results to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers suggested that Yeltsin's aides were intent on
trying to keep him in office until his term ends in mid-2000 by
making him stay at home and using Primakov as the de facto
president. Leading candidates to replace Yeltsin would benefit by
having time to organize their campaigns and not having to run amid
the chaos of early elections and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the political elite, it appears, there is a non-verbal
pact on the preservation, if possible, of the status quo until the
year 2000,'' the newspaper Sevodnya reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Should Yeltsin fail to serve out his current four-year term,
Primakov would become interim president and elections would be held
within three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have already started their campaign. We are not going to
stand in their way,'' Yakushkin said Tuesday of the jockeying by
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's selection as a compromise candidate for prime
minister in September calmed Russia's political chaos but has done
little to solve its economic problems. The Russian ruble plummeted
in value in late August and the banking system collapsed, cutting
the already low standard of living, and raising fears about fuel
and food supplies for the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   Following his stay at the Barvikha sanatorium, Yeltsin will
probably take a vacation of at least two weeks, his spokesman said,
though it was not clear where or when he will go.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed pictures of Yeltsin meeting at his
Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow with Primakov Tuesday morning
before the prime minister left for Vienna and the president was
admitted to the medical retreat. Yeltsin, wearing a sweater,
appeared tired and smiled little.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Yeltsin will be back on the job after his rest,
Yakushkin said that Yeltsin is still scheduled to meet with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin in Moscow next month.

   WASHINGTON _ Among the proposals for revamping U.S. diplomacy, a
study chaired by former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci urges:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consolidating the American diplomatic corps, which is
currently divided among dozens of U.S. agencies whose officials
work out of embassies in fields such as foreign aid, the
environment and agriculture. The study proposes that all foreign
service officials work under the direction of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A stronger hand for ambassadors, who have little authority
over the various federal agency workers stationed in their
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overhaul embassies, down-sizing some and expanding others to
serve regional roles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Establish a $400 million fund to bring diplomats into the
modern computer age.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reverse the trend of budget cuts for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coordination with businesses, some of which told the panel
that embassies were not crucial to their overseas operations.

 &HT;    RUSTY U.S. DIPLOMATIC SYSTEM NEEDS AN UPDATE, SAY EXPERTS
 &HT;    With EMBASSIES-BOX-1029.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an era in which information moves at the speed
of light and unpredictable security threats lurk around the world,
the creaky machinery of U.S. diplomacy is ``barely out of the
quill-and-scroll stage'' and needs a major overhaul to protect
American interests, a panel of experts warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without greater resources and more modernization, ``we're going
to have increasing foreign policy problems and failures,'' said
Frank Carlucci, former U.S. defense secretary, as he announced the
recommendations of a review conducted by the Henry L. Stimson
Center, a private non-partisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings, the study -- the second such to be released
in as many days -- criticized the U.S. State Department for
continuing to rely on cable-grams in the age of e-mail and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of State State Bonnie Cohen said that her
department welcomed the reports and said that the conclusions were
``deserving of serious consideration'' and would be studied by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   However, several of the recommendations would require a
sea-change for diplomatic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Stimson Center's report challenged the
decades-old credo that the United States should have a full-fledged
embassy for every nation. ``Rather, the number, location and size
of U.S. posts in a given country or region must be configured to
reflect U.S. interests,'' said the report, which called for
rethinking the need for 260 embassies and other overseas posts that
the United States now maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Staffs of the outposts should be ``right-sized,'' with smaller
countries having staffs of three to five members headed up by
``ministers'' instead of ambassadors, and the State Department
could set up mobile teams of diplomats who could provide backup in
emergencies, said the report. Further, it suggests establishing
``magnet embassies'' in regions to specialize in areas such as
environment, health or drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Such streamlining of embassies could provide a partial response
to the increased security concerns for American diplomats,
especially in the aftermath of the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last August that killed more than 250 people.
Since then, U.S. outposts have been the target for numerous
terrorist threats, with the latest one coming in Ukraine, where
officials on Tuesday ordered tightened security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to do is go hide. Our embassies are our
face to the world,'' Carlucci said, but he added that there was a
need to reduce the ``unnecessary'' dangers for American abroad. The
report, titled ``Equipped for the Future,'' concluded that
``right-sizing'' the staffs of embassies and consulates ``will help
ensure that the minimum number of American personnel are put at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In its call for modernizing American diplomacy, the Stimson
Center study reinforced the findings of another private research
group, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which on
Monday issued a call for ``Reinventing Diplomacy in the Information
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct of American diplomacy faces unacceptable
performance gaps between its outdated practices and the
requirements of the new age of information,'' concluded the CSIS
study, in calling for updating computers, raising professional
standards for diplomats, and improving relations with the news
media, business and private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies focused sharply on antiquated communications
equipment. ``It is ironic that the nation which has done more than
any other to bring the world into the information age still
conducts much of its diplomatic activities via cable,'' the Stimson
Center report said and recommended spending $400 million for modern
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The funding would ``go a long way to modernize'' the State
Department's systems, said Cohen, who oversees management for the
department. She acknowledged that many in her department are still
using Wang computers, several years after that company quit the
word-processing business.

 &HT;    AID GROUPS SEE REFUGEES TRICKLE BACK INTO KOSOVO AS SERB TROOPS
PULL BACK
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Amid signs that Serb forces were pulling out of Kosovo,
humanitarian aid groups there were encouraged Tuesday by the sight
of ethnic Albanian refugees starting to make their way back to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we saw hope in their eyes instead of
fear,'' said Terry Heselius, the head of the Mercy Corps
International's office in Pristina, the embattled province's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The return of 250,000 to 500,000 refugees to their homes before
winter would dramatically reduce the challenge faced by the
approximately 30 aid groups amassed in Pristina. As long as the
ethnic Albanians remained in the open or in temporary shelter, aid
workers could do little more than struggle to provide basic
subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   Even badly damaged homes provide better shelter than either the
woods or temporary lodging with already struggling host families,
aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the logistical nightmare of serving a hugely,
poorly counted population of wandering refugees becomes far more
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get them on a monthly distribution cycle as opposed to
running around after them,'' said Mick Lorentzen of the World Food
Program's Pristina office.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a jumbo cargo jet filled with relief supplies landed
at the Pristina airport, which had been closed for several months
because of the fighting. It was an heartening sign for air workers
who have feared the worst for the thousands of refugees who fled
there homes during eight months of fighting between Serb forces and
Kosovo separatists. On the flight was Hugh Palmer, the head of the
U.S. A I D.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military leaders withdrew their forces from Kosovo in large
numbers Tuesday, and NATO was preparing to take a step back from
its threat of imminent air strikes against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration said the Serbs were in
``substantial compliance'' with the Kosovo peace accord. And the
NATO secretary-general said it appeared Serb forces were
redeploying in the embattled province, as demanded by Western
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 90 percent of the security force reinforcements''
have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been dismantled and
heavy weapons have been returned to garrison, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said. ``As we see this substantial compliance, we also
need to make sure that coming into compliance isn't the only issue.
We need to send the message that he needs to stay in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb
sources as saying the Serb withdrawal was complete and that
government forces in Kosovo were back to the level before Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown against ethnic
Albanian militants on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they encountered few Serb police or soldiers
during Tuesday's convoys from Pristina to places where refugees
have congregated. ``The checkpoints seem to be coming down,''
Heselius said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Pagarushe, where more than 15,000 refugees had
made a makeshift town of clear plastic tents, Heselius said there
was strong evidence of progress Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people living in the plastic village are packing up and
heading home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials seemed satisfied by the Serb withdrawal Tuesday,
but will retain the authority to use force should the Serbs renege
on their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no air raids,'' Amadeo de Franchis, Italy's
envoy to NATO, told the BBC. ``There will be a consensus that there
has been sufficient (Serbian) compliance for these air raids not to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO
nations agreed to indefinitely extend the ``activation order''
keeping over 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and
maintain forces,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision would maintain pressure on Milosevic as it
appeared his troops were complying with the alliance's demand for
troop redeployments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana told
reporters. ``The security forces are returning to the level they
were at before the present crisis began.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated with
Milosevic, said the Serbs' performance so far looked good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I hate to use the 'O' word in the Balkans, but there
is reason for some more optimism than we've had in the past,''
Holbrooke told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb security forces are pulling out,'' he said. ``The
international verification regime is pouring in. The (Serbs) have
allowed Kosovo, which they have always said was their private
backyard, to become an international issue and once the
international community is in there, it is going to make a huge
difference in stabilizing the situation.''

by his refusal to stop working during his recovery from bronchitis.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ In Texas, the long winding road that leads to the
ultimate hamburger ends in Amarillo, at a place called Arnold
Burgers. There, in the state where beef is king and the hamburger
its most perfect culinary expression, Arnold's delivers the goods
in spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's standard-issue hamburger, the Arnold Double
Burger, requires two slices of cheese to cover a
five-and-a-half-inch patty. Multiplied by two, that adds up to a
pound an a half of meat per burger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a triple-meat, too,'' Gayla Arnold, the owner, said.
That's a full faceful of beef. But for the total hamburger
experience, the ground-beef equivalent of surround-sound, Arnold's
makes a burger that feeds 12 to 18. More than this, a hamburger
cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   What the croissant is to France, what goulash is to Hungary,
what pickled herring is to Sweden, the hamburger is to Texas. It's
a symbol, a necessity and a triumph, a part of the cultural
patrimony so tightly woven into the fabric of Texas life that
Texans themselves do not even remark on it until they are presented
with the gray-tinged, underfurnished, suspiciously geometric
hamburger that the rest of America lives with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest shock of my life was in New York, where they
served me a hamburger with no lettuce and tomato,'' said Ann
Criswell, the longtime food editor of The Houston Chronicle and a
third-generation Texan. ``I thought that was so'' _ she searched
for the right word and settled on ``primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans love beef, and when they order a hamburger, they expect
to see a lot of it on their plate _ freshly ground, cooked right
and tasting like meat, not soybeans. Cooked right _ and this is the
key to the Texas burger _ means seared on a grill until it gets
crisp on the outside while remaining juicy inside, even if the
patty is extra thin, a popular Texas style.
</P>
<P>
   Thick or thin, the burger must be served on a bun that's toasted
until the perimeter gets a nice crunch to it, and then piled high
with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, pickles and raw onions. Mustard and
mayonnaise go on the bun, but never ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, of course, claims that it invented the hamburger,
sometime back in the 1880s. A historical marker in the town of
Athens, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, marks the spot where
Fletcher Davis, the owner of a local cafe, first served fried
patties between two slices of bread, garnished with a slice of
Bermuda onion, pickles, mustard and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Local lore has it that Old Dave, as Davis was known, backed by a
consortium of local businessmen, took his sandwich to the 1904
world's fair in St. Louis, where he set up a concession on the
midway, called Old Dave's Hamburger Stand, and presented America
with one of its most enduring culinary classics.
</P>
<P>
   It should not to be confused with the Hamburg steak served in
fancy restaurants in the mid-19th century, which was a kind of
Swedish meatball doused in sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The legend may be fact. A photograph of the stand exists, and a
reporter from The New York Tribune wrote enthusiastically about the
new sandwich, although he neglected to mention Old Dave. Making
matters worse, he misinterpreted Old Dave's explanation of the
fried potatoes that came with the burger.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that he had learned to cook the fries from a friend
in Paris, meaning Paris, Texas The reporter filed a story saying
that the hamburgers were being served with ``French fried
potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Originator or not, Texas took the ball and ran with it. ``My
theory is that before oil, cattle was the economic machine of
Texas,'' said Robb Walsh, a Texan who writes a food column for
Natural History magazine. ``The culture came out of the cattle, but
the cattle were tough. Hamburger and chicken-fried steak became the
way to eat Texas beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Tender steaks came from Midwestern cattle, fattened on feed
lots. The restless grazing cattle that roamed the range demanded
radical grinding or pounding to make their meat edible.
</P>
<P>
   The hamburger put down deep roots all across the state, so deep
that even the forces of modernization can't quite pull them up.
Texans probably eat as many fast-food hamburgers as anyone else,
just as Parisians (the French ones) put up with substandard
baguettes, but there is a strong residual prejudice in favor of
joints over chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in trouble if the place looks too clean and nice, and
there's a mom with her kids,'' said Michael R. Levy, the publisher
of Texas Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This is not purely a matter of nostalgia. Texans know that a
ramshackle shed off the side of some Godforsaken stretch of country
road could very well be turning out a succulent beef burger tweaked
with some roasted chili peppers, or smeared with a fiery salsa, or
_ well, who knows? In Texas, the house of the hamburger has many
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   At Kitok's, a 16-table establishment in Waco, customers come
from as far as Dallas or Austin for the double-meat Liplocker with
cheese, a no-nonsense production that features two thinnish, but
not ultra-thin, hand-shaped patties seared to a nice crunch and
dressed with just enough tomato, pickle, onion and lettuce to let
the full meat flavor come through.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers order their Liplockers with Oriental fries, an
imposing haystack of matchstick-thin vegetables dipped in tempura
batter and deep-fried. The fries are an invention of the owner, a
Korean woman named Kitok Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Tookie's Restaurant in Seabrook, near Houston, serves several
idiosyncratic hamburgers, all of them memorable. Stomp's Ice House
Special comes with a topping of picante sauce, chopped jalapeno
peppers, chopped grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glorious mess of a burger, but it is rivaled by the
Squealer, which incorporates hickory-smoked bacon in the ground
beef, and the 99, made with ground beef that has been sitting for a
couple of days in a spicy wine marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road, at the Goode Company Hamburgers and Taqueria in
Houston, the truly superior burgers get a distinctive tang from
cooking over mesquite and charcoal instead of the usual gas.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, local pride coalesces around the beanburger, a
standard Texas burger that has been jazzed up with refried pinto
beans, melted cheese and crushed Fritos. It's a 1950s innovation
that has generated its own variations, like beanburgers with
refried black beans, or beanburgers with guacamole topping.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneleigh P, in Dallas, has taken the Texas hamburger about as
up-market as it can go without looking like a dude. The house's
signature burger, the Stoneleigh P, is a six-ounce patty served on
a dome-shaped pumpernickel roll with lettuce, tomato, red onion,
garlic mayonnaise and creole mustard.
</P>
<P>
   The patty comes from the B3R Ranch in the Texas Panhandle. The
restaurant also sells a Rancho Deluxe, a full eight ounces of meat
presented on an Italian rustica bun and coated with chipotle
mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Most places like to surround their burgers with an air of
mystery, and some chefs seem honestly bemused at their own
creations. ``I used to think it was the cook,'' said Paul Grubbs,
the bartender at Adair's Saloon in Dallas. ``But the cook left, and
the burgers still taste the same. I think it's just because we've
got a good old grill _ that, and we cook them slow. It takes 20
minutes to cook a hamburger here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adair's burger is a serious candidate for the best burger in
Texas. It is thick, pink in the center, juicy and flavorful.
Aggressively seasoned with salt and pepper, it is served with a
plump, shiny jalapeno pepper on top.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the grill reaches an extreme at Al's Hamburgers in
Arlington, near Fort Worth. Back in 1957, Al Matthews opened his
first restaurant, a drive-in, where the thin-patty burgers were
cooked on a 1947 vintage cast-iron grill. When the lease ran out on
Al's in the early 1980s and a shopping-mall developer took over the
sacred space that Al's had become (4,000 people attended Al's
farewell party), Matthews took his grill with him, stored it and
brought it out again when he opened a new place in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It performed valiantly until it developed a serious crack a few
years ago and had to be retired, whereupon Matthews hunted up some
old replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al will not cook on a new grill,'' his wife, Thelma, said.
``He wants it seasoned.'' A seasoned grill, most chefs agree,
accumulates subtle flavors that the burgers pick up while they
sizzle. Matthews, therefore, rubs his grill down gently, with steel
wool and a little oil. ``I don't ever scrape it,'' he said. ``You
see some people using a brick to clean one, but I don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Matthews, however, says the grill is overrated as a factor.
Fresh ingredients count for a lot more. ``We use fresh ground chuck
that is delivered every day, and we cook it well done and fast,
searing it the way you would a sirloin.''
</P>
<P>
   Al's used to serve burgers with a meat-to-fat ratio of 80-20
but, in a concession to health consciousness, it reluctantly
switched to chuck that is 89 to 92 percent lean. The Matthewses do
not use newfangled bun-toasting machines, preferring to put the
buns on the grill and then transferring the bun tops to the patties
in the final stages of cooking, so that they pick up the fragrant
steam from the burgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you might think is grease from the burger is actually
condensation,'' Mrs. Matthews said. Matthews, eyeing a customer's
single-meat cheeseburger, shook his head and said: ``You ordered
the wrong one. The double cheeseburger is juicier and better
flavored, although I can't tell you why.''
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that it may have something to do with the juices
dripping from the top patty and being absorbed by the second one.
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Arnold, of Arnold's, says she knows exactly why her
hamburgers are good, but she can't quite bring herself to surrender
the details. ``The meat has a certain grind on it that a local
market does for us, and a local bakery does our big buns,'' she
said. ``I don't like to say too much because a lot of local
restaurants would like to copy our burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, analysis can take you only so far in getting to the
heart of the Texas hamburger. ``This is complex, like asking what
makes Clinton tick,'' Levy, of Texas Monthly, said. ``It's about
the variations in the bread, the accumulation of grease on the
grill, the level of grime in the restaurant. It should be cooked in
grease to the extent that when you get within 25 yards of the
hamburger stand itself, your heart is getting angry.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of burger, artisanal and irregular, still thrives in
Texas, and it can be found in all sorts of unexpected places, from
gas stations to bowling alleys, like the Palace Lanes in southwest
Houston or Showplace Lanes in north Austin, where the featured
burger is a Double Striker.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid's, in Fort Worth, which routinely turns up at the top of
the state's best-burger lists, started out in 1946 as a grocery
store. As a way to use up his leftover beef, Charles Kincaid, the
owner, began grilling hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, hamburger operations had prevailed. Patrons now
step up and place their orders at what used to be the meat counter.
The store's shelves were shortened and converted into stand-up
eating counters.
</P>
<P>
   The same transformation may be taking place at Forget Me Nots,
an antique store in Timpson, not far from the Louisiana border in
east-central Texas. At the back of the store, Brenda MacKey, the
owner, has wedged four tables and a counter into what used to be a
back porch and now bears the name Back Porch Deli.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing deli about it; it's pure Texas. When customers
step up to the counter and order a cheeseburger, Ms. MacKey asks,
``You want that all the way?'' Something in her tone suggests that
all the way is the only possible way to go, and that's how it turns
out.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, after the outdoor grill has given forth a
cloud of smoke and a ball of fire, the $3.89, all-the-way burger
hits the plate, and it's a beauty: eight ounces of fresh beef
sitting on an extra-wide toasted bun and fully loaded with lettuce,
tomato, dill-pickle slices, raw onion rings, mustard and
mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere else in America, Ms. MacKey's all-the-way production
would cause a sensation. In Texas, it's exactly what people
expect. &QL;

blender. Combine egg, pinch of salt, cayenne, lemon juice, garlic
and mustard. Process briefly to mix well. With the blender at

QUESADILLAS, SALSAS AND MORE  
 PIZZA GHOSTS  
 PORCINI OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA  
 CALLING ON GOAT CURD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You just have to look on the shelves of a supermarket
to see the popularity of prepared Mexican food. And skyrocketing
sales of salsa confirm it. For the last six years, Authentico, a
New York company started on a shoestring by Myra and Craig Dalland,
has made first-rate products without preservatives, lard or
vegetable shortening. They include sauces, tortillas, tamales and
quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Dallands moved from Manhattan, where they
were cooking their products in the kitchen of another caterer, to a
larger space in Long Island City, Queens. In addition to fancy food
shops, they now sell to Northwest Airlines and Kings Super Markets
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Some new items, which are fresh, not frozen, and can be heated
in minutes, include a mellow quesadilla of cheese and squash
blossoms; a quesadilla with plantains and mole poblano that plays
sweetness off heat; a fajita stuffed with portobello mushrooms, and
a richly spicy tamale filled with chilies and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Authentico also has new salsas, including a forceful, dark one
of tomatoes and pasilla chilies, a chunky Oaxaca-style mix of smoky
chipotles and onions that packs plenty of fire, and a nutty, tangy
green pipian verde.
</P>
<P>
   The salsas are $3 to $4 for 8 ounces; the other products are $2
to $4 each. The complete line is sold at Commodities Natural Foods,
117 Hudson St. (North Moore Street), and at Zabar's, 80th Street
and Broadway. Other sources are Amish Market, 731 Ninth Ave. (49th
Street), and the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st St.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Ghosts
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Halloween goodies are everywhere. But for something
different, Pintaile's Pizza, home of the heart-shaped pie for
Valentine's Day, has placed mozzarella ``ghosts'' on a marinara
base on one of its pizzas. Another has an orange jack-o'-lantern of
American cheese on top.
</P>
<P>
   The pies, $15 for a 16-inch pizza, will be made through Sunday
and must be ordered at least a day in advance. Delivery is
available. Pintaile's is at 26 East 91st St., 1577 York Ave. (84th
Street), 1443 York Ave. (77th Street) and 124 Fourth Ave. (13th
Street).
</P>
<P>
   Porcini out of South Africa
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new source for meaty porcini mushrooms, a joy of
fall, is Urbani Truffle of Long Island City. It imports fresh
porcini mushrooms from South Africa and Zimbabwe. Rosario Safina,
owner of the company, said these mushrooms grow high in the
mountains, and thus are never attacked by the worms that sometimes
ruin mushroom crops at lower elevations.
</P>
<P>
   They are $28 a pound at Urbani, 29-24 40th Ave., Long Island
City, Queens. They can be ordered for free delivery within 24 hours
(minimum 1 pound) from (800) 281-2330. The porcini are also sold
for $19.95 a pound at Gourmet Garage, 453 Broome St. (Mercer
Street); 301 East 64th St., and 2567 Broadway (96th Street).
</P>
<P>
   Calling on Goat Curd
</P>
<P>
   Laura Chenel, who in the early 1980s was one of the first
Americans to make French-style goat's-milk cheeses, has 500 goats
on her farm in Sonoma County, Calif. They are not enough to meet
the demand, so she is importing goat-milk curd from Norway to
increase production. The curd comes from Norwegian Dairies, which
makes Jarlsberg, a cow's-milk cheese, and gjetost, a dark brown,
sweet-tasting goat-milk cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The new Laura Chenel Select Norwegian chevre is a pleasant,
undemanding cheese that is fresh and smooth. It is available in
supermarkets for about $4 for a 4-ounce log.

 &HT;    YELTSIN'S HEALTH HIGHLIGHTS RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-YELTSIN-1028.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The probable candidates to succeed Boris Yeltsin as
Russia's president:
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 54, leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   Background: Leader of the opposition in the Duma, parliament's
lower house, Zyuganov was dismissed as politically impotent after
Yeltsin defeated him in the 1996 presidential race. But Zyuganov's
clout has risen since the onset of Russia's financial crisis in
late August. He leads a fractured party, but his popular support
remains strong among the elderly and poor who have not benefited
from Russia's post-Soviet economy. Polls show he is the leading
candidate to replace Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   YURI LUZHKOV, 62 mayor of Moscow and business tycoon
</P>
<P>
   Background: The powerful mayor of Moscow is a nationalist who
enjoys strong popularity in Moscow and a reputation for fiercely
protecting the interests of his city and Russia's regional
governments. Luzhkov and Yeltsin mutually endorsed each other's
campaigns in 1996, but the mayor has distanced himself from the
Kremlin since the economic crisis erupted and sought to exploit the
current chaos to his political advantage. He is organizing his
presidential campaign and making political alliances with centrists
in the Duma, and suggesting that Yeltsin should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ALEXANDER LEBED, 48, governor of the Krasnoyarsk region and a
former army general
</P>
<P>
   Background: A tough-as-nails former paratrooper general with a
popular following among nationalists in Russia (he finished third
in the 1996 presidential balloting), Lebed has been one of
Yeltsin's most vocal critics. He has called for Yeltsin's
resignation, and suggested that Russia's army could revolt and its
regional governments could secede if the Kremlin does not move more
quickly to restore economic order.
</P>
<P>
   VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN, 60, former prime minister
</P>
<P>
   Background: Chernomyrdin served as Yeltsin's prime minister from
December 1992 until March OF this year, when he was fired for
failing to fix the economy. He is a political moderate who once
headed the state natural gas monopoly Gazprom, but his credentials
are tarnished. In late summer, he struggled to win confirmation as
Yeltsin's choice again as prime minister. Facing defeat in
parliament, the unpopular Chernomyrdin was shunned in favor of
Yevgeny Primakov.

 &HT;    AILING YELTSIN TO UNDERGO TREATMENT AMID CALLS FOR HIS
RESIGNATION
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-BOX-1028.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Appearing increasingly ill and politically irrelevant,
President Boris Yeltsin was admitted Tuesday to a sanitarium a day
after doctors ordered him to cancel a foreign trip to meet with
European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the medical retreat outside Moscow, Yeltsin, 67, will undergo
``a course of restoration treatment.'' The duration of Yeltsin's
stay will depend on the schedule outlined by doctors, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Long plagued by heart problems and other health complications,
Yeltsin canceled a trip to Vienna suffering from what aides
described as ``unstable blood pressure and undue fatigue'' caused
by his refusal to stop working during his recovery from bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing Russian economic crisis and Yeltsin's poor health
have provoked public demands for his resignation and prompted
several prominent politicians to begin preparations for an election
to succeed him in 2000, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who would become acting
president if Yeltsin were incapacitated, took Yeltsin's place at
the Vienna summit with European Union leaders to discuss Russia's
deep economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's inability to attend was regarded in Moscow as further
evidence that his failing health has left him incapacitated and
unable even to carry out ceremonial duties.
</P>
<P>
   After the economic and political crisis erupted in August,
Yeltsin handed unprecedented authority to Primakov. Yeltsin became
``more of a figurehead in the background. Now, even his figurehead
status is in question,'' said Sergei Kolmakov, a political analyst
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin underwent a quintuple heart bypass operation after his
reelection in 1996. Russian press have speculated broadly that his
current health problems could relate to his heart surgery, or a
history of heavy drinking or old-age dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Yeltsin's ailments have distanced him from
the day-to-day affairs of state and further eroded public
confidence in his ability to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Yeltsin cut short a visit to the Central
Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan after he stumbled during
a ceremony and experienced a coughing fit. He has appeared sluggish
on television, seeming to have difficulty even signing his name to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, despite efforts in recent weeks to portray Yeltsin
as engaged in the job, clearly feared a repeat performance in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   This visit ``would have been a litmus test observed by many
politicians and primarily by (Yeltsin's) opponents,'' said his
spokesman, Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
   The president was anguished over the decision but ``perfectly
realized that everybody would have concentrated on how he moves and
talks instead of following the agenda for the talks,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not want to take the risk because he was
rather upset by having read what the newspapers wrote about him
following his visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,'' Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has come not only from political adversaries, but
from traditional allies, too. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has
begun forming a campaign team for the presidency, this month
publicly questioned Yeltsin's ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``A temporary ailment is one thing, but if a person cannot work
and constantly perform his duties, it is necessary to find enough
will and courage to confess it,'' Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, a retired army general and regional governor
who also harbors presidential aspirations, also has called on
Yeltsin to step down for the good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that Kremlin
aides were ``mocking'' Russians by insisting that Yeltsin has no
debilitating illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Yeltsin's inability to work has been obvious to us for
quite a long time,'' Zyuganov said at a news conference. He called
on Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical examination and for
the results to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers suggested that Yeltsin's aides were intent on
trying to keep him in office until his term ends in mid-2000 by
making him stay at home and using Primakov as the de facto
president. Leading candidates to replace Yeltsin would benefit by
having time to organize their campaigns and not having to run amid
the chaos of early elections and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the political elite, it appears, there is a non-verbal
pact on the preservation, if possible, of the status quo until the
year 2000,'' the newspaper Sevodnya reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Should Yeltsin fail to serve out his current four-year term,
Primakov would become interim president and elections would be held
within three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have already started their campaign. We are not going to
stand in their way,'' Yakushkin said Tuesday of the jockeying by
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's selection as a compromise candidate for prime
minister in September calmed Russia's political chaos but has done
little to solve its economic problems. The Russian ruble plummeted
in value in late August and the banking system collapsed, cutting
the already low standard of living, and raising fears about fuel
and food supplies for the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   Following his stay at the Barvikha sanatorium, Yeltsin will
probably take a vacation of at least two weeks, his spokesman said,
though it was not clear where or when he will go.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed pictures of Yeltsin meeting at his
Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow with Primakov Tuesday morning
before the prime minister left for Vienna and the president was
admitted to the medical retreat. Yeltsin, wearing a sweater,
appeared tired and smiled little.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Yeltsin will be back on the job after his rest,
Yakushkin said that Yeltsin is still scheduled to meet with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin in Moscow next month.

   WASHINGTON _ Among the proposals for revamping U.S. diplomacy, a
study chaired by former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci urges:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consolidating the American diplomatic corps, which is
currently divided among dozens of U.S. agencies whose officials
work out of embassies in fields such as foreign aid, the
environment and agriculture. The study proposes that all foreign
service officials work under the direction of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A stronger hand for ambassadors, who have little authority
over the various federal agency workers stationed in their
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overhaul embassies, down-sizing some and expanding others to
serve regional roles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Establish a $400 million fund to bring diplomats into the
modern computer age.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    AID GROUPS SEE REFUGEES TRICKLE BACK INTO KOSOVO AS SERB TROOPS
PULL BACK
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Amid signs that Serb forces were pulling out of Kosovo,
humanitarian aid groups there were encouraged Tuesday by the sight
of ethnic Albanian refugees starting to make their way back to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we saw hope in their eyes instead of
fear,'' said Terry Heselius, the head of the Mercy Corps
International's office in Pristina, the embattled province's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The return of 250,000 to 500,000 refugees to their homes before
winter would dramatically reduce the challenge faced by the
approximately 30 aid groups amassed in Pristina. As long as the
ethnic Albanians remained in the open or in temporary shelter, aid
workers could do little more than struggle to provide basic
subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   Even badly damaged homes provide better shelter than either the
woods or temporary lodging with already struggling host families,
aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the logistical nightmare of serving a hugely,
poorly counted population of wandering refugees becomes far more
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get them on a monthly distribution cycle as opposed to
running around after them,'' said Mick Lorentzen of the World Food
Program's Pristina office.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a jumbo cargo jet filled with relief supplies landed
at the Pristina airport, which had been closed for several months
because of the fighting. It was an heartening sign for air workers
who have feared the worst for the thousands of refugees who fled
there homes during eight months of fighting between Serb forces and
Kosovo separatists. On the flight was Hugh Palmer, the head of the
U.S. A I D.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military leaders withdrew their forces from Kosovo in large
numbers Tuesday, and NATO was preparing to take a step back from
its threat of imminent air strikes against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said, ``As a result of the
improving security climate, up to 40,000 displaced people already
have been returned to their homes from the mountains, escaping the
mortal jeopardy of a winter without shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said as the cease-fire holds, ``more humanitarian relief
workers and international verifiers move into Kosovo, Serb forces
stay out, and roadblocks and checkpoints stay down, the confidence
level of the remaining displaced people should now increase, and
they too will be able to come in from the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Private radio station B-92 quoted Serb
sources as saying the Serb withdrawal was complete and that
government forces in Kosovo were back to the level before Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched his crackdown against ethnic
Albanian militants on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they encountered few Serb police or soldiers
during Tuesday's convoys from Pristina to places where refugees
have congregated. ``The checkpoints seem to be coming down,''
Heselius said.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Pagarushe, where more than 15,000 refugees had
made a makeshift town of clear plastic tents, Heselius said there
was strong evidence of progress Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people living in the plastic village are packing up and
heading home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials seemed satisfied by the Serb withdrawal Tuesday,
but will retain the authority to use force should the Serbs renege
on their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no air raids,'' Amadeo de Franchis, Italy's
envoy to NATO, told the BBC. ``There will be a consensus that there
has been sufficient (Serbian) compliance for these air raids not to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO
nations agreed to indefinitely extend the ``activation order''
keeping over 400 allied warplanes on alert for possible raids
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have instructed our military to remain prepared ... and
maintain forces,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision would maintain pressure on Milosevic as it
appeared his troops were complying with the alliance's demand for
troop redeployments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' Solana told
reporters. ``The security forces are returning to the level they
were at before the present crisis began.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated with
Milosevic, said the Serbs' performance so far looked good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I hate to use the 'O' word in the Balkans, but there
is reason for some more optimism than we've had in the past,''
Holbrooke told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb security forces are pulling out,'' he said. ``The
international verification regime is pouring in. The (Serbs) have
allowed Kosovo, which they have always said was their private
backyard, to become an international issue and once the
international community is in there, it is going to make a huge
difference in stabilizing the situation.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The possible impeachment of President Clinton
floats like a pewter thundercloud over the elections next Tuesday,
and yet the common wisdom holds that not enough political rain will
fall from that scandal to drown out ordinary local issues.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval rating remains incredibly high at 65
percent in recent polls, and two thirds of the voters say they
don't want him to be impeached. Furthermore, nearly half of the
voters disapprove of the job Republican congressional leaders are
doing, and 52 percent say the GOP has pushed too hard for Clinton's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impeachment in the week before the election remains a
minor campaign sideshow rather than the central focus it has been
for months in Washington and will become again when the election is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The major pollsters agree that voters are not factoring the
president's fate into their thinking this fall. This is not a
referendum on Bill Clinton, whose name is not on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Voters do not seem prepared to lurch collectively either to the
right or left but to leave Congress pretty much as they found it.
They are not plotting to shape a new legislative body radically
different from the present one in order to ensure a dramatic
impact, one way or the other, on the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The once-anticipated GOP landslide now looks like a pickup of
perhaps fewer than 10 in the House and 2 in the Senate. The
Republicans would remain in control of both bodies but be left with
at best a 21-seat margin in the House, still too slim to achieve
the conservative revolution they once promised. Under this
scenario, they would also fall short in the Senate of having enough
votes to shut off filibusters by the minority Democrats seeking to
block GOP legislation they don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Such a modest shift would not change the internal dynamics of
either body very much, or of Capitol Hill's fractious relationship
with Clinton. But it could send a signal to Congress that it might
be good politics to figure out some way of punishing him short of a
prolonged impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Republicans to gain huge new majorities, they would be
emboldened to go after Clinton with a vengeance, pushing for
impeachment in the House and a trial in the Senate. And Democrats
would run scared from a president they had no power to defend.
</P>
<P>
   A muddled vote for essentially the status quo signifies not just
a public desire to retain divided government _ a Democratic
president and a Republican Congress _ but to balance the power
between the two parties so that one cannot destroy the other.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in both parties have been nervous about even
mentioning the impeachment question. Republicans are very much
aware that the polls suggest a backlash if they appear overeager to
raise lying under oath about illicit sex to a constitutional
offense. Democrats are leery of being tagged the party of
immorality if they call too much attention to their affiliation
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators think there may be retroactive clues to voter
mood in the fate of the 31 House Democrats who voted with the
Republicans to launch impeachment hearings. But the legislators all
voted the way they felt their constituents would want. If they read
that correctly, they should survive.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as always, politics is local.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senators in deepest trouble were in trouble
before the world heard of Monica Lewinsky, because of their own
personal political problems. The Democratic House members in
trouble were also in trouble long ago because generally Republicans
have more campaign money than Democrats, the midterm historical
trend is against them and the country is increasingly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Voter apathy this year works in favor of incumbents of both
parties. But the size of the turnout among supporters of various
causes and philosophies can tip the outcome one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Only fools and super-confident pollsters go out on a limb with
predictions a week before an election. There is still plenty of
time for surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But it does seem settled that voters are sick of Clinton's
behavior, sick of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's pursuit of
him, sick of exaggerated political attempts to compare Clinton's
conduct with that of Richard Nixon and sick of congressional
hypocrisy on the subject. A plague on all their houses.
</P>
<P>
   But unless voters are collectively sublimating their real
intentions, this election is about other things.

HUNTER'S ROLES ARE LOUD WITH LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Holly Hunter specializes in playing live wires.
</P>
<P>
   Her path was set in the 1984 stage role that made her famous: a
feisty contestant in the off-Broadway play ``The Miss Firecracker
Contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter goaded Nicolas Cage into kidnapping a baby for her in
1987's ``Raising Arizona,'' and was especially memorable that same
year as a high-strung, high-powered television producer in
``Broadcast News.'' Attempting to seduce her, the pretty-boy
``News'' anchor played by William Hurt whispered, ``I'd love to be
inside all that energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in her Oscar-winning performance in 1993's ``The Piano,''
Hunter communicated her character's spunk without speaking, through
her eyes and the way she pounded the ivories.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish Hunter's talent, but being energetic seems to be
her natural state.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, she prowls her hotel room as she chatters
away. Hunter, 40, grew up in Georgia and still has a Southern
accent, but she talks as fast as a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Her mind jumps around from her new film, ``Living Out Loud,'' in
which she plays another pistol, to her new dress. The 5-foot-2
actress looks even thinner than her 100 pounds in a black sarong by
her favorite designer, Vera Wang, who also made the wisp of a dress
Hunter wore to pick up her Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call Vera and I say, `I've got a thing to go to,' and she
sends me a dress in a box. It always fits. It's so easy,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Her best lines are played across the room to her husband, Janusz
Kaminski, a Polish-born cinematographer who often works with Steven
Spielberg, including on ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Kaminski met
Hunter at the New York Film Critics award ceremony when she won for
``The Piano.'' They married four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They're so tight he almost always goes with her to work-related
events like the Toronto International Film Festival, where ``Living
Out Loud'' was shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very sweet man in this regard _ in all regards,
really,'' Hunter says, smiling in his direction. ``It's lovely to
have some kind of trusting thing in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her state of marital bliss, there's no question that
Hunter was acting in her two most recent roles.
</P>
<P>
   She's currently on the New York stage in ``Impossible
Marriage,'' playing a woman in a difficult relationship with an
older man. Like ``The Miss Firecracker Contest,'' the play was
written by Beth Henley. ``We go back forever,'' Hunter says.
``She's been totally pivotal to my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Living Out Loud,'' Hunter plays Judith, a wealthy doctor's
wife whose husband leaves her for a younger woman. The movie, which
co-stars Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah, is the first to be
directed by Richard LaGravenese, a highly regarded screenwriter who
worked wonders adapting ``The Bridges of Madison County'' and
``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Judith was really well-written, and I don't read a
lot of those,'' Hunter says, explaining why she took the role. ``I
loved the subtlety of the story. It's about an internal conflict
rather than an external one where there's a predator. The problem
was inside her.''
</P>
<P>
   She got to put in her two cents about how Judith should look and
act. ``I said I want her to be a major, major blonde,'' recalls
Hunter, whose hair is startlingly platinum in the movie. It was
also her idea that Judith smoke, as politically incorrect as that
is these days.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Hillary Rodham Clinton objected to Julia Roberts'
character smoking in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' Hunter says she
doesn't think the first lady will weigh in this time. ``Smoking
probably feels minor to Hillary right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter believes her most important contribution to Judith
was to make her feisty even during the humiliating aftermath of a
divorce that wasn't her idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to give her strength from the beginning. I did
not want her life to happen to her. I wanted her to take charge of
it. If Judith was going to fall off the ledge, I wanted it to be
because she stepped off, not because she was pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter accomplishes this in little ways. When Judith goes to an
expensive restaurant by herself, she looks utterly comfortable
reading a book instead of anxious that people are staring at her.
And when she ends up at a women-only club late at night when
everyone is letting loose on the dance floor, she joins right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that number on the dance floor. It was a delight,''
Hunter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' gave her a chance to explore what it would
be like to live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. ``A lot of
people really do live alone in Manhattan. It's actually quite easy
to be anonymous, to live a life that is unexamined by others even
though there's a ton of people there. That's one of the provocative
things about New York that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moviegoers may wonder whether a wealthy divorced woman like
Judith would consider a romance with her apartment building's
elevator operator, especially one who looks like DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she absolutely would,'' Hunter insists. ``Classism
doesn't really interest me very much as an actress. The only time I
might want to explore it is if I was doing a French restoration
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   With her continued interest in the theater, Hunter could be
appearing in such a comedy one day. Unlike other movie stars who
talk about how much they would love to be in a play but never do
one, Hunter makes an effort to return to the stage every couple of
years, even if it means turning down movie roles.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, she and other like-minded friends, including Ed
Harris and his wife, Amy Madigan, have formed a theater company in
Santa Monica near where they live. Right now they're trying to
raise money to build a theater for the company, called the Loretta
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company makes sense because there are a lot of great
actors who live in L.A. who aren't always working in movies,''
Hunter points out. ``A lot of them started out in theater. You know
L.A. is trash, but the fact is a lot of really good people live
there.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Kaminski stay there because it's where the work is.
Hunter has just finished ``Women Wanted,'' directed by Kiefer
Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter hopes to soon be directed by her husband, who is gaining
enough clout in Hollywood to make this happen. ``It's an
unscheduled date,'' she says, throwing him another look. ``But it
will occur.''

 &HT;    Atlanta product debugs Y2K
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A slew of Y2K fixes for IBM-compatible PC hardware
have come to market, and among them a little Atlanta company's
product seems to have found a better solution than such giants as
Symantec and McAfee.
</P>
<P>
   PCfix 2000, the Atlanta company's new entry, costs a relatively
whopping $94.95.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not in stores. If you want it, you'll have to purchase
it directly from the Web http://www.pcfix2000.com (cq).
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy it from the company, the About Time Group,
located at 4151 Ashford Dunwoody Road. Phone numbers are
404-255-2660(cq), toll free 1-888-558-2660 (cq), fax
404-255-2689(cq).
</P>
<P>
   Retail outlets, the company said, will have the product early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   PCfix 2000 tests and fixes a PC's BIOS. This ``basic
input-output system'' controls such things as the computer's disk
speed, memory and time.
</P>
<P>
   The product also tests and fixes the computer's real time clock
and system clock.
</P>
<P>
   To do much the same thing, Symantec has just released the $49.95
Norton 2000. This product has extra bells and whistles _ for
instance, it does some reporting on your applications and even
personal spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   The product is so new on the market the company hasn't yet put
up a Web page on the individual version, so for more info you have
to go to the corporate version's page http://www.symantec.com/sabu
</P>
<P>
   /n2000/index.html (cq).
</P>
<P>
   For just $29.95, McAfee offers the 2000 Tool Box, and in many
particulars it resembles the Norton 2000 http://www.mcafeemall.com
(cq).
</P>
<P>
   But you still may want to spend triple that amount for the
Atlanta company's product.
</P>
<P>
   Only PCfix 2000 is straight software. The others are memory
resident programs or device drivers. These not only eat system
memory but can create software conflicts and outright computer
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   PCfix immediately corrects date and time when a PC is booted and
does not remain in memory.
</P>
<P>
   The product has been recently selected by AT&AMP;T for its desktop
and laptop remediation program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if memory resident programs don't bother you, you can
get a free BIOS fix from Phoenix based Viasoft at http://www.onmark
</P>
<P>
   .viasoft.com/fix-it. It's offering the freebie because it wants
some attention for Onmark 2000. That Viasoft Y2K reporting product,
which sells in the $70 range, also competes with Norton and
Symantec.

 &HT;    Companies meet to forge standard for wireless communications
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gathering momentum, a growing team of communications
and computer companies is gathering here this week in Buckhead to
forge a world standard for wireless communications that could
unleash many new products next year.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Bluetooth wireless communications initiative, an
original group of five companies which first met in May, including
Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba, has now grown to some 200,
officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   And some 350 representatives of those companies are huddling
privately at the Grand Hyatt Hotel through Thursday, to share
information, conduct training and discuss refinements of the work,
now dubbed the draft specification 0.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had more, but a larger number would have been
unwieldy,'' said Chuck Napier, of Convergence Corp., a local
meeting host and a member of the initiative. Convergence makes
communications software.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth comes from the name of a Danish king who succeeded in
uniting his people during the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy is necessary, they say, to make sure all the players
subscribe to the standard and agree to cooperate royalty-free so
that the technology can spread fast and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incentive for people to take part in this is the hope that
better wireless connectivity can enhance the value of all the
products from hand held devices to mobile computers,'' said Simon
C. Ellis, data communications marketing director for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   While Intel stands ready to make new processors for the
equipment, others like IBM, Ericsson, Nokia and Toshiba will have
new, appealing machines to offer. And communications software
specialists like Norcross-based Convergence hope to help write the
programs that make the systems work.
</P>
<P>
   Basically the Bluetooth technology allows freer communication
among wireless devices, including handheld computers and laptops
without using the wired networks.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical arrangement, with the new technology, users will be
able to receive e-mail automatically on their notebooks by way of
handheld devices, or synchronize their desktop computer with their
handheld device without removing it from the brief case.
</P>
<P>
   It will also keep teams of executives in touch as never before.
Among the applications possible, technical specialists said, was an
arrangement where announcements by competitors could automatically
be transmitted to executives, and opening videoconferencing
channels immediately for meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bluetooth is technology we have been studying for eight
years,'' said Anders Edlund, senior manager of technology marketing
at Ericsson. ``With this special interest group, we will be able to
implement it quickly and smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of cooperative talks being conducted by the Bluetooth
special interest group 20 years ago would have set off antitrust
alarms in Washington and elsewhere. But in the age of deregulation,
such meetings are now encouraged so that technical innovations can
be implemented faster.
</P>
<P>
   Where necessary, regulators such as the Federal Communications
Commission and international wireless conventions can give formal
approval of the agreements if they do not violate communications
spectrum rules.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Atlanta was picked as the site for the Bluetooth
meeting, Ellis of Intel, whose company is based in Santa Clara,
Calif., said this city is close to many players and reachable by
companies domestically and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, available hotel space and your fine international
airport were big factors in selecting Atlanta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the final Bluetooth specification version 1.0 is
scheduled for public release during the second quarter of 1999. And
the first products, many near completion, could be announced during
the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They could include new mobile computers, handheld PCs, digital
cellular phones, and peripheral equipment such as printers,
projectors, PC cards and hands-free phone handsets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluetooth working group has a Web site at
http://www.bluetooth.com

there probably have been no bell-ringing changes in the tools of
classroom teaching in many a decade. But Gregory Abowd and his
partners at Georgia Tech may have changed that, at least for
college students.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Classroom 2000, the new approach pulls together several
media at once and brings them to bear on the teaching process. At
the same time, the system frees students to fully concentrate and
participate in class without the furious, head-down note taking
that characterizes most college classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that can reward the most aggressive students with
extra information, and provide a safety net and special assistance
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, in the works since 1995, specially outfitted
classrooms are augmented with gear that includes one or more
electronic white boards, as well as audio and video equipment.
Slides and other images projected on white boards are recorded
along with the voice of the lecturer, and even extra notes written
in the margins of slides as the class progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a software program called ZenPad, the system captures
the package of information on the Internet and
</P>
<P>
   organizes it into Web pages. Students, at their convenience, may
consult and review the lessons later at home or in residence halls,
and preserve them for study before exams.
</P>
<P>
   All of the teaching materials, and even additional material
fetched from the Internet via a Web browser can also be stirred
into the presentation and preserved as part of the electronic
record.
</P>
<P>
   I watched a 90-minute lecture to a computing class by computing
Professor Abowd, who directed the development of the Classroom 2000
software, and sensed an atmosphere that was unique. There was a
remnant student, obviously wedded to old ways, who followed the
lesson in a textbook and took a fair amount of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, came to class empty handed and kept their eyes
fixed on the presentation, following the points closely and
frequently asking questions to elicit additional information. A
couple of students slept in the back of the class.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for weary students is that the program functions
also as a kind of safety net that will preserve the continuity of
the classes for those who miss sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The class had standing-room attendance, which Abowd said was
normal, indicating that the technology did not encourage students
to miss and catch the evening show instead.
</P>
<P>
   The class I witnessed, mostly for doctoral students, was a
history of interaction between humans and computers. It dealt with
the enormous amount of activity since the late 1940s in places like
Xerox Park in California and elsewhere to make the computer not
just more powerful, but more handy and productive.
</P>
<P>
   Passages from books were projected and worked into the
electronic record, along with Abowd's comments, explanations, as
well as input from the class.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting points were the origins of ``windows'' or
multiple displays of work the computer performs, the invention of
the mouse, which sped up commands, and the introduction of the
desktop, simulating the way humans organize activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``An historic moment in computing,'' Abowd said, ``was the
introduction of the desktop on a Macintosh computer during
</P>
<P>
   the 1984 Super Bowl, making the desktop a useful 'metaphor' that
helped to de-mystify computers for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one student: ``Well it didn't de-mystify it for everybody,
given the fact that many people still avoid computers.'' All
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Students said they appreciated the new classroom approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that you can add your own notes and comments,
recording your reactions at the time they are presented,'' said Sam
Collins, a second year doctoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the flexibility it gives students, including a chance
to go back and get material you may have missed,'' said Tanisha
Hall, a first year doctoral student.
</P>
<P>
   Several other schools, including Kennesaw State University,
Georgia State University, and Darnton College of Albany, are using
Classroom 2000 to teach certain courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it for teaching math,'' said Meghan A. Burke of
Kennesaw. ``But I use it differently from others, preferring to
write equations on the white board while adding my voice to the
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, Dr. Burke said: ``Mine is a more traditional way of
teaching, but it presents more options to the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classroom 2000 technology has broad possibilities for
college classes beyond science and math, depending on the
resourcefulness and ingenuity of teachers, she said. For instance,
the Shakespeare scholar, striding across the room reciting Lear
would have more powerful influence on students watching with heads
up, relaxed and paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In another setting, the technology could prove useful also to
business and industry for teaching complex subject matter and and
providing in-service training for employees unaccustomed to taking
voluminous notes at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the effectiveness of Classroom 2000 is now in
progress and results are expected later this fall, Georgia Tech
officials said.

 &HT;    Hayes Corp. requests judge to cancel founder's contract
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hayes Corp. has asked a federal judge to cancel its
contract with Dennis Hayes, a move that deprives the company's
founder of his office, his car and a $400,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in federal court in Delaware, the action is part of the
Norcross, Ga.-based Hayes Corp.'s request for bankruptcy protection
filed Oct. 9. Chief Executive Ron Howard said Tuesday that
terminating the contract with Dennis Hayes is just one of many
measures aimed at saving the troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes last week resigned as the chairman and was replaced by
Howard. Hayes had given up the posts of chief executive and
president in 1996 as the company emerged from a previous sojourn in
Chapter 11. However, he remains a member of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes declined comment, citing legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no secret about his tempestuous relationship
with Howard, who arrived in the merger late last year with his
firm, Access Beyond. A number of ranking employees have since
departed Hayes Corp., many not amicably. Among former and current
employees _ especially those with long years at the company _ are
many who say Dennis Hayes has been treated unfairly:
</P>
<P>
   _ As soon as Hayes resigned from the chairman's role, his office
was cleaned so Howard could use it on his trips to Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the same time, he lost his car and driver, a long-time perk
for Hayes, who has problems with his sight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other executives who have left the company in recent months
have received generous severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard says his moves are justified as well as necessary.
Canceling the contract saves money, but also conforms to corporate
bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis' ongoing role is that of a director. He doesn't have
operations responsibility. And this company doesn't compensate any
of its outside directors. This (contract) was a significant
agreement and this is not a normally operating healthy company.''
</P>
<P>
   A firm in Chapter 11 must avoid unneeded expenses, including
severance, he said. Other contracts will also be broken as the
company struggles to right itself, and anyone who believes he is
owed money can get in line, Howard said. ``In essence, Dennis
becomes a creditor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes founded D.C. Hayes Associates in 1978, buying out
partners along the way as the company helped define the modem
industry. But its market share eroded and its technology fell
behind, and Hayes hit hard times. The company _ then known as Hayes
Microcomputer Products _ sought bankruptcy protection in 1994,
emerging two years later.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Hayes employed about 1,200 people and had revenues
of $250 million. The company now has about 500 employees and
revenues of less than $200 million.

 &HT;    Remodeling spending builds steadily, keeps contractors busy
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Building houses isn't the only thing that has kept
contractors busy the past year; remodeling spending also is up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent $88 billion (cq) on remodeling during the 12
months ending in September, according to a new economic indicator
devised by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Remodeling spending has grown 15 percent during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the boom has been the combination of low
interest rates, housing appreciation and growth in large-scale
projects such as new kitchens, said Kermit Baker, project director
for the center's Remodeling Futures Program.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on remodeling took a big jump in mid-1997, just as
interest rates began a steady fall. That triggered increased
activity in refinancing, which homeowners often use to improve
their current houses.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, business is expected to flourish as baby boomers'
families grow and older residents prepare their homes for aging,
said Mike Turner of TLC Builders and past national chairman of the
National Association of Home Builders' remodelers council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have put in more (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant
bathrooms in the past 18 months than I have done in the past 15
years, right here in Roswell,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates are expected to continue to influence
remodeling activity, even in the face of dropping consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   First Union reported that while people are reasonably secure in
their jobs and plan to spend money this holiday season, the
financial markets' recent performance has made them skittish about
buying big-ticket items, such as houses.
</P>
<P>
   But if a family can refinance its existing home at a lower rate,
come away from the transaction with some cash to invest in
remodeling, then its comfort level stays intact.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Warner McConaughey (cq), an owner of HammerSmith
remodelers, there is a population that is tired of wasted time
commuting in traffic and wants to buy inside the Perimeter. They
then remodel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a smaller lot, but they can renovate the house and
still have pretty much what they want,'' he remarked. ``I sometimes
see more money spent on the renovation than was spent to buy the
house, but these people don't care. They know they might not get
the money out, but they prefer to have a couple of extra free hours
every day.

<P>
   GREAT MILTON, England _ Great cooks usually start at the bottom,
and they start very young, learning classic kitchen techniques
honed over centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Not Raymond Blanc. At 48, he is one of Britain's most honored
chefs. Sybarites from far and wide beat a path to the door of Le
Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, his luscious, recently expanded and
renovated hotel and restaurant near Oxford. But he started late, at
21, as a commis debrasseur _ an apprentice busboy, a
waiter-in-waiting, clearing tables _ not as a trainee cook.
</P>
<P>
   A slight, tightly-wound man whose very being seems to jangle as
he talks, Blanc fell in love with good food at his mother's table
in a village near Besancon, in the Jura Mountains of eastern
France. He fell in love with great food when his parents took him
to the Palais de la Biere, then Besancon's best restaurant, and
introduced him to flamed sea bass and truffled capon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from that moment that I wanted to be a chef,'' he said
recently. ``I had no experience, obviously. I had worked as a
nurse, in a leukemia ward, where young people came to die, and I
had worked for my father, who was a watchmaker. But I went to see
the chef anyway and told him: `You must take me. One day I'll be a
great chef.' He turned and walked from the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the young Blanc went back. The chef told him he
was too old to learn to cook, but offered the busboy job instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it, of course,'' Blanc continued, ``and I worked at it.
It was a tough old school. They called us by numbers, not by name.
But I still longed to cook, so I began experimenting with sauces,
and when I got one I liked, I had the nerve to show it to the chef.
He threw a pot at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke my jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Blanc landed here. A pioneer in a country where
accomplished chefs were once as rare as tulips in winter, he built
a national reputation and trained many of the youngsters who have
revolutionized British cooking in recent years. But gradually, the
Manoir lost its edge. Attention shifted to London, and to chefs
like Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsey. Blanc felt obliged to
reinvent the menu, and reinforce the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, he is emblematic of creative chefs in the
furiously competitive modern culinary world, for whom resilience is
often a condition of survival.
</P>
<P>
   You would never guess all that if you came to Great Milton cold,
without knowing Raymond Blanc's story. Everything is in its
rightful place, and everything seems effortless, the way it must
have seemed in stately Edwardian houses, if you were Upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, and in as much of spring and autumn as England's
fickle weather permits, the evening starts with a drink in the
garden, at little tables set on a broad, Wimbledon-perfect lawn, in
the shade of a 100-year-old Atlantic cedar and a broad catalpa tree
with beanlike pods dangling from it.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the gabled manor house, built in the 15th century
in Cotswold stone the color of ancient Sauternes. On the other is
Blanc's new, 1.5-acre potager, with 75 varieties of vegetables,
from the everyday (carrots and spinach) to the more obscure
(purslane and salsify and white chard). Next to that is the herb
garden, with a filmy canopy of butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost too terribly Merchant Ivory when the bells of the
13th-century church next door start ringing, calling the faithful
to vespers, just as the waiter brings the Champagne. Almost, but
not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in the 55-seat dining room and the attached 52-seat
conservatory, Blanc has declared war on starchiness in general and
chintz in particular. Fake ancestors no longer stare from the
walls. This is no less than a reinvention of the English
country-house restaurant. It is a place at home in the shrinking,
informal world of today: pale walls, a few modern pictures, green
plants everywhere and loose white covers on the chairs. Celebrating
the disappearance of the old nostalgic look, Sir Terence Conran,
the designer and restaurateur, wrote recently that the Manoir has
become ``a hymn of contemporary style.''
</P>
<P>
   The informality of the decor communicates itself to the clients.
Unawed by a formally dressed wait staff of 48, including 7
sommeliers, people chatter happily in an assortment of languages
and men quickly shed their jackets. ``Isn't it nice?'' my wife,
Betsey, asked after we had settled in. ``The place hums. There's
none of that dismal whispering and twittering you get in a lot of
country houses, and no raucous, cocky New York talk, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanc has rethought the food as well, with what the restaurant
critic Matthew Fort recently described in The Guardian as ``quite
stunning and happy results.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many chefs, Blanc, who began as an apostle of classically
rich cuisine, has caught the Asian culinary bug. He served us an
amazing appetizer of roasted baby mackerel, marinated eel and
remarkably tender octopus, embellished with pickled ginger, daikon
radish, azuki beans and glass noodles. It was an instant trip to
Tokyo, full of the haunting, elusive flavors that distinguish
kaiseki cooking, by way of London's working-class East End, where
jellied eels have been a staple for generations.
</P>
<P>
   A second starter was Italo-Chinese, I guess you could say, in
its inspiration. A crab mousse that tasted really crabby, not like
the crab-flavored cream you sometimes encounter, had been stuffed
into a zucchini flower; that was steamed briefly and served with a
ginger sauce. It evaporated on the tongue, reminding me of an
intensely flavored tomato sherbet that Blanc once concocted to
serve with a lobster salad.
</P>
<P>
   When the chef offered to recreate a dish he invented some years
ago for a luncheon of the Club des Cent, a French gastronomic
society, I agreed in a nanosecond, because it involves the kind of
blessed excess that has been endangered by the pointillists of
nouvelle cuisine and the cholesterol cops.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The dish in question consists of veal kidneys, sauteed foie gras
and a stuffed pig's trotter, the whole bathed in a rich, gelatinous
sauce with a flavor as deep as a psychiatrist's id. Blanc is an
inspired cook of the innards that we call variety meats and the
British call offal. But as you eat the glistening morsels of goose
and pork and veal (lightened by a few sauteed potatoes), your life
does tend to pass before your eyes. I decided that I didn't care;
if this was my last meal, I could hardly do better.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey, who has cornered the market on restraint in our family,
ordered a fricassee of chicken (in this case a bird from the Landes
in southwest France), with a sauce made of morels and yellow Jura
wine. It is a classic of the Franche-Comte, Blanc's home region,
and he did it proud.
</P>
<P>
   Other main courses sounded equally tempting _ a braised turbot
fillet served with cockles and fresh pasta, for example, and a
guinea fowl cooked on a spit, served with a verbena-flavored jus.
The French, English and Irish cheeses were exemplary. To finish, I
selflessly downed a few bites of pistachio souffle, flawlessly
executed and aptly matched with cocoa sorbet. It was a grown-up
version of my favorite ice cream cone, pistachio and bitter
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked later about the eclecticism of his cooking, Blanc
told me that he found himself incorporating Chinese, Japanese and
Italian influences into his menus, and cooking peasant dishes as
well as haute cuisine. ``I don't really have any one style,'' he
said. ``Because I've lived most of my professional life outside
France, I don't feel obliged to stick to French ideas. Because I'm
completely self-taught, I don't find myself in an Escoffier
straitjacket. But I try to use a new spice or new leaf to enrich
tradition, not overthrow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alain Desenclos, the longtime maitre d'hotel, a droll,
cosmopolitan Parisian who worked at the Elysee Palace for Charles
de Gaulle, built the Manoir's wine list, a weighty document that
lists the treasures of Burgundy and Bordeaux among its 1,000
entries. The blockbusters are not there merely for show. One night
last summer, Desenclos said, before the stock market swooned, four
brokers casually spent $3,500 on old Haut Brion and Lafite.
</P>
<P>
   But give Desenclos a chance and he will educate you and save you
money at the same time. For us he chose a lean chardonnay made by
Fritz Wieninger near Vienna that went swimmingly with the Asian
flavors of our first course, and a burly Sardinian red made from
grenache grapes, which are used for blending in the Rhone valley.
For a chunk of Roquefort cheese, he came up with a delectable sweet
wine, again from Austria, where wine has made enormous strides in
the last decade _ Willi Opitz's 1995 pinot gris
trockenbeerenauslese.
</P>
<P>
   You have every incentive to save a dollar or two on wine, to
compensate for food prices verging on the ruinous. The set menu
costs $115, without wine and service charge. A la carte, first
courses range from $35 to $50, main courses from $50 to $65. The
set lunch is a relative bargain at $55.
</P>
<P>
   There are big bills to pay. The staff of 145 people doesn't come
cheap, of course. The gardens don't weed themselves. The raw
materials, like prime beef from the pampered Scottish herds of the
Duke of Buccleuch, cost a pretty penny. And to calm the villagers,
who complain about cooking odors, Blanc has installed a $500,000
room-size ventilation system, which, he said, ``pulls the smells
out of the kitchen, breaks the molecules down and throws them 200
yards in the air, where they disperse.'' It looks like the power
plant for a destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   You will meet a new, calmer Raymond Blanc if you visit the
Manoir. Things had to change. Since 1987, he has undergone two
divorces and two strokes, one large and one small; he seems fully
recovered from both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through the flames,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanc made his way to England in the early 1970s. He worked as a
waiter at the Rose Revived pub, in Standlake, not far from Oxford,
where he befriended the chef, a virtuoso with the can opener who
was only too happy to let his new buddy cook all he liked.
Eventually, Blanc took a job in Wiesbaden, hoping to learn German,
and one day, just like the movies, a call came from the Rose
Revived: the cook was sick, the No. 2 was sick; could Blanc step
in?
</P>
<P>
   He could, he did, and it was not long before he and his new
English wife, Jenny, had their own place in a mall in the Oxford
suburbs, situated with unintentional irony next to the local office
of Oxfam, a charity that ministers to the hungry hordes of the
third world. People clamored for tables.
</P>
<P>
   The Manoir opened in 1984, with Eddie Kulikundis, a theatrical
impressario, and Susan Hampshire, his wife, a London actress, among
the investors. It was dazzling from the start, winning a Michelin
star in its first year and a second in its second. At the same
time, the Good Food Guide, Britain's most respected arbiter of
restaurant quality, described Blanc as a chef of ``creativity,
passion, subtlety, indeed genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he bought out his partners with the help of
Richard Branson, the Virgin tycoon, who holds a half interest in
the Manoir. He created a new landscape, including a Japanese garden
and water gardens. He doubled the size of the old kitchen and added
new ones _ one for a cooking school, one for room service and a
private dining room. A spa, to be operated with Givenchy, the
French couture house, is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Blanc built 8 more bedrooms, bringing the total
to 27, including 3 opulent suites. It is bedrooms, not meals, that
turn the biggest profit for the country restaurateur. With the new
space, revenue from the bedrooms will rise from 40 percent to 60
percent of the total. The bedrooms start at about $350; the suites
at $720.
</P>
<P>
   One new room is in an old dovecote. Others are in a new wing
built of old stone by the contractor who works on Oxford colleges,
or in a reconstructed 17th-century stable block, which forms a
square around a courtyard with an old chestnut at its center. Most
have a boldly contemporary air, but one is Chinese in inspiration,
with a bedroom paneled in dark wood, a veritable den of iniquity,
and a private Asian garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to create a Disneyland for adults,'' Blanc said,
admiring a doorknob and stepping over a pile of lumber as workers
were concluding their labors. ``Time stops for a while. Reality
stops. You ignore the vulgar things in life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for him, after three years out of the kitchen overseeing the
expansion, he is back at the range as much as eight hours a day,
happy as a bird. He doesn't say so _ that just isn't done _ but he
is clearly shooting for a third star in the Michelin guide.
Already, he has restored to the food the pristine clarity of flavor
that made his name.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a hurricane hunter aircraft found that Hurricane
Mitch, once the strongest October hurricane on record and tied for
the fourth most powerful overall, had weakened to a Category 4
storm on the Saffir-Simpson intensity scale with central winds near
150 miles an hour. However, Hurricane Mitch will remain extremely
dangerous on Wednesday, as it plods slowly near the Central
American coast.
</P>
<P>
   A strong cold front will sweep into the interior Northeast on
Wednesday. A band of clouds and scattered showers will precede the
front. East of the mountains, clouds will increase Wednesday
afternoon as the front approaches. Weakening showers will accompany
frontal passage Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will remain nearly stationary over the South.
Ample sunshine and mild temperatures will prevail from the
Tennessee valley to the Southeast and Gulf coasts. Over Florida,
patchy clouds and isolated showers will be limited to the extreme
south.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of moist air will extend from southern Texas to the
upper Plains. Scattered thunderstorms will develop in the humid air
ahead of a cold front from Texas to Kansas. A vigorous jet stream
disturbance will pivot through the central Plains. Where this
disturbance intersects the conveyor belt of moist air, clusters of
showers and some strong thunderstorms will develop.
</P>
<P>
   Father west, areas of light rain will affect eastern parts of
Wyoming and Montana, as moist winds ascend the sloping terrain.
Meanwhile, a cold front will promote pockets of rain and higher
elevation snow from the northern Rockies to the mountains of
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Sight Loss
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists suffered partial blindness on Tuesday when a
system failure occurred on the geostationary satellite that covers
eastern North America, South America and the western Atlantic. The
loss of sight was particularly serious since clear views of
powerful Hurricane Mitch over the western Caribbean were no longer
available. Some distorted pictures were available from a satellite
stationed over the eastern Pacific as technicians attempted to
remotely repair the ailing spacecraft. Meanwhile, reconnaissance
aircraft transmitted vital details about the potentially
devastating storm.

MODERN ART: A SCHOOL OR A JOURNEY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does ``modern'' mean? Is it purely historical,
as in ancient, medieval and modern (the latter frequently seen as
beginning with the Renaissance)? Is it uppercase, an umbrella term
covering all art from van Gogh to, say, Frank Stella and Robert
Ryman (after which postmodern takes over)?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it a lowercase valedictory applied temporarily to things
that are deemed new and irrefutably contemporary _ that is, a
designation that is outgrown, rather like being a freshman in high
school? Furthermore, is it possible for a museum of modern art to
accumulate a collection and still remain involved with modern art
as it evolves?
</P>
<P>
   These questions emanate from a freshly sprung little time
capsule set by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, one of the founders of the
Museum of Modern Art, at the time of her death in 1948. They seem
surprisingly pertinent. After all, this is a time of multiple
meanings and linguistic fluidity, when the role of museums,
especially where contemporary art is concerned, is frequently
redefined by curators and artists alike.
</P>
<P>
   It is also becoming increasingly apparent that nearly every
culture has a version of modern art, that it is not a strictly
Eurocentric phenomenon. Some of its forms, like film, may begin in
the West, but many of its vocabularies have global sources _
cubism's debt to African sculpture, for example. So in some ways
these questions are as alive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, they have the added attraction of providing a
glimpse of a Museum of Modern Art that might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller, an active trustee until her death, clearly
felt that modernity was a condition with an expiration date. And so
last month the Modern gave up four works of art that she had
bequeathed to it. In accordance with her will, two drawings by
Vincent van Gogh were handed over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and two drawings by Georges Seurat were transferred to the Art
Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   She stipulated these transfers, which Glenn Lowry, the museum's
director, called painful, in the firm belief that by 50 years after
her death the drawings would cease to be modern works of art and
would therefore be better suited for museums where history, not
modernity, was the primary mission.
</P>
<P>
   This was the majority view at the Modern in the early years,
when the museum was young and the modern-art concept was too. In a
famous statement, Alfred Barr Jr., the museum's founding director,
described its collection as a torpedo moving through time, its nose
in the ever-advancing present, its tail pulling 50 to 100 years of
earlier art behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1947, after years of negotiation and discussion, the
Modern and the Whitney Museum of American Art entered an agreement
with the Metropolitan Museum of Art that was intended to keep the
younger institutions unencumbered and open to new developments. As
time passed, the Modern and the Whitney would cede or sell their
older modern works to the Met, making room for the newly modern.
</P>
<P>
   The three co-signers had decided that when these works were
roughly a century old, they would stop being modern and, with any
luck, become classic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Met bought two works by Picasso from the Modern,
including the sentimental ``Woman in White,'' the agreement soon
fell apart. The Modern must have figured out that indeed there were
such things as ``modern classics,'' that it owned a great number of
them and that they were part of its identity, its view of history
and its ability to attract future gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But some telling documents from the moment remain in the
museum's archives, according to a 1995 article by Kirk Varnedoe,
chief curator of painting and sculpture, published in the fifth
volume of the Modern's ``Studies in Modern Art'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a list drafted by James Thrall Soby, one of the
museum's prominent early curators, specifying the future dates of
transfer for some of the Modern's most beloved masterpieces:
Cezanne's emblematic ``Bather,'' usually the first work encountered
in the Modern's permanent collection galleries, was to have gone to
the Met in 1972, van Gogh's ``Starry Night'' in 1962 and Rousseau's
``Sleeping Gypsy'' in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   (It is amazing to think of the Modern as, in Robert Smithson's
words, an entropic organism, continually in flux, decaying and
renewing, and defined primarily by its exhibition program. This
brings it close to the contemporary idea of the Kunsthalle, or an
iconoclastic alternative space like the New Museum of Contemporary
Art, which in the 1970s also adopted the concept of an
``impermanent collection.'')
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, Barr's torpedo seemed to have ground to a
halt. In a 1974 interview in Artforum, William Rubin, Varnedoe's
predecessor, considered the advent of earthworks and conceptual art
and wondered out loud if the contemporary art being made even had a
place in a museum of modern art. ``The museum concept is not
infinitely expandable,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, ``modern'' was coming more and more to suggest a
``classic'' period of 20th-century art, while fresh, new and
original fell increasingly within the jurisdiction of the word
``contemporary.'' This was suggested by the distinction in auction
houses between sales of modern art and contemporary art, and by the
tendency throughout the postwar period for new museums devoted to
postwar art to call themselves museums of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How a Collection Can Define an Art
</P>
<P>
   And would our idea of ``classic'' modern art have been so
clearly defined if the Modern had not maintained its extraordinary
collection, with its highly selective view of Western art since
1880? If its treasures had been gradually ceded to the Met, they
would still be on view in New York. Yet their impact might have
been quite different seen against the backdrop of an encyclopedic
array of the world's cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Would Picasso's ``Demoiselles d'Avignon'' be quite the
mountaintop it appears to be in a museum that also contains
masterpieces of African art and paintings by Velazquez, El Greco
and Rembrandt? Certainly Barr's torpedo would have lost some of its
sleek outline and forward momentum in a context where the
simultaneity of visual endeavor _ of many cultures speaking at once
in very different languages _ is one of the main messages.
</P>
<P>
   But in effect, since the late 1940s, modern art has been less a
moving torpedo than an exploding one, a mass of powerful ideas
moving outward in all directions across the globe and having
different repercussions at each point of contact. In addition, even
as modern seems to have become more fixed as a moment in art
history, the term is also unfixed, in both cultural and personal
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Used in the lowercase, ``modern'' can connote what might be
called historical, as opposed to contemporary newness. By this
logic, nearly everything genuinely new has had its moment in the
modern sun.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of art, for example, single-point perspective was a
sign of modernity in mid-14th-century Italy; images of unpopulated
landscapes and everyday life were modern in 17th-century Holland,
and the abandonment of single-point perspective and the emphasis on
paint and color signaled modernity in late 19th-century Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There are always some objects that seem eternally modern, that
are premodern signs of modernity: Cycladic idols and African
sculpture, certain Japanese screens, Amish quilts and Navajo
weaving.
</P>
<P>
   Experience Changes Personal Definitions
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this there is a more personal, poetic idea of the modern
that is constantly affected by one's interests and experiences.
Sometimes it moves around according to what exhibition is on view.
Over the last two decades, exhibitions at the Met have enabled us
to appreciate the modernity not only of Degas but also of Fragonard
and Goya.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the modern that is to be found within, an
especially important process for artists. For Philip Guston, Piero
della Francesca was the beginning of the modern; for Myron Stout,
it was classical Greek sculpture. Donald Judd probably would have
cited the paintings of Malevich and Navajo weavings, and Alex Katz
has frequently pointed to ancient Egyptian art.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it is necessary to hold in mind several definitions
of ``modern'' at once, uppercase and lowercase, personal and
historical, and to see that it is both increasingly fixed in some
ways and in others more in flux than ever.

NEWS IS BLOSSOMING AROUND US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHARLES W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ We know it's autumn.
The calendar says so, and not many days ago we were out on a frosty
morning, cutting a fall bouquet of bittersweet. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flowering crabapple tree in the front yard has dropped its
leaves. But, perversely, standing there in all its nakedness, it
has put forth a little burst of bloom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the side, along the drive, the Hosta lilies, too, have thrust
up blossoms again. And, out walking, I've seen similar
unaccountable displays in other yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly something peculiar is afoot. Maybe it is the El Nino
effect. Or a preternatural alignment of the planets. Whatever the
cause of it, I have not seen this eruption of out-of-season
florescence reported in the news. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can remember when we had someone on the reporting staff whose
specific duty it would have been to inform readers about such a
horticultural phenomenon. But that was a long time ago, and of
course the definition of news is not fixed. It changes with
changing tastes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, I cannot help noticing the way in which killer bees
have passed from fashion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of decades, from at least the 1960s onward or
possibly the '50s, not a year went by without an update in the
nation's press, including this newspaper, about the alarming rate
at which killer bees were advancing upon us from south of the
border. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accounts were graphic, of peasant farmers wholly enveloped
in the deadly swarm _ the unfortunate human not even visible inside
the humming, woolly garment of bees _ just running and stumbling
blindly until felled by a hundred thousand stings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This sometimes happened to cattle, too, and donkeys, and
presumably cats and dogs as well. But it was the ghastly fate of
the human victims that set the imagination humming, as it were. A
reader could not help wondering how imminent was the peril for
himself and his loved ones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, as I recall, the bees were reported in Guatemala, or
maybe it was Brazil. Then they made their way into Mexico. Another
10 years and they were near the U.S. border. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the late '80s, I think it was, a nest of them was
said to have been discovered _ horror of horrors! _ in southern
Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the Yankee press took on a fevered tone. Because now
it wasn't just nameless foreign folks we were talking about wearing
bee coats. It was us! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, as so often happens, the crisis inexplicably just went
away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not once this year has so much as a single story about killer
bees found its way into print in our paper, or any other paper I've
happened to read. Nor was there a mention of them last year. Or, as
nearly as I could detect, the year before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's what happens when a business has an attention span as short
as ours. Journalists do not like to dwell on any one subject very
long. A famine in Africa is news for a week, or two at most. The
Middle East or Northern Ireland gets wearisome before very long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scandal of one sort or other seems to be the only topic that
engages us in a durable way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, preoccupied with salacious matters, we might
discover too late that we overlooked the really big news. Which is
that this outburst of unseasonable blooming could be the result of
late pollination by _ you guessed it _ by killer bees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they're no longer just coming. They're here. A
pity we missed it! &QL;

`AMERICAN MASTERS': THE IRREPRESSIBLE LEONARD BERNSTEIN, FONDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From his famous 1943 debut at the age of 25, when he filled in
for Bruno Walter as conductor of the New York Philharmonic, to his
death in 1990, Leonard Bernstein was rarely offstage, whether as
conductor or composer, teacher or showman. Wednesday night's partly
autobiographical and altogether affectionate ``American Masters''
tribute brings out the qualities that endeared him to generations
of collaborators, students and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Note'' covers a bustling
career of popular acclaim and disappointment, critical praise and
disdain, awe for the range of his talents and exasperation with his
pretensions. But mostly it celebrates the irrepressible energy,
exuberance and inventiveness that took fire with such collaborators
as Jerome Robbins and Stephen Sondheim. If Wednesday night's
two-hour program is most vibrant when delivering Broadway hits,
that may be a comment on what came most naturally to the composer
as well as on what plays best on television.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is neglected. The opening hour has time for crowd
pleasers like ``Fancy Free'' and ``On the Town,'' whose score
excited Broadway, as the narrator describes it, with its ``edgy
urban blend of concert hall and jazz club pulsating with wit and
candid sexual energy''; a description of the flamboyant conducting
style first exhibited at Tanglewood; the early symphonic works, in
which admirers found evocations of Jewish tradition and the
American West.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more personal matters, including his difficult
relations with his father and the conflict, delicately noted here,
between his homosexuality and his need for a close family life,
which was provided by his wife, Felicia Montealegre. ``He wanted
family,'' a friend says. ``He wanted a wife, he wanted good
friends. He wanted the whole, the whole banana, and he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Particular attention is given to ``West Side Story,'' which most
successfully joined Bernstein's feeling for the popular stage with
his classical training as well as with the social concerns that
would earn him some ridicule as the personification of ``radical
chic.'' Sondheim, who contributed the lyrics to the sidewalk
version of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' says he learned from Bernstein to
take chances: ``If you're going to fall off the ladder, fall off a
high rung.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein seemed tireless. As the first American to lead a major
orchestra, he proved immensely engaging, despite or because of the
leaping and laughing and weeping that offended some critics of
concert-hall taste. He brought new audiences to serious music on
television, where his young people's concerts won high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In his role of international maestro, he conducted in Israel
during the 1948 war; performed Mahler with the Vienna Philharmonic;
conducted his ``Mass'' at the opening of the Kennedy Center and
Beethoven's Ninth at the Berlin wall.
</P>
<P>
   What he did less of as success struck was to compose. He said,
``I'm helplessly suspended between the creator in me and the
performer.'' He was hurt, one friend notes, by the common judgment
that ``he can write theater music but he can't do anything in the

told a colleague that he wanted to be remembered not for ``West
Side Story'' but as a serious composer.

WHEN IT COMES TO INFINITIVES, IT IT BETTER TO SPLIT _ OR TO NOT
SPLIT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The news had been out for barely a day when the
students in Terri Gillespie's Blue Springs High School English
class were ready to eradicate one more rule of grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the radio Monday had it that Oxford dictionaries, the
self-proclaimed ``last word on words,'' had abandoned the taboo on
split infinitives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids thought it was hilarious that once again there is
another rule going by the wayside,'' Gillespie said. ``They thought
it was great. They love any rule that you can break.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, an infinitive is a verb with ``to'' in front.
</P>
<P>
   The rule works this way. The infinitive ``to eat'' should be
modified as ``to eat quickly '' and not ``to quickly eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Shakespeare's Hamlet poses the question, ``To be or not
to be'' instead of asking, ``To be or to not be.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many taboos, the guidance against split infinitives has
fallen victim to modern usage.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a more recent cultural icon: Capt. James T. Kirk of
``Star Trek'' who speaks of the mission ``to boldly go where no man
has gone before.'' A strict grammarian would insist on ``to go
boldly.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond popular culture, many grammarians long have argued
against a rule based more in Latin tradition than in English usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule has been changing for a long time,'' said Jeffrey
McQuain, an author who has worked as a researcher for William
Safire's On Language column. ``Oxford is perhaps one of the final
places to admit the split infinitive is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around a long time, and I think it's more a
nicety of language that has been taught in English classes, but
it's not very widely practiced in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is included in the new Oxford American Desk
Dictionary, which came out last month and says the prohibition on
split infinitives can lead to ``awkward, stilted sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Abate, editor in chief of Oxford's U.S. dictionaries
program in Old Saybrook, Conn., says the company really isn't
breaking new ground.
</P>
<P>
   While previous Oxford dictionaries may not have said anything
about split infinitives, Abate noted that Oxford acknowledged in
usage books as early as 1910 that split infinitives were natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we've changed and we've gone against what we
have been saying. It's more that we're coming out with a usage note
that states, `Don't worry about this rule.' ''

FORMER PORT AUTHORITY CHAIRMAN'S TIES TO HILTON CASINO
INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
   
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill
confirmed Monday that her office is investigating the relationship
between the owners of Kansas City's Flamingo Hilton Casino and the
former chairman of the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said her probe began several weeks ago after her
office received information from state gambling regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, at the request of the Missouri Gaming Commission,
investigating the Hilton matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The development Monday was the first suggestion that state
charges could be possible after U.S. Attorney Steve Hill Jr. agreed
in August to a $655,000 settlement with Hilton Hotels Corp. and its
local subsidiary, rather than file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had been investigating whether Hilton officials had
rewarded Elbert Anderson for his support of the casino project by
giving a $250,000 grant to a firm Anderson controlled through a
business associate. Anderson at the time was chairman of the Kansas
City Port Authority, which controlled the riverfront property on
which the Flamingo was built.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, executive director of the Gaming Commission, said
Monday through a spokesman that the commission would not comment on
McCaskill's probe.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the casino said Monday that McCaskill's
investigation appeared to be part of a state review of the Hilton's
license that the commission announced in August. At that time
Chairman Robert L. Wolfson Sr. said the commission would review a
transcript of grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is part of the normal regulatory process, looking
at the issues that they had resolved in 1996 (when the casino was
first licensed by the state),'' said Jerry Riffel, one of Hilton's
Kansas City attorneys. ``I think they're taking a second look at
that in light of the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilton remains confident that it is suitable to hold a
Missouri (gaming) license and has done nothing wrong,'' Riffel
added. ``We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with
Missouri's regulators, and it is up to the Missouri regulators what
process they choose to use in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill would neither characterize the commission's referral
nor say whether it came with a recommendation for any specific
action on her part. She would not say whether a county grand jury
had convened on the issue or estimate how long her review would
take.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hill's office declined to comment on McCaskill's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hilton agreed to pay the federal government $500,000
to avoid criminal charges that an executive had rewarded Anderson
for his support for the casino. Hilton also agreed to pay an
additional $155,000, the cost of the federal investigation, and set
up a training program to educate employees about how to respond to
public officials seeking money.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he opted for the out-of-court agreement because the
base fine of $500,000 was the maximum Hilton would have paid in a
guilty verdict and because a conviction might have amounted to a
``nationwide death penalty'' for Hilton's 14 casinos in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement essentially closed the book on the two-year
federal probe, but the possibility was left open that state
prosecutors or gambling regulators could pursue their own leads.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been convicted of unrelated federal charges for
bribing D. Jeanne Robinson when she was a city councilwoman and
James D. Tindall when he was chairman of the Jackson County
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Following his conviction, Anderson agreed to cooperate with
federal authorities in their investigation of Hilton and appeared
before grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Keller, an Anderson attorney, declined to comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The August agreement with Hilton stated that in 1993 Anderson
arranged for the company to pay $250,000 to K.C. Perspectives. The
company was owned by Anderson business associate Michelle Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Gaming Commission was deciding whether to
issue a license to the Flamingo, it conducted hearings at which
Anderson testified that Hilton's K.C. Perspectives was legitimate
and not intended to influence him as head of the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Because the payment came after Anderson's vote on awarding the
casino to Hilton, Hill termed it a reward rather than a bribe and
said Anderson ``was paid to influence his future support as Port
Authority chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said prosecutors did not pursue individual Hilton employees
because none of them individually benefited from the arrangement
and because none of them still worked for Hilton. Some of the
employees resigned after the payment became known, and others
resigned during the Gaming Commission hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The casino's license, which was due to expire this month, was
conditionally extended by the Gaming Commission last month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions was a satisfactory conclusion ``to the
outcome of the (commission's) investigation into (Hilton's)
relationship with former Kansas City Port Authority Chairman Elbert
Anderson and related matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission resolution extending Hilton's license did not
indicate that the Port Authority matter was to be referred to any
investigative agency.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, a spokesman for the anti-gambling campaign
committee Show Me the River, said Monday that his group would watch
McCaskill's investigation closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's concern about the corruptive influence of this
industry on government is not unfounded. There needs to be strict
regulation,'' Taylor said. ``This is an industry that wants to
deregulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Flamingo's license also is contingent on how
Missouri's ``boats-in-moats'' issue plays out at the polls next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo is one of 10 Missouri casinos faced with the loss
of games of chance, including slot machines, if voters reject
Amendment 9. That proposal would retroactively legalize casinos
moored off-river.
</P>
<P>
   If that measure fails, and the Flamingo and other threatened
casinos lose expected administrative appeals before the Gaming
Commission, they would be relicensed to offer only games of skill,
including blackjack and poker.

   &QL;  FOX, HOEFFEL RACE A RECORD $ETTER
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 -- With a flood of last-minute $1,000 checks
arriving by the bushel, Rep. Jon Fox and Democratic challenger
Joseph Hoeffel have engaged in the most aggressive fundraising
drive for a U.S. House seat in Pennsylvania history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the campaigns went searching so far for campaign cash
that it snagged a $1,000 check from an American living in London.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the opponents have so far raised $2.69 million for the
rematch of their 1996 battle, in which Fox, the incumbent, beat
Hoeffel, the Montgomery County commissioner, by 84 votes.
</P>
<P>
   That slim margin has focused national attention on the 13th
District race, as House Republicans are trying to hold onto and
expand their thin 21-seat majority. And a hefty majority of the
11th hour contributions from political parties, other congressmen
and special interests have splashed into Fox's campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   From Oct. 1 to Oct. 24, Fox raised at least $223,271, according
to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission in
Washington. Over the entire two-year election cycle Fox has raised
$1.65 million, meaning 13.5 percent of that war chest came in
little more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably raised many more thousands of dollars, since,
from Oct. 15 until election day, candidates are only required to
report donations of $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Of those big-money contributions, Fox took in $105,750 in just
nine days, Oct. 15-24. This huge money drop has allowed Fox to
virtually erase his cash deficit to Hoeffel, who has long benefited
from the fact that Fox had to spend about $800,000 last spring to
beat several primary challengers.
</P>
<P>
   In October Hoeffel has raised at least $130,155, almost 13
percent of the $1.03 million he has raised over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And, without a primary opponent, Hoeffel has been able to
stockpile his money for the most important days of the campaign. In
the first two weeks of October Hoeffel spent more money, $289,688,
than Fox, $237,293.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be outspent two-to-one,'' said Ken
Horowitz, Hoeffel's spokesman, referring to the 1996 spending
margin Fox enjoyed, ``which is one of the clear differences between
then and now.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a tight race, campaign watchdogs say it's normal for
lots of money to pour in during the home stretch of the race, but
they warn that the money can also come from some of the most
dubious sources. ``At that point, you're scrounging around wherever
you can for money,'' said Ed Davis of Common Cause, the
Washington-based group that lobbies for campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch fundraising has come from predictable sources: in
the past two weeks Hoeffel has raised more than 25 percent of his
money from unions, while Fox has raked in donations from businesses
such as GM, Bell Atlantic and CoreStates.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel also received $5,000 on Oct. 17 from People for the
American Way, the liberal civil liberties group that has mounted an
ad campaign defending President Clinton against impeachment
charges. Fox took $1,000 on Oct. 24 from the Log Cabin Republicans,
an openly homosexual group supporting Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers who face little or no opposition are
dumping their money into the Fox-Hoeffel race. Fox has received
$1,000 checks from the political action committees of Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, as well as
a $1,000 personal check from his old colleague, Montgomery County
Commissioner Mario Mele.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel's campaign received $1,000 checks from the PACs of
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and Philadelphia Rep. Chaka Fattah --
not to mention another $1,000 from the U.S. citizen in London,
whose check was funnelled through Democratic headquarters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The total amounts raised by Hoeffel and Fox, at least $2.69
million, is the greatest amount ever by Pennsylvania opponents for
a House seat. This year's House candidates in Scranton -- Democrat
Patrick Casey, the son of former Gov. Bob Casey, and Republican Don
Sherwood, a local car dealer -- will spend more money than Fox and
Hoeffel. But that's because Sherwood has dumped more than $1
million of his own money into the race. Their combined fundraising
from outside sources might not top $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to FEC records, the only other House race in
Pennsylvania that compares to this year's Fox-Hoeffel duel came in
1994, when Fox beat then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. The
opponents raised more than $2.58 million that year.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still more money to be had in the next few days.
Both campaigns say they will keep taking in checks until election
day, and that a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort could
determine the winner in a year when turnout is expected to be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (campaign) finance director always wants more money,''
said Fox, adding, ``Getting out the vote is key to this election.''

   ALANIS-MORISSETTE-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The woman who sings
Alanis Morissette's new album sounds like a mess. In the 17 songs
on ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick), which is to
be released on Tuesday, she has been attached to abusive men, she's
been stuffing and starving herself, she has taken too many
antibiotics, and she's been working herself to the point of
collapse. She has felt jealous, misunderstood, worthless; nothing,
from shopping to sex to wealth and worldwide popularity, has made
her happy. And every bit of trauma and frustration comes out in her
voice: in its harried vibrato and sudden yelping breaks, in its
banshee wails and caustic nasal turns. While her litany of
self-doubt is set in the past tense, the wounds still sound raw. By
Jon Pareles.

   ARAB-ACTORS (Undated) _ The Arab-American actor Sayed Badreya
has had no problem finding work in Hollywood. With his dark beard
and his accented English, he has had his pick of parts as
terrorists, hijackers, kidnappers and Islamic militants. ``Usually
I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone,'' Badreya said by
telephone from Egypt, where he is on a film shoot with Al Pacino,
playing the head of the military wing of Hezbollah. After years of
virtual invisibility, Arab-Americans are finally finding prominence
in Hollywood movies _ as terrorists and villains. They are only the
latest in a long line of ethnic groups and nationalities cast in
sterotypical bad-guy roles, from American Indians to Germans to
Japanese to African Americans to Russians. By Laurie Goodstein.

   HANGING-ROCK-VIDEO (Undated) _ A sweetly knowing look crosses
the face of the lovely young Miranda. ``You must learn to love
someone else apart from me, Sara,'' she says to a schoolmate. ``I
won't be here much longer.'' It never becomes clear how Miranda
knows that, but in Peter Weir's ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' as
mysterious as ever in two new video editions, just about everything
keeps us guessing. What we do know is that the year is 1900, that
the location is central Australia and that by sundown on Saint
Valentine's Day, Miranda (Anne Lambert) and two other students at
the brutally proper Appleyard College for young women will have
drifted away during a picnic as if hypnotized, disappearing among
the crags of the 500-foot-high volcanic formation called Hanging
Rock. By Peter M. Nichols.

   SWAN-LAKE-DANCE (Undated) _ Matthew Bourne'S production of

the show was touching but campy. Earlier reviews in England, where
the show originated, tended to dwell on what this ``Swan Lake'' was

   ADAM-COOPER-DANCE (Undated) _ Adam Cooper looks more like a

his shining pedigree as a principal dancer who played such regal

Lake'' these days once more, but not as the ballet's lovesick
prince. Instead, Cooper plays a powerful male swan and his
counterpart, a sneering piece of rough trade, in Matthew Bourne's
exuberantly irreverent adaptation of ``Swan Lake,'' now playing on
Broadway at the Neil Simon Theater. By Jennifer Dunning.

Company revival of ``Little Me,'' the 1962 musical comedy for which
Neil Simon wrote the book. In the show, which opens on Nov. 12, he
plays not one but seven men in the life of Belle Poitrine, nee
Schlumpfert, the curvaceous beauty turned tell-all memoirist from
Drifter's Row (portrayed by Faith Prince). As those he works with
know, Short is a master at appearing spontaneous in a completely
scripted situation, creating a sense of suspense during a
performance that keeps an audience wondering what will happen next.

Broadway despite the fact that Bernstein, late in life, gave it
some operatic trappings. And it's not ``Amahl and the Night
Visitors,'' which, since it was commissioned by a television

music and libretto by Carlisle Floyd, a native of South Carolina.

 Kauffman program brings moms and daughters together _ as partners  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Gwen Richards thought the newspaper advertisement
looked interesting. The program sounded like a great way to learn
about entrepreneurship while spending time with her teen-age
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Several months and a lot of hard work later, Gwen and Rickeena
Richards are ready to launch Keena and Me. They plan to write and
publish books that will improve communications between mothers and
adolescent daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City family developed the concept while participating
in MADE-IT, a program developed and offered by the Kauffman Center
for Entrepreneurial Leadership at the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Richards' project, as well as one by Ashley and Betty Fowler
of Blue Springs, were selected to take part today in a national
competition at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center hotel. The Fowlers
are ready to launch Sweet Dreams, which will produce customized
pillows for holidays and special events.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the local teams do in the national competition,
they're already winners. They turned good ideas into potential
businesses at a time in life when many parents and teens hardly
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives mothers and daughters a way to reconnect as
business partners,'' said Mary Beth Izard, scholar-in-residence at
the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership. ``The learn how
to do it, they learn they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother-daughter teams must include a girl entering eighth
grade in the fall and are selected based on personal interviews and
written applications.
</P>
<P>
   Teams participates in a weeklong summer program, where they
learn how to develop a business plan and launch a business. They
also receive additional mentoring and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons's we're doing it is because this provides
time for you to have one-on-one with your daughter,'' said Gwen
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience also gave her a much greater appreciation of
the work involved in running a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that a small business takes a lot of work, a lot of
preparation,'' she said. ``But I also learned that if you hang in
there, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the MADE-IT brochure says: ``We think mothers and
daughters should mind their own business.'' And they're absolutely
right.
</P>
<P>
   Adults often encourage boys to mow lawns or shovel snow to earn
extra money. The experience teaches them about marketing, time
management and numerous other skills.
</P>
<P>
   Let's encourage our daughters to explore entrepreneurial
options, too. We all need this training, and who know's where
businesses like Sweet Dreams and Keena and Me may lead?

   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Alan Rickman &LR;  and  &UR; Helen Mirren &LR;  have opened in London in a
long-awaited National Theatre production of ``Antony and

called it a ``plodding spectacle rarely informed by powerful
passion''; the Evening Standard described Rickman as ``mounting
Miss Mirren's attractive, supine Cleopatra as if she were a mare he

out before the opening of the show.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; - Diane Ladd &LR;  was in Memphis, Tenn., shooting ``Daddy and
Them,'' when a car accident occurred nearby, reports Los Angeles
magazine. Ladd picked up the phone, dialed 911 and said, ``I'm
Diane Ladd, from Hollywood, and I want an ambulance immediately.''
Help did arrive, ``but it's hard to say if Ladd's qualifier did the
trick,'' said the magazine.

<P>
   &UR; - John Glenn &LR;  participating in the ``senior space shoot'' is

GLENN AMAZED AT INTENSITY OF INTEREST IN HIS SPACEFLIGHT  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn seems mystified about why his
return to space aboard the shuttle Discovery is receiving so much
attention and good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he confessed recently. ``It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   His best guess? A vast wave of national nostalgia over his 1962
Mercury flight, a milestone that placed the United States in orbit
alongside the former Soviet Union. American astronauts later beat
the Soviets in a dramatic race to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred at a time when I think we needed a success,'' the
77-year-old Glenn recalled. ``In retrospect it was almost like we
turned a corner in our national psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's amazed at the intensity of interest in his second
flight, which is scheduled to blast off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio senator figured there would be flurries of publicity
when he was selected for the mission in January and right before
the shuttle launch.
</P>
<P>
   But the levels of attentiveness have continued to rise, perhaps
fueled by cover stories in national news magazines and a prime time
segment on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has arguably become the nation's most prominent senior
citizen and anticipation about his return to space is spreading as
liftoff approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin has urged the nation to whisper
``Godspeed, John Glenn'' when Discovery lifts off, echoing the
comments of Mercury astronaut Scott Carpenter when his colleague
and friend blasted off for the first time 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Perth, Australia, plan to illuminate their city
as Discovery flies over, just as they did when Glenn's tiny Mercury
capsule soared above them.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the shuttle will not pass directly over Perth in
its orbit has not dampened enthusiasm at all, and Commander Curt
Brown promises to put the Discovery on an angle that will allow the
crew to view the light show, weather permitting. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Aussies are not the only international participants in the
Glenn phenomenon. Several of the 54 satellite TV trucks jamming
parking areas at the Kennedy Space Center are operated by crews
from Japan or the member nations of the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers also recognize a hot property when they see one. In
addition to the usual souvenir T-shirts, medallions and buttons,
the toy company Mattel has expanded its line to include an action
figure of Glenn and models of his Friendship 7 capsule and the
shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn insists the tidal wave of interest in him, then and now,
would have been afforded whoever logged the country's first orbital
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not for me,'' he says of the ticker tape parade in
New York, an appearance before a joint session of Congress and the
past accolades that established a foundation for his successes in
business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get up every morning thinking that I am a hero,''
Glenn insists.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, however, believe that Glenn has once again struck
a chord with a national psyche in search of a dose of euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are multiple reasons why the public is caught up in
this,'' speculates William Burrows, journalist and author of the
recently published book, ``This New Ocean: The Story of the First
Age of Space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons is that people are fed up with the food
fight in Washington right now, and they are looking for something
that is kind of ennobling, he said. ``Here you have something that
is playing counterpoint to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe a catastrophic accident on this mission
would produce a national sense of gloom every bit as powerful as
the current exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   But many others believe the country is better prepared deal with
an accident because of the Challenger disaster and the multiple
crises Americans faced aboard Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, the public has come along and understands the
reality of exploratory adventures,'' said Andrew Chaikin, the
author of ``America on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo
Astronauts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hope (a catastrophe) would not shut down the program,''
said Chaikin. ``The potential is probably there, but maybe we are
at a different point now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's necessary to say those of us who ride these
machines, including John Glenn, are expendable,'' said Carpenter,
who also participates in under sea exploration. ``And for good
cause.'' &QL;

   &UR; Cassatt Retrospective In Chicago and Boston &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``No woman has the right to draw like that,'' said Edgar Degas
of Mary Cassatt. You can take the measure of her talent yourself
when viewing ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman,'' her first major
retrospective for nearly 30 years, at the Art Institute of Chicago.
The exhibition, which opened on Oct. 13 and runs through Jan. 10,
brings together about 100 paintings, pastels, drawings and prints
from more than 40 museums and private collections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pittsburgh and brought up in Philadelphia, Mary Cassatt
left home in 1865 at age 21 to travel and study in Europe. In 1874
she settled in Paris. Working with artists like Degas, Monet and
Pissarro, Cassatt made her way to the top of the art world when
painting was the province of men. She was the only American invited
to exhibit with the Impressionists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the 1890s, Cassatt had started to produce more modern works
in subject matter and style, with bold patterns, flattened
perspectives and simplified designs. Cassatt's signature works of
mothers and children are well represented in the show, as are her
lesser-known early pieces painted in Italy and Spain, her interior
paintings and her innovative color prints. The three-piece mural
``Modern Woman,'' which depicted young women chasing fame, plucking
the fruits of knowledge and participating in the arts, has long
since disappeared, but the exhibition includes a large photomural
of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute of Chicago, 111 South Michigan Avenue, is open
daily. Dated and timed tickets are required, and can be bought by
calling (800) 929-5800 (or at the door if available). Admission: $5
on Tuesday; $10 on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; $14 Friday
through Sunday (plus a $3.25 charge for telephone orders).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cassatt retrospective will be at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston from Feb. 14 to May 9, and at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington from June 6 to Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time and Again: New Year's at Versailles &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With all the focus on ushering in the 21st century, travelers to
France can celebrate a New Year's Eve this year that takes them to
the 18th century instead. The event is called Le Bal du Roy, the
king's ball, and it will take place in the palace at Versailles in
what the organizers say is the first New Year's Eve party there
since the French Revolution. There will be 650 guests dining in the
Galerie des Batailles on a meal inspired by Louis XV's table, to be
prepared by Gerard Vie, of Les Trois Marches restaurant in
Versailles, which has two Michelin stars. After dinner, guests will
stroll through the king and queen's private quarters. As the king
and queen did at midnight of Jan. 1, from the Hall of Mirrors they
will view fireworks over the gardens. Then they will repair to the
King's Chapel for a Baroque music concert. Throughout the
festivities, costumed dancers will demonstrate the latest moves of
the 1780s (contemporary guests will wear black tie).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the ball, which will run from 8:30 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
is $1,300. The event is being organized by Olivier Fresnay, a
French businessman, and part of the proceeds will go toward
restoring art and furniture at the palace. Information is available
at (212) 355-0400 or e-mail at lebalduroy(AT)aol.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like an approach to both the 21st and 18th
centuries, there are plans to hold a bigger ball there on Dec. 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Renting Cars in Europe For United States Prices &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to Europe with uncertain itineraries may benefit from
the Kemwel Holiday Autos' new Carpass, a three-day voucher that
circumvents the high cost of renting cars locally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Carpass allows for three consecutive days of car rental that
can be used anytime. Vouchers must be bought in advance in the
United States, with the price depending on the kind of car and the
country involved. A subcompact, for example, costs $79 in Germany
and $159 in France; an intermediate-size car costs $179 in Britain
and $369 in Italy. Once in Europe, a renter activates the voucher
by calling a local Kemwel Holiday Autos supplier 24 hours before
the car is wanted. The pass is available for Austria, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers who want to cross borders need to make advance
arrangements with Kemwel when buying Carpasses. Unused portions are
refundable. Call (800) 678-0678.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deerfield Museum Depicts Rural Refinements &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The western Massachusetts museum village of Historic Deerfield
has added something to its 18th- and 19th-century museum houses:
the Flynt Center of Early New England Life. The inaugural
exhibition, ``Pursuing Refinement in Rural New England:
1750-1850,'' tells of Deerfield families who strove, in the words
of the Rev. Jonathan Ashley, an 18th-century Congregational
minister, to embrace ``useful improvements,'' while avoiding pride
and vanity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the elegant 18th-century looking glass and silk
garments in the exhibition may have tempted vanity, a desk and
bookcase made of mahogany and pine emphasized its owner's
education. Nothing was too insignificant to signal refinement: a
chamber pot may have been displayed by day to signify that its
owner didn't have to make nighttime trips to an outdoor privy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 pieces from Historic Deerfield's superb collection of
decorative arts and furniture made and used in the Connecticut
River Valley are now installed on the Flynt Center's second floor,
called the Museum's Attic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here too are examples of the pursuit of refinement, like the
double-blown glass door handles that often replaced simple wooden
doorknobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historic Deerfield and the Flynt Center are open daily except on
Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A $12 fee includes
all 14 museum houses and the Flynt Center and is valid for the week
of purchase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuing Refinement in Rural New England: 1750 to 1950'' will
run until 2000. For further information call (413) 774-5581.

   &QL;  FOX, HOEFFEL RACE A RECORD $ETTER
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 -- With a flood of last-minute $1,000 checks
arriving by the bushel, Rep. Jon Fox and Democratic challenger
Joseph Hoeffel have engaged in the most aggressive fundraising
drive for a U.S. House seat in Pennsylvania history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the campaigns went searching so far for campaign cash
that it snagged a $1,000 check from an American living in London.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the opponents have so far raised $2.69 million for the
rematch of their 1996 battle, in which Fox, the incumbent, beat
Hoeffel, the Montgomery County commissioner, by 84 votes.
</P>
<P>
   That slim margin has focused national attention on the 13th
District race, as House Republicans are trying to hold onto and
expand their thin 21-seat majority. And a hefty majority of the
11th hour contributions from political parties, other congressmen
and special interests have splashed into Fox's campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   From Oct. 1 to Oct. 24, Fox raised at least $223,271, according
to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission in
Washington. Over the entire two-year election cycle Fox has raised
$1.65 million, meaning 13.5 percent of that war chest came in
little more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably raised many more thousands of dollars, since,
from Oct. 15 until election day, candidates are only required to
report donations of $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Of those big-money contributions, Fox took in $105,750 in just
nine days, Oct. 15-24. This huge money drop has allowed Fox to
virtually erase his cash deficit to Hoeffel, who has long benefited
from the fact that Fox had to spend about $800,000 last spring to
beat several primary challengers.
</P>
<P>
   In October Hoeffel has raised at least $130,155, almost 13
percent of the $1.03 million he has raised over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And, without a primary opponent, Hoeffel has been able to
stockpile his money for the most important days of the campaign. In
the first two weeks of October Hoeffel spent more money, $289,688,
than Fox, $237,293.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be outspent two-to-one,'' said Ken
Horowitz, Hoeffel's spokesman, referring to the 1996 spending
margin Fox enjoyed, ``which is one of the clear differences between
then and now.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a tight race, campaign watchdogs say it's normal for
lots of money to pour in during the home stretch of the race, but
they warn that the money can also come from some of the most
dubious sources. ``At that point, you're scrounging around wherever
you can for money,'' said Ed Davis of Common Cause, the
Washington-based group that lobbies for campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch fundraising has come from predictable sources: in
the past two weeks Hoeffel has raised more than 25 percent of his
money from unions, while Fox has raked in donations from businesses
such as GM, Bell Atlantic and CoreStates.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel also received $5,000 on Oct. 17 from People for the
American Way, the liberal civil liberties group that has mounted an
ad campaign defending President Clinton against impeachment
charges. Fox took $1,000 on Oct. 24 from the Log Cabin Republicans,
an openly homosexual group supporting Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers who face little or no opposition are
dumping their money into the Fox-Hoeffel race. Fox has received
$1,000 checks from the political action committees of Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, as well as
a $1,000 personal check from his old colleague, Montgomery County
Commissioner Mario Mele.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel's campaign received $1,000 checks from the PACs of
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and Philadelphia Rep. Chaka Fattah --
not to mention another $1,000 from the U.S. citizen in London,
whose check was funnelled through Democratic headquarters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The total amounts raised by Hoeffel and Fox, at least $2.69
million, is the greatest amount ever by Pennsylvania opponents for
a House seat. This year's House candidates in Scranton -- Democrat
Patrick Casey, the son of former Gov. Bob Casey, and Republican Don
Sherwood, a local car dealer -- will spend more money than Fox and
Hoeffel. But that's because Sherwood has dumped more than $1
million of his own money into the race. Their combined fundraising
from outside sources might not top $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to FEC records, the only other House race in
Pennsylvania that compares to this year's Fox-Hoeffel duel came in
1994, when Fox beat then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. The
opponents raised more than $2.58 million that year.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still more money to be had in the next few days.
Both campaigns say they will keep taking in checks until election
day, and that a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort could
determine the winner in a year when turnout is expected to be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (campaign) finance director always wants more money,''
said Fox, adding, ``Getting out the vote is key to this election.''

HOLLYWOOD NOW PLAYS COWBOYS AND ARABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)  
 Laurie Goodstein writes about religion for The New York Times.  
 (bl)  
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arab-American actor Sayed Badreya has had no problem finding
work in Hollywood. With his dark beard and his accented English, he
has had his pick of parts as terrorists, hijackers, kidnappers and
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone,''
Badreya said by telephone from Egypt, where he is on a film shoot
with Al Pacino, playing the head of the military wing of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to Hollywood, at first I couldn't get a lot of
jobs,'' Badreya said. ``So I grew a beard and look like a really
bad Arab, and I started to get a lot of work because that's what
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of virtual invisibility, Arab-Americans are finally
finding prominence in Hollywood movies _ as terrorists and
villains. They are only the latest in a long line of ethnic groups
and nationalities cast in sterotypical bad-guy roles, from American
Indians to Germans to Japanese to African Americans to Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Each set of villains reflected the headlines and the anxieties
of its era. Each passed into obsolescence as the headlines changed.
Now, with Soviet pretensions shattered and aliens from outer space
passe, the new cinematic enemy is the Muslim extremist.
</P>
<P>
   The latest film of this genre is ``The Siege,'' which opens
Friday and stars Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce
Willis. Trailers for ``The Siege'' reduced it to the typical
terrorist scare-fare with exploding buses and shadowy images of men
in mosques, but the full-length film is a cut above. ``The Siege''
posits the dangers to democracy and freedom when the United States.
military, in pursuit of a terrorist cell operating in New York
City, imposes martial law and herds the entire Arab-American
population of Brooklyn into a detention camp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this rather mixed portrayal of Arab-Americans as both
victims and perpetrators, several anti-defamation organizations
representing American Muslims and Arabs are undertaking a
leaflet-distributing campaign outside theaters showing ``The
Siege.'' They point out that there is no avoiding the fact that its
villains are Arabs who quote the Koran and perform ablutions before
heading off to blow up innocent civilians. The anti-defamation
groups' leaflets emphasize that Islam is a peaceful, monotheistic
religion and invite moviegoers to attend open houses at local
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivities of American Muslims and Arabs are so raw right
now because ``The Siege'' follows a succession of more than a dozen
films and made-for-television movies produced in the 1980s and '90s
featuring murderous Muslim fanatics, among them ``Executive
Decision,'' ``True Lies,'' ``Voyage of Terror'' and ``Terrorist on
Trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, you take the lunatic fringe and make the
lunatic fringe represent the majority,'' said Jack Shaheen, a
professor emeritus of broadcast journalism at Southern Illinois
University. ``It would be like showing that every Catholic is an
IRA member, or every Jew was a member of the Kach party.'' He was
referring to extremist factions in Ireland and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There are between 4 and 6 million Muslims living in the United
States. Some are white or African American converts. Some are new
immigrants. Many are first- and second-generation Americans
striving for acceptance and success, much like the other ethnic
groups who came before them.
</P>
<P>
   The voices of the small circle of Muslims and Arab-Americans who
work in Hollywood are rarely heard in the discussion about movie
stereotypes. They have never formed any group to represent their
concerns. But among them, while there is less outrage than that
expressed by the anti-defamation groups based in Washington, there
is more frustration. The Muslim actors and writers, and the sole
identifiable Muslim director-producer, have an insider's
perspective on the reasons their religion is so often stereotyped
in Hollywood, and whether anything can be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge that one reason Muslim terrorists have become
frequent Hollywood fare is that terrorists who kill in the name of
Islam are a genuine threat in international politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say there are no Arab and no Muslim terrorists,''
said Moustapha Akkad, an Arab-American producer and director who
was born in Syria and who has worked in Hollywood for 45 years.
``Of course there are.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, balance it with the image of the normal
human being, the Arab-American, the family man,'' Akkad said. ``The
lack of anyone showing the other side makes it stand out that in
Hollywood, Muslims are only terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Akkad produced and directed two films
portraying Muslims as heroes. ``The Message'' (1977) told the story
of the beginning of Islam, and ``Lion of the Desert'' (1981)
starred Anthony Quinn as the real-life Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar,
who fought Mussolini's invading troops in the deserts of Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But Akkad said that raising money for such films was difficult,
and that to achieve financial success and creative freedom, he had
had to turn to another genre. He is now better known as the
executive producer of all seven movies in the ``Halloween'' horror
series, the most recent, ``Halloween H2O,'' released in August.
</P>
<P>
   And like many Muslims interviewed for this story, including the
actor Badreya, Akkad is at work on a screenplay that he hopes will
help countradict the stereotypes about Muslims. Akkad's project is
about the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone acquainted with real Muslims and Arab-Americans living in
this country knows that their lives are rich with potential plot
lines: crises of faith, cross-cultural tensions, daughters and sons
marrying outside the faith. These are some of the same dramatic
themes often tapped in movies about Roman Catholics or Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But J.D. Hall, an actor and scriptwriter who is Muslim, said:
``I've never come across a script about Muslims where they weren't
terrorists. Islam as a way of life, and the people that follow it _
I've seen documentaries but never a dramatic adaptation involving
that. My suspicion, based on experience, is that if you came up
with something like that, you'd have a devil of a time getting it
made because it doesn't involve hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, an African American who has appeared in numerous black
family sitcoms like ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' says that while
African Americans have had a modest measure of success as writers
and directors in Hollywood, Muslims and Arab-Americans are far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any political power in this country,'' Hall said
of Muslims in America. ``And we don't have the decision-making
capacity in the motion picture industry, so we can't control our
own image.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they hesitate to raise the issue, Muslims and Arabs in
Hollywood say that the preponderance of powerful Jews in the movie
industry is probably a factor, but not the cause of, negative
stereotypes of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to paint all Jews with one broad brush,'' said
Hall, ``but there's a Zionist element that is definitely against
Islam, and to the degree you sympathize with that element, if you
have the power to portray Muslims, that portrayal is not going to
be favorable.''

 &HT;    CLINTON MIXES POLITICS AND POLICY OVER SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mixing politics with policy, President Clinton used
a forum on women and Social Security on Tuesday to challenge
Republican leaders to deal with him on reforming the system next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the forum, in which five women told how Social
Security and the Family and Medical Leave Act had helped them in
times of crisis, Clinton said he expected to work with Republican
leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on a
bipartisan plan to restore the system's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming the Republican-led Congress had made time for the
insurance industry to kill a patient's bill of rights, the tobacco
industry to kill anti-smoking legislation, and for special
interests to kill campaign finance reform, Clinton said: ``I think
the Senate majority leader will be able to find time to work with
me to save Social Security. And I certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., quickly issued a statement saying, ``I am
committed to genuine Social Security reform and, after the
election, I will work with anyone who shares that commitment. The
president's credibility crisis leaves many wondering whether he can
be trusted with such an important policy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-level exchange came one week before congressional
elections. In the campaign, Democrats have been warning that
Republicans may try to use much of the federal budget surplus for
tax relief rather than for Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum Tuesday in the White House East Room, Clinton
stressed that the only way to ensure reform would be to elect a
Congress ``100 percent committed'' to reserving the surplus for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for a White House conference on Social
Security reform for Dec. 8 and 9, and plans to follow that with
negotiations with congressional leaders next year leading to
passage of a bipartisan reform bill. Without reform, the program
will be unable to fully pay benefits beginning in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   In a prelude to the December conference, the women selected for
the forum stressed not only Social Security's guaranteed benefits
for the elderly, but also survivors benefits for children of
deceased workers and disability benefits for the families of
seriously ill or injured workers. Clinton noted that about
one-third of the 44 million Americans receiving Social Security
benefits are either disabled or survivors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the administration has been careful not to tip its hand
by revealing the kinds of reform it would support, and Clinton
noted the difficult decisions that will be faced between offering
individuals greater flexibility in investing their savings _ with
the possibility of higher returns _ while still providing the
guaranteed security that Social Security now offers, particularly
for women.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the president's National Economic Council
highlighted the importance of Social Security to women. It noted
women generally live longer, earn and save less, and are more
dependent on the program to keep them out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Women live longer than men. The average 65-year-old woman has a
life expectancy to 85 compare to 81 for men.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly women are more likely than elderly men _ 13 percent to 7
percent _ to live in poverty, while the rate among unmarried
elderly women (widowed, divorced or never married) is close to 19
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those unmarried elderly women, 51 percent receive their total
income from Social Security, compared to 39 percent for unmarried
elderly men and 36 percent for married elderly couples.
</P>
<P>
   Because women move in and out of the workplace more frequently
than men, and because their pay levels are generally lower, women
are less likely to have adequate pensions or savings than men.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to expand the Family and Medical Leave
Act so that time taken for family emergencies would not be deducted
from a person's eligibility for vesting or other pension benefits.
He noted that women are more likely than men to use the act to care
for sick children, parents and spouses.

 UNDATED: be favorable.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more pervasive reason for stereotyping is that few
Americans, in Hollywood and elsewhere, have firsthand knowledge of
Islam, say American Muslim leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not intentional,'' said Aslam Abdullah, the Los
Angeles-based editor of Minaret Magazine, who recently helped found
a Muslim resource center for filmmakers. ``It is primarily
ignorance. People do not know us. And we have not made any
systematic effort to reach out to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious evidence of ignorance is that many movies and
television shows, and undoubtedly many Americans, make the mistake
of equating Arabs with Muslims. In fact, only about 12 percent of
the world's Muslims are Arabs. Far more Muslims live in Malaysia,
Indonesia and India than in the Middle East. And most Americans
wrongly assume that, conversely, all Arabs are Muslims. The truth
is that many Arabs, particularly Palestinians, Lebanese and
Egyptians, are Christians. Of the 3 million or so Arab-Americans
now living in the United States, a large majority are Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for Arabs and Muslims in Hollywood is not all bleak.
Even Badreya, so often cast as terrorist, played a heroic Arab
pilot in 1996's ``Independence Day.'' And a handful of
Arab-American and Muslim actors whose skin tone and accent allow
them to ``pass'' have consistently avoided being typecast as
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   F. Murray Abraham, who received an Academy Award for his
portrayal of Salieri in ``Amadeus,'' (1984) is among them. (Early
in his career, Abraham dropped his first name ``Fahrid'' to avoid
being typecast ``as a sour Arab out to kill everyone,'' he once
told an interviewer.)
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, an Orthodox Christian, is the son of a Syrian father
and an Italian-American mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Shalhoub, an American of Lebanese heritage, has played a
Russian, a Jew, several Italians (he was the hapless cab driver on
NBC's ``Wings'' and the temperamental Italian chef in ``Big
Night'') and many nondescript Caucasian Americans. When he first
began acting, he was offered roles as a terrorist, he said in an
interview. But ``once you start turning them down,'' he added,
``they stop calling with those roles.''
</P>
<P>
   One twist in the controversy over ``The Siege'' is that the film
offered Shalhoub a sophisticated and nuanced role as an
Arab-American. Shalhoub plays Frank Haddad, an FBI agent whose
loyalty to the United States is tested when his son is among those
rounded up for detention.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Zwick, the director of ``The Siege,'' pointed out that
Haddad is ``the single rounded character in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one with whom we even imagine a life, see him at
home, with his family. He is not gratuitous or token at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, both Zwick and Lawrence Wright, the film's
principal screenwriter, defended the Arab-terrorist scenario of
``The Siege'' as legitimate and, judging from recent headlines,
even prescient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were there a story about Baruch Goldstein,'' Zwick said,
referring to an Israeli militant who murdered 29 Muslims in Hebron
in 1994, ``and an attack on the mosques, and about Jewish
fundamentalism, I would tell that story too. I would not believe
that that depiction is inflammatory by talking about marginal
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a journalist who has traveled in the Middle East and
worked in Cairo as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam war,
said: ``If I had felt `The Siege' was anti-Arab, I would have taken
my name off of it. The fact is, I'm proud to have my name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the criticism from Arab and Muslim anti-defamation groups,
Wright said: ``I understand their anxiety and paranoia about the
way Hollywood has depicted Muslims and Arabs. They're absolutely
right. Arabs have been scapegoated. It's disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet that's just what this movie is about,'' he said.
``It's all about what happens when you blame a group for the
violence of individuals.''

   NEW YORK _ In a performance believed to be the first since 1909,
the pianist Margaret Leng Tan will resurrect Arthur Bergh's setting
of the Edgar Allan Poe poem ``The Raven'' in a Halloween
celebration at 8 p.m. Saturday at St. Ann's, the landmark church at
Clinton and Montague streets in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   An orchestral version of the work, conducted by Bergh, had its
premiere at Carnegie Hall in April 1909, three months after the
premiere of the piano version. Poe will be the focal figure in the
celebration, assembled by Arts at St. Ann's and Hal Willner, a
record producer.
</P>
<P>
   Taking part in readings will be actors and musicians including
Steve Buscemi, Lili Taylor, Colin Quinn, John Ventimiglia, Umar Bin
Hassan and John Cale. Musical settings will be supplied by Garth
Hudson, Elysian Fields, Mark Bingham and Lenny Pickett.

the occasion was the celebration of its 100th birthday.

   With Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, members of Parliament and

   Should children be introduced to live theater? Those who answer
``yes'' can find their reward through the third annual Kids Night
on Broadway. This program offers children from 6 to 18 in nearly 50
participating cities _ from Amherst, N.Y., and Grand Rapids, Mich.,
to Wilmington, Del., and Tulsa, Okla. _ a free ticket to a Broadway
show when they are accompanied by an adult with a full-price
ticket.

<P>
   As part of Kids Night, created in 1996 by the League of American
Theaters and Producers and the Theater Development Fund, most
cities are offering a 7 p.m. curtain and parking and restaurant
discounts. In New York, where 16 shows are participating, Kids
Nights are Jan. 26 and Feb. 2. National information may be obtained
from (888) 411-2929; the New York metropolitan area number is (212)

CLINTON SAYS 75 MILLION BABY BOOMERS FACE DIRE FINANCIAL TIMES IF
SOCIAL SECURITY ISN'T RESCUED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, focusing on a favorite
Democratic theme a week before Election Day, said Tuesday that
Congress must save Social Security now or 75 million baby boomers
could face dire financial times in their sunset years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated the ``save Social Security first'' pledge he
made in his State of the Union Address last January and said that
insolvency in the retirement account would hurt women most.
</P>
<P>
   The president, at a White House event featuring and attended
mostly by women, assailed Republicans for trying to thwart his plan
to earmark funds in a projected budget surplus to rescue the
financially ailing government retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent much of his speech deriding GOP partisanship,
used partisan tones in criticizing congressional Republicans for
proposing that the surplus be used to fund tax cuts rather than
Social Security. The president's comments followed recent remarks
from GOP members of Congress who said they would find it difficult
to cooperate with him on many issues, including what to do with the
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's just election-season rhetoric,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to tax cuts,'' Clinton said at the White House
event that featured five women who have benefited from Social
Security. ``I'm just opposed to using the surplus to fund tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing White House data, said Social Security accounts
for 51 percent of the income for unmarried women older than age 65
but only 39 percent of the earnings for single men at that age.
This disparity is especially troubling because women have a higher
life expectancy than men and therefore have greater need for a
pension, Clinton said, using information from his National Economic
Council's Interagency Working Group on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, the president proposed permitting married people
to receive a 75-percent survivor benefit following the death of a
spouse, compared to the current system that allows surviving
husbands and wives to receive only 50 percent of the monthly
benefits they received as a married couple. Under the president's
proposal, married people who opt for the 75 percent survivor
benefit would receive reduced benefits while they are both alive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed letting workers who take time off to care
for a newborn child or sick relative under the federal Family and
Medical Leave Act have that time count toward Social Security
vesting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be a partisan issue,'' Clinton said of saving
the Social Security trust fund. He urged Congress to start
``putting people over politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, in a nod to Democratic senators facing tough
re-election fights, said his proposals are mere extensions of ideas
first endorsed by Barbara Boxer of California and Carol
Moseley-Braun of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, appearing with Clinton at the event,
echoed the president in saying that the budget surplus must be
protected against ``risky budget-busting tax schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Clinton and Gore at a table in front of more than 100
invited guests were the five women who said they were grateful for
Social Security: Molly Lozoff of Miami, a retired Realtor who
raised four children by herself after her husband died; Wilma Haga
of Bristol, Tenn., a retired school cafeteria worker whose husband
died about eight years ago; Bernice Meyer of Seattle, a 49-year-old
home healthcare aide whose primary pension will be Social Security;
Lucy Sanchez of Washington, a wife and daughter who has had to use
the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for her sick husband and
mother; and Tyra Brown of Washington, a Howard University student
who was a teenager when her mother died, leaving the family
dependent on Social Security survivor benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there for me,'' Brown said of Social Security. ``I want
it to be there in the future.'' &QL;

`A MAN IN FULL': WOLFE TURNS `BONFIRE' UPSIDE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
(editors: boldfaced words should be italicized) 
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Tom Wolfe's first novel, ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
(1987), gave us a satiric portrait of New York in the giddy go-go
years of the 1980s _ those heady years when bond salesmen could
think of themselves as ``Masters of the Universe'' _ his sprawling
new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' gives us an equally entertaining
portrait of Atlanta in the 1990s, an era when greed has begun to
give way to debt, capitalistic hubris to premillennial doubts.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, almost from the start, that ``A Man in Full'' (which
will be available in stores Nov. 9) is a big if qualified leap
forward for Wolfe as a novelist. The cartoonish cast of ``Bonfire''
_ a collection of physical and sartorial tics animated by heaps of
authorial malice _ has been replaced by characters who bear more of
a resemblance to real, sympathetic human beings, and Wolfe's
novelistic canvas has expanded persuasively to include not merely
the powerful and rich but also the poor and middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Wolfe's nimble, often enthralling
orchestration of several rollicking story lines _ cross-cut
cinematically to build tension _ comes to a screeching halt in the
last few chapters of this novel as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus,
of all people, is introduced as a crude deus ex machina cum
self-help guru to provide this thick, Dickensian novel with an
abrupt, unsatisfying ending.
</P>
<P>
   As in Wolfe's last novel, an interracial incident that threatens
to be as incendiary as the Rodney King trial or Tawana Brawley case
holds center stage in this volume. In ``Bonfire,'' a white yuppie
stood accused of injuring a young black man in a hit-and-run
accident; in ``A Man in Full,'' a black football star named Fareek
Fanon is suspected of raping the daughter of a wealthy white
businessman. This incident not only provides Wolfe with ample
opportunities to satirize racial politics in Atlanta (not to
mention the politics of political correctness) but also gives him a
convenient pivot around which he can put several plot lines into
play.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those plot lines is the story of a blustering real
estate developer by the name of Charlie Croker, the so-called
``King of the Crackers,'' who presides, like a foul-mouthed
antebellum lord, over a 29,000-acre plantation and a vast
conglomerate of enterprises, including Croker Global Foods. These
days, however, Charlie has slipped into a late midlife crisis: at
60, he is suffering from a bad knee, doubts about his 28-year-old
trophy wife and high anxiety over the half-billion dollars he owes
his creditors. His money problems draw him willy-nilly into a
political scheme cooked up by the mayor of Atlanta to promote his
own re-election while defusing the explosive Fanon case.
</P>
<P>
   While Charlie is having trouble living on several million
dollars a year (much the way Sherman McCoy, in ``Bonfire,'' had
trouble living on $980,000 a year), Wolfe's other characters are
having similar difficulties on their far more modest incomes.
Raymond Peepgass, the mousy banker with Charlie's chief creditor,
PlannersBanc, can't make ends meet on $130,000 a year: he's already
maxed out 19 of his 22 Visa cards and owes his lawyer thousands
more for handling a paternity suit. As for Conrad Hensley, an
earnest young man who works in a Croker warehouse and finds his
life bizarrely colliding with his boss', he sees his dreams of
buying a condo for his family rapidly slipping away on his
$14-an-hour paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent the better part of his career as a reporter who
ardently documented his subjects' lives with dozens of physical and
sociological details, Wolfe tends to build up his characters from
the outside in. The reverse of a Method actor, he's a craftsman who
believes that people can be defined by externals like money and
clothing, that their behavior is largely driven by social context
and status (or lack of it).
</P>
<P>
   And so, Wolfe tells us what sort of cars his characters drive:
``a silver-gray four-door Lexus sedan,'' a ``rattling old Hyundai''
or a rented ``black Volvo 960 with veal-beige leather seats.'' What
sort of clothes they wear: ``a new hard-finished worsted navy suit
from Gus Carroll, a high-necked tab-collar shirt and a pale-blue
crepe de chine necktie with a &UR; perfect  &LR; dimple.'' And what their
accents sound like: `` `Unnh-unnh- &UR; unn
</P>
<P>
   There's Fareek Fanon, the football star, ``225 pounds of
attitude,'' wearing around his neck ``a gold chain so chunky you
could have used it to pull an Isuzu pickup out of a red clay
ditch.'' And there's Fanon's accuser, Inman Armholster, the sort of
ornery ``fat white man who exists only in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But if these characters are thorough stereotypes, Wolfe's main
men (Charlie Croker, Conrad Hensley and Raymond Peepgass) are more
three-dimensional, more fully fashioned human beings. Writing from
their point of view, Wolfe endows them with frustrations, fears and
conflicts that turn them into recognizable individuals while at the
same time using their picaresque adventures to try to create the
sort of big work of social realism, based on research and
reporting, that he has long advocated as a means (in his view,
 &UR; the &LR;  means) of capturing the Zeitgeist of ``this wild, bizarre,
unpredictable, Hog-stomping baroque country of ours'' as it
slouches towards the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``A Man in Full'' aspires to giving the reader an
inside look at how deals are struck in big city politics, how real
estate empires can be built on debt, how alpha males struggle to
achieve dominance on the football field, in business and in high
society.
</P>
<P>
   And Wolfe does give us some dazzling, funny, wrenching set
pieces, all rendered in his exclamatory, adrenaline-laced prose,
that take us from a plantation deep in the heart of Georgia to a
prison in Alameda County in California, from a glittering art
opening in Atlanta to a numbing night shift in a warehouse stocked
with frozen food.
</P>
<P>
   In his controversial 1989 Harper's manifesto for ``the new
social novel,'' Wolfe dismissed the notion that American life was
too ``chaotic, fragmented, random, discontinuous'' to be captured _
roped, tied down and branded _ by contemporary fiction writers, and
the strongest sections of ``A Man in Full'' do in fact leave us
with a sense of what it's like to live in the ``billion-footed''
world of today.
</P>
<P>
   The book's hokey, stage-managed ending, however, suggests that
Wolfe sees the world as such an absurd place _ such a chaotic,
fragmented, random, discontinuous place _ that he could cavalierly
(or desperately) tack ona ending that has virtually nothing to do
with what has gone before, a conclusion that subjects his
characters to fates that seem preposterous even in the ``age of
anomalies'' so energetically conjured up in this bold but flawed
new novel.

   NEW YORK _ ``All boys, all day'' is how Rich Cronin, president
of Fox Family Channels, described the new cable channel his company
plans to start next year. On cue, a dozen slightly awestruck
third-grade boys from East Harlem trotted into the midtown
Manhattan hotel room where Cronin was making his announcement
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before feminists in the room could object, Cronin announced
another new channel _ and the boys' female classmates entered.
</P>
<P>
   The children had been borrowed from P.S. 101, the Andrew Draper
Academy, on East 111th Street (a former teacher there is the sister
of a Fox Family Web-site executive) for Fox Family's announcement
that it would start the Boyz Channel and the Girlz Channel,
offering entertainment and educational programming (wonder if
they'll tackle spelling?) geared specifically and separately to
each sex, for ages up to 14.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. the channels will switch to programs for parents, and
these, too, will be gender-specific, focusing on ``parenting
issues'' in raising boys or girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not stereotyping,'' Cronin said. ``You have Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts, boys' clubs and girls' clubs, boys' schools and
girls' schools, camps for boys and camps for girls, magazines for
boys and magazines for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a fact of life,'' he said, that there are some
television shows that boys love and girls hate, and vice versa. He
said Fox's research had shown that children want separate channels,
and that Fox would develop programs for them based on what children
say they like.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin also presides over the Fox Kids Network, carried by Fox's
broadcast stations on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings,
where a problem for some advertisers is that the lineup attracts
far more boys than girls, with shows like ``Power Rangers,''
``Spider-Man'' and ``Young Hercules.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon, the network most watched by children, uses a
different strategy, trying to develop shows that both sexes will
watch, including some with female lead characters, like ``The
Secret World of Alex Mack'' and ``The Mystery Files of Shelby
Woo.''

   Plotting Into the Night
</P>
<P>
   CBS is quietly putting the pieces in place for its new
late-night show with Craig Kilborn. The network has selected Billy
Kimball, a comedy writer and producer, to be the executive producer
of the show, which will replace Tom Snyder's talk show as the 12:35
companion to David Letterman's ``Late Show'' early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball's appointment is expected to be announced Wednesday. A
one-time editor of the Harvard Lampoon, Kimball has mostly been
associated with the Comedy Central channel in recent years, having
worked on its satirical political specials like ``Indecision '92''
and ``State of the Union Undressed.'' Earlier in his career he was
an Emmy-nominated comedy writer for HBO's ``Not Necessarily the
News.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn's show could start as early as February or as late as
April. The network will not rush it onto the air until it is
convinced that the show is ready, a network executive said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has agreed to stay on with his show until Kilborn's
starts, the CBS executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lassally, executive producer of Snyder's show, who
previously held the same job on Letterman's show, will stay on as a
consultant to Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants,
advising on both Letterman's and Kilborn's shows.

   Covering John Glenn
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering about the extent of interest in 77-year-old
John Glenn's return to space, almost four decades after he became
the first American to orbit the earth, could get an idea from this
week's television listings.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are all the television news outfits, both broadcast and
cable, covering Glenn's scheduled launching aboard the space
shuttle Discovery on Thursday live, but a variety of specials is
being served up all week.
</P>
<P>
   Two networks took advantage of the link in many people's minds
between Glenn's original flight and Walter Cronkite's voice.
Cronkite's broadcast of the 1962 launching and landing ranks among
the best-remembered events in the legendary CBS anchor's career.
</P>
<P>
   But Cronkite will not be working for CBS News on Thursday at the
Kennedy Space Center. He will be part of the two-man commentary
team (with Miles O'Brien) covering the launching for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite also narrated the first documentary in a series of
three on Monday night on the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' series presented a new
episode, ``John Glenn: The All-American Hero,'' and CNN showed
``The John Glenn Story.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, PBS offers a one-hour documentary, ``John
Glenn: American Hero,'' written and produced by Blaine Baggett, a
filmmaker who was among the candidates to be the first journalist
in space, before that idea was abandoned in the wake of the
Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
   An MSNBC commentator for the launching will be Scott Carpenter,
one of Glenn's ``teammates'' among the original Mercury astronauts.
Fox News Channel, the third all-news cable channel, will have
another early astronaut, James Lovell Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On the day itself, NBC's ``Today'' show anchors, Katie Couric
and Matt Lauer, will both be at Cape Canaveral, as will Al Roker,
the weatherman. The show's ABC rival, ``Good Morning America,'' has
sent Kevin Newman (his co-anchor, Lisa McRee, will stay in New
York) and its weatherman, Spencer Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Thalia Assuras, the CBS ``This Morning'' news anchor, will be
there, but the program's co-anchors, Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot,
will not. Ms. Robelot had her first child, a son, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ LAWRIE MIFFLIN
</P>
<P>
   A Comedown for NBC
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the changes at the top of NBC's programming
department, the network suffered through one of its worst ratings
weeks in recent years last week, finishing last among viewers, and
third among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the network's
main target group.
</P>
<P>
   Fox zoomed to the top, on the strength of two World Series
games. CBS was second in total viewers, ABC was third, and NBC,
which relied on a lot of repeat programming, especially on its
powerhouse Thursday night, finished last. Among young adult viewers
the order was Fox, ABC, NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also got some bad news from Monday's ratings, when ``Will
and Grace,'' a new comedy it had been counting on to grow into a
substantial hit, was beaten badly by a repeat of CBS' ``Everybody
Loves Raymond.''

NEW CHELSEA AND THE EVANESCENCE OF CHIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other day, an artist who will remain nameless for
obvious reasons told me she was worried about her forthcoming show,
not because the work was causing her more than the usual anxiety
but because her gallery happens not to be in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I knew what she meant. At last count, around 60
galleries had colonized the area roughly between 17th Street and
27th Street on the far West Side of Manhattan. Dealers there are
ecstatic, and why not? Foot traffic is booming. For these 15
minutes, at least, it's the new epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a couple of days recently making the rounds of the
neighborhood. I liked Chelsea very much when it first started to
develop as the un-SoHo, but now, though I still want to like it,
I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's not the art. The art is simply what it is, location
notwithstanding, and this time around, for instance, I got a kick
out of Nayland Blake's gingerbread house at Matthew Marks and James
Welling's photographs at Leslie Tonkonow.
</P>
<P>
   There were also Sue Williams' new paintings at 303 Gallery to
see, and Louise Fishman's at Cheim &AMP; Reid. (Do you remember, by the
way, a decade ago, long before the Chelsea boomlet, when that space
was Larry Gagosian's gallery? Too far ahead of the curve, it didn't
last long.)
</P>
<P>
   I stopped at a few galleries I hadn't visited before, which
always reduces my guilt level, although making the rounds is like
changing light bulbs in the Empire State Building: by the time you
finish one cycle you're behind in the next. Guilt is built in.
</P>
<P>
   It was just three years ago that only a handful of galleries
existed among Chelsea's taxi garages. When you went to see them, or
to see the Dia Center for the Arts, which was already there and a
kind of magnet to the area, you were probably making a minor
pilgrimage because Chelsea is out of the way for most people.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of its attraction: people went there specifically
to look at art, as was no longer the case in SoHo, and moreover
they were going to a place that seemed to evoke something of SoHo's
former character because it was largely industrial. (It triggered
the art world's Pavlovian response to la vie de boheme.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually the resemblance to SoHo was superficial. I happened to
grow up next to SoHo and vaguely remember as a child thinking _ the
way we all think when we have a stake in the past, which blinds us
to the future _ that the old neighborhood had been taken over by
outsiders after the first galleries opened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, SoHo's virtue was that its growth was organic and
bottom up. It was an architecture of airy cast-iron lofts. Artists
moved in because the spaces were cheap and practical. Then
galleries followed.
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal gallery was Leo Castelli's, at 420 West Broadway,
which resembled an artist's loft. In SoHo, dealers were mostly in
plain sight, and the ambient aim, even if it increasingly wasn't
achieved, was to be informal and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   In Chelsea the evolution has roughly been reversed. It is an
architecture of storage facilities and garages, less easily
adaptable to art. There are artist studios in the area, but it is
not, nor was it ever, where many artists lived. The new galleries
arrived pretty much ex nihilo, the first ones mostly belonging to
high-enders like Matthew Marks, Barbara Gladstone, Paula Cooper and
Metro Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Marks' gallery on 22nd Street, in a converted single-story
garage with skylights, turned out to be a spare and handsome place
with a big window on the street that makes the art inside visible
from outside, a friendly arrangement roughly mimicked by the new
Postmasters, with a glass storefront on 18th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But most Chelsea galleries are chilly and turn inward. The
spaces feel antiseptic, awkward. They tend to speak of money.
Dealers too often opt to be out of sight, with offices on a
separate floor. Sometimes the architecture is grand _ Paula
Cooper's gallery is stunning to look at _ but so grand that the
architecture can overwhelm the art.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Rosen's gallery on 24th Street exemplifies the problem.
It's like a mausoleum, tall and windowless, with a hallway to an
office in the back, the office blocked from view by a giant file
cabinet so that, like a child, anyone with a question about what's
on view must stand on tiptoes to talk to the 20-somethings who work
there.
</P>
<P>
   A few scrappy galleries have found quarters more or less in the
interstices of the neighborhood. Team, for instance, is in a
basement on 26th Street, and Kenny Schacter/Rove uses an unfinished
warehouse, noble but grim.
</P>
<P>
   As for the big new mall buildings (529 West 20th Street, for
example), let's just say that once the elevators arrive and you
make your way inside some of the galleries, the views of the Hudson
aren't bad.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent dealer like Bill Maynes told me he has 10 times as
much space in the building for twice the price of what his gallery
in SoHo cost, but the old gallery, where he specialized in small
works, was distinctive and matched the art he showed. Everything is
a trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   New York is not Los Angeles, yet Chelsea's rapid rise is a
phenomenon perhaps more typical in Los Angeles than in New York,
which may explain its rootless ethos. In L.A., a car culture,
galleries will cluster in one place, then pick up and move
somewhere else a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Moving around fits the character of the place, where a
multigallery development like, say, Bergamot Station, is a matter
of real estate prices combined with collective bargaining, a
temporary arrangement subject to the whims of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the arc of fashion that a thing becomes chic, then
passe, then maybe it achieves retrochic. With Manhattan
neighborhoods these days, the evolution seems rapid. SoHo is passe.
Chelsea, having become chic, has already been diluted by a number
of SoHo's schlock galleries. It is now closer in character to 57th
Street than to SoHo as a center for the business of art; though,
contrary to the old assumptions about uptown galleries versus
downtown galleries, many of the galleries on 57th Street actually
feel less pretentious. Who knows? SoHo may soon seem retrochic.
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder how long it will be before the arrival in Chelsea
of SoHo's clothing shops, which finally overwhelmed the
neighborhood and turned it into a retail mall, count to one: I was
told last week that the Con Edison trucks on 22nd Street, outside
303 Gallery, were there for the new Comme des Garcons shop.
</P>
<P>
   Then I stopped in to see Leslie Tonkonow at 601 West 26th
Street, and she told me that she had heard that the owners of her
building were asking new renters three times what they were
charging when she arrived two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An old industrial facility long known as the Starrett-Lehigh
building, 601 West 26th has housed a typical fringe New York mix:
box manufacturers, printers, hospital storage rooms and a
cheesecake company, along with a few artists' studios.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's placing advertisements in The New York Times calling
itself the Starrett-Lehigh Center for Creative Arts, Media and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there goes the neighborhood.

WHITE HOUSE DRUG OFFICIAL URGES DEFEAT OF MARIJUANA INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House drug adviser on Tuesday urged
voters in five states and the District of Columbia to reject ballot
initiatives that would legalize marijuana for medical uses, saying
that medical treatments shouldn't be decided ``by popular vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be blunt, these initiatives would result in the
quasi-legalization of marijuana,'' Barry McCaffrey, White House
drug policy director, told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   He said passing the initiatives would send the wrong message to
young Americans, adding that the use of marijuana among minors has
risen over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said decisions to use certain drugs for medical use
should be based on science rather than politics. ``Medicine is not
determined by popular vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of California, which passed a similar measure
in 1996, voters in Alaska, Arizona, the District of Columbia,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington state will find initiatives on their
Nov. 3 ballots. The measures would allow physicians, under defined
conditions, to obtain and dispense marijuana as a palliative to
their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters already passed an initiative legalizing medical
marijuana in 1996, but the referendum was block by the state
legislature when it discovered that the measure also allowed
doctors to prescribe 116 other drugs, including LSD, heroin and
PCP.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has strongly denounced the
initiatives, saying that scientists have not proven conclusively
the medical benefits of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the determination as to whether there is a
medical use for marijuana should be made at the ballot box,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the initiatives say there are many cancer and AIDS
patients for whom marijuana is the most effective drug in relieving
nausea and other debilitating side-effects of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has told us that they support the right of
suffering patients to use medical marijuana,'' said Wayne Turner,
who helped organize the ballot initiative in the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey suggested that if a certain chemical in marijuana is
found to help patients, doctors could prescribe pills containing
only that chemical rather than allowing the patient to smoke the
narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With pills or patches, there's no need to be giving a joint or
a bong to terminally-ill patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, proponents of the initiatives say that research has
shown that smoking marijuana is more effective than pills and
patches containing THC _ the chemical found in marijuana that some
scientists and physicians believe is beneficial to terminally-ill
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of California's initiative two years ago,
state and federal authorities have made a persistent effort to
prevent people from selling to marijuana individuals who obtain a
doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fratello, spokesman for Los Angeles-based Americans for
Medical Rights _ which is coordinating the ballot drives Alaska,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington state _ said in a statement that his
group hopes to put the medical marijuana initiatives on more states
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to change national policy, but we know we will
have to win more battles in 1999 and 2000 before that happens,''
said Fratello, whose group will spend $2 million on advertisements
supporting the state initiatives.

   FBC-GSUGSU _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Southern might have pulled off
the steal of the century two years ago when it recruited Adrian
Peterson out of Alachua High School in Florida. Peterson was a
football star with incredible talent, but a speech impediment
caused major schools to back away thinking he might be an academic
risk. So GSU assistant Tracy Ham, an Alachua graduate, convinced
Peterson to come to Georgia Southern and he has taken Division I-AA
by storm. Peterson broke GSU single-season rushing record in last
week's victory over The Citadel and has fans in Statesboro thinking
of the glory days when GSU was competing for national titles year

   FBC-GATORS_ GAINESVILLE, Fla._ Florida is 5-1 and ranked No. 5
in the nation. So why are people here not as excited as normal
about the Gators? Their only loss was in overtime to No. 3
Tennessee in a game they could have easily won. Part of the problem
is an offense that doesn't score 50 points each time out and win
games as decisively as they used to. The other problem is Florida
had a very special collection of athletes in 1995 and 1996 when
they played for the national championship. They set the
expectations bar very high -- maybe too high. Despite all this,
Florida enters Saturday's game with Georgia in the hunt for the
national championship. But do they really feel like a national
championship team? (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    COLUMN: Once upon a time, `small meow' helped candidates roar
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The headline on a story about political contributions the other
day really struck me. It said, ``Georgia `fat cat' contributors
only make a small meow.'' Add my family to that small meow list.
</P>
<P>
   We always put a political contribution in the budget, along with
a tithe for the church. But looking at today's contributors, I am
woefully embarrassed. The Home Depot chairman and his wife,
$52,500, for goodness' sake!
</P>
<P>
   The most I ever remember my parents contributing to any
candidate was $10.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, $10 out of the salary of a sawmill operator during
the Depression wasn't chicken feed. And the spirit was certainly
all right. If you believe in the candidate, said my father, help
him out. Unfortunately, he helped out Herbert Hoover with his $10 _
and spent the rest of his life regretting it. A lifelong Democrat,
he was turned off by Al Smith's plan to repeal Prohibition,
although he would have been the first to admit that it wasn't
working. Our woods were full of moonshiners. His only hope was that
his $10 didn't help Mr. Hoover much.
</P>
<P>
   We thought a lot about that $10 gone awry, but we never doubted
the impulse behind it. If you believe ... help. Later, the $10
dwindled to $5, and after I grew up and was making $12 a week on
The Mobile(Ala.) Press, I dropped to $2.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that comforts me is that, in those days,
candidates did not have to buy television time and my $2 may have
bought them some ink for cardboard signs ornamenting all the
roadside trees in Mobile County. Or, even better, it would have
bought 10 gallons of gas for the campaigner's car. Remember when
``a dollar's worth of regular'' would practically fill your tank?
</P>
<P>
   Tithing for the church was absolutely essential. I don't
remember the theology behind that. You don't hear much about
tithing in church these days. They call it stewardship, and pledges
run into the thousands. But my parents were practically doomsday
tithers. They believed if you didn't give a 10th of your income,
God washed his hands of you.
</P>
<P>
   And the Reader's Digest came out and supported that view. It
reported that interviews with men in bread lines disclosed that
nobody who tithed was ever forced to stand in a bread line. I can't
believe that, but I share my mother's view that there's some
spiritual connection between giving a 10th to the church and
getting along happily with your life.
</P>
<P>
   She had a story about that. She was repairing an old house they
had bought down on St. Andrews Bay in Florida, and its needs were
many _ paint and plaster and plumbing parts. She had practically
run out of money except for $30 she owed on her tithe at the
neighborhood Methodist church. She was sorely tempted to use that
$30 to keep the work going on the old house. To combat that urge,
she walked straight to the post office and mailed it to the church,
fearing that if she waited for Sunday, she would weaken and buy
paint.
</P>
<P>
   She was walking back to the house, shuffling through dead leaves
and wondering how to cope with repairs, when she saw blowing down
the sidewalk toward her three $10 bills.
</P>

   She said it happened, and as long as she lived, she earmarked
part of her little, never adequate, income for the church _ and a

   When baby boomers were of trick-or-treat age, they pretty much
had to make do with ``It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'' for
Halloween specials. These days, Halloween has become TV's second
favorite holiday, and anywhere you swing a black cat, you'll hit a
Halloween show. A few highlights of the many:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Simpsons'' 8 p.m. EST Thursday on Fox _ If you missed
``Treehouse of Terror IX'' on Sunday, Fox repeats it right away.
The traditional ``Treehouse'' anthology episode includes the first
time real people (Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford) have
appeared on the series, interacting with the animation. It's brief,
but not a bad little special effect.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Wes Craven Presents: Don't Look Down'' 9 p.m. EST Thursday
on ABC _ The filmmaker didn't direct or write this new TV-movie; he
was just one of four executive producers. It's especially aimed to
unnerve those with a fear of heights and falling. Megan Ward
(``Party of Five'') stars.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``ER'' 10 p.m. EST Thursday on NBC _ What else could young
Lucy (Kellie Martin) mess up? How about the Halloween party at her
dorm? How about next week she imitates Rosalind Shays on ``L.A.
Law?''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'' 8 p.m. EST Friday
on CBS _ You're never too old.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Millennium'' 9 p.m. EST Friday on Fox _ A horror movie is
being shot based about an old case of Frank's (Lance Henriksen).
And speaking of old cases and horror, KISS members guest star as
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Hollywood Ghost Stories'' 9 p.m. EST Friday on AMC _ A
one-hour documentary about haunted landmarks and the like in Los
Angeles. Hosted by William Shatner. Now that's scary.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' 9 p.m. EST Friday on ABC _
``Laugh-in'' alumni JoAnne Worley, Ruth Buzzi, Gary Owens, Alan
Sues and Dave Madden guest-star as ``psychotic party animals.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Nick or Treat'' 3-9 p.m. EST Saturday on Nickeoldeon _ Nick
runs a six-hour marathon of spooky episode repeats, including
``Rugrats,'' ``The Secret World of Alex Mack,'' ``Are You Afraid of
the Dark?,'' ``The Adventures of Pete &AMP; Pete'' and ``AAAHH!!! Real
Monsters.''

   As the interim director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission,
Bruce Nourse authorized the opening of the state's first casino in
1992. But a year later, as casino neon began to flicker with
opportunity all along the Gulf coast and north into the Delta
region, Nourse traded roles. Instead of continuing to police the
casino operators, he joined them, doubling his salary and becoming
a senior vice president for Casino Magic, a casino hotel owner.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of months, the government body formed to keep
Mississippi's casino industry honest was virtually wiped out.
Nourse's successor, Lorenzo Creighton, resigned to become general
manager of a riverboat casino in St. Louis. Nine of the
commission's 10 law-enforcement agents also left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who quit'' to seek jobs in the
industry, recalled Chuck Patton, the gaming commission's current
chairman. ``It was a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   As fast as the gambling business has spread across the country,
a fast-spinning revolving door has also developed, creating a world
in which a state senator with no casino experience has in an
instant become president of a major casino, a law enforcement
official from a state attorney general's office has gone on to
become chief executive officer of the nation's most profitable
casino, and where top gaming officials from one state after another
have resigned to pursue lucrative casino careers.
</P>
<P>
   From Raymond ``Skip'' Avansino Jr., the Nevada Gaming Commission
member who went on to become president and chief operating officer
of Hilton hotels and casinos, to James E. Thompson, the Illinois
governor who first signed riverboat gambling into law in his state
and then, after leaving office, became one of the industry's key
lobbyist, the officials who wrote the rules and picked the casino
operators are reaping rewards from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulated industries, like airlines or pharmaceuticals,
have for years lured government officials into their camps. But
legalized gambling has created a robust new market for politically
connected executives, lobbyists and consultants not only because it
is growing so fast, but precisely because it is one of the nation's
most highly regulated industries at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own the politicians, regulators, judges or whoever you
need to do what you need to do, you totally control your
environment,'' said Don Williams, a political strategist in Las
Vegas and a former senior executive and part owner of casinos.
``It's always best to have these people on your side, so why not
hire these people?''
</P>
<P>
   Convincing government officials to join forces with the gambling
industry is usually easy, Williams said, adding: ``They hang around
wealth, they investigate wealth, they see money being made in areas
that they never dreamed of before. And they're learning how people
made this money.''
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider looking in, he said, joining the industry is like
becoming ``a part of the king's court.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG FEAR: It's a Matter Of Objectivity
</P>
<P>
   The high crossover rate, coming as many states are writing laws
that will govern the industry for years to come, has raised
concerns about the impartiality of the people who oversee gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly raises doubts about the objectivity and the
credibility of some of those individuals,'' said Kay Coles James,
chairwoman of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the
presidential committee that is studying the effect of legalized
gambling on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is scheduled to report its findings to
Congress next summer, has not yet considered taking action to
discourage the industry's revolving door, Ms. James said. But in
forming her staff she extracted verbal commitments from those she
hired not to leave and take jobs in the gambling industry while the
commission continued its work.
</P>
<P>
   Even though states like Nevada and New Jersey have
``cooling-off'' periods that prohibit some government employees
from immediately going to work for casinos within their own
jurisdictions, other casino states, including Mississippi, have no
such waiting periods. And in those states that do have cooling-off
periods, officials regularly get around the prohibitions by working
for subsidiaries in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of revolving-door practices contend that the cooling-off
periods, which range from one to four years, are not long enough
and do not apply to enough people. Some have suggested that
regulatory positions should be filled by people who are either near
retirement or financially secure enough to avoid being induced by
high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear is that they'll be overly friendly with the
companies they're going to go work for in the future,'' said Nelson
Rose, a gambling law professor at Whittier Law School in Costa
Mesa, Calif. ``They may think deep down subconsciously that if they
make decisions against the industry they won't get hired if they
choose to leave government.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's revolving door has become so promising that Rose
said he advises his students that the best way to get ahead in the
gambling business is to first become a regulator because they
``learn the regulatory system'' and ``of course, you make
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have switched to the casino business within
months of making decisions that benefited their future employers,
no one has been able to prove a direct exchange of a job for
favorable treatment from regulators. However, critics of the
revolving door contend that there are many cases illustrating that
state regulators are too close to the industry and are particularly
lax about exacting punishment on casinos that break the rules.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although Bally Gaming several years ago entered
into a partnership in Louisiana with a company that was later found
to have ties to organized crime, officials in New Jersey and Nevada
_ where Bally is also licensed _ allowed the company to keep its
license in those places.
</P>
<P>
   And last August, Hilton Hotels Corp. entered into an agreement
with federal prosecutors to avoid an indictment on charges that
Hilton executives paid money to a public official in Kansas City,
Mo., as a reward for his support for the Flamingo Hilton casino
project in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton denies any wrongdoing. However, in its signed pact with
prosecutors, the hotel and casino company agreed to ``acknowledge
that the Unites States has evidence'' supporting the alleged scheme
to pay the Kansas City Port Authority chairman for using his
influence to assist the company's casino project. So far,
regulators in other jurisdictions where Hilton operates casinos
have not taken any action in response, and Missouri regulators
renewed Hilton's license a month after the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they call themselves heavily regulated, it's a
good-old-boys network that is taking care of gambling companies
throughout the United States,'' said Tom Grey, executive director
of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, the nation's
most active anti-gambling organization.
</P>
<P>
   THE INCENTIVES: Instant Pay Rise In Casino Work
</P>
<P>
   Those who have traded in their bureaucratic backgrounds and
joined forces with the casino business can be found all around the
country. Mick Lura, for example, the former top administrator for
Iowa's Racing and Gaming Commission, left his job in 1993 to become
an executive at president casinos, which operates riverboats in
three states, including Iowa. He later became general manager of
the Meskwaki tribal casino in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the nation's third largest gambling
jurisdiction, after Nevada and New Jersey, there was no cooling-off
period that prohibited Nourse from going to work for a casino in
the state. But he did seek an opinion from a state ethics
commission, which cleared the way for him to join Casino Magic.
</P>
<P>
   State officials later considered putting a cooling-off period
into effect, but instead have continued to consider such moves on a
case-by-case basis, which has allowed employees of the gaming
commission to continue to get instant salary increases by taking
jobs with the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved into the industry and effectively doubled my salary,''
said Nourse, who earned about $90,000 a year with the gaming
commission. Defending his decision to become a casino executive,
Nourse noted the ``huge demand by the industry'' for regulators.
``I speak the language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hannifin, a career bureaucrat who was a longtime member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board before going on to help operate
some of the industry's largest casino companies, conceded that the
gambling business has been very good to him. ``My family and I have
been well-treated from a monetary standpoint,'' said Hannifin, now
an executive vice president at Fitzgeralds, a casino company based
in Nevada. ``I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former government officials have truly hit the jackpot in
the casino industry. Avansino, for example, was a Nevada tax lawyer
and gaming commission member who was named president and chief
operating officer of Hilton Hotels in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years Avansino led the company through a
worldwide expansion of its gambling operations. His salary and
bonuses over those years totaled $2.6 million, plus generous stock
options, according to the company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning abruptly in 1996, Avansino is now chairman of a
nonprofit foundation in Nevada, teaches gaming law at the
University of San Francisco School of Law, and shuttles on a
private plane between homes in Reno and in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such financial rewards entices others. In
September the chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission,
Bradford Smith, stepped down from his $95,000-year-post, expressing
a desire to ``maximize my earning capacity,'' and candidly said he
would like to land a job in the gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by this industry,'' he said in an interview
after his final meeting as head of the commission, which governs
the state's casinos. He also noted that he was prepared to move
outside New Jersey to avoid the state's cooling-off period and
immediately go to work for the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's predecessor, Stephen Perskie, has fared well since he
resigned in 1994. Perskie was the New Jersey General Assembly
member who wrote the 1977 statue that legalized casino gambling in
Atlantic City. After serving as chief of staff to former Gov. Jim
Florio (Florio joined the board of Bally Gaming, a major
manufacturer of casino equipment, after he was defeated by Gov.
Christie Whitman in 1993), Perskie was appointed to the casino
control commission in 1990, where he served as the state's top
regulator for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned to join the riverboat casino company, Players
International, as vice president and general counsel, and was able
to circumvent the cooling-off period because, although Players
operated casinos in other parts of the country, they had none in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while at Players, Perskie's office remained in Atlantic
City. A few years later, he left the company to go into private
practice, and is now considered one of New Jersey's top gaming
lawyers. In fact, the casino business that Perskie was instrumental
in legalizing in New Jersey has been very good to the entire
Perskie family. Three Atlantic City law firms that represent
casinos bear the Perskie family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of the revolving door is a matter of legitimate
concern,'' Perskie conceded in a recent interview. But he insisted
that in the 20 years that Atlantic City has had legalized gambling,
``there has been no threat to the public confidence or the
integrity of the regulatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PIONEERS: Early Proponents Often Prosper
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many cases the same people who have been instrumental
in setting up the casino industry in their states have gotten the
biggest opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, where gaming officials often boast of having the
toughest, most restrictive cooling-off laws, Martin Greenberg, a
former state senator who helped draft the casino control law that
governs the state's casinos, resigned from his legislative post in
1979 and within days became president of the Golden Nugget despite
having no experience in casino operations. (As a result, the
cooling-off laws in New Jersey were expanded in 1981 to include
state legislators, but most other states still do not prohibit such
moves.)
</P>
<P>
   And G. Michael Brown, who as director of the state attorney
general's division of gaming enforcement, conducted background
investigations of many of Atlantic City's first casino operators,
left his job in 1982 to go into legal practice representing foreign
casino companies. He later became became chief executive officer of
the Connecticut-based Foxwoods Casino, the nation's most profitable
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cody, who as a New Jersey assemblyman in 1977 was
chairman of the legislative committee that wrote the state's casino
control act, said he has received numerous invitations to join the
industry but refused. Cody, now a state senator, said he believes
that government officials who are interested in working for the
gambling industry tend to ``become the lap dog instead of the watch
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   But for their part, many former regulators contend that the
influx of former government officials into the industry has only
helped to clean up a once-notorious business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because it brings people with honesty, ethics and
integrity into the industry,'' said Shannon Bybee, a former member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board who went on to become president
of the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City and chairman and chief
executive officer of the Claridge casino. But Bybee, now a gaming
professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, conceded that
the revolving door ``can be bad if it's abused and people use their
positions to get around doing things, or do things because of
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BLURRED LINES: When Regulators Relax the Rules
</P>
<P>
   Others, including former regulators, say the revolving door has
created an incestuous culture in which the lines separating
gambling and the people responsible for overseeing it are often
blurred, or even nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Waters, a former casino control commission member in New
Jersey, said he found that his colleagues were sometimes swayed by
their personal job interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these folks, as their terms come to an end, start
finding ways to agree with the industry,'' he said. ``They start
trying to pave a way to endear themselves with the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who retired in 1991 after five years on the commission,
said he never sought a casino job. But he added, ``If I had wanted
to, all I had to do was cozy up to them.''

`HISTORY X' POTENT   YET DISTURBING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Maddening.
</P>
<P>
   That's what ``American History X'' strives to be, and that's
what it is. But not entirely in the way that was intended.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably powerful and upsetting, with insightful glimpses of a
troubled family that make for blessedly tender relief from the
mortal storm swirling around them, the movie nonetheless fails to
convincingly dramatize key character points. More troubling, while
the film is clearly out to criticize racism, it comes uncomfortably
close to glamorizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Those glaring flaws acknowledged, the last thing you can call
``X'' is unmoving. It provokes, angers and outrages by form,
content and even by its behind-the-scenes Hollywood controversy
(director Tony Kaye wanted his credit removed from a film that, by
any standard, is an impressive first feature effort).
</P>
<P>
   Written by David McKenna, a 28-year-old white guy from Orange
County, the movie focuses on two young, neo-Nazi brothers from the
Venice section of L.A. The eldest, Derek Vinyard, is played mostly
bare-chested by a beefed-up Edward Norton, with shaved head and a
giant swastika tattooed over his heart. The younger, high school
underclassman Danny (Edward Furlong), worships the passionate,
articulate Derek, just like the other members of the local white
supremacist gang do.
</P>
<P>
   But Derek has been in prison for killing two African-American
men who tried to steal his car. That's made him even more of a
local legend than his virulent rhetoric did. But the Derek that's
paroled is a changed, loving man, concerned with helping his
sickly, widowed mother (Beverly D'Angelo) raise her younger
children and diverting Danny from the self-destructive path of
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Derek's unforgiving ex-comrades view his new pacifism
as betrayal. And the friends of the men he killed are still around,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Employing lots of hand-held camerawork and improvisational
staging, Kaye draws us into a world of constant tension and
immediate, ugly emotion. About half of the story is told in
fragmented flashbacks, and these scenes are shot in a gritty black
and white that emphasizes the stark nature of the principals'
us-vs.-them mentality.
</P>
<P>
   There are horrendous suites of violence _ the initial murders, a
raid on an Asian-owned, Latino-staffed grocery, a prison rape _
most of which are preceded by one of Derek's disgusting yet
mesmerizing hate speeches. Norton's performance of these difficult
bits is chillingly impeccable, but that also contributes greatly to
the sense that someone is getting off a bit too much on what the
film is supposed to be criticizing. After a couple of these things,
we get the point, but the film keeps returning us to that poison
well. By comparison, Derek's change of heart comes off preachy and
pat.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely interaction within the crowded, modern-day Vinyard
home is what really humanizes these apparently hateful individuals.
But even that leaves you asking why only two of the film's
African-American characters are permitted anything resembling
positive traits (and one of them is an incarcerated felon), and why
there is nothing about the home life of any person of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' is a shattering experience and, in many
ways, a brave film. It confronts the ugliness of racism in a crude,
visceral manner that is far more affecting than the traditional,
polite liberal approach that Hollywood condescendingly employs most
of the time (``Ghosts of Mississippi'' and ``A Time to Kill'' being
recent examples).
</P>
<P>
   But it still sees the issue as a tragedy for white people first,
all of us second.

 UNDATED: to them.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, gambling's courtship of regulators began in
Las Vegas, where former officials have long cashed in on ties to
gambling. Today, in many of the 26 casino gambling jurisdictions
around the country, some of the most powerful gaming lawyers and
executives are people who started as regulators in Nevada, where
cooling-off laws did not exist until 1987 and are still less
restrictive than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Schreck, for example, left the Nevada Gaming Commission in
1975 and immediately began building his law practice by providing
counsel to gaming clients. ``At that time, the only real way to
learn gaming law was to learn it on the governmental side,''
Schreck said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is one of the most prominent and influential gaming
lawyers in the country, known especially for his high rate of
success when representing clients appearing before Nevada's gaming
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the casino industry's consumption of government
officials is attributed to its rapid growth and resulting job
opportunities. Since 1990, casino revenue has more than doubled, to
$20.5 billion annually, and the industry now accounts for an
estimated $7.3 billion in wages, according to the American Gaming
Association, the industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And as the casino industry has grown, so has the need for
consultants, lobbyists and executives with regulatory experience
who can obtain and maintain the government licenses that allow
casinos to operate and proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   THE LUSH LIFE: From Prosecutor To Casino Boss
</P>
<P>
   Of all the many former government and law-enforcement officials
who have chosen to stake their futures on the casino industry,
probably none has evolved so completely as that of James Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Ritchie was a federal prosecutor earning
less than $35,000 a year. He worked on the West Coast and,
according to former colleagues, his investigations included the
gambling business in Nevada, where organized crime was still deeply
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1973, Ritchie left the Justice Department to become
executive director of the Congressional Commission on the Review of
the National Policy Toward Gambling, which was organized to help
establish guidelines on legalized gambling. But when the commission
issued its report in 1976, Ritchie's former colleagues at the
department lashed out at him for being too partial to the casino
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several strong differences of opinion,'' recalled
William Lynch, who, as head of the organized crime and racketeering
section, had been Ritchie's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission was very influenced by, or in agreement with,
the gambling industry,'' Lynch added. ``Basically, the whole thrust
of the commission as it developed became pretty clear. They were in
the `let's repeal all laws against gambling' attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade or more, as state laws were changed and
casinos began to open around the country, Ritchie worked as the
industry's top lobbyist in Washington. In those years, said
associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Ritchie owned
his own boat and had a lavishly appointed Capitol Hill office
decorated with expensive artifacts that underscored the lush life
the gambling business had afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on his cellular phone recently, Ritchie, 62, refused to
discuss why he switched jobs or how his life has changed since he
traded in his federal credentials for a career in the casino
industry.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying for the industry, Ritchie moved to Las Vegas,
where in 1990 he became executive vice president of development at
Mirage Casinos, helping to analyze new casino development
opportunities. After four years in that job he left the company,
taking more than $6 million in stock options on his way out,
according to Mirage records.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ritchie's evolution was nearly complete. At that
time he went before Nevada regulators seeking a license to own 12.3
percent of the CasaBlanca Resort, a privately held casino and
700-room hotel with a luxury spa and championship golf course, 80
miles north of Las Vegas in Mesquite, Nev. The former prosecutor of
organized crime, which once controlled the casino business, was
about to become a casino operator himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clean background Ritchie had when he joined the
casino industry, his years in gambling have led to relationships
and business associations that have brought him scrutiny. At the
hearings in August, Nevada regulators questioned Ritchie about some
of his past business relationships, specifically about what one
gaming commission member called ``questionable associations'' with
two men.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, whom Ritchie had lent $400,000 in 1994 for a
casino investment, was said by regulators to have a history of
problems and allegations of impropriety in the gambling industry.
Ritchie, according to his testimony, said he was unaware of the
full nature of the man's past problems when he gave him the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who had been a partner of Ritchie's earlier this
year in a plan to buy the Desert Inn casino in Las Vegas was
described by regulators as a ``flim-flam man'' and ``the world's
biggest flake.'' Ritchie testified that he now recognized that he
was ``used'' by the partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer in government,'' told the regulators. ``I no
longer have access to law-enforcement records. I'm sitting in my
kitchen with a fax machine and a telephone and enough of a bankroll
to try to become involved in some of these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their misgivings, both the state gaming board and the
state gaming commission voted unanimously to give Ritchie a
two-year license as co-owner of the CasaBlanca casino and hotel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Cooper looks more like a young club hipster than an
elegantly refined ballet prince, despite his shining pedigree as a
principal dancer who played such regal roles at England's Royal
Ballet. He is dancing a lead in ``Swan Lake'' these days once more,
but not as the ballet's lovesick prince.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cooper plays a powerful male swan and his counterpart,
a sneering piece of rough trade, in Matthew Bourne's exuberantly
irreverent adaptation of ``Swan Lake,'' now playing on Broadway at
the Neil Simon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are Bourne's re-envisioning of Odette, the white
swan, and Odile, her evil look-alike. Although they are not played
here by a ballerina, they have the same dire effect on the prince
on whom they lavish their attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper did not hesitate to accept Bourne's invitation to play
the parts in the first production, in 1996 (he alternates in them
with Will Kemp in the Broadway staging). ``I just thought: `How
exciting. It's about time a man played the swan,' '' Cooper
recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's amazement, the show was so popular it was moved to
London's West End, the equivalent of Broadway, then toured to Los
Angeles before opening last month in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up with the character of the swan was hard because you
had so many restrictions, like no facial expressions,'' Cooper said
of his work with Bourne. ``Basically you had to do it with your
eyes. The feeling had to come from within. And you can't use your
arms normally. When we were trying to get the duets together, I
couldn't just lift. It had to be with my wing. That was kind of
hard. But basically I think we were thinking of trying to represent
a sense of freedom as a swan. A sense of knowing, a sense of beauty
and of grace, but also a sense of caution toward the prince
initially.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's portrayal of the evil swan, whom he calls ``the
stranger,'' is modeled somewhat on Brad Pitt. ``Somebody who could
walk into a room and everybody wants him, men and women,'' he said.
``The stranger is not afraid to do anything to get what he wants.
And to use anybody to get what he wants. And he has no conscience
about it.'' He laughed. ``Which is (italics)fabulous(end italics)
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to express yourself in today's way in ballet when
you're stuck in a pair of white tights and a tunic holding up a
ballerina for two hours. Men have always been the background to the
ballerina in ballet. He may get the odd solo now and then, but
that's the man's job, basically. There still aren't that many
ballets around where the man is the main (italics)guy,(end italics)
and that's hard for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had to quit the Royal Ballet for Bourne's ``Swan Lake.''
He describes himself as an accidental star in the ballet company, a
dancer who got the big roles and the promotions because he was tall
and could learn fast enough to replace injured dancers at the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in the middle of the ballet, he went on in the lead male
role in Kenneth MacMillan's ``Mayerling,'' guided a little by the
onstage murmurings of ``stand here, stand there'' from Fiona
Chadwick, another Royal principal and one of the dancers playing
the queen mother in Bourne's ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   The English royal family has not been to see the production as
far as Cooper knows. Princess Margaret, an official patron of the
Royal Ballet whom Cooper is clearly fond of, has questioned him
about the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cornered me for half an hour at a leaving party for one of
the Royal Ballet dancers,'' he said. ``She wanted to know all about
it.'' Bourne's queen mother is said to have been modeled on both
Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. ``I think they might be
afraid because there is that royal aspect to it,'' Cooper said with
a sly grin. ``It's not very flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   A Londoner who followed his slightly older brother into ballet
and studied dance for many years, Cooper does miss the Royal at
times. But he does not regret his decision to leave. ``I was doing
well and working hard and enjoying what I was doing, but there was
always something in the back of my mind saying there was more. So I
jumped at this, partly because the chance of having a role that big
created on you is so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel I haven't achieved everything I wanted to in
classical ballet. But the freedom of being able to chose what I
want to do is fantastic. Dancing in a big ballet company becomes a
bit of a chore after a while. You're always fighting for roles,
fighting the management. With something like this, the movement was
created on me, so it's really mine. And however much I do it, I
still love it.''

`AMERICAN HISTORY X' TURNS DIRECTOR AGAINST FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ ``American History X's'' star, producers and studio
all hope that the controversial new movie's message condemning
racial hatred is heard above the elaborately staged complaints of
its disgruntled director, Tony Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at `American History X' as what some may refer to
as a message movie, I'm very, very proud that this messenger is
ugly and right in your face,'' says Steve Tisch, one of the film's
executive producers. ``But it's also a message that has to be told,
and the story has to be told in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened at the prospect that Tony may not participate in
the discussion that this film is going to provoke,'' adds Edward
Norton, the respected actor who plays a violent, neo-Nazi skinhead
who turns against hate in `X.'' ``I'm as proud of it as anything
that I've been involved in, both the performance and the film. And
it's a remarkable first film.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Goldman, marketing and distribution president for the
film's distributor, New Line Cinema, says ``It's not just a movie
about skinheads. It's about humanity, hatred and love, with an
undeniably powerful performance by Edward Norton. And I think Tony
Kaye is a genius despite his problems with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems have included a general characterization of
first-time feature filmmaker Kaye, a 46-year-old English
commercials director and provocation-prone performance artist, as a
Hollywood outsider with delusions that he's a latter-day Orson
Welles. He's been attacking New Line, Norton and others involved
with the film since late spring, claiming that they edited the
release cut of the picture against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   And his tactics have been bizarre, even by industry ``creative
differences'' standards. Kaye took out cryptic ads in the
show-business trade papers quoting classic poets, scriptures and
John Lennon on subjects such as greed and betrayal. Then there was
the meeting with New Line production president Michael De Luca, to
which Kaye brought along a priest, a rabbi, a Buddhist monk and a
camera to record the absurd encounter.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to have the Directors Guild of America replace his
credit with their official pseudonym Alan Smithee failed because he
publicly badmouthed the film, which is a violation of the union's
agreement with the studios (Kaye has since tried to get ``X's''
direction credited to Humpty Dumpty). He was more successful,
however, at persuading the prestigious Toronto Film Festival not to
screen the picture.
</P>
<P>
   These shenanigans have gotten Kaye dubbed either nuts or
self-destructive by a town notorious for telling troublemakers
they'll never work in it again. However, the reluctant auteur
claims that his concerns are essentially the same as the film's
defenders: to put its tough social message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to make a movie that really, truly investigates
racism and why this kind of hate and misunderstanding exists,''
says Kaye, speaking deliberately in a working-class English accent.
``My hope was that it would provoke some sort of positive dialogue
that might do some good.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we ended up with a movie about a rower from
Yale,'' he adds, referring to his Ivy League-educated star. ``Due
to the narcissism of Norton and his current clout within the
industry, he managed to f--- up my process.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WENT WRONG
</P>
<P>
   Kaye's point of contention is that the current, approximately
two-hour cut of the film lingers much too long on both the
impassioned hate speeches delivered by Norton's rage-filled Derek
Vinyard and on the character's admirable, if preachy, conversion to
a more tolerant attitude. He claims that an 87-minute cut he
delivered was much harder hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot in the movie that he just rambles on about for
far too long,'' Kaye complains of Norton. ``But that's only half
the problem. The other problem, and a lot of people are going to
miss this, is that the way this movie is structured right now; it
lionizes a neo-Nazi and there's not really a black voice in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton, 29, was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar for his
first film, ``Primal Fear,'' and has only made three critically
acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful features _ ``Everyone Says
I Love You,'' ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ``Rounders'' _
since. He denies having either the clout or the desire to recut
``X,'' and Kaye is now backing off earlier claims that Norton
actually re-edited the film himself.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the New Line general line is that the release
version is essentially a Kaye cut with minor changes, producer John
Morrissey reveals that the longer Kaye spent in the editing room,
the more alarming the result grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was thrilled with Tony's initial versions of the
film,'' Morrissey says. ``But his subsequent versions got
progressively more spare and more sparse and more bare-boned, and
less emotional and even less emotional. All he was interested in
was how the shots looked. When it became obvious that it needed
some more emotional support, he acknowledged this and he invited
Edward into the editing room. And then things started to go the way
they went.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Line faction points to an eight-week extension (that
expanded into 10 weeks) requested by Kaye that did not yield a
discernibly different movie.
</P>
<P>
   The director, who consulted with the Nobel Prize-winning
Caribbean poet Derek Walcott on how to fix the picture, admits that
he's a slow editor. But he blames the usual suspects for his lack
of 11th-hour progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screwed with me for a year, making me attend to their
whims,'' he says. ``Now, when you put someone in a spin for a year,
when they come out of that, they have to get their feet back again.
I just wasn't finished at the end of those two months.''
</P>
<P>
   `SCARED TO LET IT GO'
</P>
<P>
   Norton has a different, creative psychology take on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, it's his first film and, I think, Tony's just
scared to let it go,'' the actor reckons. ``You just have to at a
certain point; I think Coppola said films never get finished, they
get abandoned, and that's very true. Tony's demonstrated amply that
there is no new, radical vision of the film. I wish he would just
shake hands with everyone who worked very hard with him on it and
say, `Well hell, however it happened, it seems to be provoking very
much the response that we all set out to get.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   That is not going to happen. Kaye hopes to encourage
civil-rights groups to picket theaters showing ``American History
X'' (he denies reports that he offered his tickets to the premiere
to white supremacist Tom Metzger, noting that he has not been
invited to the premiere himself). He also swears he'll never work
with anyone from the ``X'' crowd again except actress Beverly
D'Angelo, who plays Vinyard's troubled, widowed mom.
</P>
<P>
   As for working in the field he's always wanted to break into,
Kaye could be characterized as an optimistic realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've risked never working again,'' he admits. ``But I think if
somebody's got something to offer, there's always going to be
someone there to take them up on that. And I've certainly exposed
what my modus operandum is; if someone does work with me, they know
what they're going to be walking into.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, ironically, in some ways the kind of publicity that
conventional marketing can't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to make it an interesting attack,'' admits Kaye,
whose self-described Hype Art installations have included hiring
homeless people to walk around rich art museums, including L.A.'s
Getty Center, wearing ``By Tony Kaye'' signs. ``I don't really
think I've put anyone off from seeing the film. Quite the opposite;
I think people are intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, there are certain bits in the film that I think
are as good as anything else you'll see,'' he admits. ``It's just
that all of these things are lost in the appalling framework. I'd
just like to apologize to anyone who goes to see it, and tell them
that it'll be much better the next time they see my name on the end
of a film.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FROZE OUT NETSCAPE WITH AOL DEAL, EXECUTIVE SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft won a vital contract with America Online,
the nation's largest Internet provider, after agreeing to embed
AOL's software into its popular Windows 95 operating system,
according to testimony released Tuesday in the federal antitrust
trial against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Microsoft demanded that AOL stop offering the rival
Netscape Navigator browser to its own 13 million customers, the
testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Microsoft agreement, AOL must and does
strictly limit its distribution, promotion and advertising of
Netscape Navigator,'' said a court submission by David Colburn, the
company's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn is to be cross-examined by Microsoft lawyers on his
18-page statement when the trial, now in its second week, resumes
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape president Jim Barksdale, who spent five full days on
the witness stand, said at the landmark trial that ``AOL told me
(the Microsoft deal) was worth a lot of money to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Barksdale, using the code name of ``Josef Stalin,'' had
negotiated in vain with AOL president Stephen Case, who dubbed
himself ``Franklin Roosevelt,'' to strike his own Internet browser
deal with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   In their talks, Microsoft was dubbed the ``Axis,'' and the
aborted Netscape-AOL union was ``the Allies'' _ on the theory that
``the enemy of my enemy is my friend, Barksdale told the court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Microsoft had become a direct rival of AOL by launching
its own online service, known as the Microsoft Network, or MSN,
when it released Windows 95. In response to market pressures, both
services have since gravitated to the Internet as a platform for
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Since nearly all personal computers run on Windows, ``Microsoft
was thus to achieve virtually costless distribution of MSN to
almost every new computer user,'' according to Colburn's direct
testimony, which will be made part of the trial record and be
weighed as evidence by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Colburn reported, AOL complained to the Department of
Justice ``about what it felt was Microsoft's ability to use its
marketing position in operating systems to gain an unfair advantage
in the online services business.''
</P>
<P>
   But then AOL decided to switch, rather than fight, and joined
forces with the Microsoft camp in the browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Under their 1996 bargain, AOL can choose at the end of this year
to end its exclusivity deal with Microsoft. But in his prepared
testimony, Colburn suggested that the deal would remain in force
well into the next century, even though ``at this point Navigator
and (Microsoft's) Internet Explorer continue to be reasonably
comparable browser solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn noted that the ongoing struggle has left Netscape ``in a
weakened state.'' He also said AOL sought to avoid any
``interoperability problems between (Windows) and AOL, (or) any
perception in the marketplace that this could occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn's availability as a witness prompted the government to
postpone, probably until next week, its earlier plans to show about
seven hours of videotaped testimony from Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing a virtual Gates to the stand as a hostile witness,
the government hopes to buttress its case that the company he
co-founded had offered to divide the market for Internet software
with a Netscape after having become the largest software firm in
the world.

with a Netscape after having become the largest software firm in
the world.

SINGER MONICA MANCINI SHOWS SHE CAN CUT IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Accompanied by a single acoustic guitar, Monica
Mancini movingly sings the words, ``Dear heart, wish you were here
...''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier overly orchestrated versions of ``Dear Heart'' can only
be described as schmaltz. But on her new CD, Mancini _ with her
strong vocal and simple approach _ rescues the song, giving it
poignancy. It was, after all, written by her father, composer Henry
Mancini, who died in 1994 at the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one song that I found very difficult to sing after Dad
died. It took me about three years to be able to sing it,'' she
says. ``I wanted `Dear Heart' to be very intimate and very about me
talking to Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Monica Mancini will perform some of her father's most
famous songs, accompanied by a 40-piece orchestra at UCLA's Royce
Hall. The invitation-only performance will be taped as a PBS
special that will air nationally in December. The broadcast will
also include interviews with Quincy Jones, Paul Newman, Julie
Andrews and Johnny Mathis talking about the late composer who was
known for his film and TV scores, including ``The Pink Panther,''
``Hatari!'' and ``Peter Gunn'' along with the love themes that came
from those scores _ ``Moon River,'' ``Charade'' and ``The Days of
Wine and Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Mancini is the first artist signed to PBS Records, a
joint venture with Warner Bros. Records, and it's the first solo
venture for the 40-something Mancini. It may seem kind of late to
be starting a solo career, but Mancini has been ``very happy being
a studio singer,'' emulating her mom, Ginny, who had a 30-year
career as a studio singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my mom go to work and thought I'd love to do that if
I were able,'' says Mancini, who was calling from Hartford, Conn.,
where she was performing her tribute show to her father that night.
</P>
<P>
   So while admitting that the idea of a solo career has crossed
her mind, she has made her living singing on lots of film scores
(``Armageddon,'' ``Batman''), lots of commercials, lots of other
people's records (Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton) and
variety shows, including the Emmys and Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may think I get jobs because I'm Mancini's
daughter,'' she says, ``but you don't get asked back if you can't
cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one listen to her new CD, which will be in stores Nov. 17,
and you know she can cut it. ``Her voice spreads into a rapid
vibrato that suggest the glamorous vocal equivalent of diamonds
flashing,'' a New York Times critic wrote last July about one of
her concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God that Dad didn't sing and people can't draw
comparisons there,'' Mancini says. ``We complement each other
perfectly because he writes the songs and I sing the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mancini says she only embarked on a solo career when
composer/conductor Bill Conti (``Rocky''), who was filling in on
concert dates for her father when he became ill, asked her to sing.
``I wouldn't be doing this if Dad was still alive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a five-record deal with PBS Records and is in
discussions about her next album, though she doesn't think another
CD of her father's works is likely.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``I'm really proud of the fact I'm doing my
dad's music,'' says Mancini, who used the memory of her father as
inspiration while making the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to find ways to make these songs my own. Especially with
something like `Moon River,' which is something I knew I had to
include on the CD but wasn't anxious to tackle. You think of Andy
Williams when you think of `Moon River.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of my dad throughout the making of the CD.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perched on a director's chair at Eighth Avenue and
44th Street one recent midnight, Martin Scorsese is somewhere he
never expected to be: directing a movie again on his native city's
mean streets. Nor did he ever expect to be working again from a
script by Paul Schrader, with whom he collaborated on cinematic
landmarks like ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull,'' and with whom
he believed he would never work again.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on Scorsese's far-flung professional itinerary _
after his most recent stops in the Dalai Lama's Tibet in ``Kundun''
(1997), 1970s Las Vegas in ``Casino'' (1995) and Edith Wharton's
``Age of Innocence'' (1993) _ was to have been the glitzy world of
Hollywood across a span of four decades for ``Dino,'' based on the
life of Dean Martin, with a screenplay by Nick Pileggi.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, illuminated by flashing red ambulance lights, his ears
ringing with the sounds of screeching sirens and raging traffic,
Scorsese's eyes are glued to the patch of Eighth Avenue black-top
at his feet. There, Nicolas Cage, playing an ambulance paramedic,
crouches to minister to a suicidal street person, played by Marc
Anthony, as Anthony, caked in blood (really sugar mixed with red
food coloring), writhes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   How Scorsese came to be here, shooting ``Bringing Out the
Dead,'' which Schrader adapted from a recently published first
novel by Joe Connelly, is in part a typical movie-business tale of
switching gears because of logistical delays. (``Dino'' is now to
begin shooting next fall.)
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the unusual story of how the work of Connelly, a
former paramedic, found its way speedily and almost seamlessly to
this point. Filming began Sept. 15 and is expected to be completed
by Christmas for release in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Bringing Out the Dead' had this little voice that said, `Pay
attention to me now,''' recalled Eric Steel, a scout in the
producer Scott Rudin's office who had learned of the book from
Connelly's agent. Steel recommended that Rudin option the novel
while it was still in manuscript. ``It became this chain that had
no glitches in it,'' he said. ``There was this sense that it went
from Joe's hands to the publisher's hands to my hands and Scott's
hands to Marty's hands to Paul's hands. That's an incredibly
unusual scenario in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   With elements of ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Mean Streets'' and even
``After Hours,'' ``Bringing out the Dead'' is the gritty, darkly
humorous story of Frank Pierce, a troubled ambulance paramedic in
New York City's Hell's Kitchen whose psychological condition could
only be called critical.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, Connelly, 34, too, spent his nights as a
paramedic on these same streets of Hell's Kitchen (lately referred
to as Clinton). Born in Queens, the son of a nurse and a bus
driver, he dropped out of Colgate University, where he had a full
scholarship, when he found himself ``majoring in drunkenness and
confusion.'' He traveled, supporting himself at odd jobs, including
a six-month stint in 1985 as a bartender in Dublin. Pouring through
Hemingway's Nick Adams stories and Maugham's ``Razor's Edge'' in
his off-hours got him interested in becoming, like the fictional
characters in those books, an ambulance driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no focus on the future,'' he said in his trailer on the
set, where he reports each night as a technical adviser for the
movie. ``Driving an ambulance seemed completely black and white.
You just go in there and you help people and save lives, and I
figured I would do that until I figured out my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning home from abroad in 1986, he took the necessary
training and by 1988 he found himself working the night shift out
of St. Claire's Hospital, where his mother had worked as a nurse,
where his parents had first met, and where he had been born.
</P>
<P>
   He was also toying with the idea of writing about his nocturnal
experiences, and while studying at Columbia University's School of
General Studies enrolled in a writing class taught by Colin
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe showed up looking like he had arrived from somewhere
between hell and breakfast,'' recalled Harrison. ``He said, `I
drive an ambulance.' Some lucky sixth sense told me he should be in
the class, even though he didn't have the writing sample I require.
But when he put up his first piece of work, I remember knowing
instantly that this was very good work. His material had tremendous
drive, there was an exuberance in the language. I took him aside
and said: `Listen, you're a writer, and I think you need an
agent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, Connelly worked on the novel while
continuing to work nights ``crunching the chests of dead strangers
while putting stories together from the pieces they left behind,''
as he wrote. During this time, Harrison found Connelly an agent,
and by November of 1996, Knopf had agreed to publish the book. By
February, 1997, Rudin had optioned the movie rights, for $100,000
with only Scorsese in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Eric when he brought it in, `If we don't get Marty to
do this, this won't be a movie,''' said Rudin, one of the film's
producers. ``Marty was the obvious and only choice for this book.
These are the themes he's explored his entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Scorsese thought of ``Bringing Out the Dead'' as a
project for the unspecified future. ``Marty has all these projects
that he's been developing for years and years, and often we go
through these long, painful development processes,'' said Barbara
De Fina, who is producing her ninth Scorsese film. But as ``Dino''
hit snags, she said, ``Bringing Out the Dead'' seemed a good
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a production that would be relatively easy to mount.''
she said. ``We were ready to go back to work and we realized we
could just jump in and do it. I mean, we all know these streets and
these corners.'' Not only was the script ready, but Cage, the actor
Scorsese envisioned as Frank Pierce, was available. (The cast also
includes John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore, as Frank's
alternating ambulance partners and Cage's wife, Patricia Arquette,
as the daughter of a dying man whose life Frank has tried to save).

103.1 KEEPS THE MUSIC COMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The phone calls and e-mail messages are coming in
from far and wide congratulating Channel 103.1 on its new
music-intensive format.
</P>
<P>
   The adult alternative station, which adopted its new format Oct.
19, carries on where now-defunct KSCA-FM left off.
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills resident Jay Marsh, who recalls literally crying
Feb. 4, 1997, during KSCA's final hour, reported he was ``thrilled
at the long overdue return of a true AAA (adult album alternative)
format to Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Folga of Costa Mesa said Channel 103.1 has cured her
road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe how much happier I am,'' she e-mailed Channel
103.1's Web site (www.channel1031.com). ``(I've) been in a funk
since KSCA (went) off the air. Just keep the good music coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Jane Piedad of Torrance: ``Because of you guys, my horrible
daily commute is now a little less cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood resident Shaun Mason, 37, speaks for many when he says
Channel 103.1 has ``filled a void. I'll stay loyal, (but) I ask
just one thing in return _ please don't break my heart in two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem for Valley listeners of the Santa Monica
station is the car reception, which sometimes comes and goes in a
cloud of static. Channel 103.1 is, however, available over the
Internet at its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Laughlin, president and general manager of the station, said
there is a plan to improve the signal, which is strong on the
Westside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This signal serves the area where the majority of listeners
live,'' he said. ``We know there's a market for adult alternative
in the Valley. But this is the best shot for having the format on
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   LEYKIS MOVING UP
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leykis called to straighten out an incorrect ratings
tabulation in Sunday's afternoon-drive package.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that among adult listeners, 25 to 54, Leykis on
KLSX-FM (97.1) and Larry Elder of KABC-AM (790) tied for No. 1 in
the talk format with a 2.8 percent share, while John &AMP; Ken of
KFI-AM (640) placed third in that key demographic with a 2.3 share.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in a full ratings book that Leykis has
beaten John &AMP; Ken, and the syndicated KLSX host couldn't help
gloating: ``A year ago, they had shares in the fours.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BELL'S BACK
</P>
<P>
   Overnight host Art Bell, who resigned from his syndicated
``Coast to Coast'' program Oct. 13 under mysterious circumstances,
returns to the airwaves at 10 tonight on KABC. Bell said Friday
that ``the situation (involving his family) has improved.'' ...
``Ferrall on the Bench,'' the often outrageous sports-talk show
hosted by Scott Ferrall, is back on the air locally at 7 p.m. on
KXTA-AM (1150).

 NEW YORK: to save.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it was more than just logistical synergy. ``I really
responded to the material,'' said Scorsese. ``Basically, Frank's
emotional conflict and his search fascinated me. He needs some
meaning in his life, and really a sense of contentment of some
kind, not happiness, but a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   To Schrader's way of thinking, ``It was in Marty's interests to
circle around this territory again anyway, to do a smaller, more
interior-driven New York story rather than another big canvas film.
I thought he needed to go back to the well and drink the fresh
water of his youth.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Scorsese and Schrader teamed up for the first time on
``Taxi Driver.'' Twice more they came together, for ``Raging Bull''
(1980) and ``The Last Temptation of Christ ''(1988).
</P>
<P>
   But after those three movies, while in discussions for a fourth,
they decided to part company professionally. ``I think it became
clear to us that it was time to back off a bit,'' said Schrader,
adding: ``Our two egos had gotten too big for the size of the room.
As I said at the time: `We've made three great films together.
Let's be happy with that.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was to Schrader's great surprise, then, when Scorsese called
with this screenplay assignment: ``I never expected to work with
him again. But as soon as I read it, I understood why he thought I
was the guy to do it. It's material I'm very comfortable with.'' He
added: ``I know exactly how Scorsese thinks when it comes to this
kind of subject matter. We're kind of two souls in a creative lock
step. We know how to do this particular kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese and Schrader both anticipate the ``Taxi Driver''
comparison, but say they see this ambulance driver story as a
bookend to, rather than a photocopy of, the earlier film.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 20 years of our lives gone by, we're not putting our feet
down in that same river,'' Schrader said. ``It has to come to a
different conclusion. Yes, it's still a man driving around New York
at night at the cusp of urban decay, but he's not alone anymore, he
has partners. And he's not brimming with energy, he's brimming with
despair. And he's not malevolent, he's on the side of the angels.
What he wants in life is some peace and meaning out of his chosen
task. The thing he seeks in these dark New York nights is different
from what the taxi driver seeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the elements of luck and coincidence that brought
this project his way, Scorsese said, ``I think this one just seems
to reflect where we are now as people, both Paul and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And where is he? ``Let me put it this way: I'm always
questioning,'' said Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   ``You save a man on one corner and on the next corner a man
dies,'' he said in his customary rapid-fire speech, punctuated only
with a nervous laugh. ``It begs the question, the constant
question, of what our existence is, the `Who-are-we?
Why-are-we-here?' kind of thing. Paramedics are faced with this
every second of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't these hard questions somewhat softened for him
personally by his success as a filmmaker? (Gone are the days of
``Mean Streets,'' when Scorsese had to wear white editor's gloves,
he said, to stop from ``chewing my fingers to the bone.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it changes somewhat,'' he said. ``But how it really
changes, I don't know. Otherwise I wouldn't have to make this
movie. I'd go home. I wouldn't be in the pouring rain shooting an
ambulance driving up and down the streets until dawn.''

 &HT;    Money brings loopiness to core of politics
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a token of the headline writer's art that so much
of this year's confusing, muddled election picture can be summed up
in a single multi-purpose, one-column line: ``Low Tax Sought.''
</P>
<P>
   In the narrowest sense, this could have been a headline over a
story last week about Byron (Low Tax) Looper, former Georgia House
clerk turned Tennessee political candidate and fugitive from
justice who was arrested Friday for the murder of state Sen. Tommy
Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the focus, the saga of Low Tax, tragic though it is,
can be seen as a metaphor for elections all over the country in
which the bizarre has eclipsed the relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Every campaign autumn gives reporters a few tall tales to tell.
But the loopiness that used to make for entertaining distractions
at the margins of American politics has moved to the center and
become the stuff of the most vital races.
</P>
<P>
   This year candidates for major office have called each other
names like ``fat monkey'' and ``boob.'' The Michigan governor's
race, where Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, is the
Democratic candidate, sounds more like a name-calling contest. In
the Minnesota governor's race, a professional wrestler, Jesse ``The
Bod'' Ventura, has upstaged his Democratic and Republican opponents
and is polling better than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, the Republicans have attempted not only to get their
nominee disqualified but to delay the election, while in Wisconsin,
Sen. Russ Feingold has demanded the Democratic Party not buy ads
for his race. A pretty strange year all round.
</P>
<P>
   The zany, trivialized quality of so many races around the
country doesn't represent a flaw in our culture or any such pap.
The voters have better sense than this year's candidates would
indicate, which is really not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the march of the wacky from the outskirts to the center
of politics is another unhealthy consequence of Congress's failure
to deal with the problem of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   As politics gets more expensive and meaner, fewer serious,
well-established citizens are running for office, leaving the field
to contenders like John J. Hooker, who was considered eccentric
when he first ran for governor of Tennessee in 1970, and no less so
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even where there are competitive races, the relentless drive to
raise money and spend it in 30-second bites dumbs down the process.
Certainly that's been the case in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In some races the voters seem to be turning to unconventional
candidates, such as Ventura in Minnesota, as their only means of
expressing their disgust with the present system. In Vermont,
Republican voters chose Fred Tuttle, a retired dairy farmer who
spent $200 and wears overhauls to debates, over a millionaire
candidate to face Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. Tuttle says his
wife plans to vote for Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   In its final layer of meaning, ``Low Tax Sought'' is a headline
likely to describe the posture of voters for a long time after this
election is over. The federal tax cut which didn't materialized
this year has become a promise to be fulfilled after the election,
when all the tax cuts being promised in state races also are
supposed to roll in.
</P>
<P>
   When elections aren't serious, however, promises seldom are.

 &HT;    Cadbury Schweppes vows to offer alternatives to Pepsi, Coke
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The world's No. 1 noncola soft drink company is vowing
to do what it takes to ensure consumers have more soda options than
just Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico products.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've experienced the soft drink industry's version of what we
call 'ethnic cleansing' over the last few years,'' John F. Brock,
managing director and chief executive of global beverages for
Cadbury Schweppes PLC. He spoke here Tuesday during InterBev, the
industry's largest trade show.
</P>
<P>
   While there has certainly been a proliferation of new flavors
and offerings in recent years, getting those products to market has
been a challenge for companies not among soft drinks' elite. That's
because most don't have the bottling pipeline of No. 1 Coca-Cola
and No. 2 Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Cadbury Schweppes, No. 3 in global soft drink sales,
faces an uphill battle for market share. The London-based company,
with U.S. operations based in Dallas under the Dr Pepper/Seven Up
Inc. banner, relies largely on Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers to
bottle its brands, which include Dr Pepper, 7 UP, A&AMP;W Root Beer,
Crush, Canada Dry, Country Time and Sunkist.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent of U.S. volume for Dr Pepper and 7 UP flows
through the Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottling system; the rest is
handled by independent ''third-tier'' bottlers or American Bottling
Co., in which Cadbury Schweppes bought a 40 percent stake earlier
this year to become more self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, which has become reality in some markets, is that
bottlers affiliated with Coke and Pepsi will drop Cadbury
Schweppes' beverages to concentrate on their own brands.
</P>
<P>
   While Cadbury Schweppes' non-cola business is substantially
larger than that of either Coca-Cola or Pepsi, maintaining that
position could be difficult in the face of what Brock called
''prediatory'' competition by the company's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel it's important to do our part to stop this 'volume at
any price' strategy,'' said Brock, referring to such battle grounds
as the fountain soft drink arena.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico has filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Coca-Cola
to stop the company from barring independent food service
distributors from delivering Pepsi products if they also carry
Coca-Cola brands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, any exclusivity deals concern us, but we understand
they're part of the industry,'' said Brock, who on Monday was named
chairman of the National Soft Drink Association.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cadbury Schweppes would ''look at any and all
alternatives'' _ short of joining Pepsico's lawsuit or filing its
own _ to address freedom of choice and the inflationary prices
caused by exclusive deals.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, a Georgia Tech graduate, said the cost of securing
fountain business has grown roughly 20 percent over the last three
years. That growth rate is ''well in excess of volume growth and
pricing inflation'' over that same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fierce competition, Cadbury Schweppes landed 4,000
new fountain accounts in 1997 and another 9,000 so far this year,
Brock said. The contracts have pushed the company's fountain volume
up more than 5 percent, he said, giving Cadbury Schweppes a total
12 percent share of fountain volume to Coca-Cola's 62 percent and
Pepsi's 19 percent. Cadbury Schweppes on Tuesday reported the
company's domestic soft drink sales grew 3 percent in the third
quarter, versus 2 percent in the second quarter and 1 percent in
the first. It was the best quarter for soft drink sales since
Cadbury Schweppes bought Dr Pepper and 7 UP almost four years ago.

 &HT;    Southern Co. to manage Texas electric operation
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., taking a big step into Texas' utility
markets, has agreed to manage Brazos Electric Power Cooperative's
wholesale electric power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Under a five-year agreement announced Tuesday, the Atlanta-based
utility holding company takes charge of all of Waco-based Brazos
Electric's 1,650 megawatts of electric capacity, which comes from
two power plants and agreements with other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Southern then will provide Brazos with enough electricity to
meet its needs and sell surplus electricity in wholesale markets at
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazos Electric, the largest and oldest Texas power cooperative,
provides electricity to 19 customer-owned electric membership
corporations. Those EMCs in turn supply 225,000 residential and
40,000 business customers in a 66-county area that includes the
Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs and Texas A&AMP;M University, and a swatch of
rural territory that extends to the state capital of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Company Energy Marketing, a Southern subsidiary based
at Perimeter Center, also agreed to build a power plant to
accommodate growing demand for electricity in the Dallas-Fort Worth
suburbs. Southern has targeted the Southwest as one of four regions
for expansion of its U.S. wholesale energy businesses. In its first
Texas foray last month, Southern announced plans to build a small
power plant 130 miles northwest of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Southern is now squarely on the home ground of rival Enron Corp.
The Houston-based energy conglomerate eyed Southern's home turf
this year by considering entering Georgia's newly deregulated
natural gas market but then opted out.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Foster, an Enron spokesman, declined to comment on whether
his company was one of 16 confidential bidders on the Brazos deal,
though he said Enron is generally interested in such opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's agreement with Brazos Electric is similar to
arrangements that Atlanta-based Oglethorpe Power Cooperative worked
out with two wholesale power marketing companies in 1996 and 1997
to manage its power supply.
</P>
<P>
   One of those suppliers, Louisville, Ky.-based LG&AMP;E Energy Corp.
shut down its energy trading company in July, citing difficulties
in delivering power to Oglethorpe at their agreed-upon price
following an unprecedented summer run-up in wholesale electricity
prices. Oglethorpe, which supplies 39 Georgia EMCs that in turn
have 1.2 million customers, is still receiving power from the LG&AMP;E
under a 15-year agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Southern spokesman Chuck Griffin said Southern's agreement with
Brazos Electric provides for a combination of prices to be fixed
and indexed to wholesale fluctuations. Unlike the Oglethorpe
agreements, Southern will take a hands-on role in managing the
Brazos power plants and supplying natural gas to run them.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Karnei, Brazos Electric executive vice president, said
the agreement will mean savings and a ``higher level of
predictability and security'' for the cooperative's member
utilities in advance of deregulation of the electric power
industry.

 &HT;    Cadbury Schweppes vows to offer alternatives to Pepsi, Coke
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The world's No. 1 noncola soft drink company is vowing
to do what it takes to ensure consumers have more soda options than
just Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico products.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've experienced the soft drink industry's version of what we
call 'ethnic cleansing' over the last few years,'' John F. Brock,
managing director and chief executive of global beverages for
Cadbury Schweppes PLC. He spoke here Tuesday during InterBev, the
industry's largest trade show.
</P>
<P>
   While there has certainly been a proliferation of new flavors
and offerings in recent years, getting those products to market has
been a challenge for companies not among soft drinks' elite. That's
because most don't have the bottling pipeline of No. 1 Coca-Cola
and No. 2 Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Cadbury Schweppes, No. 3 in global soft drink sales,
faces an uphill battle for market share. The London-based company,
with U.S. operations based in Dallas under the Dr Pepper/Seven Up
Inc. banner, relies largely on Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers to
bottle its brands, which include Dr Pepper, 7 UP, A&AMP;W Root Beer,
Crush, Canada Dry, Country Time and Sunkist.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent of U.S. volume for Dr Pepper and 7 UP flows
through the Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottling system; the rest is
handled by independent ''third-tier'' bottlers or American Bottling
Co., in which Cadbury Schweppes bought a 40 percent stake earlier
this year to become more self-reliant.
</P>

MUSIC AND PERFORMER, AND UNSTABLE COMPOUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The delicate dance between performer and performed has played
out in a number of places this young season. It is a dance in the
form of a competition, for what is it we go to hear? The pianist or
the piano sonata? The singer or the song?
</P>
<P>
   To say that the second cannot exist without the first is only
partly true. The perfect interpretation of Beethoven's
``Waldstein'' Sonata does not reside in a collection of past
impressions but grows inside our heads. It is fertilized by all the
performances we have heard of it but raised to full flower only by
our own imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing the fact that living personalities move
more tickets than dead composers. Vladimir Horowitz easily sold out
programs of trivia. Luciano Pavarotti, Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman
anchor subscription series around the country, charging concert
presenters punishing fees yet guaranteeing them that the big name
will carry lesser names when blocks of concerts must be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the ideal interpreter goes unnoticed, that in
the transcendent concert experience audiences forget not just the
player but also the instrument. Listening to Michael Tilson Thomas
conduct Gershwin at Carnegie Hall a few weeks ago made one
conscious of Thomas at every moment: of his bright personality, the
joy in what he was doing, the deftness of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Christoph von Dohnanyi conduct the ``Eroica''
Symphony in Cleveland soon after left me with only the vaguest
notion of who or what Dohnanyi was. The maker of music became lost
in music. One felt gratitude for wonderful Beethoven, but
admiration? One could find no one to admire.
</P>
<P>
   All is not so simple; the collaboration of player and played is
always present. In popular song, the singer has the advantage.
There is no urtext for a Gershwin number, no first or second
edition. There are a tune, words and chord changes.
</P>
<P>
   What Peggy Lee makes of them says as much about her as about
Gershwin, although if she is true to perhaps unnamable values, it
is Gershwin we finally remember.
</P>
<P>
   What Peggy Lee does in large amounts, concert musicians do in
smaller ones. They seek out the sympathetic vibration between the
music and themselves. Maurizio Pollini plays the ``Waldstein,'' and
we hear the elegance; Alfred Brendel plays it, and we hear the
struggle. The ``Waldstein'' has both. Brendel, on the other hand,
is not terribly elegant and Pollini does not struggle.
</P>
<P>
   When Nigel Kennedy, or Kennedy, as the violinist now chooses to
be called, plays (as he will Sunday evening at Avery Fisher Hall),
the intervention of performer between listener and music is clearly
intentional. So eagerly flamboyant is Kennedy, the stage presence,
and so subversive his appearance against the usual iconography of
the concert stage that a Kennedy concert is three events: the man
onstage, the interpreter of music, and the music.
</P>
<P>
   Only cynics will suggest that the stage show conveniently takes
our minds off how well Kennedy actually plays. There is in any case
a sensory overload destined to bewilder the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Bryn Terfel in his well-received recital at Carnegie Hall three
weeks ago sounded almost too good for our own good. As he
assiduously produced beautiful sounds, careful diction and
scrupulous applications of musical principles, the experience of
Terfel's doing all these wonderful things sometimes made it hard to
get past his imposing presence and put one's hands on music pure
and simple.
</P>
<P>
   With the Metropolitan Opera's ``Samson et Dalila,'' the
performer's ego was welcome. Olga Borodina's lovely singing
protected us from some of the questionable music around her, and in
the process one almost understood the rabid cults for whose members
the opera itself is fodder and the only domestic animal worth
feeding is the human voice.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pollinis, Brendels, Borodinas and Terfels leave their
mark on the music of others, there is one composer who has turned
the tables on them. Daniel Barenboim played a Liszt program at
Carnegie Hall two weeks ago, and one had the odd sensation of the
musician as object of scrutiny, not the music. Liszt is litmus
paper: a dangerous trap for the mediocre musical mind and an
exalted opportunity for the pure of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim loves Liszt for the right reasons. Large numbers of
listeners reject Liszt as shallow, gaudy and sentimental, because
they have grown up with his music played by shallow, gaudy and
sentimental pianists.
</P>
<P>
   Liszt's mannerisms are seductive to the easy virtuoso. The
supreme pianist wrote piano music that invites the hand to the
keyboard. The fit is graceful, and Liszt's devices make the
virtuoso sound even more virtuosic.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven is awkward while sounding playable. Liszt flatters the
technique while asking hands to do what they want to do but to do
it even better. Liszt on the piano feels good.
</P>
<P>
   Those who love Liszt for the wrong reasons soon find their cover
blown, their second-rateness betrayed. Those who seek empty show in
this music will find it. Those with the wit to discover its noble,
generous and deeply inventive qualities ennoble themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more depressing experiences of my long reviewing life
have been the young debutants, flush with energy and technique,
rattling mindlessly through ``The Fountains at the Villa d'Este,''
dotting every ``i'' and playing every note of every octave passage
and arpeggio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most uplifting experiences of my life has been to
hear Claudio Arrau play the same piece. Liszt is what the performer
makes of him, and few are up to the job.

HURRICANE'S SOUTHERN ROUTE MAKES GLENN'S PROSPECTS FOR ON-TIME
LAUNCH SOAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ When Hurricane Mitch stayed further south
than expected Tuesday, John Glenn's prospects for an on-time launch
aboard the shuttle Discovery soared.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters' concerns that winds triggered by the potent storm
might gust over the safety limit for the shuttle's use of an
emergency runway Thursday disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's good news, good news and good news,'' said Ed
Priselac, NASA's lead weather forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   As Discovery's countdown got under way earlier this week,
Mitch's path into the Caribbean prompted weather experts to peg the
odds of high winds at 40 percent. They fell to zero on Tuesday when
Mitch did not turn north as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's seven-member crew is scheduled to blast off Thursday
at 1 p.m. CST with Glenn seeking an encore to his 1962 mission that
made him the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The flawless forecast, if it holds, is an especially fortunate
turn of events for Glenn and the rest of the Discovery crew.
Earlier in the day, the GOES 8 weather satellite used by NASA to
monitor cloud cover for its shuttle launchings malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   If not recovered by Thursday, the loss would mean the space
agency's forecasters will not have the succession of images of sky
conditions snapped every 15 minutes they have come to rely on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some launch preparations temporarily fell about 90
minutes behind schedule when control teams encountered a pair of
equipment problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved the malfunction of a sensor system that
alerts launch controllers to potentially explosive leaks of the
fuel used to generate electricity aboard the shuttle and power its
three rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs needed to permit loading large amounts of liquid
hydrogen and oxygen propellants into Discovery's large fuel tank
were planned overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The second difficulty involved an oxygen leak in the launch pad
fueling system that forced a brief postponement of some activities
by shuttle technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be back on schedule,'' said Doug Lyons, who was
supervising countdown activities.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Curt Brown and his crew spent the day under
going medical exams, making sure their flight suits fit properly
and then relaxing privately with close family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in excellent shape,'' Jim Wetherbee, NASA's director of
flight crew operations, said of the 77-year-old Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brown, pilot Steve Lindsey, flight engineer Scott
Parazynski, payload commander Steve Robinson, European Space Agency
astronaut Pedro Duque and Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai remained
in medical quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wetherbee, who has logged four missions of his own,
the hours before launch often turn into an opportunity for personal
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to spend time with my wife, and (Glenn) is spending
some time with Mrs. (Annie) Glenn,'' said Wetherbee. ``Of course
these conversations are personal.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, most likely after the couple parts company for
the day, Glenn's thoughts will turn to the risk of his undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astronauts tend to think about risk a little bit differently
than most folks, and I know that John Glenn in particular feels
that if the benefits outweigh the risks, then it's a good thing to
accept,'' Wetherbee said. ``I know he did that on his first flight.
He accepted the risk so others could follow in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the same job now,'' Wetherbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the men who shared the responsibility for launching
Glenn in 1962 reminisced about how great the risk was with the
Atlas rocket, compared to the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how primitive it was back in those days,'' said
Paul Donnelly, 75, who served as NASA's Mercury capsule test
conductor. ``The only thing we had that was automatic in those days
was the coffee pot back in the ready room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm sort of amazed,'' said Walt Kapryan, 78, of
Glenn's new-found celebrity. Kapryan supervised preparation of
Glenn's capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the the public is looking for a hero,'' he said.
``John Glenn fits that.'' &QL;

   On a warm late afternoon in August 1920 a bunch of boys stood
outside Comiskey Park in Chicago, waiting under the stands for
their heroes, the White Sox players, to emerge after a game. One of
those boys would become an important American novelist, James T.
Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Young Jim, then 16, was an avid fan and he, like several of the
others, couldn't believe the headlines that had just broken.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of their idols had been charged with intentionally losing
the previous fall's World Series to the Cincinnati Reds (five games
to three in a best-of-nine series). One of them was the greatest of
contemporary stars, Shoeless Joe Jackson, who still owns the
third-highest career batting average in baseball history, at .356.
Farrell, who died in 1979, once told me what happened on that day
in 1920:
</P>
<P>
   He watched the players come out of the clubhouse. Jackson
appeared ``sportively'' dressed in gray silk shirt, white duck
trousers and white shoes, his face ``masked in passivity.'' Farrell
heard a fan call out, ``Say it ain't true, Joe.'' And again,
hauntingly, ``It ain't true, Joe.'' Then Big Joe Jackson got into
his ``sportive'' roadster and drove through a double file of silent
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell emphasized that he did not hear, ``Say it ain't so,
Joe,'' the rhyming lamentation that has inspired a raft of
articles, books and movies, from ``The Natural'' to ``Eight Men
Out'' to the cloyingly sentimental ``Field of Dreams,'' which
portrayed a gauzy comeback in a latter-day Iowa cornfield by Joe.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fix'' was a seminal event in American history, one that
ended, to many, the Age of Innocence. And the lesson learned then
is one that we are reminded of today, that baseball stars, like
Presidents, may have tragic flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with Joe Jackson and the Black Sox will again be
in evidence at a sports memorabilia auction Tuesday at Christie's
in New York. Items will include Jackson's legal correspondence
regarding his banishment from baseball (estimated price: $20,000 to
$30,000), his signed driver's license (estimate: $15,000 to
$20,000) as well as his business card ($3,000 to $5,000) and
photographs like the one showing Jackson behind the cash register
in the liquor store he owned in middle age in his hometown,
Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   None of those are expected to be the most expensive item in the
auction. That distinction goes to a circa 1910 baseball card of the
Hall of Fame shortstop Honus Wagner of the Pirates ($350,000 to
$400,000). The baseball that Mark McGwire hit for his 50th home run
this season will also be auctioned ($12,000 to $15,000). Other
memorabilia on sale include an official American League baseball
signed by Marilyn Monroe (about $20,000) and one signed by John F.
Kennedy on opening day in 1962 (around $10,000).
</P>
<P>
   Not for sale are any of the baseball shoes that Shoeless Joe
wore. A pair of them, however, are in a case in the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Joe got his nickname after he removed
his tight-fitting shoes in a minor-league game and played in
stocking feet.
</P>
<P>
   It contributed, though, to the image of him as an illiterate _
which he was (though he could apparently sign his name) _ and a
rube, which he may not have been altogether. After all, Jackson had
been around: he was a sharp dresser, demanded and got a drawing
room for road trips, and was 30 years old and a 12-year
major-league veteran at the time of the 1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Field of Dreams,'' the question is posed: ``Shoeless Joe
Jackson batted .375 in the Series, hit the only home run and didn't
make an error. How could he have thrown the Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his death in 1951 at age 63, Joseph Jefferson Jackson _
though he confessed to taking $5,000 from gamblers and was
admittedly disturbed when he didn't get the other $15,000 they had
promised _ proclaimed his innocence. But his testimony to the grand
jury in Cook County, Illinois, on Sept. 28, 1920 was sometimes
conflicting, and the end result was damaging to him. He was banned
from professional baseball for life by baseball's commissioner,
Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the left fielder for the Sox,'' Jackson said when taking
the stand. ``When a Cincinnati player would bat a ball out in my
territory, I'd muff it if I could. But if it would look too much
like crooked work to do that, I'd be slow and would make a throw to
the infield that would be too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work netted the Cincinnati team several runs that they
would never have made if I had been playing on the square.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he was asked what he did after not being paid as expected
after the first game of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``I asked Gandil what is the trouble?'' (The reference
was to Chick Gandil, the White Sox first baseman). ``He says,
`Everything is all right.' He had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Then you went ahead and threw the second game, thinking you
would get it then, is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We went ahead and threw the second game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Farrell said that the Black Sox scandal ``marked the end of
my hero-worshiping baseball players.'' Every generation seems to
gets its dose of stunning imperfections from those we place in
exalted positions. Ours is no different. The auction at Christie's
reflects just such a tragic and poignant example, one that centered
on a baseball diamond as opposed to an oval office.

NETANYAHU DELAYS VOTE ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday postponed
a Cabinet vote on the new Israeli-Palestinian agreement, saying
that the Palestinians had failed to draw up a plan to counter
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, Israelis and Palestinians held funerals for a
Jewish settler and a Palestinian farmer killed Monday in apparent
tit-for-tat attacks. Palestinian police arrested two suspects in
the slaying of the settler. Palestinians clashed with Israeli
forces outside the Palestinian-ruled town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's office issued a statement announcing the
postponement. ``It was determined at the Wye summit that the
Palestinians would _ within one week _ complete their working plan
for fighting terrorism,'' the statement said. ``However, it has
become clear that they are not meeting the agreed-upon schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Cabinet, originally scheduled to convene on
Thursday, will meet to endorse the agreement once Israel receives
the plan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed hope
that the postponement was not a stalling tactic. ``This detailed
plan is an internal Palestinian plan dealing with security,''
spokesman Ahmed Tibi told the Associated Press, ``The Israelis do
not need to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord, negotiated at the Wye River conference center in
Maryland, makes no mention of a Palestinian obligation to furnish
Israel with a working plan to combat terror within one week. It
states that the Palestinians will share the plan with the United
States as soon as the memorandum goes into force, which the accord
specified as 10 days after the signing.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diplomat said such an obligation on the part of the
Palestinians may have been spelled out in a letter to Netanyahu
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but stressed that in
any case the United States expected Israel to begin implementing
the terms of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the Israeli government bound to begin the Wye
memorandum within 10 days after the signing,'' said the diplomat,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli law, Netanyahu is not required to present
the agreement to the Cabinet or to Parliament for ratification.
However, since Israel signed the Camp David Peace Treaty with Egypt
in 1979, it has become customary for the prime minister to bring
international agreements to both bodies for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli observers suggested that Netanyahu, faced with
right-wing opposition to the Wye agreement, was searching for a way
to delay the Cabinet vote. Others said the Israeli leader may be
signaling the opposition Labor Party that he will not put the
agreement into action while facing the threat of new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, which supports the Wye agreement, has agreed to
give Netanyahu a two-week ``safety net'' so that his government
will not fall on issues of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Labor members of the Knesset Law Committee, in
alliance with the pro-settlement National Religious Party, helped
to draft a bill calling for elections as early as mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu wants a safety net not just for the next two weeks,
but he wants the opposition to more or less be forced to back him
as long as he's implementing the peace agreement,'' said Reuven
Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``He
wants to buy another hundred days of grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he returned to Israel on Sunday, Netanyahu has been
inundated with right-wing protests against the Wye deal. On Monday,
hundreds of angry Israelis demonstrated outside the prime
minister's office with placards of Netanyahu and Arafat, drenched
in blood and bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes, reminiscent of the frenzied rhetoric that preceded
the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin three years ago, raised the
specter of right-wing violence even as the Israeli secret service
beefed up security surrounding Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, thousands of mourners gathered in Kiryat Arba, a
settlement in the southern West Bank, to bury Danny Vargas, the
settler shot by Palestinian gunmen on Monday. He was killed as he
drove to the settlement from his security guard job in the
Israeli-controlled part of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police Tuesday arrested two Palestinians suspected
of carrying out the murder. One admitted to killing Itamar Dorom as
he swam in a natural spring near Jerusalem last month, Palestinian
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians gathered in
the village of Fariq near Nablus to bury Mohammad Zamout, 69, a
farmer bludgeoned to death on Monday outside the Jewish settlement
of Itamar. Police received a phone call from someone claiming that
the murder was carried out to avenge Vargas' death.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners called for revenge, and the Israeli army declared
Palestinian towns in the West Bank off-limits to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Zamout's killing sparked clashes Tuesday between stone-throwing
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers outside Nablus and general
strikes in Ramallah, Bethlehem, Nablus and east Jerusalem. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   CANADA-POLITICS (Toronto) _ Profile of Jean Chretien: Whether it
is candor, or insensitivity, Chretien's five years in office have
been marked by a directness uncommon among world leaders. At a time
of obtuse diplomacy and executive legalisms, he can be outspoken
and blunt to a degree that frightens and frustrates his handlers.
By Anthony DePalma.

<P>
   GAMBLING-REGULATORS (Undated) _ As fast as the gambling business
has spread across the country, a fast-spinning revolving door has
also developed, creating a world in which a state senator with no
casino experience has in an instant become president of a major
casino, a law enforcement official from a state attorney general's
office has gone on to become chief executive officer of the
nation's most profitable casino, and where top gaming officials
from one state after another have resigned to pursue lucrative
casino careers. By Brett Pulley. (The story has moved in ``a'' news

<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE-NOSTALGIA (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ There must be
something here that invigorates the likes of John Glenn and T.J.
O'Malley. Thomas J. O'Malley, known to missile colleagues as T. J.,
was the man who on the morning of Feb. 20, 1962, pressed the black
button to start the Atlas booster's engines and send Glenn on his
way in a Mercury capsule to be the first American to orbit the
planet. He is 83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and
brimming with stories of the old days. Like O'Malley, many of those
who shared the anxiety, thrill and glory of the first Glenn flight
in 1962 are gathering here again to sip at the fountain of their
youth. For this moment at least, their years seem to decline in
number like a launching clock, counting down instead of up. By John

GLENN MISSION HELPS FLORIDA TOWN RECAPTURE YOUTH, HAPPY MEMORIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ Thirty-six years ago the original Mercury
astronauts made this beach town their personal playground, and the
locals hang on to those memories as though they were gold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the current crop of astronauts aren't just as
brave, and probably just as likeable, but they aren't the guys who
put this beach town on the map. So seeing John Glenn launched into
space again is a personal triumph for people up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   For people who knew the first astronauts personally, and for
those who never got any closer than watching them in a parade, this
launch is a way to recapture the town's youth, and their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a population of about 3,000 people, exciting people,''
recalls Cocoa Beach Mayor Joe Morgan. ``The average age was 29. If
we saw anyone with white hair, we knew they didn't live here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cocoa Beach eventually became a haven for retirees, like
many other Florida towns, and the average age of residents is now
50-something.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime residents get wistful when they talk about the old days
when the Mercury 7 astronauts were fixtures in the local bars and
restaurants, and occasionally used the main highway through town as
a drag strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said real estate developer Bernard Simpkins.
``We had a lot of mosquitoes and a two-lane road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all rubbed shoulders together, ate at the same
restaurants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just good, strong-willed individuals and nice
people,'' said Carl Ransom, who managed the Cape Colony Inn and the
old Ramada, hotels (with bars) that the astronauts frequented in
the old days. ``They did enjoy a good meal and a good drink,''
Ransom said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two distinct groups of memories on file here _
memories of the practical jokes and general craziness associated
with some of the Mercury astronauts, and the quieter memories they
have of John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rathmann, the owner of a local Chevrolet dealership in
Melbourne, is the man who provided those now legendary Corvettes
for the early astronauts to drive. But Glenn didn't accept a
Corvette, he said. He doesn't recall Glenn having the passion for
racing that astronauts like Alan Shepard and Gordon Cooper had.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sort of a fuddy duddy guy as far as I was concerned,''
Rathmann said. ``All the other guys were always having a lot of fun
and doing things. John wasn't that kind of guy. He was the studious
type.
</P>
<P>
   But if Glenn's more sober personality made him less accessible
as a local legend, it never interfered with putting him on a
pedestal. And making this second flight at age 77 has only kicked
him up a couple of notches in local esteem.
</P>
<P>
   In Melbourne, retired baker Eli Weissman, 79, keeps a battered
scrapbook in his living room that chronicles the giant cake he made
to celebrate Glenn's return to earth after that historic first
flight. It was a 1,700-pound frosted replica of the Friendship 7
capsule that carried Glenn into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   He also keeps a rusting cake pan with Glenn's signature carved
into it _ evidence of his first meeting the astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's daughter came to the bakery while her father was in
quarantine as backup astronaut for Gus Grissom's launch. She
requested a cake that read, ``From Annie and the kids _ Happy
Birthday!''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was only eight or nine,'' Weissman said, ``She came in
with a reporter from Look Magazine.'' She was disappointed at the
number of people who could be served from a half-sheet cake, he
said, so he offered to make a full sheet cake for free, if her
famous father would return the pan personally.
</P>
<P>
   Weissman said he and his crew were making apple turnovers the
day Glenn returned the pan. He agreed to autograph the pan, and
then pitched in to help make turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd never been in a bakery before,'' Weissman
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Weissman ran a gauntlet of Secret Service agents
accompanying Glenn and President Carter and presented Glenn with
his favorite onion pumpernickel rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Glenn wrote Weissman a letter to thank
him for a delivery of the same onion-pumpernickel rolls arranged by
one of his staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, thank you for the rolls,'' Glenn wrote in a letter
dated Aug. 6. ``I would be grateful if you would keep me in your
thoughts and prayers in the weeks and months ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they could have gotten VIP seats for the launch had
Weissman just used that letter, his wife chided him. Never mind, he
said, he's got a pretty good view from his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa Beach resident Louise Hurd has her own Glenn memento _ a
photo of Glenn perched on the hood of a car outside Riverside
Presbyterian Church, autographing Bibles for the kids in the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come every Sunday, when he was in town,'' Hurd said. The
church was new enough that they didn't have pews yet, just chairs.
``People would turn their chairs around so they could see him when
he came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Sunday I took a picture of John signing the kids' Bibles.
My daughter was in that picture,'' she said. She got Glenn's mother
and father to sign it when they visited, she said, but didn't get a
chance to seek Glenn's autograph until years later when he was
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said she took the picture with her to a party hosted by
Simpkins, and asked Glenn and his wife to sign it. ``Somehow it got
piled up in his office,'' Hurd said. ``Then along came this
envelope from John Glenn, and he and Annie had signed it.'' The
photo arrived back in 1989 _ four years after his unsuccessful run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was lost but I'm glad somebody found it,'' Hurd
said. The photo was signed, ``To Louise, with best regards. I
enjoyed seeing this memory of too many years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of the church has written a letter inviting Glenn
back, she said, but she doesn't know whether to expect to see him.
``We have a much bigger church now with pews and everything.'' &QL;

GREENVILLE, Maine: of evergreens. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a moose does for most of its life is eat _ a lot. A
thousand-pound adult consumes 25 pounds or even 50 pounds of
vegetation a day in the summer and 10 or 12 pounds of evergreen
branches or twigs in the winter. (Moose are partial to Christmas
trees, i.e., balsam fir.) One year, Schwartz said, it took a crew
of 10 people all summer to collect enough vegetation to feed four
moose for two weeks in a research project on moose digestion.
</P>
<P>
   In its constant search for food and security from predators, a
moose is served by only so-so eyesight. But its senses of smell and
hearing are acute. Its long ears move in an almost 360-degree arc,
helping the animal detect sounds far off. Moose ``are capable of
hearing sounds humans would be oblivious to,'' Schwartz said. He
has seen them perk up their ears and turn in a common direction, he
said, while he has heard nothing. ``Five minutes later, a vehicle
comes driving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet moose tend not to flee from much of anything. One reason,
experts say, is that _ at up to six feet at the shoulder and 1,500
pounds _ they are just bigger than most other objects in their
world. They have few natural enemies, and even against predators
like wolves they stand their ground; moving might prompt the
predator to attack, and in any case moose are formidable fighters.
Unfortunately, they also tend to stand their ground against
oncoming cars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, moose are considered the most docile of the deer
family, and the most tolerant of people's presence. But there are
exceptions. Douglas Kane, the state's regional biologist here, says
that mature bull moose hereabouts have become more skittish and
harder to see. ``When they smell a human, they're gone,'' he said.
It may be, he speculates, that bulls are shyer because they are the
primary quarry in Maine's short, one-week moose hunting season in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any given moose can be dangerous, and all should be
approached cautiously and in some cases not at all, experts say.
There are two situations in which moose are especially dangerous:
when a human comes between a cow and its calf, and during the rut,
or mating season, from about mid-September to mid-October. That is
when bulls establish dominance, with intimidating displays and
sometimes clashes of antlers, and cows signal with moans and wails
that they are in the mood, a condition that normally lasts less
than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Anything or anyone invading a moose's turf then risks injury or
even death. More people are killed by moose, in fact, than by
grizzly bears, said Dr. Joel Berger, a biologist at the University
of Nevada at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, moose have become so comfortable with people
that, like deer, they have started raiding gardens and crops in
some localities. ``A few of them in northern Maine are beginning to
understand the concept of broccoli,'' Ms. Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   When a moose calf is a year old, its mother drives it away (to
make way for the next year's calf) and it must find a new territory
of its own. Moose are now so numerous in northern New England that
the youngsters are being forced southward.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a young moose cow apparently got lost while
searching out new territory and wound up in Boston. She led police
and state biologists on a frantic chase, at one point crashing
through the yards of row houses near Boston College. ``You could
hear the chain-link fences going down,'' said Dr. John McDonald, a
wildlife biologist for the state. Eventually the moose was
tranquilized and taken to a zoo, where she died; although moose
have sometimes been used as draft animals, they generally do not do
well in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   With a breeding population estimated at 200, moose are no longer
a novelty in Massachusetts. ``As they become more common,''
McDonald said, ``people report them less frequently. Once you've
seen your third or fourth moose, it's not a big deal any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In northern New England, and especially in Maine, moose-car
accidents have become epidemic. Besides being unintimidated by
vehicles, moose are drawn to roads because they love to lick up the
salt left over from deposits made by snow-clearance crews.
Sometimes they lie down in the roadway to do this, presenting an
unexpected traffic hazard. Another problem is that moose are dark
in color, sometimes almost black, and they are so tall that their
eyes do not shine in car lights. So at night, motorists often do
not see them until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris, the state biologist, said Maine averages more than
600 moose-car accidents a year. About 15 percent of the motorists
involved require medical treatment. And while Ms. Morris could not
cite human death statistics for Maine, she said the state's
mortality rate in moose-car accidents was probably about the same
as the rate measured in Sweden: about 1 in 400 accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The moose dies much more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some wildlife specialists in Maine favor loosening restrictions
on hunting to reduce the numbers of both moose and accidents.
Permits for the one-week October hunt are rationed; this year's cap
was 2,000. But other interests, mainly the tourist industry, want
to keep the number of moose high.
</P>
<P>
   New logging practices that rely less on clear-cutting and more
on selective removal of trees may well shrink the area of prime
moose habitat in future years, and as today's second-growth forests
grow out of the reach of moose their population may decline, Kane
said. ``It may be close to a stable herd now,'' he said, ``stable
or low growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the foreseeable future, the evolving new relationship
between people and moose seems likely to continue.

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ If he could see the place this week, Juan
Ponce de Leon might wish he had taken a closer look when he passed
this way in 1513 in his quest for the Fountain of Youth. There must
be something here invigorating the likes of John Glenn and T.J.
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, as everyone knows by now, is preparing to return to space
on Thursday at an age _ 77 _ when many men are content to read
Modern Maturity magazine after a gentle round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the spring in Glenn's step may be gone and his bones may
be a little creaky, but here he is ready to board the space shuttle
Discovery with other astronauts half his age to show the world, as
he said in a recent interview, that the lives of older people need
not be dictated by the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Malley, known to colleagues as T.J., was the man who on
the morning of Feb. 20, 1962, pressed a black button to start the
Atlas booster's engines and send Glenn on his way in a Mercury
capsule to be the first American to orbit the planet. O'Malley is
83 now, still full of sass and gruff charm, and brimming with
stories of the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were great days, and we survived them,'' O'Malley said
recently at his home in Cocoa Beach, a town near the launching
pads. He was surrounded by space memorabilia, including the black
starter button mounted on wood. He seemed relieved not to be still
under the pressures of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all trying to catch up with the Russians,'' he
continued. ``We had a bunch of guys really gung-ho to get the job
done, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Malley, many of those who shared the anxiety, thrill and
glory of the first Glenn flight in 1962 are gathering here again to
sip at the fountain of their youth. For this moment at least, their
years seem to decline in number like a launching clock, counting
down instead of up.
</P>
<P>
   The three other surviving members of the original astronaut
corps _ Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra and Gordon Cooper _ have
returned as commentators for television networks. Virgil ``Gus''
Grissom died in 1967 when an Apollo spacecraft caught fire during a
launching-pad test. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton died of cancer in 1993,
and Alan Shepard died of leukemia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dee O'Hara, nurse to the first astronauts, is back, remembering
the day. ``It's a nostalgia trip for many of us,'' she said. ``John
Glenn with that wonderful smile; it was a beautiful time in our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, 73, who was the backup pilot for Glenn's flight and
flew the next Mercury orbital mission, joked about a recent
conversation with his old colleague. ``I told John I would be glad
to stand by for him again,'' Carpenter said. ``But this time I'm
going to insist that he break a leg, so I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have a way of doing at reunions, unfulfilled dreams cast
shadows over the nostalgia. Some of the old-timers expressed regret
that public support for human space flight has waned and many
ambitious goals have been abandoned, such as the plans of Mars
missions that are gathering dust on shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cared then,'' Ms. O'Hara said of the early days of
space flight. ``Lots of people don't care anymore, and I think
that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter noted ruefully: ``We could have been further along.
But we will get there sooner or later. Occupation of Mars is still
inevitable, in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the first Glenn flight, the hotels, shopping
centers and high-rise condominiums that line the beaches and rivers
here were years in the future. So was the large community of
retired people.
</P>
<P>
   Jack King, then a public-affairs officer for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and now manager for media
relations for a shuttle contractor here, recalled that there were
only three or four motels, two restaurants, a few cocktail lounges
and a small community of young engineers, mostly in their 20s and
30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, we thought of John Glenn as an old man when we launched
him in '62,'' King said. Glenn was all of 40 at the time, oldest of
the original seven astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   King's most vivid memories are of the ``press invasion,'' as he
called it, with hundreds of journalists from all over the world
arriving in December for the Glenn flight and many of them staying
through the 10 launching postponements, or scrubs, to the eventual
liftoff. ``They were a hard-working and hard-playing crowd, and
desperate for news after so many scrubs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up a favorite story among old-timers. One night at
a media hangout called the Starlight, the former husband of one of
the waitresses burst in, shot her dead, and then escaped. Some
reporters splashed the story of ``murder in missileland.'' It is
said, and the tale is too good to check, that the reporter for a
London tabloid filed the following dispatch: ``A jealous ex-husband
shot his former wife in a nightclub last night. It was the first
successful shot here in weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count, some 3,000 media representatives had registered
to cover Glenn's comeback flight here, and not once have they had
to turn to the police for something to report.
</P>
<P>
   George Page, who is 74, was T.J. O'Malley's assistant test
conductor in the blockhouse at launching pad 14 on the morning
Glenn went into orbit. At first, he recalled, there was little
excitement or tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go for another one, probably another scrub for weather
or some mechanical hitch,'' Page said of the initial feeling among
the 40 or more engineers monitoring the condition of the Atlas
rocket and the Mercury capsule. ``But the count got down to a
minute or two, and there were no problems. So we sat up and began
to believe this might be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn himself had reason to wonder if he would get off the pad
that day. He recalled in an interview: ``I actually suited up four
times and was on top of the booster one time waiting for four and a
half hours, another time for almost six hours. It was no-go. I
finally went up on the 11th scheduled date.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, the chief test conductor for the booster, who grew up
in Montclair, N.J., and came here in 1958, a few months after the
first Soviet Sputnik stunned Americans, remembered the blockhouse
that day. He called it ``a pressure pot.'' It was rudimentary by
today's control-room standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no computers,'' he said. ``The only thing that you
might say was one, was the timer, a clock running the launching
program. When Glenn said, `The clock is started,' it was that
timer.''
</P>
<P>
   From a shelf in his den, O'Malley pulled down the mounted
ignition button that had been at his control console. It was among
such treasures as Atlas, Apollo and space shuttle models; his last
job, before he retired in 1982, was to prepare the first space
shuttle, Columbia, for launching in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At T-minus-18 seconds in the countdown, he said, ``I hit this
button, and then put my fist on the red button next to it, ready to
activate the escape tower if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tape recordings caught his words at that moment. ``May the good
Lord ride all the way,'' O'Malley said. Carpenter, in the
blockhouse to handle communications between the ground and Glenn,
followed with the famous benediction, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.'' At
T-minus-0, the Atlas rose from the pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was elated,'' O'Malley said. ``We all went to
celebrate with a keg of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, some of the old blockhouse gang will be
coming around to O'Malley's house for a fish fry, to bask in
memories of when they were young with John Glenn and sent him off
into the sky and fame.

DHAKA JOURNAL: DEFIANT AUTHOR, DYING MOTHER AND WRATH OF ISLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh _ The writer Taslima Nasrin returned home to
Bangladesh last month to be at the side of her dying mother. But
while the older woman lies bedridden _ cancer amok in her liver and
colon _ her daughter has been forced into hiding by religious
firebrands who chant ``Death to the apostate!'' and have put a
$5,000 price on her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my mother's last days, and I cannot see her,'' Ms.
Nasrin, 36, said Tuesday, talking angrily on a mobile phone from a
hideaway in Dhaka. ``I cannot go anywhere or meet anyone. I love
this country, but my life here is something no one would want.''
</P>
<P>
   The onetime government doctor is a feminist and an atheist, a
novelist and poet, a creator of erotic imagery and critic of
organized religion. In heavily Islamic Bangladesh, her ideas are
disquieting to many and blasphemous to others. The price for this
outspokenness has been a lonely odyssey, of which her current
hideout is but the latest stop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Nasrin fled her homeland after some little-known
Muslim clerics issued a fatwa, or death sentence, against her. She
had also been arrested and charged by prosecutors with a seldom
used section of the penal code that prohibits the insulting of
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ms. Nasrin's writings and pronouncements could have set
off such difficulties _ not the least her 1993 novel ``Shame,'' a
book that depicted a murderous rampage by Bangladeshi Muslims
against the nation's Hindu minority.
</P>
<P>
   But anger turned to outrage only after Ms. Nasrin was quoted in
a Calcutta newspaper as having commented that ``the Koran should be
thoroughly revised.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she said she had been misquoted, though her
clarifications then, like ones she offered Tuesday, were hardly
mollification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every religion oppresses women,'' she said in the phone
conversation. ``I talk about the Koran because I know this book
best. It allows for torture and other mistreatment, especially for
women. And I despise the Sharia laws. They cannot be changed. They
must be thrown out, abolished. We don't need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this fire, while hardly unusual for Ms. Nasrin, was
stoked by unattributed reports on Tuesday's front pages that the
writer was now repentant and wished to atone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apologize for what?'' Ms. Nasrin said emphatically. ``I
haven't done anything wrong. I've told the truth. Religious
scriptures are out of time and out of place.''
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing Bangladesh in 1994, she primarily lived in Europe,
collecting some awards for artistic courage but little peace of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   In August, her mother, Idul Wara, a devout Muslim, joined Ms.
Nasrin in New York and received cancer treatments. With the
diagnosis dire, she left for home Sept. 13. She was accompanied by
her husband, himself a heart patient, and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nasrin hoped to return unnoticed. Indeed, immigration and
customs officials did not realize whom they had in their midst.
Other air travelers, however, recognized her. Reporters were
called. Flight records were checked. Articles were written.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, the fatwa and the arrest again hung over her
head. The writer spent two days with her parents, who live in a
comfortable three-bedroom apartment that Ms. Nasrin bought with
earnings from her books. Then she again went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Many here presume that police know her whereabouts. For a while,
protesters demanded her arrest. Thousands took to the streets.
Rioters threw rocks. Seminarians in the northeastern city of Sylhet
called a general strike. Everything there was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the street fury has subsided, prompting many here to
suggest that Ms. Nasrin no longer faces any danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should come out,'' said Syed Ali Ahsan, a noted writer and
vice chancellor of Darul Ihsan University. ``She has the best
lawyers in the country. Nothing will happen to her. She can lead a
normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are not uncommon here. Many prominent
Bangladeshis insist that the fatwas are empty threats by feckless
fundamentalists. They remind people that Bangladesh is governed by
secular laws and resent Westerners who have used the Nasrin case to
stereotype their nation as another repressive Islamic backwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the West, Taslima is an even better victim than Salman
Rushdie because she is a woman,'' said Mahfuz Anam, the
liberal-minded editor of The Daily Star, an English-language
newspaper in Dhaka. Rushdie was for years under a death sentence
issued by Iran's Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has gotten global attention, but in Bangladesh she is not
such a heroine. She has not inspired us. She is not a great writer.
We have far more extraordinary women here who are working with the
villages and protecting women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nasrin has her share of supporters, but she is surely no
darling within most women's groups or literary circles. Her work is
often derided. Indeed, many are perturbed that she is linked to a
literary superstar like Rushdie by virtue of mutual circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Ms. Nasrin is an indiscreet, all-too-shrill voice.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, Ahsan said, but its use
must be tempered in places where words too easily lead to
bloodshed. ``Freedom does not give me the right to try and kill the
beliefs of another person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those pained by Ms. Nasrin's writing is someone who loves
and respects her dearly, the terminally ill Idul Wara, 62. Near
death, she finds it hard to talk, to eat, to sit up. Still,
clutching to her faith, she tries to pray the required five times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother supports Taslima's feminist writings, but when she
writes very directly against Islam, my mother cannot help but think
this is wrong,'' said Faizul Kabir, the author's older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother wants to know why it is necessary to write against
religion in order to be in favor of women. She does not see things
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabir had left his mother's bedside and agreed to take tea
around the corner. He said his mother longed to see Taslima and was
bereft at the separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother asks for forgiveness for her daughter,'' he said,
drawing a careful distinction. ``She does not ask that Taslima ask.
She asks as a mother asks. She asks for the sake of herself.''

 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the moral universe, especially the one that
postdates the Holocaust, remembering is almost always enlisted on
the side of good, and forgetting on the side of bad. But in a
symposium that ended Tuesday titled ``The Claims of Memory,'' held
at Boston University over the last few days to celebrate Elie
Wiesel's 70th birthday, it was memory's difficult skirmishes _
battles where it has clashed with artistic freedom, morality, fact,
writing and sanity _ that were evoked.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wiesel, whose writing is all about memory, conceded that
there may be ``too many memories.'' He added that if he remembered
everything he would not be here but rather ``in an institution.''
In the face of so much opposition, memory must fight for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Ozick, the novelist and critic, addressed the threat of
literature, particularly the historical novel, poses to memory.
``The aims of the imagination,'' she said, ``are not the aims of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   So how can one object to a novel that distorts events? She made
an example of William Styron's novel ``Sophie's Choice.'' The
problem? The vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust were
Jews, but ``Sophie's Choice'' is about a Polish Catholic victim. So
what? ``Why must a writer's character be representative of the
statistical norm?'' she asked. No reason, she answered _ unless it
is the novelist's intention to ``put flesh on history.'' The term
``historical novel'' she said, is an oxymoron. Since Sophie's story
stands in for history, ``the rights of history can begin to urge
their own force'' over the rights of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ozick raised the same problem with ``The Reader,'' a novel
by Bernhard Schlink whose narrator belongs to the second generation
of Germans born after the Holocaust. The novel involves an
illiterate woman who, because she could not read an advertisement
for a factory job, ended up instead as an SS guard. The woman's
illiteracy is used, Ms. Ozick said, to exculpate her. Furthermore,
she said, this woman is an anomaly: after all, most Germans in
power were far from illiterate. An anomaly like this, Ms. Ozick
said, ``sweeps away memory.'' She cannot be excused, even in the
name of literary freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Memory must be preserved because it may be the only redress for
the victims. ``It comes out of seeming nowhere from the country of
the dead,'' Ariel Dorfman said, ``and bites back'' at the villains
who think they can erase history. But what happens when villains
keep the memories?
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman, a novelist, poet and journalist, recalled District 6, a
multiracial, multireligious neighborhood in Cape Town that was so
offensive to the officials upholding apartheid that they bulldozed
it. There was nothing left but barren fields and a few churches
(which the government always spared). But once Nelson Mandela came
to power, said Dorfman, a museum was built on the site of District
6, which included the street signs from the neighborhood. How did
they survive?
</P>
<P>
   The foreman of the wrecking crew had taken the signs home and
saved them. The man who razed the neighborhood knew, Dorfman
concluded, that ``he was destroying something sacred,'' and that,
he added, stirred him enough to ``become the guardian of that
space.'' This reminds us that memories are kept not only by the
victims but also by the persecutors. Even villains seem to know
that ``there must be a space where memories can resonate.''
</P>
<P>
   And even victims can turn on their own memories. Novelist Aharon
Appelfeld recalled his erasure of memory and its eventual
retrieval. At the beginning of the war, he said, he tried to
preserve the details of his home, to imagine each room, each
corner, separately. But during the war, ``we tried to forget we
came from Jewish homes.'' He changed his appearance so he wouldn't
look Jewish. ``I washed my tongue so that Jewish words should not
slip from my mouth.'' He added, ``Memory was our enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 8, he was taken to a concentration camp, then escaped.
After the war, he found himself in a refugee, or liberation, camp.
But the atmosphere was oppressive. After days of ``quarrels over
every inch of space,'' he escaped once more, with a few others.
Then memory came back to him unexpectedly. It was nature _
``contact with the trees in the forest, with the moist earth, the
straw'' _ that brought him to his senses and returned memory to
him. He described it as a religious awakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we felt that we were individuals _ bereft
individuals, but people who had not lost their humanity,'' he said.
When memory came back to us, it was ``like reattaching to your body
organs which were cut off.'' His parents and grandparents spoke to
him in ``a long and colorful dream.'' It was only when memory was
no longer a danger to survival, nor occluded by the hopeful clamor
of the liberation camp, that it resurfaced. ``Weeks of seclusion
redeemed us from our forgetfulness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One might assume that memory has a solid ally in memoir, but
some of the speakers were doubtful. Shlomo Breznitz, a psychology
professor at the New School University in Manhattan, who studies
stress, spoke about writing ``Memory Fields,'' his memoir of being
placed in an orphanage with his sister when his parents were taken
to Auschwitz. ``We were hungry, but we were not starving,'' he
recalled. ``We were cold, but we were not freezing. We were alone,
but we still had hope that our parents would come back. Nothing at
all compared with with the big drama and the tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he needed a half century of reflection before he
could write. And even with a long delay, there was a cost to
telling the story _ a cost to memory itself. After telling the
story, he said, ``I remember the way I told it, not the way it
happened. It is something which has a beginning, a middle and an
end. The original is covered hopelessly by the reproduction. Once
we write it, it is frozen forever.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone agrees. Henry Louis Gates Jr., the
chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard
University, found that his memoir, ``Colored People,'' continued to
unfreeze memories long after he thought he had finished writing
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a 12-year-old, he once crossed his legs right over left
rather than left over right and dared God to do something about it.
Soon after, his mother told him she was going to die. She went to
the hospital. He told God that if his mother lived, he'd give his
life to Christ. When his mother came back from the hospital, Gates
started going to church. So, after writing his memoir decades
later, he finally figured out why he joined the church as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Gates thinks that memoirs not only free personal secrets but
family and race secrets too. In the business of testifying, he does
not think there should be any rules or limitations. ``Bill Styron
wrote about Nat Turner,'' and that's fine, he said. A former
speechwriter for Alabama Gov. George Wallace wrote ``The Education
of Little Tree'' pretending to be a Cherokee. And that, to Gates,
is remarkable. ``I love the confusion of forms, the blurring of
boundaries,'' he said. ``I love the fact that people can't tell
whether some 18th-century work is a memoir or a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some do not love such confusion. Susan Suleiman, the chairwoman
of the Romance language and literature department at Harvard
University and the author of a memoir, ``Budapest Diary: In Search
of the Motherbook,'' spoke about the ``institutional boundary''
between fiction and nonfiction. It is notable, she said, that it
can really only be violated in one direction: ``If a memoir is felt
to be fraudulent, there are shock waves,'' especially if the events
described are traumatic. If a novel turns out to be a memoir, she
said, people don't care as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be limits on what one can do with
the Holocaust'' in literature, she said. But, she added, ``I think
the category of memoir implies a kind of contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And so memory battled on through the symposium, with Wiesel's
recurring message as its best ally: ``Memories, even painful
memories, are all we have. In fact, they are the only thing we are.
So we must take very good care of them.''

NATO RETREATS FROM AIR STRIKES BUT WARNS MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ NATO officials said Tuesday that while the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, had withdrawn enough troops from the
Serbian province of Kosovo to avert air strikes, they would reserve
the right to bomb Serb targets if Milosevic resumed his offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO decision defused the immediate crisis, it did
little to forge a long-term solution to the problem in Kosovo,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said NATO would move
quickly to use force against Yugoslavia if Milosevic redeploys his
troops against ethnic Albanian civilians. Albright also said that
NATO allies were preparing to assemble a rapid-reaction force in
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to intervene if
neccessary.
</P>
<P>
   There already are some 350 US troops in Macedonia as part of a
``tripwire'' to guard against the Kosovo turmoil spilling into
other countries. Albright added that to dispatch a rapid-deployment
force would require Macedonian approval. The US force would extract
international monitors in the event of an emergency, said David
Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO deadline for Milosevic to comply with a United Nations
resolution calling for him to withdraw most of his army and police
units from Kosovo and to allow ethnic Albanian refugees to return
to their homes expired Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Brussels, where NATO ambassadors met to decide if
Milosevic had complied with the UN resolution and the deal he
struck with US special envoy Richard Holbrooke, NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana said that the order authorizing air strikes
would remain in effect indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   While there were still Serbian army and police in Kosovo, Solana
said that the Serb forces had dismantled roadblocks and withdrawn
troops not normally stationed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that President Milosevic moves only when he is
presented with a credible threat of force,'' said Solana.
</P>
<P>
   But Solana added that Kosovar Albanians ``must also cooperate
with the international community,'' a call for Albanian
representatives to negotiate with the Serbs and for the rebels of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, to maintain their cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Milosevic waited until the last minute to avoid
punishment from the West. In this case, he ordered an accelerated
withdrawal of the forces that had lingered in Kosovo nearly two
weeks after he and Holbrooke reached an agreement to avert NATO air
strikes and to stop the killing and displacement of Albanian
civilians by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of Serb troops, some of them flashing three-finger Serb
salutes, rolled north out of Kosovo Tuesday. According to NATO
estimates, up to 4,000 special forces of the Yugoslav army, blamed
by many Albanians for some of the worst atrocities in recent
months, left the province in the previous 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, Milosevic also fired his secret service chief,
Jovica Stanisic following reports the official opposed his
hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, some cautious ethnic Albanians quit their hiding
places in the hills and woods to find their villages in ruins.
Those who did return Tuesday came largely out of curiosity. Few
stayed, according to Western diplomats and aid workers. ``The
Kosovars won't stay until they believe the Serbs won't come back,''
said one US diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian groups, meanwhile, are racing against the
approaching Balkan winter to facilitate the return of refugees who
left their homes in the face of the Serb offensive. Up to 300,000
of Kosovo's 2 million people are estimated to have fled in the last
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   An international force of some 2,000 civilian observers is also
trying to verify that Milosevic and the KLA keep their word in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 700 people, most of them Albanian civilians, have
been killed since last February, when Serb forces launched a
counteroffensive against the KLA after the separatist group began
killing members of the Serb security forces and taking control of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   The passing air strike deadline was greeted with disappointment
by Albanians. But most Serbs did not greet it with relief. Hardly
anyone in Belgrade believed that NATO was serious about bombing,
especially after Milosevic and Holbrooke reached a deal two weeks
ago. In its 50-year history, NATO has never intervened in a
conflict confined within the borders of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were not the only ones who doubted that air strikes
would happen. Zvonimir Arsic, the assistant manager of Belgrade
Airport, pointed out that as the deadline approached, five foreign
airlines resumed flights to Belgrade. They included the national
airlines of Britain, France, Germany and Italy, Europe's biggest
powers and presumably the countries that, along with the United
States, had the most influence in deciding if air strikes would
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, from ordinary Serbs to Western diplomats, saw
Tuesday's announcement as a face-saving measure both for NATO and
Milosevic. Privately, some Western diplomats acknowledged that with
so few observers on the ground it was next to impossible to verify
to what degree Milosevic was in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the diplomats admitted, this has been a conflict where
Western intervention has been dictated largely by television
images. If footage of slaughtered Albanian civilians, including
babies, could trigger threats of air strikes, scenes of Serb forces
rumbling out of Kosovo could postpone the bombing indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in New York Tuesday afternoon, Holbrooke said that
there had been ``very substantial compliance. They are withdrawing
in very large numbers. The refugees are coming back from the
wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA is also returning to villages from which it was
driven by the Serb offensive that killed more of their supporters
than rebel fighters. The prospect of the rebels retaking the ground
they lost to Milosevic's rampaging troops brings the situation full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Solana admitted as much when he said that circumstances on the
ground were similar to those of last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the progress, this crisis is far from over,'' said
Solana, urging both sides to take advantage of what he called a
unique opportunity to negotiate a long-term settlement. ``Clearly,
a political solution must be found.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is ever clear in Kosovo in particular and the
Balkans in general. Many longtime observers expressed fear that
this latest development is merely a winter cease-fire, a common
phenomenon in this bellicose region.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian rebels need the cover of trees and brush to wage
their hit-and-run campaign against the Serbs. The Serbs, in turn,
do not favor a winter campaign, which is a logistical nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   So both sides live to fight another day, in the spring. In the
interim, the pressure continues on the international community to
avert a humanitarian disaster in the coming months and to find a
diplomatic solution to a problem that appears as regularly as the
snows of the unforgiving Balkan winter.

   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia _ Under the gaze of U.S. spy planes overhead
and international monitors prowling the back roads in armored cars,
filing reports by satellite telephone, Yugoslav forces continued to
move out of the battered province of Kosovo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police and military units disappeared from many positions they
had held for months, though it was not clear if enough troops had
gone _ and gone far enough away _ to meet the exacting demands that
NATO laid down to forestall threatened air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials said Tuesday that Yugoslavia had not met
all requirements, its compliance was considered sufficient to hold
off any immediate attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a constant stream of information about the
situation on the ground,'' a U.S. diplomat said. ``It is very
detailed, very specific. We know exactly what a lot of the units
are doing, and they are leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of returning to their barracks by Tuesday, as NATO
demanded, some police units appeared to be dispersing their forces
into small groups assigned to places where they would be much more
difficult to see from the sky or the ground.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, rebel soldiers who had been kept scattered and
somewhat disorganized by the government forces, were boldly
re-forming and fanning out in large numbers into villages now freed
of government control by NATO threats.
</P>
<P>
   As reports were received in Western capitals, a senior U.S.
diplomat, Christopher Hill, spent much of the day with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to personally handle any difficulties
on the day of the NATO deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the same all over,'' a diplomat in the western
town of Pec said Tuesday morning as five hulking armored personnel
carriers were hauled down the main street on flatbed trucks. ``A
lot of them are leaving. There was so much traffic through here
last night that we could hardly sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside a remote village about 30 miles away, what appeared
to be a group of police officers packing to leave was actually a
redeployment of sorts, the officer in charge said.
</P>
<P>
   As some of his men loaded a truck with their backpacks and with
furniture from the house they had commandeered for their
headquarters, the officer said, ``We're taking the things from here
so the men can be more comfortable in their new locations higher up
the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the men in his unit were leaving, only being
scattered about the area in small groups.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said their surveillance aircraft over Kosovo may
not be able to detect policemen or soldiers based in homes or small
camps. ``We're worried that they will hide themselves, perhaps
change into civilian clothes,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the village of Junik, where a few police officers were still
present, villagers said most of the others who had been there have
moved to a house hidden in the nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, Yugoslavia said it would comply with a United Nations
resolution demanding that the number of police officers and
soldiers in Kosovo be brought down to what it was in February.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that number was 15,000, and that as recently
as last weekend there were an additional 9,000 on duty in Kosovo.
NATO gave Yugoslavia until Tuesday to reduce the numbers or face
air strikes. Senior NATO officers also told Yugoslav officials
which units they wanted withdrawn from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250,000 ethnic Albanians fled their homes during the
offensive, and most are still afraid to return. U.S. monitors said
Tuesday that it was their impression, based on their observation,
that many refugees were returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But many were cautious. ``They have gone from here, but they are
in the next village,'' said Bajram Morina. ``They could be back in
five minutes, so we are still in danger.'' He stood in front of a
burned-out house that became a two-story pile of stones and debris
after government forces attacked his village in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here in the daytime,'' he said, ``but at night I sleep
with my family in the woods, because we are not safe yet. If you
don't eat proper food for months, if you are afraid all the time
and your family is always in danger, that can make a man go
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was an atmosphere of joy and optimism here in the
village of Istinic as people watched the police leave the building
that had been their base for several months.
</P>
<P>
   They left the sandbags up in the firing positions at the corners
of the building, and the logs that protected the windows, but
Petrit Jonuzaj said, ``They took down that antenna for the radio
last night. Then just loaded their cooking stove, and they're gone.
I can't say where they are going, but it is away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Police left in two blue armored vans, snaking through a throng
of people filling the marketplace where the village's two streets
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Some villagers said that with the police gone, they hoped
guerrillas from the Kosovo Liberation Army would not move into the
village. ``We are all civilians here, with our children, and the
police are still on the main road very near. We don't want more
fighting,'' Jonuzaj said. ``Now there is a chance for negotiations
with the government. We want to solve problems, not create
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the strategy to reduce the number of police and
soldiers is the theory held by some Western diplomats that if
people can return to their homes and if renewed fighting can be
prevented it is possible for the vast differences between the
Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to be settled
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ethnic Albanians think that is a foolish theory because
what they want is nothing short of independence, and Yugoslav
officials say they will never agree to that. Nine out of ten people
in Kosovo are ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who embrace the view
that only insurrection can achieve independence, were filing down
from their isolated hideouts and into many of the places government
forces were leaving Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A drive across the province revealed that many Serbian police
checkpoints had disappeared. Only one car was seen being stopped by
police and that was for speeding. On the other hand, many rebel
checkpoints had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in months, in some villages rebel fighters in
uniform casually walked the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say they have told rebel leaders that it would
be a mistake for them to take advantage of the government pullout
by trying to strengthen their military position. But, the diplomats
say the military offensive that hurt so many civilians caused
little permanent damage to the Kosovo Liberation Army, and if the
rebels wanted to renew combat it would be difficult to stop them.

 NOVELIST IAN McEWAN WINS BRITAIN'S PRESTIGIOUS BOOKER PRIZE   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ian McEwan, the British writer whose novels explore the
ways that seemingly ordinary people can veer frighteningly out of
control, was on Tuesday night awarded the Booker Prize, Britain's
most prestigious literary award, for his latest work,
``Amsterdam.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan had been nominated for the prize twice before _ for ``The
Comfort of Strangers,'' in 1981, and for ``Black Dogs,'' in 1992 _
and Tuesday night's award came as something of a surprise.
``Amsterdam'' received generally glowing reviews here, but several
critics said McEwan has written better books.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the $34,000 prize, McEwan beat not only his close
friend Julian Barnes, whose novel ``England, England'' had also
made the five-book short list, but also Beryl Bainbridge, whose
appearance on the short list this year was her fifth, for the novel
``Master Georgie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amsterdam'' is the story of a strange euthanasia pact between
two friends, a composer and a newspaper editor, whose relationship
spins into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the award, Douglas Hurd, the former Tory foreign
secretary who served as the chairman of the five-judge panel this
year, said that McEwan's book was ``a sardonic and wise examination
of the morals and culture of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, a glowing McEwan said at a news conference in
London's Guildhall, where the award was presented, that he would
probably spend the prize money on ``something perfectly useless,''
so that it wouldn't be frittered away on things like ``bus fare and
linoleum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Booker is awarded each year to a novel written by a Briton
or a citizen of the Commonwealth, including the Caribbean,
Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Other finalists were ``Breakfast on Pluto,'' by the Irish author
Patrick McCabe; ``Industry of Souls'' by Martin Booth, and ``The
Restraint of Beasts'' by Magnus Mills, a London bus driver.

MORNING SURPRISE: BABY GIRL LEFT ON A DOORSTEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ It was a scene from a fairy tale, another
time &UR;  &LR; and place. Helaine Miller stepped outside her West Newton
home Tuesday morning to find a feisty, crying, healthy newborn girl
waiting to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe it. I said, `I think I'm in a movie,'''
said Miller, who had walked outside to pick up her newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked to find the child, but pleased to see that she appeared
healthy, the mother of three and grandmother of one instinctively
scooped her up and took her inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' said the beaming 63-year-old. ``It felt very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, who turned the infant over to authorities, realizes
it was fortuitous that she was home. Police believe the girl was
left on her doorstep between 6 and 7:05 a.m., when the temperature
was only 38 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky we were here. It was a very cold morning and very sad a
mother would leave a baby here,'' Miller said. ``It's tragic. It's
not natural for a mother to abandon her child.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours old, the baby was found wrapped in a terry
cloth towel soiled with blood, her umbilical cord still attached,
said Newton Police Chief Frank R. Gorgone.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy 7-pound, 6-ounce girl, who measures 20 1/2inches
long and has strawberry-blonde hair, was in stable condition in
Newton Wellesley Hospital Tuesday. Nurses, striving for a more
personal name than Baby Doe, are calling her Julia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a beautiful baby, a gorgeous baby,'' said Dr. Thomas
Beatty, the hospital's chief of obstetrics and gynecology. ``In
spite of being a little cool, she was alert, looking around,
responding and behaving just like any normal newborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Touched by news reports of the baby's abandonment Tuesday, many
people called the hospital and police, asking to visit her or even
adopt her, said hospital spokeswoman Rachel Kagno. The state
Department of Social Services sought temporary custody of the baby
Tuesday, and will work with police to identify the parents or find
her a foster home and adoptive parents, said spokeswoman Lorraine
Carli.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgone said he is concerned for the mother's health but that
criminal charges may be considered if and when she is located.
Police canvassed the neighborhood Tuesday, finding few clues to the
mother's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Their only early lead was the sound of two slamming car doors at
about 6 a.m. One may have been the mother. The other was the
newspaper carrier. Vernon Wright, 28, a divinity student who
delivered the papers Tuesday for his wife, Kathleen, Tuesdaytold
police the baby was not there at about 6 a.m. when he walked up the
Millers' path.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrights, who have a 2-year-old son, were touched by the
news. Kathleen Wright had a miscarriage in August and was among
those calling DSS Tuesday, considering adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have that baby, as many people would,''
she said. ``I'm just horrified that that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have no idea why the baby turned up on the Millers'
doorstep but guess it may have been because the lights were on and
someone was obviously home. The home, which Miller has shared with
her husband, Stanley, since 1966, is something out of a fairy tale,
too: A massive English tudor, with a second-story window balcony
and a surrounding stone wall. Thick hedges form an archway and
obscure from sidewalk view the stone steps where the baby was
found.
</P>
<P>
   Miller couldn't guess whether the mother left the girl there in
the hopes that the family could offer her a better life. Nor does
Miller, a former vice president at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, know anyone who was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past that stage,'' she said. ``I'm in the grandparent
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors were appalled that the baby was left on a
doorstep. But some found it heartwarming that the infant was left
in a place where she could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when somebody abandons a baby in a place where there
are caring people, like on the step of a church or a hospital, the
thinking of the mother or person leaving the baby is that
hopefully, somebody in a better position than them will pick up the
child and care for him or her,'' Carli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's usually a positive sign,'' she added. ``It's different
than when you see the horrible cases where somebody discards a baby
where hopefully nobody would find it.''

CHRETIEN AFTER 5 YEARS: TOUGH, BUT A TYRANT TOO?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Even for a tough political competitor like Jean
Chretien, question period in the House of Commons can be a grind.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, for an hour, Prime Minister Chretien has to answer
questions, in English and French, from his parliamentary foes. The
opposition constantly tries to bait him, and sometimes succeeds, as
in a recent session when Chretien stood to defend himself against
accusations that he and his staff had ordered the police to use
pepper spray on demonstrators before a visit by a foreign dignitary
last year.
</P>
<P>
   He retorted that it was better to get hit with pepper spray than
a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister shrugged and said he was only being
honest. It didn't matter. ``Pepper Spray Beats Baseball Bats'' was
the main story on newscasts and newspapers across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is candor, or insensitivity, Chretien's five years in
office have been marked by a directness uncommon among world
leaders. At a time of obtuse diplomacy and executive legalisms, he
can be outspoken and blunt to a degree that frightens and
frustrates his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to be called ``the little guy from Shawinigan,'' the
mill town in Quebec where he was born 64 years ago, but recent
incidents have critics accusing him of being a street tough and a
tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   His missteps are already legend in Canada. He once boasted
before what he thought was a closed microphone that Canada's Cuba
policy scores points at home because it makes the United States
squirm. When Canadians speak of the ``Shawinigan handshake,'' they
are referring to the time the prime minister literally wrung the
neck of a protester who got too close to him at a Flag Day rally in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was first asked about the pepper spray incident,
Chretien told reporters, ``Pepper, for me I put it on my plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole affair is affording Canadians a rare glimpse into
the inner soul of this prime minister,'' said Rick Anderson, an
opposition strategist. ``People are getting to see him as a
bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Chretien's wisecracks and roughhousing has always
been split. Everything about him is open to criticism except the
paralysis that causes the left part of his face to contract so that
he looks as if he is talking out of the side of his mouth. An
opponent once tried poking fun during a campaign and paid dearly
for it in lost votes.
</P>
<P>
   French speakers delight in saying that this prime minister has
trouble expressing himself in both of Canada's official languages.
They make fun of his bumbling, and at the same time they accuse him
of hiding behind the everyman persona to deflect criticism. Louis
Duclos, head of Quebec's delegation in Toronto, points out that
Chretien is a lawyer and has for most of his adult life been a
member of the government elite, something far from common on the
streets of Shawinigan.
</P>
<P>
   But the average Canadian identifies with Chretien's humble
beginnings and his unassuming ways. ``I don't think Canadians are
expecting perfection,'' said Edward Zussman, a political analyst
who once worked for Chretien. In spite of past miscues, the prime
minister's personal approval ratings have always remained well
above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Chretien's current popularity rides on the
performance of Canada's economy. Unemployment, though at 8 percent
about double that in the United States, has been steadily dropping,
inflation has practically vanished and there is a budget surplus
for the first time in a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that when the press writes `that's a damn good
government,''' Chretien said in an interview in his office in the
center block of Canada's prim parliamentary complex in Ottawa.
``I've never seen that title in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He has shown an uncanny talent for shaking off controversy. Even
badly fumbled explanations for major policy reversals _ he
campaigned against a free trade agreement, then warmly embraced it
_ frustrate voters but do not entirely alienate them.
</P>
<P>
   And his support sometimes comes from unlikely corners. The
pepper-spraying incident took place last November, but it surfaced
in newspapers and newscasts only after the Starr report on
President Clinton was issued in early September. That left many
Canadians, including some Ottawa reporters, asking old questions
about the character of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the doings in Washington set it off, but the Canadian
political and media elites appear to be suffering a dose of scandal
envy,'' wrote Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist with The Globe and Mail
of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   What Chretien is accused of is directly, or indirectly,
interfering with security arrangements at the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation conference in Vancouver and making it clear that he did
not want the visiting President Suharto of Indonesia to be
embarrassed by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Even though conclusive proof has not been found, Chretien's
jokes and heavy-handed responses have raised questions about his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going after Chretien for insensitivity, but that is
not an indictable offense,'' said Robert Bothwell, a professor of
history at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The big concern now is that the prime minister's controversial
remarks and actions could influence the outcome of the coming
election in Quebec, where separatist and federalist parties are
fighting for control of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are already speculating that Chretien will resign
if the separatist party is re-elected. The separatists have vowed
to hold a third referendum on Quebec independence, and even within
Chretien's own party, the Liberals, not everyone thinks he can lead
another campaign to hold Canada together. He was widely seen as
having mishandled the 1995 referendum, which federalists won by
less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chretien,'' wrote Rosemary Speirs, a Toronto Star columnist,
``would have to face the fact that many federalists believe he'd be
a liability, not an asset, in the ultimate fight to keep the
country together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The old warrior smiles crookedly at suggestions that he is not
up to another fight, and challenges anyone who doubts his stamina
to race him up the stairs at Parliament. He takes pride in a recent
photograph that shows him bounding over a wall while Clinton, with
whom he has a cordial relationship, struggles to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that some days I feel that perhaps I should
go,'' said Chretien, who has spent more than 35 years in Canadian
politics. ``Then the day after, I am saying, `Gee, I'm staying.'
And I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear. After fighting Quebec separatists for 35
years, he has no intention of overseeing the dismemberment of his
country, should that day ever arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, if they were to vote two-thirds or 75 percent
for separation, I would probably resign the day after and go home
and let them bring in somebody else,'' Chretien said. He
acknowledged that a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
made it clear that under such circumstances the federal government
would be obliged to negotiate the separation of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that the Supreme Court said too that the
borders of Quebec are not secure,'' he said. ``Now you fall into
the problem of partition of Quebec, because if you can break Canada
why the people who are not happy to stay in Quebec cannot break
Quebec?''
</P>
<P>
   Cree Indians who inhabit the wild northern part of Quebec, along
with scattered Eskimo groups, have threatened to break away from
the province if it leaves Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's unbending opposition to separation makes him more
popular throughout Canada but in Quebec he is seen as a traitor,
and he doesn't apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The separatists don't like Chretien at all, and I'm very proud
of that,'' the prime minister said. ``I've always been very clearly
a Canadian whose province is Quebec, whose language is French,
whose religion is Catholic, who's coming from the St. Maurice
Valley. I've always been very consistent with my policy, my view of
myself and of my country and those who want to split Canada always
see me in their path.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure from Quebec will always be there, he said,
because the province can use it to force Ottawa to grant programs
and constitutional changes that strengthen the province at the
expense of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But discussing the constitution in Canada, it's part of the
national _ what's the right word here _ sport. We have hockey and
the constitution. When hockey is not doing too well, we start to
talk about the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the recent controversies have taken a toll
on him. In a move that seemed to betray unusual anger, Chretien's
press office filed a complaint against the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. for slanted coverage of the pepper spray incident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chretien's wife, Aline, attended the question period.
At one point he looked up at her and smiled, then took the
opposition's best shots. When the hourlong period ended, he scooped
up his briefing books and was one of the first members to leave the
House.
</P>
<P>
   He returned energetically to his third-floor office, where one
window almost perfectly frames the U.S. embassy across Wellington
Street. With the Stars and Stripes snapping over his shoulder, he
said that simply surviving was his ultimate political goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day you say `I've survived one more day,'''
he said. ``In order to survive you have to learn to walk with your
back to the wall, with your elbows held very high, and a smile on
your face.''

SCHUMER INCHES AHEAD OF D'AMATO, POLL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A week to go before the election, Democrat Charles E.
Schumer has inched out in front of three-term Republican incumbent
Alfonse M. D'Amato in their bitterly fought race for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contest, which may be the most closely watched in the
country, is seen as way too tight for anyone to venture a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll taken Sunday of 709 likely voters _ the first survey
since the candidates' raucous Saturday night debate _ Schumer leads
D'Amato, 42.9 percent to 38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's edge still lies within the poll's 3.8-percentage-point
margin of error. However, over the past few days, his numbers have
been rising consistently and D'Amato's have been falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Schumer has the momentum,'' the pollster, John Zogby,
said Tuesday. The trend, he said, ``is dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, he noted, has lost considerable ground over the past
week among all the demographic groups that usually decide close
elections in New York _ Jews, suburbanites and women. Even upstate,
the more rural and conservative regions where D'Amato is still
ahead, his lead has deteriorated from about 20 percentage points to
10.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 15 percent of those polled remain undecided. ``Anything
can happen,'' Zogby emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, agreed: ``I wouldn't bet a dime on this race.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato vs. Schumer is not only one of the closest, but may be
the most politically significant Senate race. In a season when five
Democratic senators are in danger of losing, putting Republicans
close to the 60-seat majority needed to block filibusters, Schumer
is that rare candidate who might unseat a Republican _ and not just
any Republican, but the king of New York state's surging GOP.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was in town Tuesday to
campaign with Schumer, her third such visit. President Clinton, who
raised $1.1 million for Schumer in a campaign appearance this
month, is also due for a return trip this week.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer needs all the money he can get. Republican Governor
George W. Pataki set out with D'Amato Tuesday on a four-day,
16-city campaign tour. Pataki, also up for reelection, is way ahead
of his Democratic opponent, New York City Council speaker Peter
Vallone, so he will spend about $6 million for joint media ads this
week. The Republican Party is expected to pour a few million more,
for ads, phone banks, transportation, and other get-out-the-vote
aids.
</P>
<P>
   Two of D'Amato's past three Senate victories have been close.
His last one, in 1992 against Robert Abrams, was decided by one
percent of the ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Amato loses this time, the turning point may have been last
Wednesday, when, speaking to 40 Jewish supporters, he referred to
Schumer as a ``putzhead.'' The Yiddish word ``putz,'' a put-down
for a fool, literally means a small male organ. When asked about
the incident, D'Amato at first denied using the word _ until some
of his supporters, who were in the room, confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer trumpeted the remark and the denial as another example
of how ``New Yorkers cannot trust Al D'Amato'' _ his main campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato won over 40 percent of the Jewish vote in 1992 _
staggering for a Republican in New York _ and has been consistently
getting 35 percent in the polls for this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   However, the latest poll, published in Tuesday's New York Post,
shows him favored by just 18 percent of Jews. Zogby said D'Amato's
insult might be the reason for the decline, because they see it not
so much as an ethnic slur as ``un-senatorial behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is Jewish. D'Amato is Roman Catholic but has long been
active in Jewish causes, most recently in forcing Swiss banks to
return assets stolen from Jewish families by the Nazis during World
War II. His reelection has been endorsed by both of New York City's
Jewish newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, D'Amato had also been attracting more support
from women than Republicans usually attract in New York, splitting
their vote with Schumer, 50-50. However, in the latest poll,
Schumer has taken a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had been doing well because he had pushed bills to spend
more money on breast-cancer research and to make HMOs pay for
reconstructive surgery after mastectomies, moves that Democrats had
criticized as election-year ploys.
</P>
<P>
   However, Zogby said, Schumer may have gained points in recent
days because of his upfront support for abortion rights, which
D'Amato opposes. New York is so overwhelmingly in favor of abortion
rights that even most Republicans here declare they are, too.

NETANYAHU POSTPONES CABINET RATIFICATION OF WYE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Under pressure from his right flank, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed ratification of the new
Israeli-Palestinian accord by his Cabinet until Palestinians show a
plan to fight terrorism to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The delay drew angry condemnations from Palestinian officials,
who accused Netanyahu of appeasing right-wing critics, who have
mounted a fierce campaign against the agreement and have vowed to
unseat the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu announced the postponement on Tuesday hours after the
Palestinian police announced that they had arrested the killers of
a Jewish settler shot near Hebron on Monday _ a swift response
widely seen as an outcome of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by Netanyahu's spokesman said that he had
decided to postpone a Cabinet meeting to ratify the agreement that
had been scheduled for Thursday. The agreement calls for a further
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in return for
specific Palestinian measures to fight violence by anti-Israeli
militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Wye summit the Palestinians committed to complete
within one week a working plan to combat terrorism, but this
evening it became clear that the plan will not be completed on
schedule,'' the statement said. ``Once the working plan is
received, the Cabinet will convene to ratify the accord.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first hitch in last week's agreement, which is to
be enacted in stages over 12 weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wye Memorandum'' signed at the White House last Friday
said that ``a working plan developed by the Palestinian side will
be shared with the U.S.'' within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   [``The agreement is due to enter into force on Nov. 2,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in
Washington. ``We expect that both parties will take the necessary
steps in a timely manner to allow them to meet their commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian security plan is not due to be submitted until
Friday and does not enter into force until next Monday, an official
said, speaking on condition that he not be identified. ``There's
plenty of time to work this out.'')
</P>
<P>
   According to David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications
director, the Israelis had learned that the working plan would not
be submitted by Friday as scheduled. A Palestinian official who
declined to be named said that Palestinian security officials were
to meet their Israeli counterparts on Wednesday to explain the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bar-Illan and Palestinian officials attributed Netanyahu's
move to the strong resistance he has encountered among his rightist
allies in the governing coalition, including some Cabinet ministers
opposed to the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to make sure these people understand that he intends to
see to it that the agreement is kept,'' Bar-Illan said. ``Otherwise
it will be difficult to sell the idea that this is a good
agreement. He has to show that he is not playing around here, that
he is going to insist on reciprocity and compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Abdel Rahman, a senior aide to Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, said: ``He has problems with his coalition.
This is for internal reasons, but he blames us as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Asfour, a member of the Palestinian team at the Wye
talks, accused Netanyahu of trying to wriggle out of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is under pressure and the settlers are against him,''
Asfour said. ``He wants to create propaganda for the settlers, and
he is looking for any excuse to escape the agreement because he
doesn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing protests against Netanyahu reached a new
crescendo on Monday night when demonstrators outside his residence
in Jerusalem chanted ``Bibi is a traitor!'' and held up posters
showing blood dripping form his handshake with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials from the president to the speaker of
Parliament condemned the demonstrations, saying they were
reminiscent of incendiary protests that preceded the assassination
of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin on Nov. 4, 1995. With security
measures around Netanyahu visibly heightened and the anniversary of
the assassination drawing near, there is growing concern in Israel
about the danger of another political killing.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was also denounced on Tuesday at the funeral of the
Danny Vargas, the settler slain near Hebron. Mourners cried out for
revenge and condemned the accord as a recipe for more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a surrender of the Land of Israel and an abandonment
of Jewish lives!,'' said Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the
Jewish settlement in Hebron. ``Bibi is abandoning Jews more and
more!''
</P>
<P>
   But as Vargas was buried, there were signs of growing
Palestinian security cooperation with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Palestinian General Intelligence announced
that two men, identified as Jamil Khalifa and Ismat Mutaweh, had
been arrested and had confessed to the killing. They also admitted
to the slaying of another Israeli at a hillside spring outside
Jerusalem on Oct. 13, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ahmad Tibi, an aide to Arafat, said that the men had denied
membership in any organization and maintained that they had acted
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the the Israeli authorities will catch up with the
murderers of Mohammed Zalmout,'' Tibi added. Zalmout, a 68-year-old
Palestinian, was found battered to death near a West Bank
settlement hours after the killing of Vargas, apparently the victim
of a revenge attack.

<P>
   As the interim director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission,
Bruce Nourse authorized the opening of the state's first casino in
1992. But a year later, as casino neon began to flicker with
opportunity all along the Gulf coast and north into the Delta
region, Nourse traded roles. Instead of continuing to police the
casino operators, he joined them, doubling his salary and becoming
a senior vice president for Casino Magic, a casino hotel owner.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of months, the government body formed to keep
Mississippi's casino industry honest was virtually wiped out.
Nourse's successor, Lorenzo Creighton, resigned to become general
manager of a riverboat casino in St. Louis. Nine of the
commission's 10 law-enforcement agents also left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who quit'' to seek jobs in the
industry, recalled Chuck Patton, the gaming commission's current
chairman. ``It was a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   As fast as the gambling business has spread across the country,
a fast-spinning revolving door has also developed, creating a world
in which a state senator with no casino experience has in an
instant become president of a major casino, a law enforcement
official from a state attorney general's office has gone on to
become chief executive officer of the nation's most profitable
casino, and where top gaming officials from one state after another
have resigned to pursue lucrative casino careers.
</P>
<P>
   From Raymond ``Skip'' Avansino Jr., the Nevada Gaming Commission
member who went on to become president and chief operating officer
of Hilton hotels and casinos, to James E. Thompson, the Illinois
governor who first signed riverboat gambling into law in his state
and then, after leaving office, became one of the industry's key
lobbyist, the officials who wrote the rules and picked the casino
operators are reaping rewards from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulated industries, like airlines or pharmaceuticals,
have for years lured government officials into their camps. But
legalized gambling has created a robust new market for politically
connected executives, lobbyists and consultants not only because it
is growing so fast, but precisely because it is one of the nation's
most highly regulated industries at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own the politicians, regulators, judges or whoever you
need to do what you need to do, you totally control your
environment,'' said Don Williams, a political strategist in Las
Vegas and a former senior executive and part owner of casinos.
``It's always best to have these people on your side, so why not
hire these people?''
</P>
<P>
   Convincing government officials to join forces with the gambling
industry is usually easy, Williams said, adding: ``They hang around
wealth, they investigate wealth, they see money being made in areas
that they never dreamed of before. And they're learning how people
made this money.''
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider looking in, he said, joining the industry is like
becoming ``a part of the king's court.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG FEAR: It's a Matter Of Objectivity
</P>
<P>
   The high crossover rate, coming as many states are writing laws
that will govern the industry for years to come, has raised
concerns about the impartiality of the people who oversee gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly raises doubts about the objectivity and the
credibility of some of those individuals,'' said Kay Coles James,
chairwoman of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the
presidential committee that is studying the effect of legalized
gambling on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is scheduled to report its findings to
Congress next summer, has not yet considered taking action to
discourage the industry's revolving door, Ms. James said. But in
forming her staff she extracted verbal commitments from those she
hired not to leave and take jobs in the gambling industry while the
commission continued its work.
</P>
<P>
   Even though states like Nevada and New Jersey have
``cooling-off'' periods that prohibit some government employees
from immediately going to work for casinos within their own
jurisdictions, other casino states, including Mississippi, have no
such waiting periods. And in those states that do have cooling-off
periods, officials regularly get around the prohibitions by working
for subsidiaries in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of revolving-door practices contend that the cooling-off
periods, which range from one to four years, are not long enough
and do not apply to enough people. Some have suggested that
regulatory positions should be filled by people who are either near
retirement or financially secure enough to avoid being induced by
high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear is that they'll be overly friendly with the
companies they're going to go work for in the future,'' said Nelson
Rose, a gambling law professor at Whittier Law School in Costa
Mesa, Calif. ``They may think deep down subconsciously that if they
make decisions against the industry they won't get hired if they
choose to leave government.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's revolving door has become so promising that Rose
said he advises his students that the best way to get ahead in the
gambling business is to first become a regulator because they
``learn the regulatory system'' and ``of course, you make
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have switched to the casino business within
months of making decisions that benefited their future employers,
no one has been able to prove a direct exchange of a job for
favorable treatment from regulators. However, critics of the
revolving door contend that there are many cases illustrating that
state regulators are too close to the industry and are particularly
lax about exacting punishment on casinos that break the rules.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although Bally Gaming several years ago entered
into a partnership in Louisiana with a company that was later found
to have ties to organized crime, officials in New Jersey and Nevada
_ where Bally is also licensed _ allowed the company to keep its
license in those places.
</P>
<P>
   And last August, Hilton Hotels Corp. entered into an agreement
with federal prosecutors to avoid an indictment on charges that
Hilton executives paid money to a public official in Kansas City,
Mo., as a reward for his support for the Flamingo Hilton casino
project in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton denies any wrongdoing. However, in its signed pact with
prosecutors, the hotel and casino company agreed to ``acknowledge
that the Unites States has evidence'' supporting the alleged scheme
to pay the Kansas City Port Authority chairman for using his
influence to assist the company's casino project. So far,
regulators in other jurisdictions where Hilton operates casinos
have not taken any action in response, and Missouri regulators
renewed Hilton's license a month after the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they call themselves heavily regulated, it's a
good-old-boys network that is taking care of gambling companies
throughout the United States,'' said Tom Grey, executive director
of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, the nation's
most active anti-gambling organization.
</P>
<P>
   THE INCENTIVES: Instant Pay Rise In Casino Work
</P>
<P>
   Those who have traded in their bureaucratic backgrounds and
joined forces with the casino business can be found all around the
country. Mick Lura, for example, the former top administrator for
Iowa's Racing and Gaming Commission, left his job in 1993 to become
an executive at president casinos, which operates riverboats in
three states, including Iowa. He later became general manager of
the Meskwaki tribal casino in Iowa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the nation's third largest gambling
jurisdiction, after Nevada and New Jersey, there was no cooling-off
period that prohibited Nourse from going to work for a casino in
the state. But he did seek an opinion from a state ethics
commission, which cleared the way for him to join Casino Magic.
</P>
<P>
   State officials later considered putting a cooling-off period
into effect, but instead have continued to consider such moves on a
case-by-case basis, which has allowed employees of the gaming
commission to continue to get instant salary increases by taking
jobs with the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved into the industry and effectively doubled my salary,''
said Nourse, who earned about $90,000 a year with the gaming
commission. Defending his decision to become a casino executive,
Nourse noted the ``huge demand by the industry'' for regulators.
``I speak the language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hannifin, a career bureaucrat who was a longtime member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board before going on to help operate
some of the industry's largest casino companies, conceded that the
gambling business has been very good to him. ``My family and I have
been well-treated from a monetary standpoint,'' said Hannifin, now
an executive vice president at Fitzgeralds, a casino company based
in Nevada. ``I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former government officials have truly hit the jackpot in
the casino industry. Avansino, for example, was a Nevada tax lawyer
and gaming commission member who was named president and chief
operating officer of Hilton Hotels in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years Avansino led the company through a
worldwide expansion of its gambling operations. His salary and
bonuses over those years totaled $2.6 million, plus generous stock
options, according to the company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning abruptly in 1996, Avansino is now chairman of a
nonprofit foundation in Nevada, teaches gaming law at the
University of San Francisco School of Law, and shuttles on a
private plane between homes in Reno and in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such financial rewards entices others. In
September the chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission,
Bradford Smith, stepped down from his $95,000-year-post, expressing
a desire to ``maximize my earning capacity,'' and candidly said he
would like to land a job in the gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by this industry,'' he said in an interview
after his final meeting as head of the commission, which governs
the state's casinos. He also noted that he was prepared to move
outside New Jersey to avoid the state's cooling-off period and
immediately go to work for the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's predecessor, Stephen Perskie, has fared well since he
resigned in 1994. Perskie was the New Jersey General Assembly
member who wrote the 1977 statue that legalized casino gambling in
Atlantic City. After serving as chief of staff to former Gov. Jim
Florio (Florio joined the board of Bally Gaming, a major
manufacturer of casino equipment, after he was defeated by Gov.
Christie Whitman in 1993), Perskie was appointed to the casino
control commission in 1990, where he served as the state's top
regulator for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned to join the riverboat casino company, Players
International, as vice president and general counsel, and was able
to circumvent the cooling-off period because, although Players
operated casinos in other parts of the country, they had none in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while at Players, Perskie's office remained in Atlantic
City. A few years later, he left the company to go into private
practice, and is now considered one of New Jersey's top gaming
lawyers. In fact, the casino business that Perskie was instrumental
in legalizing in New Jersey has been very good to the entire
Perskie family. Three Atlantic City law firms that represent
casinos bear the Perskie family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of the revolving door is a matter of legitimate
concern,'' Perskie conceded in a recent interview. But he insisted
that in the 20 years that Atlantic City has had legalized gambling,
``there has been no threat to the public confidence or the
integrity of the regulatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PIONEERS: Early Proponents Often Prosper
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many cases the same people who have been instrumental
in setting up the casino industry in their states have gotten the
biggest opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, where gaming officials often boast of having the
toughest, most restrictive cooling-off laws, Martin Greenberg, a
former state senator who helped draft the casino control law that
governs the state's casinos, resigned from his legislative post in
1979 and within days became president of the Golden Nugget despite
having no experience in casino operations. (As a result, the
cooling-off laws in New Jersey were expanded in 1981 to include
state legislators, but most other states still do not prohibit such
moves.)
</P>
<P>
   And G. Michael Brown, who as director of the state attorney
general's division of gaming enforcement, conducted background
investigations of many of Atlantic City's first casino operators,
left his job in 1982 to go into legal practice representing foreign
casino companies. He later became became chief executive officer of
the Connecticut-based Foxwoods Casino, the nation's most profitable
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cody, who as a New Jersey assemblyman in 1977 was
chairman of the legislative committee that wrote the state's casino
control act, said he has received numerous invitations to join the
industry but refused. Cody, now a state senator, said he believes
that government officials who are interested in working for the
gambling industry tend to ``become the lap dog instead of the watch
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   But for their part, many former regulators contend that the
influx of former government officials into the industry has only
helped to clean up a once-notorious business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because it brings people with honesty, ethics and
integrity into the industry,'' said Shannon Bybee, a former member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board who went on to become president
of the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City and chairman and chief
executive officer of the Claridge casino. But Bybee, now a gaming
professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, conceded that
the revolving door ``can be bad if it's abused and people use their
positions to get around doing things, or do things because of
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BLURRED LINES: When Regulators Relax the Rules
</P>
<P>
   Others, including former regulators, say the revolving door has
created an incestuous culture in which the lines separating
gambling and the people responsible for overseeing it are often
blurred, or even nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Waters, a former casino control commission member in New
Jersey, said he found that his colleagues were sometimes swayed by
their personal job interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these folks, as their terms come to an end, start
finding ways to agree with the industry,'' he said. ``They start
trying to pave a way to endear themselves with the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who retired in 1991 after five years on the commission,
said he never sought a casino job. But he added, ``If I had wanted
to, all I had to do was cozy up to them.''

<P>
   Not surprisingly, gambling's courtship of regulators began in
Las Vegas, where former officials have long cashed in on ties to
gambling. Today, in many of the 26 casino gambling jurisdictions
around the country, some of the most powerful gaming lawyers and
executives are people who started as regulators in Nevada, where
cooling-off laws did not exist until 1987 and are still less
restrictive than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Schreck, for example, left the Nevada Gaming Commission in
1975 and immediately began building his law practice by providing
counsel to gaming clients. ``At that time, the only real way to
learn gaming law was to learn it on the governmental side,''
Schreck said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is one of the most prominent and influential gaming
lawyers in the country, known especially for his high rate of
success when representing clients appearing before Nevada's gaming
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the casino industry's consumption of government
officials is attributed to its rapid growth and resulting job
opportunities. Since 1990, casino revenue has more than doubled, to
$20.5 billion annually, and the industry now accounts for an
estimated $7.3 billion in wages, according to the American Gaming
Association, the industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And as the casino industry has grown, so has the need for
consultants, lobbyists and executives with regulatory experience
who can obtain and maintain the government licenses that allow
casinos to operate and proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   THE LUSH LIFE: From Prosecutor To Casino Boss
</P>
<P>
   Of all the many former government and law-enforcement officials
who have chosen to stake their futures on the casino industry,
probably none has evolved so completely as that of James Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Ritchie was a federal prosecutor earning
less than $35,000 a year. He worked on the West Coast and,
according to former colleagues, his investigations included the
gambling business in Nevada, where organized crime was still deeply
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1973, Ritchie left the Justice Department to become
executive director of the Congressional Commission on the Review of
the National Policy Toward Gambling, which was organized to help
establish guidelines on legalized gambling. But when the commission
issued its report in 1976, Ritchie's former colleagues at the
department lashed out at him for being too partial to the casino
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several strong differences of opinion,'' recalled
William Lynch, who, as head of the organized crime and racketeering
section, had been Ritchie's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission was very influenced by, or in agreement with,
the gambling industry,'' Lynch added. ``Basically, the whole thrust
of the commission as it developed became pretty clear. They were in
the `let's repeal all laws against gambling' attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade or more, as state laws were changed and
casinos began to open around the country, Ritchie worked as the
industry's top lobbyist in Washington. In those years, said
associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Ritchie owned
his own boat and had a lavishly appointed Capitol Hill office
decorated with expensive artifacts that underscored the lush life
the gambling business had afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on his cellular phone recently, Ritchie, 62, refused to
discuss why he switched jobs or how his life has changed since he
traded in his federal credentials for a career in the casino
industry.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying for the industry, Ritchie moved to Las Vegas,
where in 1990 he became executive vice president of development at
Mirage Casinos, helping to analyze new casino development
opportunities. After four years in that job he left the company,
taking more than $6 million in stock options on his way out,
according to Mirage records.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ritchie's evolution was nearly complete. At that
time he went before Nevada regulators seeking a license to own 12.3
percent of the CasaBlanca Resort, a privately held casino and
700-room hotel with a luxury spa and championship golf course, 80
miles north of Las Vegas in Mesquite, Nev. The former prosecutor of
organized crime, which once controlled the casino business, was
about to become a casino operator himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clean background Ritchie had when he joined the
casino industry, his years in gambling have led to relationships
and business associations that have brought him scrutiny. At the
hearings in August, Nevada regulators questioned Ritchie about some
of his past business relationships, specifically about what one
gaming commission member called ``questionable associations'' with
two men.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, whom Ritchie had lent $400,000 in 1994 for a
casino investment, was said by regulators to have a history of
problems and allegations of impropriety in the gambling industry.
Ritchie, according to his testimony, said he was unaware of the
full nature of the man's past problems when he gave him the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who had been a partner of Ritchie's earlier this
year in a plan to buy the Desert Inn casino in Las Vegas was
described by regulators as a ``flim-flam man'' and ``the world's
biggest flake.'' Ritchie testified that he now recognized that he
was ``used'' by the partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer in government,'' told the regulators. ``I no
longer have access to law-enforcement records. I'm sitting in my
kitchen with a fax machine and a telephone and enough of a bankroll
to try to become involved in some of these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their misgivings, both the state gaming board and the
state gaming commission voted unanimously to give Ritchie a
two-year license as co-owner of the CasaBlanca casino and hotel.

SCHROEDER OFFICIALLY TAKES OVER AS GERMAN CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, became
Germany's seventh postwar chancellor Tuesday, the first member of
his party to lead the country since unification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional session, Parliament voted 351-287 to elect
Schroeder, a pragmatist who has risen to power without revealing
his political convictions with any great precision. There were 27
abstentions, one invalid vote, and three absent deputies in the
669-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who has governed for 16
years, immediately rose from his chair and shook Schroeder's hand.
Several members of the environmentalist Green Party, which is
joining the government for the first time, embraced the new
chancellor, who is generally big on bear hugs and low on formality.
</P>
<P>
   The official transition from the father of German unification to
the first representative of a postwar generation to hold power came
exactly one month after Schroeder swept to victory in an election
that showed a strong desire for change in Europe's most powerful
state.
</P>
<P>
   But the exact direction in which Schroeder, 54, will lead his
untried coalition with the Greens remains uncertain, clouded by
apparent differences over economic policy between the chancellor
and his forceful finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who also holds
the pivotal post of Social Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the meaning of ``social democracy'' in a
Germany racked by 10 percent unemployment remains deeply uncertain
even as Schroeder assumes the august mantle of the two postwar
Social Democratic chancellors _ Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt stands for Ostpolitik _ the fruitful opening to the
communist east _ in the German memory, and Schmidt for a resolute
style of government that consolidated Germany's position as a
Western industrial power. But as the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel
asked Tuesday, ``What will Gerhard Schroeder stand for one day?''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Lafontaine, seated next to each other, embraced
warmly _ almost demonstratively _ after the vote, in which
Schroeder gained 6 more ballots than the combined 345 seats that
the Social Democrats and Greens hold.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not sunshine between the two men. ``There is a very
real tension there,'' said Lutz Erbring, a political scientist.
``They both know that the tension has to be kept under wraps to
avoid a disaster, and they may succeed in doing that, but it
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's push to close tax loopholes for big corporations,
his suggestions that the fight against unemployment may be as
important as that against inflation, his invective against the
``casino'' of international finance, and his determination to close
the gap between rich and poor have already angered the very
businessmen whom Schroeder sought to cultivate with his slogan of
the New Middle.
</P>
<P>
   The new chancellor, who sat on the board of Volkswagen in his
former post as premier of the state of Lower Saxony and sought
during the election campaign to portray himself as friendly to
business, has played down insistent talk of differences, but the
German press has delighted in calling Lafontaine ``the red shadow''
of Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the talk of pragmatism, we are astonished and
disillusioned by the government program, which will not help
competitiveness or job creation,'' said Guenter Albrecht, the chief
economist for the Association of German Industry. ``Industry is
very angry, after believing that its tax burden would be
substantially cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new government has proposed some corporate tax cuts
by the year 2002, most of the planned reduction will come at the
end of that period while the immediate closing of loopholes will
increase the tax burden on major companies in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, however, that, in Germany as in many western
countries, the rich have generally been getting richer in recent
years and the poor poorer, and Lafontaine knows that he is tapping
into a potentially vast pool of support with his talk of growing
social injustice.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both Schroeder and Lafontaine will depend on
cooperation from industry in perhaps their most critical struggle _
an attempt to create jobs for the more than 4 million unemployed in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They have proposed an Alliance for Jobs under which employers
and trade unions would agree on new means to fight unemployment,
including innovative forms of part-time work. But some industry
leaders have expressed skepticism over these plans in the light of
Schroeder's program.
</P>
<P>
   The new chancellor has, however, already shown that he can sway
his partners to discard ideological principle for practical
measures. His foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, a Green, approved
the potential use of NATO force in Kosovo earlier this month,
despite grave misgivings in his party over the legality of the
measure and despite the fact that a strong pacifist current still
exists among his colleagues.

CHINA TIGHTENS CURBS ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Only weeks after signing a global covenant calling for
freedom of speech and assembly, China has taken new steps to
suppress political organizations and debate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, government agents closed a recently formed independent
think tank in Beijing that sponsored research and unusual, open
seminars on democracy and current affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Government censors have also barred the further distribution of
a path-breaking book of essays on political change, people with
ties to the book said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the last three days, the police have questioned or
detained more than 20 democracy advocates who had planned a show of
support for a colleague who is being evicted from his home and
whose wife was forced out of her teaching job after he applied to
register a new political party.
</P>
<P>
   These measures seem part of a pattern in recent months. Over
all, the climate for open discussion is somewhat looser than it was
over the previous nine years, since the violent crackdown on
demonstrators in 1989. But security agents have not hesitated to
harass or detain people who try to form independent organizations
or who publicly question the primacy of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The think tank that was closed Monday, the China Development
Union, was started this year by a 42 year-old former official and
businessman, Peng Ming. It has sponsored research and frequent
public seminars, attended by a few dozen people, on topics ranging
from democratic theory to environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Peng started enlisting intellectuals and others as
members; he recently asserted that several thousand people had
joined and that he hoped to sign up millions in a movement to push
for new ideas and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Peng's ideas are somewhat eclectic and he has had few
associations with the better known, and often more radical,
dissidents here. But he has walked a risky legal line. In an effort
to bypass the general rule that all groups must have government
sponsors, he had registered the China Development Union in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, agents who said they were from the Beijing Bureau of
Civil Affairs entered the union offices, held Peng and eight others
for three hours of questioning, said the group was operating
illegally and took away the office computer and other documents.
According to Peng, they also searched the home of a U.S. citizen
and businesswoman who is a union board member, Qiao Zhihui (known
as Wisdom Qiao) and took away her computer and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Peng said that while he believed the
closure was illegal, he would comply with the orders to cease the
union. But he vowed to continue the activities of a separate
affiliated entity, the China Development New Strategy Research
Institute, including its research and public forums. ``They didn't
say that was illegal,'' Peng said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the tactic will work is unclear since Oct. 13 the
research institute's sponsoring government agency severed its ties.
The institute also remains registered in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In another crackdown, over the last three days the police
temporarily detained several democracy advocates around the country
who planned to travel to Shandong Province, on the east coast, in
support of a destitute colleague. Many more were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents had announced plans to travel to Dongping city in
Shandong where Xie Wanjun has been punished for trying to register
a new opposition party, which has been declared illegal. Xie faces
eviction from his home on Sunday and his wife has lost her teaching
job, dissidents said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those detained was one of the best-known dissidents still
in China, Xu Wenli, a veteran of the Democracy Wall movement of the
1970s who has been repeatedly detained for short periods over the
last six months, and his computers and fax machines repeatedly
confiscated. He was held Monday for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have repeatedly made it clear to Chinese authorities that
the recent detention of political activists is a step in the wrong
direction,'' the U.S. State Department said Tuesday in Washington.
``Although the Chinese authorities have demonstrated a greater
degree of tolerance toward political debate over the past year,
these detentions and others that have occurred in recent months
demonstrate that sharp limits on what is permissible continue to
exist and that organized opposition to the Communist Party will not
be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, China held its own international conference on human
rights, where officials boasted that the Chinese view of human
rights as a relative concept, adapted to national traditions and
needs, was gaining international acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month China signed the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. But, like any country, it has the
right, whenever it eventually ratifies the treaty, to override any
clauses it deems to contradict Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   The book government censors have suppressed is ``Political
China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New Structure.'' Published in
August by China Today Publishing House, it brought together 39
recently published essays on political change and democratic
thought by 32 scholars, journalists and former government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hardly radical _ the book avoids any discussion of
multi-party politics or calls for electing senior officials _ it
reflects the impatient ferment among liberal intellectuals who are
questioning the ossified, corruption-riddled system of Communist
rule. It was edited by two journalists with official newspapers,
Dong Yuyu of The Guangming Daily and Shi Binghai of The China
Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
   Shi was arrested Sept. 5 and is still in detention. Associates
said they did not believe his involvement with the book was the
reason, but rather some other activity _ possibly contacts with the
former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who has been under house
arrest in Beijing since he was ousted in 1989 for being too soft on
the student demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The first edition of ``Political China'' ran to 30,000 copies,
most of which have already been sold. With more orders pouring in
from bookstores around the country, the publisher printed an
additional 30,000 copies. But early this month it was ordered not
to distribute them by the Administration of Press and Publications,
according to people with ties to the book.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, at a meeting of publishing houses, a top
official of that government agency had criticized the book, saying
some of its essays had ``serious problems,'' the people said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1)  
 (af)  
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early fall of 1962, a group of New York theater artists
ventured down to Philadelphia to try out a new musical comedy,
``Little Me,'' based on a racy novel by Patrick Dennis. In terms of
comedy and drama, they found, offstage events sometimes rivaled
those in the show: a bathroom sink untimely ripped from a wall, a
police officer commandeered to arrest the creative team, and a
world teetering on the brink of nuclear annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very scary time,'' recalled the playwright Neil
Simon, who wrote the show's book and at 34 was fresh from his first
Broadway success, ``Come Blow Your Horn.'' ``It was during the
Cuban missile crisis, and it really looked like the world might
end. My wife, Joan, was at home in New York with our daughter,
Ellen, and Joan called me almost in tears, saying, `You've got to
come home, because if we're going to die I want all of us to die
together.' I was prepared to leave if it looked like it was really
getting bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the group included the producers Cy Feuer and Ernest
Martin, among whose credits were ``Guys and Dolls'' and ``How to
Succeed in Business Without Really Trying''; Sid Caesar, the hugely
talented and equally troubled television star of ``Your Show of
Shows'' and ``Caesar's Hour''; Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, the
composer-lyricist songwriting team that had recently collaborated
on ``Wildcat,'' their first Broadway show together; and Bob Fosse,
who was co-directing with Feuer and had already won Tony Awards for
choreographing ``The Pajama Game,'' ``Damn Yankees'' and
``Redhead.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Caesar, Coleman, Feuer and Simon _ who has
written about the show in his 1996 memoir, ``Rewrites'' _
remembered the days they spent together 36 years ago in a Manhattan
rehearsal hall, at the Erlanger Theater in Philadelphia and at the
Lunt-Fontanne on Broadway. (Ms. Leigh died in 1983, Fosse in 1987
and Martin in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   A revival of the musical, starring Martin Short and Faith
Prince, presented by the Roundabout Theater Company, is opening on
Nov. 12 at the Criterion Center Stage Right.
</P>
<P>
   It was Simon who gave the show its essential form, and its star.
``The book was about a woman,'' Feuer said. ``But it was Neil's
idea to make it about a man.'' The woman is Belle Schlumpfert
(played by Virginia Martin in the 1962 show), a generously endowed
innocent from the wrong side of the tracks who becomes rich and
socially acceptable through her relationships with seven very
different men _ beginning in 1900 with Noble Eggleston, the richest
and handsomest boy in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil said, `Why not have one actor play all seven men?' ''
Feuer said. ``And as a result the star became a man.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Simon was concerned, that star could be only one
person _ Sid Caesar. ``I had written for him for four years on
television,'' Simon said, ``and his comedy seemed ideal for the
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Caesar had been on Broadway before, in a revue called ``Make
Mine Manhattan'' in 1948, but he soon found that doing seven roles
in one show was very different. ``I did all eight shows a week,''
Caesar said. ``It's not like today, when some actors do six shows
and skip the matinees. I had 36 costume changes, so in a matinee
and evening there were 72 changes. Some were so quick I went
offstage and it felt like I was meeting myself coming on.'' (A
Broadway revival in 1982, in which James Coco and Victor Garber
divided Caesar's roles, flopped.)
</P>
<P>
   The costume changes may have been difficult, but memorizing the
lines precisely was at first equally troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``On television, Sid would paraphrase and it was fine,'' Simon
said. ``Because whatever he paraphrased was just as funny as what
we wrote. But in the theater you can't paraphrase. You have to say
it directly, because the other actor has to know what his cue is.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said that when he told Caesar he had to say every line,
``Sid was horrified. He found it very difficult not to just give
vent to his natural comedic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   One night, that sense failed him. ``Sid was playing Noble
Eggleston,'' Simon said. ``Things haven't worked out for Belle and
him, and after a long time they meet again but they're married to
other people. She says, `Oh, Noble, isn't there some way we can go
on seeing each other?' And he says, `What do you want to do? Check
into cheap hotels? Sneak around back alleys, lying to our family
and friends?' And she says, `Of course not.' And he says, `Well, it
was just a suggestion.' Every night there was a huge, huge laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   But at one performance, Caesar paraphrased. ``Sid said, `Well,
it was just a situation,''' Simon said. ``There was no laugh. I
went backstage, and Sid asked why he didn't get a laugh on the
line. I said, `Because you said situation, not suggestion.' And he
said, `What's the difference?' Knowing Sid, I knew it was time to
leave, and I said good night. And the next day Sid realized what he
had done.''
</P>
<P>
   But once, when Simon was in the dressing room with Caesar, Feuer
came in and didn't know when to say good night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sid didn't take direction very readily,'' Simon said. ``In the
theater, you have notes _ and you give the notes. With Sid, you
have to give the notes very carefully, because Sid could be a
sleeping giant. Cy said to him one night, `It was a very good show
tonight, Sid, but I thought it was a little slow.' And Sid said,
`Slow?' I could see from the look on his face that he didn't take
kindly to it. `Well,' he said, `I can make it faster. You want to
do the 12-minute version tomorrow night? Or you could do a faster
version where the audience just buys the tickets and goes right
home. Would that be faster?' Cy knew he had stumbled into something
and left. But Sid went back to his hotel room with his manager, and
he was still mumbling about it. He was very angry. He went to the
bathroom, put his hands on the sink and pulled it out of the wall.
And he said to his manager, `(italics)Now(end italics) is it fast
enough?'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the incident recently, Caesar still seemed bothered by
it. ``I was trying to find the rhythms for the show,'' he said.
``Cy Feuer asked if it could move a little faster. But rehearsing a
show and performing it in front of an audience are two different
things. Things that go well in rehearsal don't always work onstage.
And to be concerned about fine details, like it wasn't up to tempo,
at such an early stage was at the very least distracting. I hadn't
worked it out yet. That's what out of town is for. I didn't realize
it, but I was furious. Everybody wants things fixed immediately,
and timing is something you can't fix immediately. Timing is trial
and error. So I got mad. And I think I cut my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years _ in fact for 20 years _ Caesar had a severe
drinking problem. The drinking would be done after a performance.
``Doing `Your Show of Shows,' an hour and a half, live every week,
39 weeks a year, with no laugh track, no Teleprompters, you've got
to know it,'' Caesar said. ``And it was kind of hard to go to
sleep. You're always thinking, maybe I'll do it this way, maybe
I'll do it that way. If I got drunk I could sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tense moment out of town, involving the kind of
desperate seriousness that can occur around opening a show and that
seems funny only later, came when Ms. Leigh, the lyricist, abruptly
brought a police officer into the theater.
</P>
<P>
   A song-and-dance number staged by Fosse about the women sent to
entertain the troops in World War I wasn't working. ``The audience
just didn't care for it,'' Simon said. ``We gave it three nights.
Fosse said there was nothing else he could do, and I knew that when
Bob said he couldn't fix something it was unfixable. So Cy Feuer
said, `We're cutting that number tonight.' Cy Coleman took it well,
but Carolyn didn't want anyone to cut her song and started blaming
Fosse for not choreographing it right. But the number came out, and
as the show started, she came in with a policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leigh had run ``three long, dark, dreary and quite dangerous
blocks to city hall and got a traffic cop,'' Coleman said. ``When
she came in with him, she wanted Feuer and Martin arrested, and
Fosse arrested, and Neil Simon arrested. I think she still had some
need for me so I guess I was on probation.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the police officer that they were ``violating her
rights under the Dramatists Guild agreement,'' Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the policeman says, `Why is it I'm arresting them?' ''
Simon recalled. ``And she said, `Because they cut my number out of
the show.' The officer didn't quite know what to do, so he asked if
he could watch the show. Afterward, he came over to us and said,
`Looks pretty good to me.' And he left. And that was the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the tears and laughter of trying out a Broadway musical
there is always the same nagging question: Will it work in New
York? With ``Little Me,'' the creators were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Cy Feuer walking down the street with me,'' Simon
said, ``and saying, `I don't know if we have an enormous hit or an
enormous flop.' He said it could go either way. You just couldn't
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, Nov. 17, 1962, the critics also gave mixed
notices, though almost all praised Caesar. Time magazine called
``Little Me'' ``rampagingly funny.'' John Chapman of The Daily News
wrote that it was ``inventive, funny, attractive and expertly
staged'' but that it had ``little of any sentimental worth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Howard Taubman in The New York Times, while remarking that
the musical ``gleams with show-business savvy,'' said that in the
end it was a ``flimsy contrivance'' that ``plods as much as it
romps.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, however, seemed to enjoy it, and the show was
nominated for 10 Tony Awards. But it was the year of ``A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' and ``Little Me'' wound
up winning just one Tony _ for Fosse's choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The show also fell victim to a 114-day newspaper strike that
began three weeks after opening night. ``It's hard to function
without advertising and without publicity,'' Caesar said. ``We
carried on for almost a year, but the strike really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there were 257 performances of ``Little Me,'' a
respectable run in those days, but also a disappointing one. ``Some
of the critics were baffled by it,'' Simon remembered. ``It was an
out and out comedy _ with a score. We broke the mold and did
something daring.''

COLLEGES UNITE TO DEFEND THEIR PRICE TAGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   With institutions of higher education fighting an image as
elitist money-vacuums, a coalition of 1,200 of them announced a
national campaign Tuesday to convince the public that college isn't
really that expensive, after all.
</P>
<P>
   That pitch may come as a shock to already sticker-shocked
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``College is Possible'' campaign argues that parents and
students overestimate the cost of college by 200 percent, and
underestimate how much money they can get to help defray that cost
_ in too many cases, deciding to forgo a college education.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also plays defense for the schools, pointing to the
``complexities'' of college costs _ in short, arguing that colleges
aren't as greedy as some might say. In fact, the colleges say, it
costs them more than the money they get in tuition to educate
students, especially as applicants demand constant improvements in
computers, dormitories, and athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tuition increases of the '80s and '90s were very
frightening to people, including the colleges,'' said Stanley
Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, the
organizer of the campaign and the umbrella group for the nation's
public and private colleges and universities. ``There is public
anxiety out there that is still a hangover from that, and worse,
there is confusion about what can be done. There is a real
knowledge gap, even among upper-income families.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes just as colleges are looking for a little
good publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the higher education world has been criticized
twice with national reports showing the cost of tuition climbing at
twice the rate of inflation. A Carnegie Commission report last year
accused the top research universities of spending too little time
on undergraduate education, leaving students to learn from ``badly
trained or even untrained'' teaching assistants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In response, Princeton, followed by Yale, Harvard, and last
week Dartmouth, announced small _ but strongly symbolic _ boosts in
financial aid. Cornell University on Friday announced a $400
million, 10-year plan to improve undergraduate education and boost
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They're getting hit from a number of directions,'' said
Harvey Blustain, who has a PhD from Yale and is now head of
higher-education consulting practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
``There is definitely increased nervousness about their image. And
they have reason to be. As a parent looking at two kids, and as
someone who went to private schools for undergraduate and graduate
education, the University of Massachusetts is looking pretty good
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But after two decades of steep increases, and news about highly
paid celebrity professors, the campaign may have a tough time
persuading the public.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``When the price tag is over $30,000 in many schools and
pushing it in many others, it's going to be pretty hard to convince
people that it's inexpensive,'' said Allan Sutfin, a guidance
counselor at Brookline High School for 28 years. ``It's pretty hard
to sugar-coat $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The colleges, though, point out that while schools like Harvard
and Brown cost in the $30,000 range, 75 percent of students go to
colleges that charge less than $8,000 a year for tuition and fees.
That latter figure, however, doesn't include room and board, which
lifts the cost this year to an average of $10,458 at a public
four-year college and $22,533 at a four-year private school.
</P>
<P>
   After the steep increases in the late '80s and early '90s,
tuitions and fees increased by only 4 to 5 percent over the last
few years _ although that is twice the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And even at the higher-priced institutions, many students end up
paying below the sticker price, with schools and the federal
government paying out $60 billion in grants and loans to students
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schools also like to point out the value of investing in
college. College graduates, according to the College Board, earn on
average $1 million more over a lifetime than people who have only a
high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The council started the campaign after doing a survey released
in May that showed a wide gap between what college costs and what
the public thinks college costs. Seven in 10 students are eligible
for financial aid, according to the council, with the average
student at a private college receiving $9,000 in loans or grants.
</P>
<P>
   But in focus groups, families who would easily qualify for aid
said they could not afford college. The perception was especially
strong among minorities, low-income families, and students whose
parents did not attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some students who go to school in the Midwest and get some
financial aid, the cost is virtually nil,'' Ikenberry said. ``For a
student who goes to a highly selective school in the Northeast,
it's likely to be a different story. But our goal is to help
families become more informed consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Boettcher, director of guidance and testing for the public
schools in Watertown, Mass., said she welcomed the message. ``Is it
a lot of money? Sure,'' she said. ``But the statistics show college
is a good investment in the long run. When you think of the cost
over your lifetime, it's shortsighted not to get your education
because you think it will cost too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hits people, even those with substantial means,'' Sutfin
said. ``I tell my students, `Don't let that price tag scare you
away from your dreams.' Some of them don't listen to me. They think
college is only for students who live in a home where there's a lot
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the campaign was akin to ``pushing a boulder
up a hill,'' Ikenberry said campaign, including the television and
newspaper ads, will run through 2000: ``It's not likely that this
is going to turn around quickly.''

A PERENNIAL REGIONAL HIT STEPS UP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, name the most often performed full-length American opera.
It's not ``Porgy and Bess,'' which was banished from the opera
house for decades and branded a highbrow musical. It's not ``West
Side Story,'' which was intended for Broadway despite the fact that
Bernstein, late in life, gave it some operatic trappings.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not ``Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' which, since it
was commissioned by a television network, could not run longer than
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Susannah,'' with music and libretto by Carlisle Floyd, a
native of South Carolina. The work received its premiere in 1955,
when Floyd was 28, and immediately leapt to national renown.
Regional companies and university opera studios have made it a
repertory staple. It has had more than 230 productions and 750
performances, and despite changing fashion, it has never
disappeared from the American stage.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, stages on which it never appeared in the
first place. Although it was given its first professional
production by the New York City Opera, ``Susannah'' has been
mysteriously absent from America's biggest houses. And although
Floyd went on to compose eight more operas, his name is rarely
mentioned by the major companies, except with condescension.
</P>
<P>
   So new productions in New York this season of not only
``Susannah'' but also ``Of Mice and Men,'' Floyd's 1969 adaptation
of the Steinbeck novel, are major events. ``Of Mice and Men'' opens
on Saturday evening at the City Opera, which has long championed
Floyd's work. And next March, ``Susannah'' finally makes its debut
at the Metropolitan Opera, 44 years after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   Why should ``Susannah,'' so beloved by a large and diverse
public, suffer such neglect from the major houses? And how did
Floyd, now 71, get pushed to the margins, where he remains a
shadowy presence?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Southerner, he's never been part of the compositional
circles, which are largely in the Northeast and the West,'' said
the soprano Phyllis Curtin, who created the role of Susannah. ``He
was not going the 12-tone way, so he was not part of academic
circles. He seemed out of the Romantic era, a bit passe and naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the Northeast there is still this idea that a Southern
accent means someone is a little bit slow,'' added Ms. Curtin,
herself from West Virginia. ``You know: `He's a Southern boy, so
Susannah must be a one-shot thing, and probably he can only write
little folk operas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Julius Rudel, who directed the New York City Opera from 1957 to
1979, revived ``Susannah'' three times and introduced two other
operas by Floyd, although not ``Of Mice and Men.'' ``There was
disdain not only for the musical style of `Susannah' but for the
rural Southern setting,'' Rudel said. ``Who writes an opera about
an itinerant preacher and a bunch of hillbillies?''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd seems to have survived decades of neglect with relative
equanimity. ``It's irksome not to be considered part of an
intellectual elite simply because of the style of your work,'' he
said recently from his home in Houston. ``It has to do with the
Northeastern academic establishment's attitude toward the South. In
New York, I'm simply outside the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   At mention of the Met debut of ``Susannah,'' Floyd turned
wistful. ``To be quite honest,'' he said, ``I never expected to see
it in my lifetime.'' Yet he harbors no illusions as to why it is
occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to think that the Met is conferring repertory
status on it,'' Floyd said. ``That would at least take it out of
the novelty category. I hope it's an acknowledgment of the work's
longevity and effectiveness as a piece of theater. But the big
houses are performer-oriented, not work-oriented, and I'm sure the
fact that Renee Fleming and Samuel Ramey and Jerry Hadley wanted to
do it played a very large part in the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Met's press office seems to confirm Floyd's
suspicions: ``We always talk to singers about repertory, and both
Sam Ramey and Renee Fleming brought us the idea that we should do
`Susannah,' and we agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   In its subject and tone, ``Susannah'' deliberately broke new
ground. Set in an isolated village in the hills of Tennessee, it
offers an unflinching portrayal of a wandering preacher and the
fanatical mob he incites. Although it takes place in the early 20th
century, its harsh attack on fundamentalist hypocrisy seems
surprisingly timely.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's libretto, based on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and
the elders, strips it of all but the essentials. The townsfolk have
always considered the beautiful young Susannah an outsider. When
she is glimpsed bathing in a stream, her nakedness is taken as a
sign of promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   A visiting preacher, Olin Blitch, inflames the passions of the
faithful. At a revival meeting, Susannah is publicly accused. But
Blitch turns out to be the sinner, raping Susannah only to discover
that she is still a virgin. As a mob descends on Susannah's
farmhouse, her brother shoots Blitch. Susannah remains defiant to
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, whose father was a minister, was born in Latta, S.C., in
1926, and grew up in a succession of South Carolina towns, where
revival meetings were common. The experience of small-town bigotry
seems to have shaped his life and art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that horrified me already as a child about revival
meetings was mass coercion, people being forced to conform to
something against their will without even knowing what they were
being asked to confess or receive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially important to him that Susannah end the opera
in triumph, he added. ``Opera had for so long been about pathetic
heroines, heroines as victims, that not everyone was quite ready
for a woman this strong.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Let alone a woman who, though still a virgin, is unashamed of
her sexuality. `` `Susannah' has a central theme,'' said Ms.
Curtin, ``and it's something that's right in front of us today, the
fear and fascination and punishment of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1953, Susannah was also a veiled commentary on the
McCarthy era. ``The whole atmosphere of `Susannah,' '' Floyd said,
``is not far from the idea of McCarthyism, that accusation is
tantamount to guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Floyd identifies with Susannah, just as he identifies
with the protagonists of ``Of Mice and Men,'' the migrant farm
workers George and Lenny. All are outsiders who have been
ostracized by the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw myself in that role in relation to the academic
new-music world,'' Floyd said. ``I may not have been the outcast,
but I certainly was the misfit. I wrote music that had strong
emotional content and that said something to an audience. And I
realized that what I did was going against the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Floyd understates the conflict. During the 1950s,
Serialism was rising toward academic dominance, and Coplandesque
Americana was falling into disgrace. Floyd had the temerity to
write an opera that was unashamedly tonal, frank in its use of folk
material, soaring in its lyricism and direct in its expression.
</P>
<P>
   Even Floyd's detractors acknowledge that he has an uncanny
theatrical command. His skill as a dramatist was honed by years of
attending plays and movies, not by listening to operas.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a country that's been born and bred on realism, in
plays and films and on TV,'' Floyd said. ``That has been the
hallmark of American theater from the beginning of the 20th
century. In the opera world we assume the drama will be slow,
arbitrary and artificial in its pacing. My heritage is in the
theater, and I wanted to transfer the tradition of American realism
to the opera house.''
</P>
<P>
   So it wouldn't bother Floyd if, on first hearing, ``Of Mice and
Men'' impressed more as drama than as music. ``If I can sit back
and subtly evaluate the score of a new opera, then I didn't spend a
very absorbing evening in the theater,'' he said. ``I'm not
insulted if people who see `Of Mice and Men' get caught up in the
drama. The music is still there, and it's working on you
subliminally whether you're aware of it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Mice and Men,'' Steinbeck's gritty portrayal of migrant
workers in the dust bowl of the 1930s, is so lean that it might
already seem the ideal opera text. But this libretto, Floyd
reports, turned out to be the most difficult project of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the fatal mistake of thinking that Steinbeck had done
my work for me,'' he said. ``So I never did the first and most
important task, the basic compression. I had to start it all over
and trim and trim, always asking myself, `What is this story really
about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Mice and Men'' was to have received its premiere at the
City Opera in 1970. But Rudel canceled the performances after
hearing a piano reduction of an early version. ``I had planned to
do it, and then we came to the conclusion that it wasn't going in
quite the right direction.'' Rudel said. ``It was a disappointment
for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd found the cancellation, coming from an ardent supporter,
devastating. ``I felt like the opera was getting an advance black
eye before it had even been heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inherently a grim, brutal and pessimistic tale, ``Of Mice and
Men'' will never hold the appeal of ``Susannah.'' Its score is more
dissonant and less lyrical; its sonorities are strident, bathing
the libretto in a harsh, cold light.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when the music seems to pale alongside the vivid
narrative. But at its best, ``Of Mice and Men'' provides a riveting
theatrical realism rarely encountered in the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Some think that ``Of Mice and Men'' may be Floyd's greatest
work, and he does not disagree. ``It's as perfectly wrought as I
can make it,'' he said, ``and as fine an opera as I've written in
terms of realizing both musical and dramatic goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But others wonder whether Floyd's career started at a peak it
has never regained. `` `Susannah' stands by itself,'' Rudel said.
``It's like a throw of genius, a young man's first explosion. I
hate to make value judgments. Is `Rigoletto' better than
`Traviata'? But in a sense, the large public has spoken in favor of
`Susannah,' and the paying customer tells you what to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Floyd's career could hardly be judged a failure,
precisely because it begins with ``Susannah,'' perhaps the most
dramatically viable opera ever written by an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come up in a lifetime with just one `Susannah,' '' said
Ms. Curtin, ``that's already a pretty remarkable thing.''

   A sweetly knowing look crosses the face of the lovely young
Miranda. ``You must learn to love someone else apart from me,
Sara,'' she says to a schoolmate. ``I won't be here much longer.''
It never becomes clear how Miranda knows that, but in Peter Weir's
``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' as mysterious as ever in two new video
editions, just about everything keeps us guessing.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that the year is 1900, that the location is
central Australia and that by sundown on Saint Valentine's Day,
Miranda (Anne Lambert) and two other students at the brutally
proper Appleyard College for young women will have drifted away
during a picnic as if hypnotized, disappearing among the crags of
the 500-foot-high volcanic formation called Hanging Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Later, one of the girls, Irma (Karen Robson), is found
unconscious on the ground, but she remembers nothing about what
happened. So there the case stands for the harried constable,
Sergeant Bumpher (Wyn Roberts), his bloodhounds and his Aborigine
tracker in a red jacket and three-cornered hat: three dewy young
women, almost vaporous to begin with in the throes of awakening
desires, suddenly vanished without leaving a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Having gotten into a tantalizing situation, Weir's film takes an
unusual route out of it. This is a film, it can be safely said,
that defies convention. Released in 1975, it earned an
international reputation as an early example of the emerging
Australian school of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Financial complications kept it out of circulation for the last
15 years, but this summer it had a theatrical revival, and last
week it was reissued on a new videotape from Home Vision and in a
stunning digital video disk edition, recut by Weir, from the
Criterion Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting shifting vision and intent, Weir's themes have ranged
from the metaphysical in ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' and the ``The
Last Wave'' (1977) to political strife in ``Gallipoli'' (1981) and
``The Year of Living Dangerously'' (1983). Later came Hollywood
productions: ``Witness'' (1985) and ``The Mosquito Coast'' (1986),
both starring Harrison Ford; ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989), for
which he won an Oscar nomination, and, most recently, ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early work, mystical forces of irrationality have their
way with a prosaic world. ``I understand what interested me as a
young man,'' Weir, 54, said on the telephone from Sydney, ``but I
left that field of storytelling after `The Last Wave' because it
was a cul-de-sac and didn't lead to larger areas.'' Nevertheless,
the metaphysical has its pull. ``As hard as I've tried, I've failed
to become a materialist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By re-editing ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' he revisits, as he put
it, ``unmeasured forces that lead you into religious speculation.''
Not everything comes clear in such circumstances, or needs to. The
departure for the film, and a risky one for a mystery that begs for
a solution, lies in an enigma that is never resolved.
</P>
<P>
   As the young women in long white dresses climb the forbidden
rock in the stifling heat, they shed their shoes and socks, a
startling act in that time. A low, chilling moan comes from the
rock. The girls crumple in a swoon, and when they awake they are
possessed, compelled upward by _ what? _ some kind of force.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly they are being carried off. One girl, though, is
unaffected. She screams in terror and races down to get help. ``The
genre really was a kind of whodunit,'' Weir said. But who did what?
Well, these are virginal young women. ``She's quite intact, yes,
quite intact,'' says old Doc McKenzie (Jack Fegan) after examining
Irma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the fun is trying to guess what the ending might be,''
Weir said. ``The challenge was to let the audience know in a way
that wouldn't upset them that there wasn't going to be an ending.
To switch off the expectation.'' Attention was diverted to mood,
which is stoked most effectively by a mix of electronic music,
pipes and classical passages.
</P>
<P>
   From its meticulously studied gentry in their heavy formal
attire to the buzzing of a fly in the sweltering torpor, feeling
and attitude, both menacing and mischievous, slowly overtake the
viewer's concern about missing pieces of the puzzle.``It was quite
bold because it wasn't the style of narrative, but the use of sound
and music and sensual overload,'' said Ms. Robson, who was 17 when
she played Irma and now is an entertainment lawyer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a novel by Joan Lindsay, who in turn based
her book on what was believed to be a true story. Records show no
such incident, but the tale is so alluring that Weir and others who
were involved with the film are reluctant to question its veracity.
``Who's to say it couldn't have happened?'' said Ms. Robson.
</P>
<P>
   For some, ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' is a period horror piece.
But there is also much teasing playfulness _ mysteriously missing
undergarments, a lizard with a quizzical look waddling by a young
woman passed out on the grass, a girl's hand reaching for a piece
of paper up on the rock _ dangling a false expectation that the
riddle might yet have a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, though, the film can be seen as a hallucinatory clash
between society, its banners of repression flying, and sly,
predatory forces lying in wait where manicured lawns stop and the
alien wild begins.
</P>
<P>
   Weir has trimmed the film slightly. He had wanted to make the
adjustments when it went to the Cannes International Film Festival
in the 70s. ``To mesmerize the audience, I had to experiment with
rhythm,'' he said. ``Too slow and the film would become indulgent.
You would see the wheels turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to tinker with a winner, the film's backers
objected. ``No one would let me touch it,'' he said, ``because it
was a freak anyway, and they thought if you touched it, everything
would collapse.''

MAKING `THE NUTCRACKER' SYMPHONIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON

<P>
   For most of us, Tchaikovsky's ballet ``The Nutcracker'' probably
means one of two things: the perennial magic of the stagework
itself or a purely musical encounter with the beloved little dances
that pepper the second act.
</P>
<P>
   But who would pause over the whole of Tchaikovsky's musical
work, every scene and transition, without the stagecraft and
dancing? After all, ``The Nutcracker'' isn't exactly the
``Pathetique'' Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? In a new recording by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov
Orchestra (Philips 289 462 114-2; CD), to be replicated in a
concert at Carnegie Hall on Saturday evening, ``The Nutcracker''
takes on a symphonic aspect of unsuspected power and depth. While
cleverness and brilliance may be routinely associated with
Tchaikovsky's evergreen score, Gergiev gives fresh meaning to those
virtues in an interpretation that is anything but routine.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the Kirov's vibrant playing here, one thinks of
Toscanini's definition of tradition as the last bad performance. At
least in the West, tradition has glazed the rich textures of ``The
Nutcracker'' with a superficial gloss that reflects nothing much
deeper than good tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev and his savvy Russian ensemble strip away that varnish
to get at the counterpoint, the interior voices and their animating
rhythms. End to end, it's a heady process of rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, one is reminded of Tchaikovsky's lifelong
fascination with music of the 18th century. Along with the
sparkling clarity and motoric energy that Gergiev brings to the
work at every turn, he also catches a distinctive edge of Sturm und
Drang that charges Tchaikovsky's music at unexpected points: in
Drosselmeyer's presentation of gifts, in the impassioned duet
between Clara and the Nutcracker, even in the grand waltz that
crowns the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is Gergiev's sense of the musical fabric more
striking than in the transitional Act I tableau of the Christmas
tree, leading to the ``Waltz of the Snowflakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The conductor achieves an aura of dramatic suspension and flow
worthy of a well-fashioned symphonic movement; ``The Nutcracker,''
Gergiev demonstrates, makes for compelling theater even on the
stage of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, his seriously considered reading shows us an
eveninglong symphonic work of unflagging vitality and invention.
Tchaikovsky may have rued the wild popularity of his children's
tale, but that was after the creative fact.
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev takes us back to that first light of inspiration, and
his orchestra plays as if guided by the composer's own hand.

`WANTED' POSTERS IN MEXICO FEATURE A WHITE COLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The halls of Mexico's Congress are adorned these
days with ``wanted'' posters that show a man whom many opposition
lawmakers consider to be an unrepentant white-collar outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   He is Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, the former finance minister who
heads the central bank and is one of the Mexican officials who
command the most respect on Wall Street and among economic
policy-makers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of tempestuous debate that has dominated
Mexican politics, the parties in Congress have not agreed on much
about financing a $62 billion bailout of the country's banks. But
one point of accord among squabbling opposition groups is that they
want Ortiz to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, in separate initiatives, both the left-of-center
Party of the Democratic Revolution and the conservative National
Action Party presented formal petitions in Congress to begin
impeachment proceedings. The opposition holds a majority in the
lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, where the process started.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals for a political trial of Ortiz are largely
symbolic, because they are virtually certain to be blocked in the
Senate, where the governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, remains in control.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge to Ortiz shows how bitterly the dispute has
polarized the discussion over the financial system, as the slide in
world markets brings uncertainty and a slowdown to an essentially
robust economy that Ortiz did much to build.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is the opposition's target because after becoming finance
minister following a catastrophic devaluation of the peso, he
stitched together the emergency program in 1995 that subsidized
overwhelmed debtors and bought bad loans from failing banks. In
exchange for the relief the banks' shareholders were required to
make new injections of capital. The bailout has been widely
credited with saving the wobbling banks from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In March the government sought permission from Congress to
refinance the bailout by including it in Mexico's overall public
debt. The opposition balked, accusing the government of seeking to
rescue high-living bankers at the expense of overburdened
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, opposition legislators are not accusing Ortiz of
corruption. Rather they argue that he violated the Constitution by
contracting billions of dollars of government debt to shore up the
banks without having consulted the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a personal attack on Ortiz,'' said Santiago Creel
Miranda, a National Action Party lawmaker who is chairman of the
Chamber of Deputies subcommittee that would start an impeachment.
``But he was the one in charge at the time. Up to now
accountability has always been a theory in Mexico. For the first
time we want someone to be held responsible for a violation of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded that the bailout was fully legal,
based on a statute that allows certain kinds of government debt
without legislative consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Congress' prerogative to take this action, but I am
convinced that I acted fully within the law,'' Ortiz said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of Wall Street confidence in Ortiz, who also
managed the successful $12.5 billion emergency loans that the
Clinton administration made to Mexico, the Mexican stock market
plummeted 2 percent in a few hours this summer when a rumor
circulated that he was resigning from the central bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he had
enjoyed a ``good working relationship'' with Ortiz. ``His ability
to make very difficult judgments in very short time frames played
an important role in Mexico's recovery,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law permits the impeachment drive even though Ortiz is
no longer finance minister. Although President Ernesto Zedillo was
the highest official to approve the bailout, the constitution bars
his impeachment.

EX-REP. DORNAN FIGHTS TO RECAPTURE DISTRICT, NOW LARGELY HISPANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `a' code)

<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ At 63, Sam Romero has never felt more
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, the son of Mexican immigrants, is a retired
cabinetmaker, a Reagan Democrat and a veteran. In other words, he
is the kind of blue-collar voter that Rep. Loretta Sanchez and her
Republican challenger, Robert Dornan, the former incumbent, are
spending much of their time and money courting like lovesick
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus of politics is rapidly changing across California
and that is easy to see in the 46th Congressional District, where
old dogs are trying to learn new tricks to avoid being left behind.
In the last days of the bitter and tightening rematch of their 1996
campaign, Ms. Sanchez and Dornan know they need as many Sam Romeros
as they can get in this increasingly Hispanic and Asian district in
the heart of Orange County, once a largely white, conservative
bastion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, it was white man's land,'' said Gary
Jacobson, a professor of political science at the University of
California, San Diego. ``That's certainly not true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That was made clear two years ago when Ms. Sanchez narrowly
upset Dornan, the nine-term incumbent, largely on the strength of
the growing Hispanic vote. Dornan spent 14 months unsuccessfully
challenging the results, saying that non-citizens had voted
illegally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dornan, 65, the fiery conservative nicknamed B-1 Bob for his
ardent support of the defense industry and his own rhetorical
bomb-throwing, says he can capture the Hispanic vote this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Latinos to vote for me and they will,'' Dornan said.
``I'm the guy with the work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanchez, who has a much larger war chest, is favored to win,
although her lead has slipped from 21 points in a Chapman
University poll released last summer to 15 points in one the
university released in early October, with 35 percent of the
voters, most of them Republicans, still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual election is going to be much closer than 15
points,'' said Mark Mattern, the political science professor who
directed the polling. ``I'm guessing that Dornan will pick up more
of the undecided vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornan said his own polling shows him only 4 points behind.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Dornan, a redhead of Irish descent, has been proclaiming
that he is ``the only true Latino'' in the race because he opposes
abortion. Ms. Sanchez, a fellow Catholic, supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan is banking that opposition to abortion in the heavily
Catholic Hispanic community will help him pull in votes. But the
polling shows his abortion strategy doing him little good, Mattern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dornan has pressed ahead. He included drawings of the
Virgin of Guadelupe and pictures of aborted fetuses in a campaign
flier, said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science
department at the University of California, Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanchez, 38, a moderate Republican turned moderate Democrat,
picked up on the district's new math much quicker than Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Sanchez ran for the Anaheim City Council using her
married named, Brixey. She came in eighth out of 16. Two years
later, she dropped the name in her upset victory over Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the extent of change in Orange Country had become
clear. Indeed, for decades, immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador and
Vietnam had been moving into the county, fleeing war and want.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demographics continue to change, Ms. Sanchez said,
``the basic core values of hard work and the desire to give a
better opportunity to your children, remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the district, the county's most diverse, is half
Hispanic, primarily Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, a former U.S. Marine, operates St. Teresa's Catholic
Gift Shop on Fourth Street here in memory of his late daughter,
Lydia Romero-Cruz. Although he is a registered Democrat, like many
Hispanic residents he knows, he has often voted for Republicans,
including Dornan and President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped turn one of the worse slums in the county into a
decent place to live,'' Romero said of Dornan's efforts to help
revitalize a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 3, Romero said he would vote for Ms. Sanchez, as he
did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she started to run, a lot of us said, `It's about time we
had some Hispanics in office,''' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic pride was not the only reason. Romero said he was
also motivated by hurt and anger at what he said were
Republican-backed efforts to stifle Hispanic progress in California
with ballot initiatives attacking immigrant rights, affirmative
action and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day,'' he said ``the Republicans decided I wasn't American
anymore, and they shoved me off the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he calls the Republican Party, ``the Evil Empire'' and
Dornan one of its loudest voices of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because of the challenger's shoot-from-the-lip
reputation, Republicans here and in Washington ``were lukewarm to
another Dornan run,'' said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg
Political Report, an independent political newsletter in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could only activate Hispanic voters who weren't pleased
about his lengthy challenge after he lost,'' Rothenberg said.
``Sanchez raised a million bucks because of Bob Dornan.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dornan officially announced last February that he was
running again, a group of Republican movers and shakers in Orange
County came to see him, said Dornan's son and campaign manager,
Mark. They told him that if he ran, they would spend money to
defeat him, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was concerned, said Fred Smoller, Chapman University
political science professor, that Dornan's confrontational style
and harsh words about gays and others he disagrees with would be
bad for the party's reputation and the county's business climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty good record with constituency services,''
Smoller said. ``But for a lot of people he just represented rage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party wants Bob Dornan around,'' his son said. ``He's
their conscience. He makes them uncomfortable. He's a down-to-earth
guy who has never played a round of golf in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far it does not sound good for the man some call ``
Soundbite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very Republican,'' said Calvin Quy Ngo, the property
manager at the Mall of Fortune in nearby Westminster, where
refugees from Vietnam have been settling since 1975. ``But Dornan,
I don't know. His term before, I don't think he did much for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornan has been extremely popular in the Vietnamese community of
Orange County because of his staunch anti-communism. But Ngo, who
fought the communists in Vietnam, is not sure that will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo said he liked Ms. Sanchez, especially after she recently
attended a local festival, where she rolled up her sleeves and
helped wrapped gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her shadow is everywhere compared to Dornan,'' Ngo said. ``I
used to support Dornan 100 percent. Now, I have to ask myself.''

revitalize a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 3, Romero said he would vote for Ms. Sanchez, as he
did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she started to run, a lot of us said, `It's about time we
had some Hispanics in office,''' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic pride was not the only reason. Romero said he was
also motivated by hurt and anger at what he said were
Republican-backed efforts to stifle Hispanic progress in California
with ballot initiatives attacking immigrant rights, affirmative
action and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day,'' he said ``the Republicans decided I wasn't American
anymore, and they shoved me off the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he calls the Republican Party, ``the Evil Empire'' and
Dornan one of its loudest voices of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because of the challenger's shoot-from-the-lip
reputation, Republicans here and in Washington ``were lukewarm to
another Dornan run,'' said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg
Political Report, an independent political newsletter in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could only activate Hispanic voters who weren't pleased
about his lengthy challenge after he lost,'' Rothenberg said.
``Sanchez raised a million bucks because of Bob Dornan.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dornan officially announced last February that he was
running again, a group of Republican movers and shakers in Orange
County came to see him, said Dornan's son and campaign manager,
Mark. They told him that if he ran, they would spend money to
defeat him, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was concerned, said Fred Smoller, Chapman University
political science professor, that Dornan's confrontational style
and harsh words about gays and others he disagrees with would be
bad for the party's reputation and the county's business climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty good record with constituency services,''
Smoller said. ``But for a lot of people he just represented rage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party wants Bob Dornan around,'' his son said. ``He's
their conscience. He makes them uncomfortable. He's a down-to-earth
guy who has never played a round of golf in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far it does not sound good for the man some call ``
Soundbite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very Republican,'' said Calvin Quy Ngo, the property
manager at the Mall of Fortune in nearby Westminster, where
refugees from Vietnam have been settling since 1975. ``But Dornan,
I don't know. His term before, I don't think he did much for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornan has been extremely popular in the Vietnamese community of
Orange County because of his staunch anti-communism. But Ngo, who
fought the communists in Vietnam, is not sure that will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo said he liked Ms. Sanchez, especially after she recently
attended a local festival, where she rolled up her sleeves and
helped wrapped gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her shadow is everywhere compared to Dornan,'' Ngo said. ``I
used to support Dornan 100 percent. Now, I have to ask myself.''

   O'Malley, the chief test conductor for the booster, who grew up
in Montclair, N.J., and came here in 1958, a few months after the
first Soviet Sputnik stunned Americans, remembered the blockhouse
that day. He called it ``a pressure pot.'' It was rudimentary by
today's control-room standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no computers,'' he said. ``The only thing that you
might say was one, was the timer, a clock running the launching
program. When Glenn said, `The clock is started,' it was that
timer.''
</P>
<P>
   From a shelf in his den, O'Malley pulled down the mounted
ignition button that had been at his control console. It was among
such treasures as Atlas, Apollo and space shuttle models; his last
job, before he retired in 1982, was to prepare the first space
shuttle, Columbia, for launching in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At T-minus-18 seconds in the countdown, he said, ``I hit this
button, and then put my fist on the red button next to it, ready to
activate the escape tower if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tape recordings caught his words at that moment. ``May the good
Lord ride all the way,'' O'Malley said. Carpenter, in the
blockhouse to handle communications between the ground and Glenn,
followed with the famous benediction, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.'' At
T-minus-0, the Atlas rose from the pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was elated,'' O'Malley said. ``We all went to
celebrate with a keg of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, some of the old blockhouse gang will be
coming around to O'Malley's house for a fish fry, to bask in
memories of when they were young with John Glenn and sent him off
into the sky and fame.

CRONKITE IN ORBIT OVER GLENN LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might wonder who's being relaunched this week, John Glenn or
Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, 81, seems every bit as ubiquitous as his friend Glenn,
77, the Mercury astronaut who's due to be sent back into orbit on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When ``60 Minutes'' ran a Glenn segment eight days ago, there
was Cronkite, sharing space program memories with the Ohio senator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn adorns the cover of TV Guide magazine this week, his face
over the stripes of a U.S. flag. A smiling Cronkite is right next
to him, planted over the field of stars.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday morning, CNN will begin its extensive live
coverage of Glenn's scheduled space shuttle launch. The co-anchors
of CNN's mission coverage are Miles O'Brien and Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   So all in all, the next two weeks should be a stunning
demonstration of geriatric durability and power.
</P>
<P>
   Should be an unusual few weeks for Glenn, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, who admits to getting excited as a puppy by the manned
space program, wouldn't mind occupying Glenn's spacesuit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that my friend John Glenn is getting his flight,
and clearly he's the qualified one in every sense of the word,''
Cronkite said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I told him in a phone call ... I told him that I
thought this was most unfair. I'm older than he is, and if they
want to test old age in space, I'm the guy to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cronkite's fame derives from his space coverage as a CBS
correspondent and as anchor of ``The CBS Evening News'' from 1962
to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Before the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
Cronkite said, the Air Force conducted rocket tests in semisecrecy.
He and other reporters ventured out on a jetty to observe unmanned
rocket launches at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Many ended in
spectacular explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Access improved with the formation of NASA and the advent of
manned space flight, Cronkite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even the earliest (manned) flights were very primitive,''
he said of the coverage conditions. ``I covered (Alan) Shepard's
little pop downrange from the back of a station wagon, being chewed
up by mosquitoes on top and watching out for rattlesnakes below.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shepard suborbital flight was in 1961, three weeks after
Russia's Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Glenn's
orbital ride, atop a type of rocket that was apt to explode, was in
February 1962.
</P>
<P>
   That first Glenn flight lasted less than five hours. Cronkite
was at the launch site, reporting from another makeshift vantage
point.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Cronkite had surrendered the CBS
anchor desk to Dan Rather, but he still had a chance at space
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to launch a civilian into space, NASA concocted a
``journalist in space'' program as a start. Cronkite was a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination process went quite a long way,'' he said. ``I
think we got down to 20 of us who were still in line for further
weeding out ... I felt I had a pretty good shot at that at the
time, and I was very excited and hopeful that the flight would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, President Reagan, making a campaign speech
before a teachers' union meeting in Chicago, got carried away and
promised that a teacher would be the first civilian in space. The
priority was changed by the president's ad-libbed comments, and
Christa McAuliffe was selected for the first civilian-in-space
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe and six others died in the Challenger shuttle tragedy
in 1986. With a little jiggling of human destiny, it could have
been Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   But now Cronkite will observe his 82nd birthday on November 2,
during his CNN stint with O'Brien. Though Cronkite is still under
contract at CBS, the network has no plans for extensive live
coverage of the Glenn flight and granted Cronkite permission to
appear on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that publicity is a valuable byproduct of the Glenn
mission, but Cronkite bristles, ever so slightly, at suggestions
that nothing of value to science is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The mission will test the effects of prolonged weightlessness on
an older human and, among other things, will deploy a device to
measure solar activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not child's play,'' Cronkite said. ``This is not a
vacation trip for John Glenn in any manner of speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite said the public has become blase about the space
shuttle flights. ``I think there's a whole generation out there,
the under-29ers, who are hardly aware that we're (set ital)in(end
ital) space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be the same people, presumably, who have never seen
Cronkite anchor a live news event. If an 81-year-old semiretired
newsman can get cranked about space exploration, why not a
25-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the great challenges we still face,''
Cronkite said. ``This is, other than the oceans, the last great
frontier. I can't imagine anyone (set ital)not(end ital) being
excited about it.''

 UNDATED: in Iowa.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the nation's third largest gambling
jurisdiction, after Nevada and New Jersey, there was no cooling-off
period that prohibited Nourse from going to work for a casino in
the state. But he did seek an opinion from a state ethics
commission, which cleared the way for him to join Casino Magic.
</P>
<P>
   State officials later considered putting a cooling-off period
into effect, but instead have continued to consider such moves on a
case-by-case basis, which has allowed employees of the gaming
commission to continue to get instant salary increases by taking
jobs with the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved into the industry and effectively doubled my salary,''
said Nourse, who earned about $90,000 a year with the gaming
commission. Defending his decision to become a casino executive,
Nourse noted the ``huge demand by the industry'' for regulators.
``I speak the language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hannifin, a career bureaucrat who was a longtime member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board before going on to help operate
some of the industry's largest casino companies, conceded that the
gambling business has been very good to him. ``My family and I have
been well-treated from a monetary standpoint,'' said Hannifin, now
an executive vice president at Fitzgeralds, a casino company based
in Nevada. ``I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former government officials have truly hit the jackpot in
the casino industry. Avansino, for example, was a Nevada tax lawyer
and gaming commission member who was named president and chief
operating officer of Hilton Hotels in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years Avansino led the company through a
worldwide expansion of its gambling operations. His salary and
bonuses over those years totaled $2.6 million, plus generous stock
options, according to the company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning abruptly in 1996, Avansino is now chairman of a
nonprofit foundation in Nevada, teaches gaming law at the
University of San Francisco School of Law, and shuttles on a
private plane between homes in Reno and in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such financial rewards entices others. In
September the chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission,
Bradford Smith, stepped down from his $95,000-year-post, expressing
a desire to ``maximize my earning capacity,'' and candidly said he
would like to land a job in the gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by this industry,'' he said in an interview
after his final meeting as head of the commission, which governs
the state's casinos. He also noted that he was prepared to move
outside New Jersey to avoid the state's cooling-off period and
immediately go to work for the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's predecessor, Stephen Perskie, has fared well since he
resigned in 1994. Perskie was the New Jersey General Assembly
member who wrote the 1977 statue that legalized casino gambling in
Atlantic City. After serving as chief of staff to former Gov. Jim
Florio (Florio joined the board of Bally Gaming, a major
manufacturer of casino equipment, after he was defeated by Gov.
Christie Whitman in 1993), Perskie was appointed to the casino
control commission in 1990, where he served as the state's top
regulator for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned to join the riverboat casino company, Players
International, as vice president and general counsel, and was able
to circumvent the cooling-off period because, although Players
operated casinos in other parts of the country, they had none in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while at Players, Perskie's office remained in Atlantic
City. A few years later, he left the company to go into private
practice, and is now considered one of New Jersey's top gaming
lawyers. In fact, the casino business that Perskie was instrumental
in legalizing in New Jersey has been very good to the entire
Perskie family. Three Atlantic City law firms that represent
casinos bear the Perskie family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of the revolving door is a matter of legitimate
concern,'' Perskie conceded in a recent interview. But he insisted
that in the 20 years that Atlantic City has had legalized gambling,
``there has been no threat to the public confidence or the
integrity of the regulatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PIONEERS: Early Proponents Often Prosper
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many cases the same people who have been instrumental
in setting up the casino industry in their states have gotten the
biggest opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, where gaming officials often boast of having the
toughest, most restrictive cooling-off laws, Martin Greenberg, a
former state senator who helped draft the casino control law that
governs the state's casinos, resigned from his legislative post in
1979 and within days became president of the Golden Nugget despite
having no experience in casino operations. (As a result, the
cooling-off laws in New Jersey were expanded in 1981 to include
state legislators, but most other states still do not prohibit such
moves.)
</P>
<P>
   And G. Michael Brown, who as director of the state attorney
general's division of gaming enforcement, conducted background
investigations of many of Atlantic City's first casino operators,
left his job in 1982 to go into legal practice representing foreign
casino companies. He later became became chief executive officer of
the Connecticut-based Foxwoods Casino, the nation's most profitable
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cody, who as a New Jersey assemblyman in 1977 was
chairman of the legislative committee that wrote the state's casino
control act, said he has received numerous invitations to join the
industry but refused. Cody, now a state senator, said he believes
that government officials who are interested in working for the
gambling industry tend to ``become the lap dog instead of the watch
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   But for their part, many former regulators contend that the
influx of former government officials into the industry has only
helped to clean up a once-notorious business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because it brings people with honesty, ethics and
integrity into the industry,'' said Shannon Bybee, a former member
of the Nevada Gaming Control Board who went on to become president
of the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City and chairman and chief
executive officer of the Claridge casino. But Bybee, now a gaming
professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, conceded that
the revolving door ``can be bad if it's abused and people use their
positions to get around doing things, or do things because of
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BLURRED LINES: When Regulators Relax the Rules
</P>
<P>
   Others, including former regulators, say the revolving door has
created an incestuous culture in which the lines separating
gambling and the people responsible for overseeing it are often
blurred, or even nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Waters, a former casino control commission member in New
Jersey, said he found that his colleagues were sometimes swayed by
their personal job interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these folks, as their terms come to an end, start
finding ways to agree with the industry,'' he said. ``They start
trying to pave a way to endear themselves with the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who retired in 1991 after five years on the commission,
said he never sought a casino job. But he added, ``If I had wanted
to, all I had to do was cozy up to them.''

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLIPS   TO 1996 LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new wave of layoffs coupled with uncertainty on Wall Street
have made consumers skittish.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer outlook
index, a key measurement of confidence and spending, dropped to
117.3 in October from 126.4 in September, the lowest level since
December 1996. What's more, confidence in the economy for the
coming six months has reached an almost three-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Economists blamed consumers' gloomy outlook on layoffs and the
recent upheaval in the stock market. ``The job market has a great
influence on confidence levels,'' noted Lynn Franco, economist and
associate director of the Conference Board, a nonprofit research
organization in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this actually began in July and it has carried on
since then,'' she said. ``The turmoil in the financial markets, the
volatilty, and the fact that these gyrations are now resulting in
layoffs are partly to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco also warned that ``any further decline in the confidence
index could spell a bleak (Christmas sales) season for retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a tough holiday season, many merchants, including
the world's number one retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc., are issuing
very conservative sales estimates for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are feeling cautiously optimistic because you cannot look
at what's going on in the world economy without having some
concerns about the impact it will have on the consumer,'' Shawn
Kahle, a spokeswoman for Kmart Corp., told the Associated Press.
``There's a lot on the plate and there's a lot of reason to be
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sara Johnson, chief regional economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI in Lexington, Mass., believes the drop is mostly concentrated
in households with earnings of $50,000 or more, suggesting that the
primary influence is the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has recovered somewhat, but that has reduced
household wealth,'' she said. ``Consumers are turning cautious.
They are less optimistic about their future and that reflects
unsettled markets everywhere as well as concerns about more layoffs
due to market declines.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a national outplacement firm,
reports that layoffs were 53 percent higher this year than they
were in the first nine months of 1997. In September, more than
73,000 job cuts were announced in the electronics, computer,
consumer products, banking, securities, and telecommunications
industries _ all industries that have led national job growth in
the past. Both Gillette and Raytheon recently announced plans to
cut thousands of jobs nationwide.

 &HT;    Search for savings would start with an early audit
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Guy Millner doesn't want to appear presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   So a week out from the election that could make him Georgia's
first Republican governor in more than a century, he has little
specific to say about who would make up his historic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real dangerous to talk about where you're going
to put the football trophy until you win the game,'' Millner said.
``First, we've got to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Millner is unequivocal about is that the people
who will surround him will reflect his commitment to bring business
leadership to state government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll approach it the way a CEO approaches running a
company,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta).
``First, he will try to find people from outside government, people
he's run across in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before taking office, Millner wants to start the audit of
all state agencies he campaigned on as the way to trim state
spending by 7 percent. Millner says he would ask outgoing Gov. Zell
Miller for permission to begin by late November.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republican lawmakers say next year's budget, which the
governor will present to lawmakers in January, will be too close to
a final draft for Millner to immediately insert much of his package
of tax and spending proposals. That plan requires using the audit's
savings _ Millner estimates finding more than $800 million in waste
_ plus the state's economic growth rate to pay for what opponent
Roy Barnes says is more than $18 billion in new spending during the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Millner insists a jump-start on the audit could help free up
enough money to immediately start his auto tax elimination plan and
education initiatives, including the phased-in addition of 7,500
new teachers. ``I'm an impatient person,'' he said. ``I'm not
willing to let another year go by before we start to put our own
mark on state government.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Millner is likely to run up against state lawmakers
reluctant to implement many of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The auto tag tax repeal faces stiff opposition from city, county
and local school officials. Many state lawmakers objected to plans
last year to abolish parole. And all funding changes _ up or down _
must be approved by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains uncertain who Millner will turn to for help in
implementing his proposals, familiar faces running his campaign
this year may send some signals.
</P>
<P>
   David Shafer, who ran Millner's 1994 gubernatorial bid, is in a
similar role this year. Shafer, a former executive director of the
state GOP and unsuccessful candidate for secretary of state two
years ago, could emerge in a management role in Millner's staff or
as his pick to head the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Tom Perdue, while not considered a likely
administration employee, stands to be one of the people Millner
uses as a sounding board, at least in the administration's early
stages, Irvin and other GOP leaders said. Controversial for his
aggressive campaign tactics, Perdue was a longtime aide to two
Democratic governors, George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, and is
familiar with the process of running the state.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Millner rolled off names of business and civic
leaders he plans to consult for advice on how to move the state
forward, among them Waffle House founder Joe Rogers, developers Tom
Cousins and John Aderhold, and Russ Chandler, the unofficial mayor
of the Olympic Village during the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Former political players also are expected to have a role.
Millner said he would call on former state Budget Director Hank
Huckaby, now at the University of Georgia, and Joe Tanner, who has
headed Gov. Miller's privatization efforts and several state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If his campaign is successful, Millner says, the typical
attrition that follows a governor's departure will leave him with
any number of vacant positions to fill without wholesale
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, ``it's not a given that everybody in state
government is going to be gone,'' Millner said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some replacements would be expected as Millner pursued a
reorganization and consolidation to correct what he calls a
``fairly unwieldy organization'' with too many people reporting
directly to the governor.

 UNDATED: to them.''

<P>
   Not surprisingly, gambling's courtship of regulators began in
Las Vegas, where former officials have long cashed in on ties to
gambling. Today, in many of the 26 casino gambling jurisdictions
around the country, some of the most powerful gaming lawyers and
executives are people who started as regulators in Nevada, where
cooling-off laws did not exist until 1987 and are still less
restrictive than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Schreck, for example, left the Nevada Gaming Commission in
1975 and immediately began building his law practice by providing
counsel to gaming clients. ``At that time, the only real way to
learn gaming law was to learn it on the governmental side,''
Schreck said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is one of the most prominent and influential gaming
lawyers in the country, known especially for his high rate of
success when representing clients appearing before Nevada's gaming
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the casino industry's consumption of government
officials is attributed to its rapid growth and resulting job
opportunities. Since 1990, casino revenue has more than doubled, to
$20.5 billion annually, and the industry now accounts for an
estimated $7.3 billion in wages, according to the American Gaming
Association, the industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And as the casino industry has grown, so has the need for
consultants, lobbyists and executives with regulatory experience
who can obtain and maintain the government licenses that allow
casinos to operate and proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   THE LUSH LIFE: From Prosecutor To Casino Boss
</P>
<P>
   Of all the many former government and law-enforcement officials
who have chosen to stake their futures on the casino industry,
probably none has evolved so completely as that of James Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Ritchie was a federal prosecutor earning
less than $35,000 a year. He worked on the West Coast and,
according to former colleagues, his investigations included the
gambling business in Nevada, where organized crime was still deeply
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1973, Ritchie left the Justice Department to become
executive director of the Congressional Commission on the Review of
the National Policy Toward Gambling, which was organized to help
establish guidelines on legalized gambling. But when the commission
issued its report in 1976, Ritchie's former colleagues at the
department lashed out at him for being too partial to the casino
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several strong differences of opinion,'' recalled
William Lynch, who, as head of the organized crime and racketeering
section, had been Ritchie's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission was very influenced by, or in agreement with,
the gambling industry,'' Lynch added. ``Basically, the whole thrust
of the commission as it developed became pretty clear. They were in
the `let's repeal all laws against gambling' attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade or more, as state laws were changed and
casinos began to open around the country, Ritchie worked as the
industry's top lobbyist in Washington. In those years, said
associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Ritchie owned
his own boat and had a lavishly appointed Capitol Hill office
decorated with expensive artifacts that underscored the lush life
the gambling business had afforded him.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on his cellular phone recently, Ritchie, 62, refused to
discuss why he switched jobs or how his life has changed since he
traded in his federal credentials for a career in the casino
industry.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying for the industry, Ritchie moved to Las Vegas,
where in 1990 he became executive vice president of development at
Mirage Casinos, helping to analyze new casino development
opportunities. After four years in that job he left the company,
taking more than $6 million in stock options on his way out,
according to Mirage records.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ritchie's evolution was nearly complete. At that
time he went before Nevada regulators seeking a license to own 12.3
percent of the CasaBlanca Resort, a privately held casino and
700-room hotel with a luxury spa and championship golf course, 80
miles north of Las Vegas in Mesquite, Nev. The former prosecutor of
organized crime, which once controlled the casino business, was
about to become a casino operator himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clean background Ritchie had when he joined the
casino industry, his years in gambling have led to relationships
and business associations that have brought him scrutiny. At the
hearings in August, Nevada regulators questioned Ritchie about some
of his past business relationships, specifically about what one
gaming commission member called ``questionable associations'' with
two men.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, whom Ritchie had lent $400,000 in 1994 for a
casino investment, was said by regulators to have a history of
problems and allegations of impropriety in the gambling industry.
Ritchie, according to his testimony, said he was unaware of the
full nature of the man's past problems when he gave him the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who had been a partner of Ritchie's earlier this
year in a plan to buy the Desert Inn casino in Las Vegas was
described by regulators as a ``flim-flam man'' and ``the world's
biggest flake.'' Ritchie testified that he now recognized that he
was ``used'' by the partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer in government,'' told the regulators. ``I no
longer have access to law-enforcement records. I'm sitting in my
kitchen with a fax machine and a telephone and enough of a bankroll
to try to become involved in some of these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their misgivings, both the state gaming board and the
state gaming commission voted unanimously to give Ritchie a
two-year license as co-owner of the CasaBlanca casino and hotel.

   Taking in the signs of Space Coast
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Bruce
</P>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ They call this part of Florida the Space
Coast, and it's easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Travel A1A, the main artery from Satellite Beach to the Kennedy
Space Center. Drive past I Dream of Jeannie Lane, then a take a
right over Christa McAuliffe bridge and head straight until you
reach Saturn Causeway. All along this route to the space center
there are signs that this place is spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Signs. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godspeed Discovery,'' proclaims the billboard outside the
Riverside Presbyterian Church. A few blocks up the highway, the
Lido Cabaret, a strip joint, also gets into the act: ``Halloween
Costume Party. Cash prizes. Godspeed John Glenn.'' In between, the
roadside is dotted with other markers: ``Godspeed STS 95.''
``Godspeed Discovery.'' This Godspeed stuff has really caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Inside shops and restaurants, Space Shuttle T-shirts and caps
commemorating Glenn's return to outer space are flying off the
shelves. The hottest new item on the market: Beanie Baby space
suits at $6 a pop. Even the Ron Jon Surf Shop has a space souvenir
section.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry here, hard hit by fires, hurricanes and El
Nino, has found the onslaught of tourists a godsend. All but a
dozen or so of the area's 8,500 hotel and motel rooms are sold out
and campgrounds are ``filled to capacity,'' according to Heidi
Brandow, president of the Cocoa Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.
``We expect this to have a $20 million impact on the area. I've
never seen such interest in any launch.'' And she's been on the job
for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of sightseers will translate into traffic gridlock, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking cats and dogs living together, real wrath of God
stuff,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for the Brevard County
Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Heller declined to estimate the size of the crowd that will line
the beaches _ guesses are generally in the hundreds of thousands _
but she said police plan to keep their sense of humor through what
will likely be a very long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``During one of the Apollo launches, one of the guys here
directed traffic at the same intersection for 17 hours. But people
were real friendly, handing out drinks and sandwiches. Not at all
like a crowd for a Grateful Dead concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of rock stars and other celebs, this place is about to
be overrun with them, according to local gossip columnists. Rumor
has it that joining President Clinton on launch day will be such
luminaries as Leonardo DiCaprio, Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks, Pierce
Brosnan and Ron Howard. The rock group Aerosmith is said to be
attending, too. But, based on their record of no-shows in Dayton,
don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining the celebs will be Jimmy Buffet, he who made A1A
famous in song. He's been credentialed as a bona fide reporter for
Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There will be astronauts galore, as well. The surviving members
of the original Mercury program are guests of honor this evening at
a reception at the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. Scott Carpenter,
Gordon Cooper and Walter Schirra will be joined in town by other
spacey luminaries such as Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell (he of Apollo 13
fame) and Pete Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is ga-ga over John Glenn's latest space voyage.
According to Florida Today , residents of Cape Canaveral rebelled
at a proposal to rename Central Boulevard for the first American to
orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks, apparently, didn't want the hassle of changing their
stationery. ``It wasn't a real popular idea,'' Mayor Rocky Randels
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some people just don't know how to get into the spirit of
things.

 &HT;    Clear skies predicted for Discovery liftoff
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; GLENNBAR, GLENN-BRUCE
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. _ Two large weather systems that threatened
Thursday's scheduled space shuttle launch took decidedly positive
turns Tuesday and now NASA's experts predict beautiful,
trouble-free weather for the liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good news, good news, good news,'' said shuttle weather
officer Ed Priselac in opening his briefing on status of weather
conditions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Priselac said there is no chance weather will halt the launch,
even though there was a 40 percent chance of that on Monday.
Hurricane Mitch, off the coast of Honduras, has moved further west,
and a large high-pressure system over Georgia has begun drifting
south.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems had been threatening to bring high winds that could
have interfered with the launch schedule by making conditions
dangerous, not for the launch itself, but for an emergency landing
if the flight had to be aborted before reaching orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch ended the northwesterly drift that made it a
concern just a day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting even further away from us,'' Priselac said.
</P>
<P>
   But the system that was likely to have been the biggest hurdle
to getting Discovery cleared for launch was a high-pressure pocket
that seemed not to be moving Monday. If it had remained north of
the launch site, its edges would have generated problematic winds
for the area, but by moving south it will blanket central Florida
with mild temperatures and light breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Glenn and the other six members of Discovery's
crew spent the day in the space center's dormitory-style crew
quarters wrapping up last-minute details for the mission and
spending time with family.
</P>
<P>
   They were briefed again on two experiments from the flight, and
suited up in their flight gear to verify that everything fits
properly. Tuesday morning they took physical exams, and Tuesday
night had a flight-crew barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Although NASA's test director, Doug Lyons, said shuttle
preparations have fallen behind by about 1 hours due to a leak on a
ground vent line in the liquid oxygen system, he said the problem
is minor and ground crews expect to make up the time during one of
several built-in countdown holds. He said the leak is not connected
to the fuel system on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we're in good shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday night, the payload team worked until morning
loading supplies and self-contained experiments into the Spacehab
module in the shuttle, which sits on the launch pad. The Spacehab
is installed in the cargo bay and connects to the crew living
quarters by a tunnel, giving the astronauts another room to work
in.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wetherbee, a veteran of four shuttle flights, is now
director of flight crew operations, which puts him in regular
contact with the crew while they await the launch in quarantine. He
said Glenn is relaxed and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the distinct impression he's not really 77 years old,''
Wetherbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherbee said that in these days before the launch, the
intensity and tension level rachets a bit higher while crew members
begin focusing individually on the pending space flight. But he
said the building of tension is not a problem because astronauts
are chosen specifically for their ability to thrive in the most
tense of situations. He said being under the gun makes astronauts
perform best.
</P>
<P>
   And he said, ``You can tell when you watch (Glenn) operate that
he's an astronaut.''

 &HT;    Tour guide, volunteer experiences NASA fascination full-time
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Like a gruff old shepherd, gray-bearded
Angelo Taianis was trying to round up a busload of reporters and
photographers at Launch Complex 14 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, we're late,'' he muttered in a coarse voice. His flock
was scattered all over the remains of the old launch pad, all of
them absorbed in shooting or taping the weathered concrete
structure. He shook his head. ``I've got to get them back on the
bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taianis understood the fascination with this place. This is
where it started. Launch Complex 14 is where an Atlas rocket
blasted the Mercury capsule Friendship Seven into the sky with John
Glenn inside it, making him the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It's an event Taianis remembers well. He was in the throng of
people who quietly went about making Glenn's flight happen.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Italy and raised in Pennsylvania, Taianis served in the
Navy in World War II and was working on the Navy's Polaris missile
program in Florida when President Eisenhower created NASA, a
civilian space agency.
</P>
<P>
   Taianis decided to apply for a job. He had a degree in chemistry
and advanced engineering training, but he knew what would interest
NASA was his missile work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were interested in anyone with missile experience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taianis worked on a wide variety of programs and had a hand in
450 rocket launches, including the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and
space shuttle programs.
</P>
<P>
   He's retired now, but for 14 years he has been escorting news
media groups around Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station as a NASA volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Taianis was almost apologetic about Launch Pad 14, which is 12
miles south of Launch Pad 39-B which holds space shuttle Discovery.
While the control center is well preserved, the launch pad is in
bad shape, its red steel launch tower long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Taianis will watch the launch. But he admits to ``mixed
feelings'' at the prospect of seeing the old Mercury trailblazer
climbing onto a rocket again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you see a man on the pad, it's a pretty hairy
feeling,'' he said.

 &HT;    GOP candidate Millner is driven as he seeks to accomplish his
goals
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; POLITICS, RECORD
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Guy Millner has stuck to a simple marketing strategy
in trying to close the toughest sell of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Present the product: ``I'm a businessman. I want to make
government more efficient,'' he says as he vigorously pumps hands
at each campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch the product: ``Tell all your friends to put this message
on their answering machines _ Vote Republican on Nov. 3,'' he
recently advised supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Invest heavily: To date, Millner has spent more than $11.5
million of his own money on this, his third try for statewide
office, backing it up with 15-hour days on the campaign trail in
his bid for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the business world, where Millner made a personal fortune
valued earlier this year at $167 million, that formula has been a
tried-and-true recipe for success. But twice now in the political
world, the skills that helped him build a national network of
staffing companies have not been enough to convince Georgia voters
to put him in office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Millner, who at age 62 admits this is likely his final
political sales pitch, is convinced his persistence, combined with
a carefully honed campaign based on boosting education, eliminating
the auto tag tax and using his business skills to streamline
government, will be enough to finally seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know why I ran before,'' said Millner, who's all
too familiar with criticisms that his past political quests were
merely attempts by a bored CEO to win one more elusive trophy to
place on the mantle. ``But they're saying, `Now he must be serious
about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is Millner ever anything but serious _ at least about
going after what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted to go to college, his parents couldn't afford it.
So Millner, the youngest of three children, who started pumping gas
at his father's Holly Hill, Fla., service station by age 10 and
sold candy bars and drinks from a roadside stand in junior high
school, decided to foot the bill himself.
</P>
<P>
   The rest has been recounted on the campaign trail so often it's
become a part of Georgia political lore: The skinny kid, so
embarrassed by his stutter in grade-school that he wouldn't raise
his hand in class, signed on to sell cookware and began peddling
pots and pans door-to-door to pay his college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   An average student by his own estimation, Millner excelled
outside the classroom. By the time he completed his political
science degree at Florida State University, he had become the
cookware company's manager for the entire state. On the side, he
also had complied a list of college friends' birthdates and used
them to get their parents to buy birthday cakes from him. An
entrepreneur was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had that vision that he wanted to be (the head of)
one of the larger companies around,'' said Bob Turner, who dates
his friendship with Millner to the struggling, two-man personnel
business Millner formed when he came to Atlanta straight out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had that in the back of his mind. And he worked at
it, long days and long hours. When you or I would be out Friday
nights going to a movie, he'd be up in the office working,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   As in his political career, Millner didn't find instant success.
He sometimes struggled to meet his payroll, friends recall. His
office, started with a $6,000 loan and second-hand furniture, was
located downtown, but Millner remembers parking eight blocks away
and walking to save 50 cents on parking.
</P>
<P>
   Parking rates are no longer a problem for Millner. The company
that started off as a permanent job placement agency changed focus
just as temporary staffing came en vogue in the early 1970s, and
Millner was the first temp service to franchise. Now Norrell Corp.,
which Millner built from the two-person firm, produces annual
revenue of $1.3 billion and makes its headquarters in a Buckhead
office development.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, two sprawling homes he owns with names as well as
street numbers _ Windcrofte, the $6 million estate of former
Coca-Cola baron Robert Woodruff that Millner calls home, and
Newington, his $3.5 million Florida home _ provide more than ample
living space.
</P>
<P>
   But tight-fisted habits learned from hard-scrabble beginnings
can be hard to break. ``If we go to a restaurant, it's `Do we have
an extra iced tea on the tab?''' said Ginny Millner, Millner's wife
of 10 years. ``If we go to the theater in New York, do you think
we're going to have a limousine? Un-uh. Here we are, we're walking
in the rain. That's his mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the same scrimp-and-save philosophy Millner promises to
bring to Georgia state government. Auditing all state agencies to
pinpoint waste and trimming the state budget by 7 percent are
central themes in Millner's second campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Critics scoffed at Millner's attempts to start at the top in
politics _ all three of his campaigns have been runs at prestigious
statewide offices of governor and U.S. Senate _ and they poke holes
in his ambitious plans if elected. His combination of income tax
credits and tag tax cuts would shrink the state's revenue stream
considerably at a time when Millner is calling for 7,500 new
teachers, teacher pay raises and $1.2 billion in new spending on
prisons to fulfill his promise to abolish parole. The end result,
Democratic rival Roy Barnes says, is a balance sheet in the red by
more than $12 billion over a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters don't doubt that Millner can balance the bottom
line numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy has a real sense of urgency,'' said Karen Finley, a
management consultant who remembers Millner from his start-up days
in business. ``I cannot even explain to you how strong it is. He
knows what he wants to accomplish. He's very driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner traces that trait to his mother, who sold magazine
subscriptions on the phone to help make ends meet in the family's
modest, working-class home north of Daytona Beach, Fla. He says she
taught him never to take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most folks that come from a lower-income family setting, and
certainly that's where we were, you build up more ambition, more of
a drive to succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons stuck. As he worked to expand Norrell, Millner's
persistence led to his habit of scheduling not one but two business
lunches to woo a client. He felt they would be more receptive in
that relaxed setting over a meal. Punctuality was an expected
virtue, and late-night brainstorming calls to top executives were
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   His discipline also bleeds into his personal life, where one of
his first questions on his first date with wife Ginny was an
inquiry about her five-year plan. He schedules time to exercise _ a
program of speedwalking and stretching routines _ just as he would
a business meeting. Friends say he's as competitive on the golf
course as he is in the boardroom. The routine, as described by
some, is simple: a smooth shot, and a glance over the shoulder
followed by a confident quip ``Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   But his hard-driving nature has had personal costs. His first
marriage failed, he admits, in part, because it had to compete with
his job creating Norrell. While other politicians keep in touch
with college friends and hometown acquaintances, Millner has lost
contact with most boyhood friends and college pals. Some of his
children, now actively working on his campaign, have said they felt
neglected while growing up when Millner missed key occasions and
his gifts to them often were picked out by secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   While Millner has made amends with his children and says he's
learned to balance business with family in his third marriage, some
former employees and business associates recall a hard-bitten
executive more concerned with profits than with business ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Lolies, who spent 24 years with Millner's printing
division, says he cheated employees out of generous pensions when
he decided to sell off that part of the company seven years ago.
After verbally promising them they could remain a part of the
Norrell stock pension plan, Lolies claims, Millner issued checks to
former employees for their shares a few years before Norrell went
public and the stock soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been allowed to keep mine, it would have been a quarter
million (dollars). Instead, I got $18,000,'' said Lolies, 58. ``I
stuck to my end of the deal. I put the company ahead of my family.
And they didn't stick to their end of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner did not respond directly. But while associates admit
he's demanding they take issue with characterizations of Millner as
a ruthless businessman. ``I'd say he was very generous with his
ex-employees,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Millner himself has been his own worst enemy, feeding
the perception of insensitivity. Confronted with his membership in
an exclusive club in Florida with a reputation for excluding black
people and Jewish people, Millner at first was unapologetic. Later
he said would resign, only to withdraw the resignation request
after losing the 1996 U.S. Senate contest. He completed the
resignation, he says, before launching his latest bid for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to cram 10 pounds in a 2-pound bag,''
Millner explains. ``Sometimes when you're too focused, you tend to
appear to be uncaring. If you're too business-like, you tend to not
be warm and fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   But defenders say Millner's critics get too much attention,
while his generosity goes unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see the same person the newspaper depicts,'' said
Mary Ann Schrecengost, principal at Cedar Grove High School, a
predominately minority school in south DeKalb County where Millner
funded a college scholarship for B-average students, among other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw someone who was willing to sit down on the floor with
the kids and get their feedback,'' she said. ``He was always coming
up with bigger programs. He wanted to include more kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner and Norrell directed almost as much money into the
school for programs recognizing academic achievement as the county
did on a per-student basis for day-to-day operations, Schrecengost
said.
</P>
<P>
   His personal fortune allows Millner to infuse his wealth into a
variety of causes, many of them like his recent seven-figure
contributions to the Salvation Army and United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to voters, Millner downplays his wealth. He declines
opportunities to be interviewed or photographed at his home, and
often couches his programs as an opportunity to help families
working ``two or three jobs'' to make ends meet. Khakis and
open-collar shirts are his preferred attire on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say that's always been his pattern. Because of that
low key approach, Kaaren Johnson-Street remembers, her first
meeting with Millner almost didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed him twice before we finally recognized each other,''
the Florida marketer and member of Norrell's board of directors
said. ``I was expecting $500 shoes and monogrammed shirts. But he's
not pretentious at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Millner's wealth always crops up as a major issue in
politics, with his willingness to spend freely on his own campaigns
characterized by opponents as an attempt to buy the office.
</P>
<P>
   In two earlier contests that each failed by less than 2 percent
of the vote, Millner mixed fund-raising with his own generous loans
to the campaign. But he acknowledges in his third bid at elected
office that he's now less reluctant to reach into his own wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sensitive about it, and I spent a disproportionate
amount of my time fund-raising,'' Millner said of his earlier
contests. ``But I've laid that little alligator aside, and I've
become less concerned about it because people know I'm working
very, very hard. ... It perhaps sounds like Pollyanna to a lot of
people, but I believe God gives you gifts and you ought to use
them.''

COMMENTARY: THE NEW NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question raised in the full-page ad from the Anti-Defamation
League in Sunday's Times was plaintive: ``Is there no moral
responsibility at NBC News anymore?'' What prompted the ad _ an
open letter to NBC's president, Bob Wright _ was Louis Farrakhan's
appearance on ``Meet the Press'' the previous Sunday. Under the
cover of the flimsiest of news pegs _ the otherwise unremarked
third anniversary of the Million Man March _ Farrakhan had been
invited on air to give his opinion of ``the president's moral
behavior and his possible impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Nation of Islam did have a unique perspective
on this issue: He saw Monica Lewinsky as a possible Zionist plot to
skew the Mideast peace negotiations. But ludicrous and bigoted as
his comments were, it would be unfair to accuse NBC of pushing any
ideological agenda. No, the only agenda here was entertainment, and
Farrakhan is far more diverting, particularly if you're not Jewish,
than a sobersides like Orrin Hatch. Farrakhan was, in his
freak-show way, the perfect bookend to Matt Drudge _ the equally
entertaining and specious novelty act for which ``Meet the Press''
took heat way back at the dawn of Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ``New News'' _ as it has been appropriately
christened by Marvin Kalb, in a paper just published by the
Shorenstein Center on Press and Politics at Harvard. While the
extent of Monicagate's stain on our civic institutions is not yet
fully known, its effect on our culture is already profound. The
10-month saga has solidified for good a 20-year trend in which the
media _ especially the electronic media, by which the vast majority
of Americans get the news _ have steadily replaced journalistic
standards with those of show business. Crowding out the old ideals
of public service and truth-seeking are the imperatives of star
performances, suspenseful plot twists, sex, celebrity and
box-office profit.
</P>
<P>
   Monicagate didn't create this culture. The gulf war, O.J. and
the death of Princess Di were all dry runs for the premise that
news could be produced as long-form entertainment in the style of
nonfiction mini-series like ``Roots'' (and at far lower cost). But
Monicagate was the first of these real-life dramas to arrive on a
media field that had expanded to include three competing 24-hour
cable news channels and a full-throttle Internet. Just as
crucially, it arrived after all three major networks and CNN had
been swallowed up by media giants, some of them (Disney, Time
Warner) show biz incarnate. Now there's no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   As the old journalistic rules don't apply in the ``New News,''
so the old journalistic yardsticks for critiquing it are outdated.
Last week, for instance, the Committee of Concerned Journalists
released a much-heralded report tracking the factual accuracy (or
lack of same) of the reportage on such Monicagate scoops as the
dress, the cigar, the ``second intern'' and the authorship of the
talking points. Good or bad, that accuracy record _ the historic
criterion for journalistic quality _ is now almost beside the
point. The real flavor of the Monica marathon could be found during
the days and sometimes weeks when there was no news at all, and the
story filled up endless hours anyway. The time was passed with
show-biz stunts: new bit players, mindless speculation that became
the journalistic equivalent of sideshows, and Emmy-caliber
hyperventilation by star newscasters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than count up factual errors to assess the excesses of
this orgy, it would be more telling to add up the stories that,
like the pope's visit to Cuba, were dumped or ignored for its
duration. There should also be counts of the eyelifts performed on
Monica talking heads (including moonlighting print journalists)
since January, the number of creative network logos the ``crisis''
inspired, and the hours of Super-Bowl-style hype that preceded and
followed every new twist of the plot (however inconsequential).
</P>
<P>
   This ``New News'' format will be with us long after Monicagate
is history, and stories that don't fit it don't rate. Show-biz
criteria now dictate not only  &UR; how &LR;  news is covered but  &UR; what &LR;  news
is covered. Next in line for disproportionate mini-series
treatment, accordingly, is John Glenn's flight _ provided that it
doesn't go too smoothly to serve as cliffhanger entertainment, or
that a younger and sexier star doesn't upstage him much as Monica
did the pope.

 &HT;    Business background prompts scrutiny of company's practices
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A gleaming Buckhead office tower and a $1.3 billion
bottom line in the staffing company he built from a two-man firm is
the business success story Guy Millner pitches to Georgia voters.
</P>
<P>
   As the former chief executive officer of Norrell Corp., Millner
promises to transfer his experience from the corporate boardroom to
the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news about me as a candidate is that I'm a business
person,'' he tells voters.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, chief among them Democratic nominee Roy Barnes,
argue that Millner's business success also brings an unattractive
downside. They say Millner, who has criticized Barnes' votes during
his 22 years in the Legislature, should be measured by his own
corporate record.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his stand-out accomplishments with Norrell, which
employs about 60,000 people and supplies staffing for about half
the Fortune 500 companies such as IBM, that record includes a
string of lawsuits, state health department citations and irate
former associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made business experience the centerpiece of his
campaign,'' said Barnes, who has aired TV spots attacking Millner's
ethics and business practices.''But he cuts corners that put more
money in his pocket but cause injury to the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner's foray into health care staffing _ at a time when many
companies joined the field expecting big profits from hospitals and
Medicare reimbursements _ provides the most fodder for his critics.
</P>
<P>
   _ During a six-year period leading up to 1993 when Norrell sold
its home health care staffing chain, health department
investigators in 14 states cited Millner's health care agencies for
more than 240 violations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those were routine technical or record-keeping errors
that didn't directly compromise patient care, such as irregular
board of directors meetings or not properly informing patients of
their rights.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems raised more serious questions. In many
agencies, nurses or aides did not receive the required 14-hour
annual training. Many others lacked proof of licenses, and in some
instances were not licensed in the state where they practiced.
Medication or care was administered without, or contrary to,
doctor's written orders, and in other cases aides were weeks late
in reporting infections, abuse and changes in medical conditions to
doctors or supervisors, according to state documents.
</P>
<P>
   _ A jury awarded an Alabama woman with Lou Gerhig's disease
$340,000 in 1993 after a Norrell home health care agency
overcharged her insurance company, prematurely exhausting her
coverage. Norrell appealed, but later settled. In another Alabama
suit, the company settled for a higher dollar amount, attorneys
said, after Norrell-supplied nurses failed to properly care for a
respirator-dependent child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Norrell home health care fired an executive in California for
what she claimed was her refusal to falsify Medicare records, and
later settled that 1987 lawsuit for a reported $750,000. Also, a
caterer sued the health care agency and an Encino, Calif., hospital
for $1 million after she said a Norrell health aide abused and
assaulted her during a sponge bath. The case was settled
confidentially, but the nurse pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and
was sentenced to three years' probation and three months in jail or
500 hours of community service. Other suits are pending or were
settled for smaller amounts. After repeated citations, Maryland
health officials threatened to revoke Norrell's health care license
in Silver Spring, Md. Carol Benner, head of the licensing division
at the time, called the problems ``very serious violations, the
scope and extent of which are rarely seen in home health-care
providers.'' Texas health officials also warned Norrell that
deficiencies jeopardized the Austin office's continued
participation in Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Norell's contract agents complained of business
arrangements they said gave Norrell 60 percent of the health care
commissions and left them financially strapped as the company
constantly turned over managers and reneged on promises to train
the nursing staff and recruit business. ``Norrell cost me a small
fortune, and I'm still not out of hock,'' said Harry Ward, who
closed his South Carolina service eight years ago. ``Millner made
his money off people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all major businesses, Millner says, Norrell at times hit
some rough spots and sometimes ``didn't please everybody.'' But
lawsuits and vendor complaints, particularly against
multi-million-dollar companies, aren't uncommon. And many companies
that entered the health care arena with big plans later did as
Norrell did: they backed away from a venture that didn't pan out as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Millner insists those problems don't detract from his overall
plan to use business principles to make Georgia government more
efficient. ``I'm not perfect and I make mistakes,'' Millner said in
a recent interview. But ``any time we've had an issue at Norrell
where there was a difficulty when I was CEO, I quickly moved to
address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Health department citations from each state outline a plan that
Norrell promised to undertake immediately to correct the
deficiencies. Millner's campaign also pointed out that the
complaints and suits were against the company, not Millner
individually. In each of the case settlements, Norrell did not
admit wrongdoing. At least two other cases were discontinued or
granted summary judgment in Norrell's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my business success,'' Millner said. ``My record
will stack up pretty good against, frankly, any business success
story in this state. I hope that's the debate _ who's the best
business person _ because if it is, Guy Millner wins.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a tight contest, political scientists aren't surprised
at the emphasis on years-old business decisions, especially as they
relate to health care, a prominent issue this year. ``Millner has
opened himself up to this,'' said the University of Georgia's
Charles Bullock. ``When you say I will run the state as a business,
it makes it fair game to pick out the worst part and ask voters do
you really want to see this.''

 &HT;    Wachovia to buy brokerage firm
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wachovia announced Tuesday it will acquire
Interstate/Johnson Lane, a full-service securities firm
headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., for stock currently worth about
$230 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which continues the trend of brokerage industry
consolidation, was announced after the market closed. Wachovia
stock closed at $82.75, down $2.56 1/4. Interstate/Johnson Lane
shares closed at $37, up $3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fills a hole for Wachovia,'' said Robinson-Humphrey
analyst John Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia has relatively little visibility in the securities
business, no full-service retail brokerage system and no
stock-underwriting capability. It will now have all these along
with 63 offices in Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McCoy, chief financial officer of Wachovia, said that
excluding merger costs, the acquisition will not diminish 1999
earnings and will add to them in 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Morgan, chief executive of Interstate/Johnson Lane,
said his firm approached Wachovia about six or seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have made it alone,'' he said, but the ``changing
landscape'' of the world as well as the securities business
prompted the search for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan will become chief executive of a new subsidiary to be
called Wachovia Securities. But that's just the legal name, and the
banking company will continue to use the familiar name,
Interstate/Johnson Lane, in combination with Wachovia, McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said he expects ``a statistically insignificant number of
job losses at either firm,'' but Wachovia has established a $23
million kitty to keep the brokerage firm's employees from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia employs about 22,000, including 5,000 in Atlanta.
Interstate/Johnson Lane has about 250 employees in Atlanta and
1,500 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia said that, in order to prevent earnings per share
dilution, it intends to repurchase in the open market a number of
its shares equal to those used for the purchase. Those would be in
addition to a stock buyback program previously announced. The
banking company said it may also purchase shares of
Interstate/Johnson Lane prior to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of Interstate/ Johnson Lane, just three major
independent Southeastern securities firms will remain:
Nashville-based J.C. Bradford, Memphis-based Morgan Keegan and St.
Petersburg-headquartered Raymond James &AMP; Associates.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ AIDS is cutting the life expectancy in many
African countries and will effectively reduce their populations
within the next 10 to 15 years, according to a report to be
released on Wednesday by the Population Division of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The report, part of a world population survey for 1998, says
AIDS has achieved pandemic proportions in several of 34 sub-Saharan
countries where at least one in four people is infected with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, the hardest hit country in sub-Saharan Africa, life
expectancy, which stood at 61 years only five years ago, has
dropped to 47 years and is expected to drop further to 41 years
between 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where one of every five adults is infected with
HIV, the high mortality rate is significantly reducing the
country's population and its growth, from 3.3 percent a year
between 1980 and 1985 to 1.4 percent now and a projection of less
than 1 percent beginning in 2000. Had it not been for the virus,
Zimbabwe's population would have been growing at a projected rate
of 2.4 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 30 million persons in the world currently infected by
HIV, 26 millions, or 86 percent, reside in these 34 countries. In
addition, 91 percent of all AIDS deaths in the world have occurred
in these 34 countries,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As the virus spreads through Africa, experts said it is changing
the demographic profile of the continent, the daily rhythm of life,
and the outlook for tens of million of people.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also stress that AIDS is making its way through populous
countries like India, China and Brazil where the huge populations
result in a faster spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most affected are young people between the ages of 10 and 24. Of
the estimated 7,000 daily infections around the world, half are
occurring in this age bracket, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormity of the problems affecting Africa cited in
the report, the world's attention seems to have shifted from the
disease, largely because it seems to have been contained in
advanced industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people are aware of the scale,'' said
Lester Brown, president of World Watch Institute, a non-profit
environmental group in Washington that has studied the progression
of AIDS around the world. ``This alters rather dramatically the
population trends in Africa. In some countries as much as 20 to 25
percent of the population is HIV positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at global epidemics,'' Brown continued, `` one has
to go back to the 16th-century and the introduction of small pox in
the Aztec population of what is now Mexico to find anything on that
scale, and before that to the bubonic plague in Europe in the
14th-century to see that kind of heavy toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts like Brown and Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
U.N. Children's Fund, say that barring a miracle in the
pharmaceutical industry that discovers radical remedies to AIDS,
countries like Botswana and Zimbabwe will loose as much s a fifth
of their population within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Brown echoed the comments of other experts who have expressed
alarm that much of the developed industrialized countries of the
West seem to have shelved efforts to come to the aid of afflicted
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the World Health Organization survey released in June
in Geneva, which sounded a earlier alarm, much of the data used by
the United Nations was provided by the governments of the affected
countries, which often grossly understated the scale of infection
because they were worried it might interfere with tourism, for
example, or out of a nationalistic tendency to avoid the issue.

NEW EUROPEAN INVESTORS AREN'T SCARED BY MARKET FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A fresh crop of European stock owners, the result of
government privatizations of industry and a general trend toward
equity investment, has been battered by recent global market
turmoil. Yet experts say it has survived to bear fruit another day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, soaring stock markets, low returns on
government bonds and European policies that required people to take
a greater hand in shaping their pension plans prompted millions of
Europeans who had never before ventured near the stock market to
pour record amounts of money into individual equities and mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when stock-market indexes fell sharply last summer,
economists and government planners in European nations wondered how
this freshly minted generation of share owners would react. The
answer, said Claudio Fermi, a senior investment officer at Credito
Italiano, one of Italy's biggest banks, has been ``generally,
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has emerged, he and other experts said in recent
interviews, that these first-time investors have been permanently
frightened away. And indeed, though net flow of capital into stocks
and mutual funds has plummeted since August, much of the resulting
liquidity went into short-term money-market funds, apparently in
anticipation of an eventual market revival.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for such a reaction, experts say, is clear: With
interest rates at all-time lows, European investors, like their
American counterparts, have few alternatives to the stock market.
``There is a willingness to go back in if any change occurs,'' said
Andrea Fischer, a retail investment officer at Bayerische Hypo-und
Vereinsbank in Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cautious. Recent experience, they say, shows
that Europe has far to go before stocks become the investment of
choice for the middle class, as they have among many in the United
States. Forty-three percent of American adults own stocks, either
directly or through mutual funds, compared with 25 percent of
Britons and 16 percent of the French.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the European march toward a single currency,
and the tight monetary policies and low inflation that went with
it, pushed interest rates lower and lower. Those rate cuts, coupled
with the increased availability of stocks, as European governments
sold shares in formerly nationalized industries, prompted Europeans
to shift savings from bonds, insurance policies and bank accounts
into individual stocks and, even more often, mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   By March, net monthly payments into mutual funds, one of the
best gauges of investor behavior, had soared above $13 billion,
compared with less than $1 billion a month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the funds emerged as a significant force on stock
markets. Yet, in August, when global markets slumped, net payments
plunged to $2.5 billion, less than a quarter of the more than $10
billion recorded in July.
</P>
<P>
   In September, this trend apparently continued, though final
figures are not yet available, said Caroline Meroz, who follows
mutual-fund flows at Salomon Smith Barney in London. Italy, for
instance, recorded net outflows of $1.3 billion, she said, though
she described this as ``not too unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows,'' she said, ``that the Italians have become more
sophisticated, that there is more switching in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, at least, the Italian outflows were a result of
investors' diversifying out of Italian funds into European funds,
Ms. Meroz said, a process that is expected to accelerate across
Europe in coming months as the introduction in January of the
single currency, the euro, approaches and investors spread their
assets beyond national boundaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moreover, in other European countries, investors proved
resilient. In France, for example, mutual-fund contributions have
continued to slow, but the net flow has remained positive.
Similarly in Spain, which is closely watched because of the
economy's dependence on battered emerging markets, like those in
Latin America, net positive flows continued despite a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   European financial professionals are still in the early stages
of educating retail investors not to flee stocks at the first sign
of a market downturn. Thus, in 1987 and again in 1994, when
European markets slumped, large numbers of investors fled in panic
to fixed-income investments. This time, bankers and investment
managers say they are encouraged that the reaction was not as
severe. They attribute this to several factors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while Europeans have turned to mutual funds, the
funds on the whole continue to be extremely conservative. Fermi of
Credito Italiano said that only about 25 percent of assets in Italy
were invested in stocks; the rest are in fixed-income instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while many European investors still prefer bonds,
bankers in several countries said they had seen a greater
inclination this time around, as in the United States, to park
assets in money-market funds and await a stock-market upswing. And
some investors have even been scouring the lists, pushing to invest
as prices dip. ``There is a desire to purchase,'' Fermi said,
``though it is not yet widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts cautioned that mutual-fund flows in Europe
would continue to be more volatile than in the United States, not
least because of the absence as yet of tax-based incentives to
stock ownership, that ensure regular monthly flows into funds.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Britain, Ms. Meroz of Salomon Smith Barney
said, ``in Europe, you still don't have 401(k)s, IRAs, tax breaks _
so it's not going to be as smooth as that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, the absence of alternatives for investors
ensures that the trend will continue. ``I don't think it will stop
long term, but it will slow down,'' she said, adding: ``It's the
wave of the future. You have to put your money somewhere.''

HURRICANE WON'T STEAL GLENN'S THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Hurricane Mitch turned its back Tuesday
on John Glenn's return to orbit, clearing the way for the world's
oldest rocket jock to blast off from this barrier island where
space history gets made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now 100 percent to go,'' said Ed Priselac, a weather
forecaster with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
A day earlier, a concerned Priselac said there was only a 60
percent chance the weather would cooperate for Thursday's scheduled
launch of Glenn and six crewmates aboard the space shuttle
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But with the powerful hurricane heading toward Honduras, and a
cooperative high pressure system settling over Launch Pad 39B,
Priselac and other NASA officials said their earlier fears of high
winds had evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   It was an equally placid day for the Discovery crew. After
arriving here Monday amid mechanical delays and minor glitches,
Glenn and his crewmates spent Tuesday morning reviewing their roles
aboard the shuttle, checking equipment and undergoing brief medical
exams. The afternoon was given over to family time, though a
quarantine designed to keep the crew free from colds or infections
kept Glenn at least eight feet from his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Far more excitement was found throughout the rest of the Kennedy
Space Center and the surrounding area, which was girding for what
was expected to be the biggest onslaught of visitors since the 1969
moon launch.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 3,500 journalists and technicians requested credentials
to cover the launch, and the NASA press center was crawling with
media. More than two dozen television trucks lined the road, and
representatives of the major television networks were entrenched in
bunker-like structures from which their biggest stars will guide
live coverage throughout launch day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and more than 60 members of Congress are
expected to be on hand, and other 1960s icons such as Walter
Cronkite and Glenn's three surviving Mercury 7 colleagues plan to
offer commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The last sitting president to watch a liftoff in person was
Richard Nixon, who was present for Apollo 12 in 1969. NASA launched
during a thunderstorm, and the rocket was hit by lightning, but
without serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This time for NASA, the excitement is tinged with at least a
little worry.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials estimate that each shuttle flight has a 1-in-483
chance of exploding upon launch. Reality, however, suggests even
worse odds; there have been 91 shuttle launches to date, with one
catastrophic failure _ the 1986 Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The image of that disaster is never far from anyone's mind here.
The road leading to the space center has been renamed Challenger
Memorial Parkway. And when Glenn told his children he was going to
fly again, his son David, a doctor, immediately imagined the
terrifying y-shaped plume of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was thinking about was the replay of Challenger in my
mind,'' David Glenn said in a NASA interview. He visualized the
explosion ``over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   While any major problems with a shuttle launch would be
disastrous for the space program, NASA officials are well aware
that the stakes are even higher with this mission.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians are on high alert in light of an unusually long
four-month gap between shuttle liftoffs. Ground crews have
undergone a series of drills and fake launches ``so the guys are
sharp,'' said launch director Ralph Roe. The space center also is
still recovering from February layoffs. But an independent safety
panel has given its blessing for the launch.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's nine-day mission will concentrate on science, with
Glenn participating in 10 experiments on the effects of
weightlessness on the human body and how those effects might relate
to aging on Earth.

BUSH, MAURO STUMP WEST TEXAS CITIES, PUSH DIFFERING POSITIONS ON
EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and Democratic challenger
Garry Mauro stressed voter turnout and staked out their differing
positions on education as they stumped in several West Texas cities
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And a Lubbock official challenged Bush's commitment to Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured Lubbock-Cooper Intermediate School to promote his
efforts to end ``social promotion'' in public schools. The Cooper
district already uses the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test
to determine whether fourth-graders advance to fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed that all students in third, fifth and eighth
grades be required to pass the TAAS for promotion to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about a system that moved children through the
system who can't read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to spend $203 million on a reading program to prepare
students before they take the test. He also advocates remedial
programs and second-chance tests for students who fail.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro contends that promotion should be based on teacher
assessments rather than on a standardized test alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fourth-grader and a fifth-grader and I'm like most
parents,'' he said. ``I'm sick and tired of the TAAS test.'' He
said that teachers spend too much time preparing students for the
TAAS and not enough on other academic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   He has advocated an across-the-board teacher pay raise and
expenditures from the state's public education trust, the Permanent
School Fund, to add classrooms and reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will end social promotion the right way,'' Mauro said at
Democratic headquarters in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, the state's land commissioner, also campaigned in
Amarillo, Lubbock, Odessa, San Angelo, and Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates pushed for voter turnout, with Mauro predicting
that the victims of recent floods in South Texas, San Antonio and
suburban Houston may have other priorities than politics.
</P>
<P>
   But he also expressed optimism about Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of the Republican voters are going to think
that George Bush is a &UR;  &LR; shoo-in and are not going to be very
motivated to vote, but every Democratic voter is going to
understand I'm in a tough race and they're going to be motivated to
vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies at Abilene Christian College and in Lubbock and
Amarillo, Bush said he is working to turn out the votes on Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people who turn out to vote, the better it is for
me,'' Bush said in Abilene. ``My object is to travel the state and
encourage people to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals are predicting a low turnout in this
non-presidential election, with a lopsided race at the top of the
ticket where polls give Bush a commanding lead over Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of making inroads with traditionally Democratic
Hispanic voters, the governor, who speaks Spanish, has campaigned
in South Texas, and has made Spanish-language campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   A Lubbock official who appeared with Mauro Tuesday was skeptical
of Bush's outreach. ``When he comes to Lubbock you can't get him
out of the country clubs,'' said County Commissioner Gilbert
Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never visited the Hispanic community here. We have
never seen him in the barrio, we have never seen him in the
churches, we have never seen him in the community centers,'' Flores
said. ``He has never come to see me or anybody in my precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that he hasn't met with Flores, but said,
``I've done a lot for Hispanic parents by fixing an education
program that teaches every child to read. I've worked very hard to
make sure any of the nativist tendencies in the state of Texas
don't raise their heads. I've worked on uniting, not dividing.'' &QL;

ANTI-BIAS EFFORT ROILS CITY WHERE BEATEN GAY DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ When Matthew Shepard died in a hospital
here Oct. 12, this prairie city was a fleeting focus of national
concern over anti-gay violence. At the Poudre Valley Hospital, a
Web site for Shepard, the 21-year-old college student who was
beaten in Wyoming, drew 15,000 e-mail messages for his family and
815,000 hits from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now voters here are debating more vociferously than ever two
initiatives on next week's ballot that would expand the
anti-discrimination ordinance to include ``sexual orientation.''
And some old attitudes remain unchanged by the the case of Shepard,
who is believed to have been attacked in part because of his
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was handing out stickers on a parade route, and one boy held
out his hand for one,'' recalled Bob Lenk, spokesman for a group
promoting the ordinance change. ``His mother said, `You put that on
him, and I'll break your arm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Shepard's legacy may be a softening of attitudes
toward homosexuals, and a heightened awareness of anti-gay
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen new faces walking in the door, asking for yard
signs, asking to help,'' said Terry Summers, executive director of
the Lambda Community Center, a local gay group that supports the
initiatives. ``The middle-of-the-road has come to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any polls to gauge public opinion, it is still unclear
whether the 80,000 voters of the city where Shepard died will vote
to extend anti-discrimination protection to gay men and lesbians.
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a Washington group, knows
of only three other municipalities where similar statutes are up
for vote next week: Fayetteville, Ark., and two towns in Maine,
South Portland and Ogunquit.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Collins, which grew up around a land grant agricultural
college, Colorado State University, is well outside Colorado's
``granola belt.'' In this state, ordinances protecting homosexuals
from discrimination exist only in Denver, Boulder and the mountain
resort towns of Aspen, Crested Butte and Telluride _ all known for
their liberalism. The passage of an anti-gay discrimination
ordinance here could indicate a shift in middle America's attitudes
toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Collins, a fast-growing city of 110,000 residents,
Republicans account for the largest bloc of registered voters, 38
percent. Twenty-six percent are Democrats, and the rest are
unaffiliated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the City Council rejected, 6 to 1, a bill to expand
anti-discrimination protection to gay people. In a referendum later
that year, 43 percent of voters supported the idea. But last March
3, the City Council voted unanimously to approve extending the
city's Human Rights Code to offer protection to gay people.
</P>
<P>
   The shift appeared to mirror a larger shift across the country.
A Time/CNN poll conducted of 1,036 Americans after Shepard's death
found that 64 percent of respondents saw gay relationships as
``acceptable,'' compared with 41 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic there is a whole different feeling today than
in 1988 _ more mainstream people are willing to step forward,''
said Susan Kirkpatrick, the lone council member to vote for the
ordinance change a decade ago and who is now running as a Democrat
to represent Colorado's 4th District in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After Shepard's death, the City Council seemed to be so eager to
build support for the initiatives that it tentatively scheduled a
``Hate Awareness Week'' to coincide with the Nov. 3 election. But
officials abandoned the idea after deciding that the effort might
be construed as using public money to influence an election.
</P>
<P>
   Although opponents of the measure temporarily halted their
campaign during Shepard's hospitalization here, the proposal has
deeply split this otherwise easygoing suburban city, where one
quarter of the residents work or study at the university. Known for
its green spaces, low crime rate, and light traffic, Fort Collins
was ranked in July by Money magazine as the best small city in the
West to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, The Fort Collins Coloradoan, the local newspaper, is
filled with letters about the referendum. Among religious leaders
here, 28 have formed a group to support the ordinance change, and
53 formed another group to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Colorado's Roman Catholic archbishop, Charles Chaput,
wrote a column highlighting what he saw as flaws in the ordinance
language.
</P>
<P>
   Objecting to a clause that would extend benefits to the
``spousal equivalent'' of a worker, the archbishop wrote, ``In the
Christian understanding of marriage, no equivalent to a spouse can
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of an opposition group, Citizens for Constitutional
Freedoms, say revising the ordinance would prohibit residents from
choosing roommates according to the sex or sexual orientation they
prefer and would expand the legal definition of harassment to
include unwelcome ``verbal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Fort Collins to remain a place where people are free to
express their feelings without fear of government reprisal,'' said
James Ringenberg, a lawyer who leads the opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   These and other concerns, Ringenberg said, have fired up the
opposition movement. In the last two weeks, he said, contributions
to his group had doubled and enough volunteers had come forward to
allow opponents to canvass each of the city's 30,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad law,'' he said. ``Let's let the people of Fort
Collins decide what is the best for their city, rather than be
influenced by national politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the proposed expansion of the ordinance say that it
will not restrict free speech and that it will not restrict
people's choice of housemates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the ebb and flow of public opinion has
washed across the desk of Chris Walsh, editor of the college
newspaper here, The Rocky Mountain Collegian. Summarizing the
impact of Shepard's death on the referendum, Walsh said, ``People
are saying something has to be done, and if this is it, so be it.''

DESPITE EARLY SPURT, DOW CLOSES 66.17 LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices slumped after a strong opening Tuesday,
but traders said profit-taking rather than a shift in sentiment was
most likely the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
more than 100 points, and other broad market averages, including
the Russell 2000 index of small companies, were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   But then rumors about a possible Brazilian currency devaluation
and the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin filtered into the
market. Those rumors helped push down bank stock prices, and the
selling pressure spread from there.
</P>
<P>
   Some money managers said that a government report showing a
sharp drop in consumer confidence was another source of concern
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real reason for the market to have a reversal
other than the normal to-ing and fro-ing in a trading range I think
has a downside of 8,000 for the Dow and an upside of 8,600,'' said
Bill Allyn, the head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``What we
are seeing is just routine trading, and institutions seem to be
sitting pretty much on their hands, in no rush to get in or to get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Dow had lost 66.17 points, or 0.8
percent, and finished at 8,366.04. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 6.98, or 0.7 percent, to 1,065.34. The Nasdaq composite
index, which rallied strongly Monday, dipped 7.35, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,717.63. And the Russell 2000 index, which had advanced for
nine straight sessions, slipped 0.57 point, or 0.2 percent, to
371.50.
</P>
<P>
   More than 764 million shares were traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, a big jump from Monday, when volume was hampered by a
computer glitch that forced the Big Board to call a halt to trading
for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason the market is stalling is that there are ongoing
concerns about the impact of the global financial crisis,'' on
stocks, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has moved up, and everybody is feeling good about
that,'' he said. ``Economically sensitive sector stocks are
performing well, and the performance of small-cap stocks is a very
good sign. But everyone recognizes that a very significant
financial crisis is still ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about a possible devaluation of Brazil's currency, the
real, have circulated in the past, but a scheduled address late
Tuesday by Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was a
fresh cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso was expected to outline deficit cuts in his speech, and
some investors speculated the austerity plan might include a
devaluation of the currency, which would make it more difficult for
Brazilian companies to repay loans in dollars and would pare the
value of Brazilian securities held by banks.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-minute broadcast to the nation after the market had
closed, Cardoso said the government would propose a package of
spending cuts and tax increases designed to narrow its $60 billion
budget deficit but provided few details. Brazilian Finance Minister
Pedro Malan is expected to do so Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   News that Yeltsin had entered a health resort outside Moscow for
two weeks of treatment on the advice of his doctors was another
source of concern for bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of worries led to a sharp drop in J.P. Morgan and
Citigroup, two Dow stocks. And it pushed down prices of other
money-center bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan fell 3 9/16 Tuesday, to 89|. Citigroup dropped 2}, to 43
9/16. And Chase Manhattan, another bank with a big exposure to
Brazil, declined 2{, to 52.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks were also under pressure. Merrill Lynch fell 3
9/16, to 51]. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lost 1{, to 58 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Eagan, a managing director at Blackrock Funds, said he was
not concerned about renewed weakness in financial service company
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in the bank and brokerage stocks was profit
taking,'' he said. ``At the moment, this market will trade as much
on psychology as it will on fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices of several computer company stocks gained ground even as
investors took profits from the high-technology group.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose 1 5/16, to 144], after the company said it would buy
back as much as $3.5 billion of its stock. In the session, the
stock hit a new high of 146 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology also posted an impressive advance, gaining
1 5/16, to 15{.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks also had a hectic day.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a strong earnings report from America Online helped to
push the stock up 1, to 122; after the market closed, the company
said its profit beat expectations. Ebay, an Internet auction
company, extended its amazing rally, gaining 9[, to 82{. That gain
followed a 23-point advance Monday. But Yahoo fell 4 3/16, to
123}. &QL;

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott traded accusations of demagoguery and bad faith Tuesday in a
partisan pre-election skirmish over Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House forum on elderly women and Social
Security, said that Republicans in Congress wanted to use the
federal budget surplus to finance tax cuts, rather than to insure
the solvency of the Social Security system. The president said that
he blocked that effort by threatening to veto the Republicans' tax
bill and that he would continue to oppose any effort to spend the
surplus on anything other than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Lott had continued to insist that budget
surpluses be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. He
recalled that Lott had recently said that Clinton could not be
trusted to address the problems of Social Security and that
Republicans would wait until a new president was elected before
beginning serious work on the government retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said recently _ and repeated Tuesday _ that scandal had
eroded the president's credibility and left many wondering whether
he could be trusted to deal with important policy matters like
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hope that's just election-season rhetoric,'' the
president said in an East Room discussion of retirement security
for elderly women. He then sarcastically noted that Republicans
were willing to work with business lobbyists to kill an
administration health care proposal, tobacco legislation and a
campaign finance overhaul measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Senate majority leader will be able to find time
to work with me to save Social Security, and I certainly hope so,''
the president said with a sardonic smile.
</P>
<P>
   Barely an hour after the president finished speaking, Lott
issued a statement accusing Clinton of using Social Security to
frighten and pander to elderly voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``No politician should prey on the fears of senior Americans and
shamelessly demagogue Social Security one week before an
election,'' Lott said. ``I am committed to genuine Social Security
reform, and after the election I will work with anyone who shares
that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott then repeated a remark from 10 days earlier that infuriated
the White House and led to Tuesday's rejoinder from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's credibility crisis leaves many wondering
whether he can be trusted with such an important policy issue,''
Lott said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were delighted with Lott's response,
because polls show that the president's position on Social Security
is much more popular than Lott's.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a senior political adviser to the president, said
Clinton had not raised Social Security as a partisan issue, but had
sought bipartisan agreement on saving the budget surplus to
strengthen the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's dust-up ``is regrettable,'' Begala said with a
barely-suppressed smile. ``If the majority leader is interested in
a debate on who is more credible, who is to be trusted to save
Social Security, we will not shrink from that debate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the White House event, Clinton announced support for two
relatively minor measures similar to proposals that Congress has
twice failed to act upon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that single elderly women have among the highest
rates of poverty of any group of Americans and said that, for many
of them, Social Security ``is literally all that stands between
them and the ravages of poverty.'' He said that preserving Social
Security and expanding other retirement income programs were
critical to helping close the income gap between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revived two proposals that would expand retirement
benefits for relatively small numbers of women.
</P>
<P>
   The first would allow workers who take time off from work to
care for a baby or a sick family member to credit that time toward
vesting in a company pension plan. Workers who take advantage of
the Family and Medical Leave Act are overwhelmingly women, and many
return to work only part time, making it more difficult to vest in
pension plans, the White House noted in a fact sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The second proposal would require companies to alter the payout
provisions of pension plans for a surviving spouse. Many companies
now allow couples to save up to 50 percent of their retirement
benefits until after one spouse dies. Tuesday's proposal would
require companies to offer an option of setting aside as much as 75
percent of the retirement benefit for the surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Neither proposal would cost private employers much money, said
Dallas Salisbury, an analyst at the Employee Benefit Research
Institute. The family leave provision would affect relatively few
workers who fall just a few weeks short of the five years generally
required to vest in a pension plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And many companies already offer the 75 percent pension payout
option, which does not affect employer contributions but only the
rate at which they are paid out, Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that similar proposals had been proposed in
legislation in the past two Congresses but not acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were popular, but there are other things that were more
popular,'' Salisbury said. ``These are small proposals that affect
a quite small number of people.''

MARKET PLACE: TRYING TO TEST HOW FALSE THE POSITIVES MAY BE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the bear market over? Or is the recent rise in
stock prices just a seductive rally intended to suck investors in
before the market slides once more?
</P>
<P>
   That's what seasoned investors and traders wondered on Tuesday
as they watched the Dow Jones industrial average spurt up 101
points in the first hour of trading, and then lose it all and more
by the end of the day. The average closed Tuesday at 8,366.04, down
66.17 points, or 0.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a reversal of fortune for investors who were
beginning to regain confidence that U.S. stocks could ride out the
rest of the world's economic storms. Indeed, in the last eight
weeks or so, the Dow has risen about 1,000 points, or 13 percent,
from its Aug. 31 low of 7,539.07.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks were not the only ones to see an early rally
fizzle. The Russell 2000, the small-capitalization stock index
which has risen for two consecutive weeks, jumped 1.2 percent in
the morning, only to close down 0.57 point. Investors in bigger
Nasdaq stocks, happy to see technology companies reporting positive
earnings, could not sustain their push either.
</P>
<P>
   So where are we now? At a bull-market rest stop _ or waltzing
into a bear-market trap?
</P>
<P>
   The question may be particularly timely now because many
investors, who are relative newcomers to stocks, have not yet
experienced the trauma of a bear trap.
</P>
<P>
   During the two bear moves before this year's turmoil _ the
decline in 1990 that took stocks down 21 percent and the 1987 crash
_ there were no intermittent bear-market rallies to sucker
investors. As a result, those who have been in stocks for only 10
years or so may not realize that bear markets can have deceptively
sharp rallies that only serve to lure investors in, and then take
them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of bear markets we've seen haven't lasted long
enough to test people's psyches,'' said Charles White, president of
Avatar Associates, a money-management firm in New York with $3.5
billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   And while he noted that the market's breadth has improved _ the
number of stocks going up has risen considerably from a month ago _
White added, ``It still seems as though we're challenged to break
out of some levels, which indicates that this is nothing more than
a rally in a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear-market rallies are particularly vicious, because they last
just long enough to lull investors back into a bullish mood. In the
1973-74 bear market, for example, when stocks fell 45 percent over
22 months, there were three meaningful rallies that _ erroneously _
led investors to believe the worst was over. And in the 36 percent
decline that began in December 1968 and lasted until May 1970,
investors were also treated to three such rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest ``gotcha'' of all was in 1930 _ when stocks
recovered from the brutal decline of 1929 that took the Dow average
down almost 48 percent. In early 1930, stocks rose almost 50
percent, and then crashed, losing 83 percent of their value in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   As in most downturns, investors today are hoping that the pain
they have been through this year is all they will have to endure.
Sometimes markets do go straight down and then rebound. In 1962,
stocks fell 27.1 percent in six months, and then bounced back into
a four-year bull market that produced compound average returns of
19 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Kral, a portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP;
Jacobsen in New York, is arguing against such a recovery now.
``Nothing that's happened over the past four weeks has changed the
longer-term outlook for the economy which will drive the market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year we've seen enough of the props of the
economy _ exports and profits _ start to be chipped away so that
growth is now threatened,'' Kral said.
</P>
<P>
   The final and most important prop is the consumer, who accounts
for two-thirds of the nation's economic growth. On Tuesday the
Conference Board said that earlier this month consumer confidence
fell to its lowest level in nearly two years. If consumers pull
back on their purchases, the economy will slow significantly.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors have had reason to be optimistic. The
biggest lift has come from the Federal Reserve Board, which has cut
rates twice since the end of September. Lower interest rates are
always a positive, since lower borrowing costs can mean higher
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   And concentrated rate cuts are extra-bullish. Market historians
note that in three of four cases when the Fed has cut rates twice
in a row, stocks rise an average of 19 percent in the ensuing three
months. Since the Fed last cut rates on Oct. 15, stocks are up
almost 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More support for stocks has come from a raft of upbeat earnings
announcements. Companies as diverse as IBM, Estee Lauder, Amgen and
Northern Telecom have posted better-than-expected numbers recently.
</P>
<P>
   But with most third-quarter earnings announcements completed,
the bounce from positive surprises is probably already built into
stock prices. As a result, Kral believes that the market is at a
danger point.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that the nation's employment cost index, out
Thursday morning, will once again focus investors on rising labor
costs and declining corporate profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``GDP growth slowing and labor costs going up are not good from
a profit standpoint,'' he said. ``There's a lot of risk in the
market here.''

NATO SUSPENDS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NYT) 
(sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO suspended its immediate threat to attack
Yugoslavia on Tuesday, concluding that President Slobodan Milosevic
was now in ``substantial compliance'' with demands to end his
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives in Brussels voted to postpone the deadline
indefinitely after international observers confirmed that scores of
Serbian-led army and paramilitary units had withdrawn from the
province of Kosovo or at least returned to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the major pullout, confusion persisted on TUesday over
the exact numbers of troops still in Kosovo, and it appeared that
NATO had eased its initial demands on the number of special
paramilitary police officers it was prepared to allow to remain in
the Yougoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tuesday's decision averts any immediate strikes against
Yugoslavia, NATO did not lift the threat of force completely.
Instead, the alliance's 16 member countries agreed to extend
indefinitely a so-calledactivation order that authorizes the use of
force and keeps more than 400 NATO warplanes on alert.
</P>
<P>
   That means that NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
could still order strikes at any time if Milosevic resumes his
crackdown, though NATO's political representatives would have to
take a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the last-minute withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces, whose tanks and armored vehicles began abandoning
fortified positions in Kosovo on the eve of the NATO deadline. But
Clinton warned that Milosevic now had to move ahead with his pledge
to allow greater political freedoms for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, which has long suffered under Serbian domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's willingness to act, combined with determined diplomacy,
created this chance to end the suffering and repression in Kosovo
and to put its people on the path to peace,'' Clinton said on
Tuesday afternoon at the beginning of an address at the Old
Executive Office Building. ``But this is a chance, not a
guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The retreat of Serb forces _ which on Tuesday encouraged some
ethnic Albanians to return to homes they had fled during the worst
fighting over the summer _ was an abrupt turn in NATO's showdown
with Milosevic. Only a couple of days ago, senior NATO and American
officials had warned that Milosevic was continuing to violate a
pledge he made two weeks ago to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's representatives first authorized military strikes on Oct.
13, but then gave Milosevic four days to comply with a U.N.
Security Council resolution that called for a peaceful resolution
of the fighting. The conflict has left hundreds dead and has driven
an estimated 250,000 from their homes, threatening stability
throughout the Balkans. The first deadline was extended 10 more
days, until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals averted _ for now _ the specter of NATO cruise
missiles and attack jets battering Yugoslav military targets. It
was a threat that NATO first brandished in the spring when
Milosevic's crackdown began, then let languish over the summer,
then revived in the fall but one which, in the end, many in the
alliance fervently hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite deep reservations about the use of force against a
sovereign country for actions within its borders, NATO and
administration officials maintained on Tuesday that it was only the
threat of force that compelled Milosevic to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is
presented with the credible threat of force,'' NATO's secretary
general, Javier Solana, said after Tuesday's meeting in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now turns to Milosevic's pledges to offer greater
political freedoms in Kosovo and to accept unprecedented
international verification of those pledges, as he vowed to do in
an agreement brokered by the American special envoy to the region,
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, NATO on Tuesday formally approved an alliance-led
mission to conduct unarmed, reconnaissance flights over Kosovo.
Those flights began 10 days ago when American U-2 spyplanes
starting soaring over Yugoslav airspace, but Tuesday's vote clears
the way for other nations to join in, including other NATO members
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also ordered its military commanders to speed up plans for
a ``rapid reaction'' force that would be based in neighboring
Macedonia, ready, if needed, to evacuate the international monitors
that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
supposed to start sending into Kosovo in the next few weeks as part
of Milosevic's agreement with Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the latest withdrawals, the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav
army and police will still be able to keep thousands of troops in
Kosovo. NATO and U.S. officials have insisted that Milosevic reduce
those troops to the levels present in the province before the
fighting began in late February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Clark, in a meeting with Milosevic, demanded that
the number of special police in the province be reduced to 6,500,
senior administration official said at the time. On Tuesday a
senior Defense Department official said that even after the latest
withdrawals, 10,000 special police remained.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Clinton administration's greatest fears _ which
officials have largely avoided expressing publicly _ is that the
ethnic Albanians bent on independence for the province will regroup
and resume fighting. It was the success of their insurgency in the
spring that prompted Yugoslavia's crackdown, which quickly spread
from rebel strongholds to entire villages of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected the loosely knit insurgents would agree to
lay down their arms, a senior Defense Department official replied
that the possibility was ``dicey.'' And he went on to note that the
agreement allows Milosevic every right to order his army back on
the offensive if the rebels strike.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are reports that the rebels _ known as the Kosovo
Liberation Army, or KLA._ have returned to areas being vacated over
the last two days by Serbian forces. With NATO's deadline
approaching, the United States held extensive discussions with the
rebels, urging them to refrain from attacking retreating Serbs or
otherwise provoking retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be surprised if the KLA didn't seek to move into
areas where the Serbs left,'' the State Department's spokesman,
James Rubin, said. ``That's simply a reality of Kosovo. That's part
of the continuing crisis of Kosovo, that there are too many guns
and too many people willing to use those guns.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ When Matthew Shepard died in a hospital
here Oct. 12, this prairie city was a fleeting focus of national
concern over anti-gay violence. At the Poudre Valley Hospital, a
Web site for Shepard, the 21-year-old college student who was
beaten in Wyoming, drew 15,000 e-mail messages for his family and
815,000 hits from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now voters here are debating more vociferously than ever two
initiatives on next week's ballot that would expand the
anti-discrimination ordinance to include ``sexual orientation.''
And some old attitudes remain unchanged by the the case of Shepard,
who is believed to have been attacked in part because of his
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was handing out stickers on a parade route, and one boy held
out his hand for one,'' recalled Bob Lenk, spokesman for a group
promoting the ordinance change. ``His mother said, `You put that on
him, and I'll break your arm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Shepard's legacy may be a softening of attitudes
toward homosexuals, and a heightened awareness of anti-gay
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen new faces walking in the door, asking for yard
signs, asking to help,'' said Terry Summers, executive director of
the Lambda Community Center, a local gay group that supports the
initiatives. ``The middle-of-the-road has come to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any polls to gauge public opinion, it is still unclear
whether the 80,000 voters of the city where Shepard died will vote
to extend anti-discrimination protection to gay men and lesbians.
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a Washington group, knows
of only three other municipalities where similar statutes are up
for vote next week: Fayetteville, Ark., and two towns in Maine,
South Portland and Ogunquit.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Collins, which grew up around a land grant agricultural
college, Colorado State University, is well outside Colorado's
``granola belt.'' In this state, ordinances protecting homosexuals
from discrimination exist only in Denver, Boulder and the mountain
resort towns of Aspen, Crested Butte and Telluride _ all known for
their liberalism. The passage of an anti-gay discrimination
ordinance here could indicate a shift in middle America's attitudes
toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Collins, a fast-growing city of 110,000 residents,
Republicans account for the largest bloc of registered voters, 38
percent. Twenty-six percent are Democrats, and the rest are
unaffiliated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the City Council rejected, 6 to 1, a bill to expand
anti-discrimination protection to gay people. In a referendum later
that year, 43 percent of voters supported the idea. But last March
3, the City Council voted unanimously to approve extending the
city's Human Rights Code to offer protection to gay people.
</P>
<P>
   The shift appeared to mirror a larger shift across the country.
A Time/CNN poll conducted of 1,036 Americans after Shepard's death
found that 64 percent of respondents saw gay relationships as
``acceptable,'' compared with 41 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic there is a whole different feeling today than
in 1988 _ more mainstream people are willing to step forward,''
said Susan Kirkpatrick, the lone council member to vote for the
ordinance change a decade ago and who is now running as a Democrat
to represent Colorado's 4th District in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After Shepard's death, the City Council seemed to be so eager to
build support for the initiatives that it tentatively scheduled a
``Hate Awareness Week'' to coincide with the Nov. 3 election. But
officials abandoned the idea after deciding that the effort might
be construed as using public money to influence an election.
</P>
<P>
   Although opponents of the measure temporarily halted their
campaign during Shepard's hospitalization here, the proposal has
deeply split this otherwise easygoing suburban city, where one
quarter of the residents work or study at the university. Known for
its green spaces, low crime rate, and light traffic, Fort Collins
was ranked in July by Money magazine as the best small city in the
West to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, The Fort Collins Coloradoan, the local newspaper, is
filled with letters about the referendum. Among religious leaders
here, 28 have formed a group to support the ordinance change, and
53 formed another group to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Colorado's Roman Catholic archbishop, Charles Chaput,
wrote a column highlighting what he saw as flaws in the ordinance
language.
</P>
<P>
   Objecting to a clause that would extend benefits to the
``spousal equivalent'' of a worker, the archbishop wrote, ``In the
Christian understanding of marriage, no equivalent to a spouse can
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of an opposition group, Citizens for Constitutional
Freedoms, say revising the ordinance would prohibit residents from
choosing roommates according to the sex or sexual orientation they
prefer and would expand the legal definition of harassment to
include unwelcome ``verbal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Fort Collins to remain a place where people are free to
express their feelings without fear of government reprisal,'' said
James Ringenberg, a lawyer who leads the opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   These and other concerns, Ringenberg said, have fired up the
opposition movement. In the last two weeks, he said, contributions
to his group had doubled and enough volunteers had come forward to
allow opponents to canvass each of the city's 30,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad law,'' he said. ``Let's let the people of Fort
Collins decide what is the best for their city, rather than be
influenced by national politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the proposed expansion of the ordinance say that it
will not restrict free speech and that it will not restrict
people's choice of housemates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the ebb and flow of public opinion has
washed across the desk of Chris Walsh, editor of the college
newspaper here, The Rocky Mountain Collegian. Summarizing the
impact of Shepard's death on the referendum, Walsh said, ``People
are saying something has to be done, and if this is it, so be it.''

 &HT;    Injuries will make Falcons dig deep
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the Atlanta Falcons as injured now as they have
been in recent memory, the obvious question is: Where's the depth?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves' team will be looking for replacements at
several positions this week because of knee injuries to starting
cornerback Ronnie Bradford and kick returner/wide receiver Tim
Dwight, each expected to miss six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no guarantee that starting quarterback Chris
Chandler (shoulder/ribs), starting defensive tackle Travis Hall
(bruised knee) and starting middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle (ankle)
will be able to play Sunday against the St. Louis Rams (2-5).
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: The Falcons (5-2) will get an up-close
look at the first draft choice of the Reeves era. Second-year
cornerback Michael Booker, the No. 11 overall pick of the 1997
draft, replaces Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler can't play, second-year man Tony Graziani or 17-year
veteran Steve DeBerg will start. If Hall can't play, first-year
tackle Shawn Swayda _ cut as an end last year by the Bears _ will
dress for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight will be replaced as kickoff returner by Elijah Williams,
a rookie, and at receiver by Jammi German, another rookie.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Falcons might have had the luxury of plugging
in a six- or seven-year veteran in these spots. But the advent of
the NFL's salary cap in 1993 has changed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, like most teams, have a payroll that is weighted
heavily toward the salaries of a handful of players at the top, and
as a result, the roster is heavily populated by inexpensive,
inexperienced players elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Counting salaries and pro-rated signing bonuses, Chandler ($3.5
million), linebackers Cornelius Bennett ($3.45 million) and Jessie
Tuggle ($3.45 million), cornerback Ray Buchanan ($3 million), left
tackle Bob Whitfield ($3 million) and defensive end Chuck Smith
($2.6 million), wide receivers Terance Mathis ($1.9 million) and
Tony Martin ($1.45 million) and Booker ($1.42 million) count $23.77
million against this year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   That means nine players account for almost half _ 47.5 percent _
of the $50 million payroll. The other 44 players on the active
roster and five on the practice squad account for most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to pay for a lot of depth and stay under the
salary cap,'' Reeves said. ``A lot of times, you're going to keep
(more rookies), because they're at the minimum (NFL salary).''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons this season kept eight of nine draft choices plus
undrafted rookie tackle Jose Portilla. Last year, they kept all
nine draft choices, and seven are still on the team.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten too expensive to keep players around a long time
to see if they develop. The minimum NFL salary for a five-year
veteran is $325,000; for rookies, it's $158,000.
</P>
<P>
   A new NFL rule says a player with four or more years of
experience who is on the opening-day roster has his salary
guaranteed, even if cut. So, even if a mid-career guy isn't
performing, a team might not be able to afford to cut him.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap leaves less room for error in personnel
decisions, and teams often have to live with those errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons thought Corey Louchiey would be an upgrade at right
tackle and gave him a $500,000 signing bonus in the spring. If he
made the team, his salary-cap number would have been $750,000.
Instead, rookie Ephraim Salaam, with a $158,000 cap number, is
starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are holding onto most of their (good) players,'' said
Falcons vice president of football operations Ron Hill, who looked,
but couldn't find, a seasoned alternative to Louchiey.
</P>
<P>
   The money situation places greater emphasis on the draft. Teams
have to get it right the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Booker's litmus test is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before free-agency, once you drafted that guy he was yours for
his entire career,'' Hill said. ``Players didn't have a choice to
leave you other than by trade or waiver. You could take more time
to develop them. A lot of times now, you can't wait.

 &HT;    After tackle positions, are owners getting their money's worth?
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Minnesota Vikings are paying John Randle $12.5
million this year to figure out how to split a double-team block,
not the atom. It turns out, though, the five-time Pro Bowl
performer is almost as much a scientist as he is one of the NFL's
premier defensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the first seven years of his NFL career seeking
fame and fortune, toiling in a crowded laboratory between the
offensive tackles, Randle discovered recognition during a brilliant
1997 season. Then, he found remuneration this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, suggested Randle, 30, had been right under his nose
tackle all the while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the run is great, but when you knock down the
quarterback time and again, somebody is going to pay you almost as
much as they're paying those quarterbacks,'' said Randle, who last
year became the first defensive tackle to lead the NFL in sacks (15
1/2) since they became an official statistic in 1982. ``And if you
can do it from the tackle position, you really become a hot
commodity. People put a premium on us guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The offseason validated Randle's hypothesis that a high profile
translates into big dollars. Desperate for defenders to pressure
from the inside, counter the trend toward shorter pass drops and
still clog the inside against the run, teams created a nouveau
riche subset at the tackle position.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale was that, with quarterbacks getting rid of the
ball faster in the West Coast-style offenses, defensive ends were
frustrated having to claw their way to a passer who already had
unloaded. Tackles can exert more immediate pressure and take a more
direct route into the backfield. The evolution of the pass rush
appeared to be gravitating from the edge of the defense toward the
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Randle lead the NFL in sacks, but another tackle,
Dana Stubblefield of San Francisco, was the runner-up. As
unrestricted free agents Randle stayed in Minnesota, Stubblefield
relocated to Washington, and both got rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was a seller's market (for defensive tackles) in
free-agency,'' said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, who bid
unsuccessfully for Randle and Sean Gilbert. ``Everybody wanted that
big inside guy who could get to the passer. It was the marquee
position.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that veteran tackles with even modest credentials
cashed in big. Eight-year veteran Ray Agnew, who had just two of
his 11 career sacks with the New York Giants in 1997, landed a
four-year, $8.1 million deal, including a $2 million signing bonus,
from St. Louis. Bill Johnson, a journeyman run-stuffer with
documented off-field problems, signed for two years, $3.9 million
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that,'' Johnson said, ``was chump change compared to a lot
of (tackles).''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen defensive tackles signed contracts worth more than $3
million per year, and eight got deals valued at more than $5
million annually. The 12 tackles collected an aggregate $80.55
million in signing bonuses and the collective worth of the dozen
deals is $325.24 million.
</P>
<P>
   For those tackles who had labored in obscurity for years,
saddled by the traditional job description as strictly a
run-stuffer, such sudden financial reward seemingly meant new-found
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become the new glamour position,'' Tampa Bay tackle
Warren Sapp said after signing a six-year, $35.47 million deal.
``Now it's our turn, man, to get some of that glitz and glitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks into the season, the tackle position has lost some
luster. The results are mixed at best, especially with the failure
of Redskins tackles Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson to make an
impact. The Redskins are paying the tandem $16.4 million this year
in signing bonuses and base salaries. Through seven games
Stubblefield and Wilkinson have combined for 39 solo tackles and
four sacks. The Skins are 0-7, and their defense ranks No. 26
overall in the league. It is 28th against the run, after finishing
No. 28 last year and 30th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed during his five seasons in San Francisco to an
aggressive and penetrating style, Stubblefield has struggled
converting to the two-gap approach that's dictated by the
Washington scheme. It is a technique that neutralizes his innate
quickness, holds him accountable for the gaps to both sides of the
blocker and forces him to hand-fight at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   An underachiever during four seasons in Cincinnati, ``Big
Daddy'' Wilkinson, the first selection in the '94 draft, has been a
source of frustration for long-time defensive-line coach Earl
Leggett. His work habits are only marginally better than when he
was with the Bengals and, while he has generated inside pressure,
Wilkinson frequently has been blown away by less-talented guards in
the running game.
</P>
<P>
   In their 31-10 victory at Washington Oct. 4, the Dallas Cowboys
secured the triumph with an 11-play, 96-yard touchdown drive. All
11 plays were runs and eight, for 79 yards, were directed at
Wilkinson or Stubblefield.
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield denied last week that he feels the pressure of
living up to the investment that Washington, and, after a long
meeting with defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, his performance has
improved the last three outings. Still, Stubblefield's attempt to
justify the fat paycheck is a factor in his subpar play, one
opponent suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it in the man's eyes,'' Dallas guard Nate Newton
said. ``You almost see the wheels turning like, `I've got to make
this play.' He's taking himself out of plays with bad angles,
sloppy technique. Oh, yeah, he's pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield and Wilkinson aren't the only defensive tackles who
haven't lived up to the press clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who played the first month of '98 with a broken hand,
hasn't been much of a force at right end in Carolina's 3-4 front.
Some of Eric Swann's attitude problems have resurfaced in Arizona,
and he still just leans into people on too many snaps. Miami tackle
Tim Bowens has played the run well but doesn't have a sack. Chester
McGlockton, who went from Oakland to AFC West rival Kansas City,
underwent back surgery the day before the season began. He saw his
first action Monday night against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 13 of 39 defenders with eight sacks or more were
tackles. Nearing the halfway point of this season, just two tackles
are in the top 10 in sacks. Nine tackles are on pace to get eight
sacks for the season. The sack leaders among tackles, Jim Flanigan
of Chicago and Bryant Young of San Francisco, have 6 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   All franchises covet a dominating tackle, but some scouts now
think that free agents at the position benefited from the overall
dearth of front seven talent in a diluted league. They are quick to
rebutt the notion that the game has moved in the direction of more
athletic interior players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every one of those big guys had questions hanging over
them,'' San Diego personnel director Billy Devaney said. ``You can
say the game was moving toward the tackles because that's where the
money went. But it's more a function of not having enough of the
speed-rushers around. If you can find anybody who can pressure the
quarterback, no matter what position, his marketability is going to
be unbelievable. If there is a tackle who can give you any
semblance of a pass rush, it jacks the value up. But when you look
at the tackles who got all the money ... most of them had some
history of not playing up to their contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the Skins' interior shortcomings of the past few
seasons _ when club management was convinced that a porous front
four cost them a shot at the playoffs _ most personnel men agreed
that they might have taken the same road as Washington general
manager Charley Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledged that, even with the mixed results of '98,
defensive tackles might be worth gambling millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona personnel director Bob Ferguson said, ``(Casserly) paid
what it takes. He needed two of those guys, and it cost him plenty.
But you know what? If he hadn't paid it, some other team would
have. (Defensive tackles) are like gold.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ The preliminary damage tally from the recent Texas
floods doubled to almost $831 million Tuesday, as federal disaster
officials opened five new relief centers offering aid and loans to
displaced homeowners and businesses in 25 counties.
</P>
<P>
   According to initial damage estimates by 20 of the counties that
have been declared federal disaster areas, $570 million worth of
homes, $53.7 million worth of businesses and $207 million worth of
roads and bridges were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The flood killed 29 people; two more are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18,000 structures affected, the estimates show more than
half were destroyed or severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disaster area covers more than 21,000 square miles _ about
the size of West Virginia,'' said Tom Millwee, state emergency
coordinator. ``This is a large area with a lot of damage and a lot
of a debris.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials cautioned against putting too much
credence in the rising damage estimate. Some of the figures are
probably more ``guess-timate'' than estimate, they said, until
on-site appraisals can be completed in coming weeks, including
appraisals of damage that is covered by private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Millwee and other officials said the latest numbers
illustrate the severity of the flooding. Initially, they said it
could compare to the devastation from flooding that struck
Southeast Texas four years ago, killing about 30 people.
</P>
<P>
   The initial damage estimate last week was about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Robert Hendrix, who heads Federal Emergency
Management Agency relief efforts, announced that five local relief
centers will open today in New Braunfels, San Antonio, Cuero,
Victoria and Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, federal relief officials expect to have more
than 300 people at work in a north Austin headquarters that opened
Sunday. They will coordinate and support hundreds of other state
and federal relief workers who have fanned out across the
devastated areas _ offering victims face-to-face help in finding
temporary housing, making repairs to their damaged homes and
businesses, assistance with federal loan paperwork and arranging
for removal of dead animals and other debris.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, Hendrix said, 10,300 people had applied for
federal disaster assistance through a special toll-free phone line
set up last week. More than 4,800 people already have filed federal
flood insurance claims, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen shelters remained open, housing 481 people. A convoy of
mobile homes were being assembled for transfer to hard-hit Cuero to
provide temporary homes, as Army soldiers opened a shower tent to
let homeless residents wash up.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush issued an executive order waiving all title
fees involving manufactured homes for victims of the recent floods
that struck Central and South Texas, the Houston area and Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said the order will save Del Rio victims $140 in fees
per home and will simplify their purchases. FEMA officials said
about 200 manufactured homes are being made available to Del Rio
residents whose homes were destroyed in the August floods.

 &HT;    Magee taking it easy in bonus rounds
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andrew Magee, instead of fretting Sunday whether he
had blown his shot to make the Tour Championship and scrolling
nervously through the PGA Tour's website, took son Campbell to a
Scottsdale, Ariz., bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually discovering Sunday night that Smyrna's Stewart Cink
had finished 51st at Walt Disney World and failed to catch him at
No. 30 on the money list, Magee classified all that happens this
week at East Lake Golf Club as pure bonus minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't expect to play,'' he said. ``It's nice to get
a reprieve to play one more week. Maybe I can find some magic out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, not only has Magee finished 30th
and grabbed the final spot in the $4 million season-ending event,
but an Atlanta player again has been closed out at No. 31. Last
year Magee finished ahead of Atlanta's Billy Andrade by less than
$5. Sunday, Cink, an East Lake member who had been relishing a
chance to play for $720,000 this week, came up $57,054 short. That
a friend wound up disappointed muted Magee's excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of feeling for Stewart, being from here,'' Magee
said Tuesday. ``He's a lot better player than I am. He could
probably do a lot better this week playing here and having all this
local knowledge. ... Stewart told me after I missed the cut Friday
that he wanted me to make the cut so I could pass Tom (Watson at
29th), and he wouldn't have to worry about knocking me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're all friends out here,'' Magee said, ``and it's
a tough grind we go through. We all root for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When Magee shot a second-round 74 at Walt Disney, he figured
that his PGA Tour year had ended. Cink moved to a tie for eighth
after 54 holes and would have made East Lake with a solo eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `This guy's going to close it out and play
(well) and send me packing,''' Magee said. ``Which I was kind of
fine with. I really got a reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year veteran with four victories, the 36-year-old Magee
will have fun this week, if he has nothing else. He's been known to
pass $50 to loyal gallery followers to buy themselves a few beers.
Whatever transpires by Sunday, he will enjoy this week's
nothing-to-lose atmosphere and a guaranteed check of at least
$64,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing without much stress,'' he said.
``The last two weeks have been no fun at all ... I like to enjoy
myself playing. If you can't enjoy yourself here this week, you
better go see a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot 2-over-par 72 in Tuesday's pro-am _ not bad for a first
look at the course and with his game slightly tattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come out this week and totally forget what I was
doing before,'' Magee said. ``Usually, in two days, I'll come up
with something.''

 &HT;    Carter key for Georgia vs. Florida
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Can Georgia beat Florida? Perhaps I should
rephrase the question: Can Quincy Carter beat Florida?
</P>
<P>
   Not to oversimplify matters _ naturally, someone has to catch
Carter's passes, and someone has to block for him, and someone has
to play defense _ but the truth is, this Georgia season hasn't been
very complicated. Accurately described by coach Jim Donnan as ``a
good and solid team, not great,'' the Bulldogs are 6-1 because when
they have needed someone to do something special, their 21-year-old
freshman quarterback usually has done more than a little.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his performance in Georgia's two most difficult wins.
Against LSU, he accounted for 85 percent of the Bulldogs' offensive
yards _ passing, rushing, receiving. Against Kentucky, he accounted
for 79 percent of the Dogs' offense _ and became the first Georgia
player to rush for 100 yards in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Given Georgia's void at running back _ and the fact that even a
team with a stellar RB would have difficulty running against
Florida's phenomenal defensive front _ there is no apparent way for
the Dogs to beat the Gators on Saturday without another mega-game
from Carter. Heck, some people around here look at this team and
see a losing record if not for its outfielder-turned-quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd make such an impact as a freshman,''
Carter says. ``I was looking for maybe a running back to have 1,500
yards by now. The luck of the draw fell on me to do more than I
expected. It's been ... very astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, he ranks 12th in passing efficiency, just ahead of
Kentucky's Tim Couch; locally, he is just 46 yards short of leading
the Dogs in rushing. A year ago, when Georgia broke its seven-game
losing streak against Florida, he was watching on television, his
minor-league baseball season over and his sights already privately
set on being the Dogs' quarterback against the Gators this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to beat them again and prove it wasn't a fluke,''
Carter says now. ``That's really the statement we are trying to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Georgia's chances aren't great _ a team without a real
running game vs. the SEC's No. 1 defense. But the Bulldogs'
best-case scenario probably goes something like this: Hold the
Florida offense in check, benefit from the Gators' turnover
tendency, capitalize on Champ Bailey offensively, put Carter in
position to make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he'd give us a chance to be better than we actually
were _ or are,'' Donnan says. ``His ability to get out of bad plays
has helped immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   While others marvel at such plays, teammate Jonas Jennings
shrugs. ``Guys look at me when Quincy does something spectacular,
and they say, `God, did you see that?' '' the offensive lineman
said. ``I always say, `Yeah, but I've seen it before.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was a two-way lineman at Tri-Cities High School in East
Point, playing against Carter's Southwest DeKalb teams. ``I was one
of those guys who used to try to tackle him.'' And does Jennings
ever think about where this Georgia team would be without Carter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about that.

THE MUSIC OF YOUTH REBELLION EMBRACES THE FAMILY  
 RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a child,'' sang Neil Young in 1968. ``I'll last awhile.''
It was the flash point of a rock-and-roll-fueled youth explosion,
and fans identified more with Young's naive protagonist than with
the father figure making rules in the ballad's last verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Am a Child'' magnified rock's romanticization of childhood _
and of adolescence, which to most rockers means childhood plus sex.
The song traced a legacy of teen-age rebels and sweet little
16-year-olds to its origins in an emotional Never-Never Land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, though, rock and its sibling genre, hip-hop, seem
headed for a different future. On the MTV Music Video Awards, the
rapper and actor Will Smith accepted his awards accompanied by his
5-year-old son, Justin; Smith's current single, ``Just the Two of
Us,'' is an ebullient ode to the boy. Billie Joe, of the punk band
Green Day, focused his awards speech on his wife, at home awaiting
the birth of their second child.
</P>
<P>
   Performers included two cutting-edge mother figures: Courtney
Love of Hole and the evening's big winner, Madonna, whose latest
album, ``Ray of Light'' describes her spiritual awakening after the
birth of her daughter, Lourdes. Rock-and-roll, the cultural home of
perpetual adolescence, was clearly engaging the ultimate passage
into maturity: parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic realm has long provided fruitful subject matter for
musicians in other genres like country and folk, which attract
listeners of all ages and gain power from a different set of myths,
including an often sentimental view of family life. When classic
rockers have addressed their own children in song, they often
invoke these other styles, tapping their melodrama and effectively
sidestepping the conflict between such conventional feelings and
rock-and-roll rebelliousness.
</P>
<P>
   As rock-and-roll becomes a lifelong pursuit for many, however,
the debauched dream of sex, drugs and general abandon is giving way
to a new set of ambitions. Young rockers have seen Mick Jagger
become a grandfather and Bob Dylan share the pop charts with his
hit-making son, Jakob, and they are starting to question the
illusion that the rock life style could or should stave off adult
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop artists are turning their attention away from gangsta
fantasies toward realities that include child rearing. There seems
to be a growing consensus that no one really wants to die before
they grow old.
</P>
<P>
   Rockers are eager to learn how to grow up without abandoning
shared values like spontaneity and self-determination. Being a
parent is a great metaphor for that attempt, and it is also a
condition that many feel should no longer be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to infuse parenthood with rock-and-roll attitude
extends from the mainstream to the underground. Once, female
artists usually retired or at least took time off when pregnant,
but the trend today is to pick up some groovy maternity gear and
keep going, as Posh and Scary Spice are doing and Erykah Badu did.
And once the kids are born, they are not always banished to nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-rock fans can sometimes spot 4-year-old Coco Gordon
Moore, daughter of Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of the legendary
art rock band Sonic Youth, wearing huge protective headphones while
watching a concert in her mother's arms. Artists like Ms. Gordon
treat maternity as a normal part of life _ a daring concept in a
field where, not long ago, female sexuality was designated as
either fantasy material or a means of entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   To the world in general, staying childless is still the real act
of rebellion, especially for women. But within a rock-and-roll
culture struggling to maintain its youthful ideals beyond an
overspent adolescence, artists venturing into public parenthood
break a different set of constraints. ``Unsure of what the balance
held, I touched my belly overwhelmed,'' sings Lauryn Hill on ``To
Zion,'' a song dedicated to her newborn son, from her huge-selling
debut album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill (who is expecting again) has been called self-righteous
in her advocacy of old-fashioned mama power. But her songs tackle
the doubts that come with parenthood, as well as the revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retrospect for Life,'' a 1997 track Ms. Hill recorded with the
Chicago rapper Common, addresses the same uncertainties from a male
point of view. These honest portraits of commitments made under
stress acknowledge that sometimes the choice to become a parent may
be the wrong one, and that such decisions deserve consideration
beyond the self-satisfied kitsch of oldies like Paul Anka's
``You're Havin' My Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that perspective _ the man worshipfully
acknowledging mother and child, but from a safe distance _ typified
rock-and-roll's attitude toward being a parent. Most rock stars
were guys, after all, and they did not often take time off from
their schedules of playing and carousing to learn how to strain
peas for Junior.
</P>
<P>
   (One important exception is Young, who spent much of the early
1980s caring for his son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy; Young wrote
the experimental album ``Trans'' in an effort to comprehend
communicating with the boy and subsequently organized an annual
concert to benefit disabled children.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if they did engage in such matters, though, rockers rarely
wrote about them, perhaps because they contradicted the free and
easy individualism of the rock myth. Usually, when an artist turns
to domestic subjects, as Bruce Springsteen did, for example, with
the album ``Lucky Town,'' it has signaled a step away from his
rock-and-roll virility.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, though, such separations are harder to maintain. The
biggest change in pop during this decade has been the emergence of
female artists as regular and equal players instead of courageous
rarities. These new stars, like most professional women, are
refusing to choose between career and family.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneers who stood in isolation before _ Chrissie Hynde,
Sinead O'Connor, Kristin Hersh of the Throwing Muses _ are now
considered role models, instead of freaks, among the boys. These
women endured great difficulties because of their insistence that
mothering need not end their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hynde and Ms. O'Connor faced criticism and saw their record
sales drop when they turned to more domestic subjects. Ms. Hersh,
who had the first of three sons at age 19, lost custody of her
oldest, Dylan, to his father partly because she was in a touring
band. But she refused to give up her art, and the sight of her
playing Throwing Muses' jagged, hypnotic rock while huge with her
second son, Ryder, was one of the most inspirational shocks the
underground rock world got in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The way motherhood informed the artistic identity of such women
is equally subversive. Ms. Hersh's lyrics tend to be oblique, and
the erotic, fractured ballads that fill her 1998 solo album,
``Strange Angels,'' would not necessarily conjure images of
fecundity unless one knows that she wrote them while confined to
her bed with a difficult third pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersh has also frankly discussed her family life in the news
media; she kept a diary of the tour she recently took, with her two
younger sons in tow, for the Webzine Hipmama.com, and even included
her children in her publicity photograph for ``Strange Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, Ms. Hersh has set out to
prove that the rock-and-roll life style is not bad for children or
vice versa. Her proof is in the obvious health and vitality of her
sons, and of her music.
</P>
<P>
   Parents like Ms. Hersh are changing the scenes in which
contemporary music is made and heard, and, just as important,
confounding the argument that children must be protected from
rock-and-roll's dangerous influence. Others, like Liz Phair and Amy
Rigby, are making their mark through their lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rigby's 1997 debut album, ``Diary of a Mod Housewife,'' was
hailed as a groundbreaking effort because its rootsy pop songs
matter-of-factly broached subjects like marital boredom and
dead-end pink-collar jobs. These were quotidian concerns that did
not fit anyone's description of bohemian. But Ms. Rigby is
undeniably bohemian, and she was describing that world's plain
truths, not its wishful self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Her just-released second album, ``Middlescence,'' takes up her
story at a new juncture. Now a single mom, she contemplates the
drama of buying clothes off the clearance rack or trying to salvage
a date when the kids demand to stay up past their bedtime. The
album's homespun sound suits its practical attitude; Ms. Rigby's
songs capture reality instead of inflating it.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Phair goes in a similar direction on
``Whitechocolatespacegg,'' especially on the indelible ballad ``You
Go Ahead, Honey,'' which plainly and simply elucidates the strain a
new baby can put on a relationship. Once underground rock's most
famous female sexual adventurer, Ms. Phair has not compromised her
frank approach because she has settled down.
</P>
<P>
   The most triumphant thing about songs like hers and Ms. Rigby's
is that they so blithely cross lines few artists have even
approached. Just as classic rock first broached forbidden subjects
like sexuality, these women dig into the particulars of domestic
experience with a frankness that challenges propriety. Not only is
the reverent image of traditional family life violated, but rock's
rule of silence on subjects considered ``novelties,'' as Ms. Rigby
called making a living and having a family on her liner notes to
her first album, is broken.
</P>
<P>
   Neither sentimentalizing nor trivializing parenthood, today's
artists target it with the same penetrating gaze that the Who
applied to the generation gap in the 1960s. Few have done so with
such force as the inimitable Courtney Love. Ms. Love has never been
anybody's idea of the perfect mom: she had her daughter, Frances
Bean, within a maelstrom of controversy about drug use and other
irresponsible acts, then faced single parenthood when her husband,
Kurt Cobain, killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to hide her troubles, she turned them into
ferocious music. In 1994, her band, Hole, released ``Live Through
This,'' an album that staged a visceral attack on feminine
stereotypes. Songs like ``Plump'' and ``I Think That I Would Die''
took on motherhood, their images of squirting milk and screaming
hunger invoking the exhaustion, isolation and emotional
bewilderment that are the dark side of maternity.
</P>
<P>
   Hole's current album, ``Celebrity Skin,'' avoids these subjects.
But ``Live Through This'' insured that no female artist would have
to for fear of being called soft. Other daring women were not going
to stand for such dismissals, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When Sinead O'Connor returned to the spotlight with ``The Gospel
Oak,'' she filled it with lullabies about pregnancy and mothering.
And breaking an even bigger taboo, Tori Amos wrote about her recent
miscarriage on her latest album, ``From the Choirboy Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year's two best answers to the example of Ms. Love come
from men. The songs ``Father of Mine,'' by the band Everclear, and
``Carriage for Two,'' by the English hip-hop experimenter Tricky,
also rage against the damaged legacy of the nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Art Alexakis of Everclear berates a deadbeat dad for bequeathing
his son a life of alienation; he ends with a pledge to do better
for his own daughter, although his anger makes it clear that his
promise will not be easy to fulfill. ``Carriage for Two'' is more
spare, with Tricky muttering proud and protective words about his
daughter, as the sinister music builds a mood of foreboding at the
prospects of raising a black child in a racist world.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety also colors ``Dearest Christian, I'm So Very Sorry for
Bringing You Here. Love Dad,'' the new release by the progressive
soul duo P.M. Dawn. The album, inspired by the birth of a son to
the group's primary songwriter, Prince Be, confronts fatherhood
with equal parts love and apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   With the lush, soothing grooves of the music creating a
nurturing environment, Prince Be embarks on an inner journey that
puts him in contact with the ghosts of his own childhood: an
unloving mother and a father who died too young, tormentors who
made him an outcast, his own self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Prince Be's ire seems more like a sign of childishness
than of growth, but his willingness to expose these vulnerabilities
does make for a kind of cleansing. Like ``Mer Girl,'' the climactic
song on ``Ray of Light'' that sends Madonna to mourn at her
mother's grave, ``Dearest Christian'' shows a new parent uncovering
a birthright of sorrow to break free of it. He turns toward his own
son in tenderness and hope, but cannot deny his fears. The sense of
struggle that animates his testimonies.
</P>
<P>
   While past rockers rebelled against the social control exerted
by their elders, Prince Be and his peers are making art of the
effort to break patterns set down within private life. The artist
who set the stakes for these kinds of explorations was John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   On the Plastic Ono Band album ``Mother,'' Lennon brutally
exposed the psychic scars that came from the frequent absence and
early death of his mother, Julia, anticipating the therapeutic
viewpoint that often pops up in current songs. Even more
revolutionary was the role-switching he did with his wife, Yoko
Ono, which made Lennon the world's most prominent househusband, an
experience he wrote about in songs in the years before his death in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that this cultural powerhouse could retreat into the
home struck many as bizarre; in fact, it was a brave move, making
Lennon's radical politics a matter of his daily life as well as his
art.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that an artist of the baby-boom era foreshadowed
a trend so divergent from the classic rock-and-roll approach, but
such connections are key to rock's new family values.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon's son, Sean, one of rock's grooviest new talents, began
his career in a band with his mother. Rock's generation gap is
being superseded by an intergenerational dialogue about how to
uphold a legacy that encompasses much more than adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   If ``I Am a Child'' marked the high point of rock's historic
youth fetish, the new album ``The McGarrigle Hour,'' exemplifies
its changing perspective. That album features a sprawling tribe of
musicians headed by the sisters Kate and Anna McGarrigle. Other
performers include Anna's daughter, Lily Lanken; Kate's children,
Martha and Rufus Wainwright; her ex-husband, Loudon Wainwright III,
and her friends Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Chaim
Tannenbaum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its homey selection of folk songs and originals, ``The
McGarrigle Hour'' presents a fantasy of a clan gathered around the
piano that appeals as much to 20-something fans of Rufus' promising
solo career as it does to the boomers who love his mom and dad.
That they are divorced and Rufus is openly homosexual gives it a
millennial twist that is also very rock-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   When Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright were new parents,
they both wrote about the experience in songs that were sometimes
sarcastic, sometimes poignant. On his recent debut album, Rufus
returned the favor to his mom with a lovely ballad, ``Beauty
Mark,'' which is about the qualities she instilled in him.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Wainwright is his own man, but he also likes being
part of a family. Like so many young artists, he does not see a
contradiction in that.

<P>
   MORENO VALLEY, Calif. _ Four years ago, people interviewed in
this bedroom community of stucco houses, strip malls and
independent-minded voters expressed deep disappointment with
President Clinton and complained vehemently about declining wages,
rising taxes and worsening crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the bitterness about Clinton had receded as
voters raised concerns about Republican presidential nominee Bob
Dole and said his party was too extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Now, dozens of random interviews on the eve of another election
show that the outlook of voters here had shifted yet again: They do
not seem exercised about anything.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling contrast to past years, voter after voter could
not name a single burning issue that weighed heavily on them. They
could not muster enthusiasm for any candidate. They were sick of
hearing about Monica Lewinsky, and the talk of impeachment
exasperated them even more. The only political matters on their
minds, if any, were the most local of issues, like school board
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that affects me so much that I've got to vote
on it,'' said Cathy Scharwark, a 35-year-old math teacher who is an
independent. ``My life on Nov. 4 is going to be the same as on Nov.
3. I don't see how voting one way will change it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is voters like those in this fast-growing region, 75 miles
east of Los Angeles, where many people have no deep political roots
or traditions, who are confounding, and even causing alarm, among
Democratic and Republican strategists. This close to the elections,
candidates say they are still struggling, with little success, to
identify issues that engage the public. As a result, they are
aiming their appeals at a narrow, and not particularly
representative, slice of the electorate that is considered most
likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Democratic consultant Rich Neimand has likened this
campaign season to the ``Seinfeld'' television program. He says it
is about nothing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   This middle-class sprawl of seemingly endless suburbs, called
the ``Inland Empire'' is not usually a haven of apathy. In fact, it
is a pivotal area that pollsters watch closely for hints of
possible mood swings in the American electorate. In interviews in
past years, voters here were rarely at a loss for words about their
personal agenda, or politicians they supported or reviled.
</P>
<P>
   But not this month.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched over her two little girls at a pumpkin patch
here, Cindy Taylor, a 31-year-old homemaker who is a Republican,
was asked what she considered the big issues this year. ``Refresh
my memory _ tell me a couple,'' she pleaded gently. ''There's
nothing that pops straight in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the same question, Brian van den Burg, a 20-year-old
business student who is an independent, said, ``Gee, nothing in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Gene Provost, who is a 66-year-old electronics
technician, quizzed his questioner, ``Do you have any issues in
particular?''
</P>
<P>
   David Waltemeyer, 34, a fire captain who is a Republican, did
come up with a ready answer. But it was not about weighty issues.
``Safe and sane fireworks,'' he said, explaining that he was
rankled by a ballot measure which would legalize fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Waltemeyer, who was cheering his son at soccer practice, said he
was stumped to come up with any bigger issues, saying his usual
fears about the economy had been calmed. ``This year there's been
something of a recovery,'' he said. ``Things here have really
turned around in the last 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago this area, once blanketed by orange groves,
was sprinkled with foreclosed homes, the outgrowth of the economic
downturn and large military cutbacks in the area. Now, the economy
has rebounded somewhat and people are more content, and not
particularly moved by anything that is happening in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with the way things are going,'' said Andy
Stetkevich, 39, a Democrat who is a staff development official for
the local school district. ``I realize there's a lot that's going
on in Washington. But if we looked at all of Washington and dug
into all of the scandals, there might not be anybody to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one mentioned the White House scandal. When asked
about it, virtually everyone offered similar answers: They had
heard enough _ in many cases, too much _ about Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Though they condemned Clinton's
conduct, they had more pressing things to worry about, and they did
not think the president should resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to leave him alone,'' said Carol Simpson, 31, a
cosmetics saleswoman who votes Democratic. ``If Hillary can handle
it, if she's happy with it, that's her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simpson's husband, Pierre, 35, a Republican, agreed: ``He's
only got two more years in there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter after voter said the scandal would have no impact on how
they voted. ``It doesn't affect how I feel about Democrats,'' said
Diane Rowley, 43, a homemaker who is a Republican. ``What he did is
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ella Ramirez, 49, an unemployed electronics worker who is a
Democrat, said, ``You can't blame it on anyone else but him. He's
his own person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of people interviewed, only Eric Nielsen, 41, a
Democrat who said he had voted twice for Clinton, said the
president's conduct would affect how he voted for every candidate
on the ballot. Nielsen, who is the kind of voter that many pundits
expected to see more of, said he intended to vote ``across the
board for non-Democrats,'' not because he is enamored of
Republicans, but because he is so enraged at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did is his own personal business,'' said Nielsen, a
construction designer. ``But he told a stupid, silly lie. How can
you believe anything he says? It's impossible at this point.'' But
even Nielsen's indignation goes only so far. ``Impeachment seems
silly,'' he said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Greg Davis, said the scandal would cause him
to oppose Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat being challenged by state
Treasurer Matt Fong. While Davis said he was not particularly
bothered by Clinton's personal behavior, he said Ms. Boxer had
aggressively opposed Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme
Court because of accusations of sexual harassment but has been
relatively quiet about the president. (Ms. Boxer's daughter is
married to a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so tough on Clarence Thomas,'' said Davis, 37, who
designs air-conditioning systems. ``That's hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was one of the few people who even mentioned a particular
candidate. Most admitted not knowing much, if anything, about the
Senate candidates or the candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, and state Attorney General Dan Lungren, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that drew a trace of passion was a state ballot
measure that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on
Indian lands throughout the state. The proposal has been the
subject of endless commercials on television, and many people
interviewed said the tribes deserved to have the casinos after
years of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the Indians alone!'' Randy Jones, 46, a Republican who
was having a slow day selling pumpkins, said in a refrain that came
up in several interviews. ``Let them have their casinos!''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other residents here, Dee Preston, a 24-year-old
Democrat who is studying business as California State University,
blurted out several crucial concerns. But, she complained, all she
hears about is Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always on the TV for no reason at all. Just like O.J.
Simpson,'' she said. ``Even on Christmas they're going to talk
about what that man did to his wife. Leave the man alone. Let's get
some real news news: Kids getting murdered. The homeless. Kids
getting kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Preston still intends to vote, back at the pumpkin
patch, Jones, asked if he planned to go to the polls, said, ``If
they catch me.''

 &HT;    UAW members pass contract, ending Navistar strike
 &HT;    By Don Baker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ With the threat of losing their jobs fresh
in their minds, United Auto Workers members approved a contract
proposal Tuesday, ending a 24-day-old strike at Navistar's Truck
Sales Processing Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before the vote, (union leaders) said the next
ratification would be a plant closing if we didn't ratify this
contract,'' said Marshall Gregory, a 20-year employee of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the site of what was a picket line for the past
three weeks, Gregory and three other UAW members loaded wood and
signs into the back of a truck after voting Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   UAW Local 402 members voted 72-49 in favor of the contract,
while Local 658 members voted 10-0 to accept the proposal
negotiated Friday. Work at the center was expected to resume
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Bush, UAW Local 402 president, said it is possible the
company would have closed the center if the strike continued.
Navistar shipped trucks from the center to other
truck-customization operations during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have likely been sitting down negotiating a plant
closing,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Rosswurm, Navistar's Springfield spokeswoman, said the
company was pleased the five-year contract was ratified, but
wouldn't comment on whether the center faced closing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a desire to get back to work, not all employees are
pleased by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over, but I'm not happy with the results,'' said
Jim Addy, a 15-year employee.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory also said he wasn't satisfied with the deal, saying the
company should have given workers more.
</P>
<P>
   The contract ratified Tuesday was similar to the proposal
rejected Oct. 4, resulting in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic package basically stayed the same,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes a 3 percent lump sum payment the first two
years of the contract, a 2 percent general wage increase the third
year, another 3 percent lump sum payment the fourth year and a 3
percent wage increase the final year.
</P>
<P>
   UAW International financial experts evaluated the original
proposal from the company and told local union leaders that
Navistar couldn't increase the economic offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told by the International union, `Fellas, there's
nothing else there to get,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   What the union did gain is more flexibility in scheduling of
personal days off, which was the final sticking point in ending the
strike. Bush said the company also agreed to have four workers
designated as current hires rather than new hires, making them
eligible for more profit-sharing money.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Marshall, Local 658 president, said he was ``very pleased''
with the contract. The local represents the center's office
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Local 402 members said they remain disgusted with the gap in pay
between workers at the center and those at the assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you work over there across the fence, you've got it
made,'' said Herb Harris as he pointed toward the assembly plant
next to the processing center.
</P>
<P>
   Top pay at the assembly plant on U.S. Route 68 is about $22 per
hour, compared to about $15 per hour under the new contract at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Workers also said they are still grieving the death of Jonathan
McCurry, a 31-year-old striker who was struck and killed by a car
while crossing U.S. Route 68.

EXEC SAYS AOL CHOSE MICROSOFT BECAUSE OF ITS MONOPOLY POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top executive of America Online Inc. says his
company would not have formed an alliance with Microsoft were it
not for Microsoft's monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Senior Vice President David Colburn said in written
testimony released Tuesday night that America Online chose to give
its customers a browser made by Microsoft rather than one made by
Netscape Communications Corp. because of Microsoft's unique ability
to ``bundle'' America Online with the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn's testimony bolsters the central allegation in the
government's case against Microsoft, that the company was able to
take advantage of a monopoly on computer operating systems in an
effort to gain share in the market for Internet browsers. Such
activity violates the nation's antitrust laws, the government
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, an on-line service provider with 13 million
subscribers worldwide, was a much sought customer by Microsoft and
Netscape in late 1995 and early 1996. At that time, America Online
had decided it needed to hire Microsoft or Netscape to make an
Internet browser for it, because the browser America Online had
previously been using was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn said Netscape and Microsoft made comparable browsers,
and the primary reason that America Online chose Microsoft in March
1996 was because of its monopoly. America Online was desperate to
have its product bundled with Windows so as not to lose an
advantage to MSN, Microsoft's own on-line service provider, which
was heavily promoted through Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The willingness of Microsoft to bundle AOL in some form with
the Windows operating system was a critically important competitive
factor that was impossible for Netscape to match,'' Colburn said.
``AOL would not have been willing to negotiate a browser license
with Microsoft had Microsoft not indicated a willingness to bundle
and to promote the AOL client software in some form with Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to win America Online's business, Microsoft agreed to
put an icon for America Online in the Online Services folder on the
Windows desktop, Colburn said. Users can click on the American
Online icon to register for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn said Microsoft insisted in return on ``exclusive
distribution and promotion for Internet Explorer, with few or no
exceptions.'' In other words, Colburn said, AOL was prohibited
``from providing any significant promotion or distribution of
Netscape's Navigator browser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Microsoft agreement, AOL must and does
strictly limit its distribution, promotion and advertising of
Netscape Navigator,'' Colburn said. ``Microsoft has sought to
strictly enforce these restrictions, and has carefully monitored
references to Navigator or Netscape on the AOL service.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape chief executvie James Barksdale testified this week
that the America Online deal was critical because the large number
of AOL subscribers greatly bolstered Microsoft's share of the
browser market, making it look like Microsoft was making great
strides in the browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in a statement released Tuesday night, rejected
Colburn's allegations, saying that America Online has changed its
story over the past two years. Microsoft will have a chance to
cross-examine Colburn today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts show that AOL chose Microsoft because it provided
the technology AOL needed to meet the needs of their customers,''
Microsoft said. ``Microsoft won the competition fair and square.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that Netscape was too slow to agree to build a
special type of browser required by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements in Mr. Colburn's testimony and recent
statements by AOL officials seem to be an attempt at revisionist
history regarding the March 1996 agreement signed between Microsoft
and AOL,'' Microsoft said. ``At the time of the agreement, AOL
stated that a major reason they signed the contract was because of
the technological advantages of Microsoft's technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn will be the second of 12 scheduled government witnesses.
The first witness, Barksdale, was questioned by a lawyer for the
federal government and a lawyer for Microsoft in his fifth and
final day on the stand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale alleged that Microsoft used its monopoly power to
crush Netscape after Netscape refused to agree to an illegal
proposal not to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic piece of evidence introduced yesterday was a
handwritten note which Apple Computer Chief Financial Officer Fred
Anderson used as a draft for a later phone call to Barksdale. In
the document, Anderson explained why Apple chose to make a deal
with Microsoft, rather than Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple needed to ensure that Microsoft would continue to
provide MS (Microsoft) Office for MAC (Apple's Macintosh
computers), or we were dead,'' Anderson wrote. ``They were
threatening to abandon MAC.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also introduced a Microsoft document that showed
the power of providing consumers the Internet browser with the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ```It came with my computer' is the 1 reason people switch to IE
(Internet Explorer),'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the
government can show as much as it wants of the 20 hours of
videotape taken during the deposition of Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates. Microsoft had objected that if the government wanted Gates
as a witness, they should call him in person, but the judge
disagreed, and said Microsoft could show a videotape of someone
else's deposition if it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said ``I sincerely hope I'm not going to have to
listen to three days of (Gates') deposition,'' and Justice
Department special trial counsel David Boies said the government is
attempting to choose just six or seven hours to play in court. A
portion of the tape, which has been much anticipated because it
offers a rare glimpse of the richest man in the world's famously
combative style under pressure, could be shown as soon as Thursday.

to oppose Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat being challenged by state
Treasurer Matt Fong. While Davis said he was not particularly
bothered by Clinton's personal behavior, he said Ms. Boxer had
aggressively opposed Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme
Court because of accusations of sexual harassment but has been
relatively quiet about the president. (Ms. Boxer's daughter is
married to a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so tough on Clarence Thomas,'' said Davis, 37, who
designs air-conditioning systems. ``That's hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was one of the few people who even mentioned a particular
candidate. Most admitted not knowing much, if anything, about the
Senate candidates or the candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, and state Attorney General Dan Lungren, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that drew a trace of passion was a state ballot
measure that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on
Indian lands throughout the state. The proposal has been the
subject of endless commercials on television, and many people
interviewed said the tribes deserved to have the casinos after
years of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the Indians alone!'' Randy Jones, 46, a Republican who
was having a slow day selling pumpkins, said in a refrain that came
up in several interviews. ``Let them have their casinos!''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other residents here, Dee Preston, a 24-year-old
Democrat who is studying business as California State University,
blurted out several crucial concerns. But, she complained, all she
hears about is Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always on the TV for no reason at all. Just like O.J.
Simpson,'' she said. ``Even on Christmas they're going to talk
about what that man did to his wife. Leave the man alone. Let's get
some real news news: Kids getting murdered. The homeless. Kids
getting kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Preston still intends to vote, back at the pumpkin
patch, Jones, asked if he planned to go to the polls, said, ``If
they catch me.''

REPUBLICANS URGE CLINTON NOT TO RELEASE CONVICTED SPY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders called on
President Clinton on Tuesday not to release Jonathan Pollard, the
convicted spy, saying he still represents a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's Middle East peace talks, President Clinton
agreed to review Pollard's case, after Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel made his release a last-minute stumbling block
in the negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists the president made no agreement with the
Israelis for Pollard's eventual release, but the Republicans are
suspicious that Pollard might be granted parole at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in U.S. intelligence and law enforcement have been
angered that Pollard's case became a point of negotiation in the
peace talks. They believe he was one of the most damaging spies of
the 1980s by turning over huge volumes of highly classified
materials.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter issued on Monday to the president and signed by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
the chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees, the
Republicans said that Clinton should again deny clemency for
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   They warned that ``should Pollard be released, there is every
reason to believe, based on his own statements, that he would
resume his treacherous conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the White House said on Monday that ``the president
has made no commitments or predeterminations for the release of
Pollard.'' It said Clinton merely agreed to review Pollard's case.
Arrested in 1985 for spying for Israel while working as a Naval
intelligence analyst, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in
1987. Clinton has twice before reviewed the case, and twice denied
clemency.

TOSHIBA, HITACHI REPORT LOSSES FOR 6 MONTHS ENDED SEPT. 30 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. on Tuesday reported
losses for the six months ended Sept. 30, illustrating how even
Japan's vaunted high-technology companies are vulnerable to its
deep economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The companies blamed the worldwide decline in sales of memory
chips, weak consumer demand in their home market and falling
capital investment in Japan for the bulk of their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, NEC Corp. also announced losses, and both
Toshiba and Hitachi said Tuesday that they did not expect to post a
profit until the fiscal year ending March 2000. Fujitsu Ltd. alone
among Japan's large memory-chip manufacturers expects to see a
profit this year, as the price of the most widely used memory chip,
the dynamic-random-access-memory chip, or D-RAM, has fallen roughly
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months ended Sept. 30, Toshiba lost 6.4 billion yen,
or about $54 million at current exchange rates, compared with a
profit of 22.4 billion yen in the comparable period last year.
Sales dropped more than 12 percent, to 1.59 trillion yen, or $13.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi lost 124.7 billion yen, or about $1 billion, compared
with net income of 24.3 billion yen last year. Sales slid more than
12 percent, to 1.8 trillion, or about $15.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The losses were steeper than the forecasts made by Toyo Keizai
Inc., a financial data company. Analysts said the companies seemed
to have taken write-offs related to their computer businesses that
widened their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba and Hitachi have announced plans to realign their
sprawling businesses _ Hitachi has almost 1,000 affiliated entities
making everything from elevators to PCs to electric power plants _
to focus on profitable enterprises. Hitachi said recently that it
planned to pare its fixed costs by 10 percent and merge affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba has also spun off money-losing businesses and plans to
reduce its work force from about 66,000 now to less than 60,000 in
two years through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the investment community is pushing for more.
``Toshiba is losing more money on consumer electronics than on
D-RAMs,'' said Peter Wolff, a high-technology industry analyst at
ING Barings. ``These companies need to do some serious
restructuring and decide what businesses they really want to be in
going forward.''

NEW REPUBLICAN ADVERTISING BLITZ CENTERS ON PRESIDENT'S SEX
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Ga, N.C., S.C.) (Also moving in `p' category) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sudden strategy reversal during the last week
of the campaign season, the Republican Party on Tuesday night
opened a $10 million nationwide advertising blitz that capitalizes
on President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, party officials had stayed clear of Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky in their advertisements,
expressing concern that it would prompt a backlash from voters who
have grown weary of the scandal and the looming impeachment
hearings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   But after debating strategy throughout the weekend, officials at
the National Republican Congressional Committee decided that recent
surveys showed enough evidence that the scandal weighed heavily on
the minds of voters they were trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, they believe, might prod those voters to go
to the polls. So as part of their final get-out-the-vote push, the
committee bought the advertisements, settling on three 30-second
commercials that will be broadcast in up to 70 media markets in the
closing week of the campaign. The Republicans' decision could again
move the Lewinsky matter to the forefront of the national political
discourse before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials try to link the scandal to specific issues. In
one advertisement, the narrator does not mention the scandal at
all. It closes with footage, but no sound, of Clinton, in slow
motion, wagging his finger at the camera as he did when he misled
the country in January by publicly declaring that he had not had
``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That advertisement opens with tape of Clinton changing his mind
on how many years it will take to balance the budget. Then the
announcer says, ``It took the Republicans just four years to get
the job done. And get the budget balanced. Now there's a budget
surplus. And a Republican plan to save Social Security. And a
Republican plan to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. America
needs the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Clinton appears on the screen wagging his finger, the
narrator says, ``Remember, it's your choice. For balance. Vote
Republican.'' The image of the president freezes on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In another commercial the tone is set with ominous background
music. Against grainy black-and-white shots of people at the polls,
the announcer asks: ``Should we reward Democratic plans for more
big government? More big spending? Should we reward their
opposition to more welfare reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``And should we reward not telling the truth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the question of this election. Reward Bill Clinton.
Or, vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The third commercial features a conversation between two women
in their 30s. ``What did you tell your kids?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to say,'' the other says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong. For seven months he lied to us,'' the first one
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But aren't there other things to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And say it's OK to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, the Republicans are doing them. They cut taxes. They
helped balance the budget. And they're putting people on welfare
back to work. And now they have a plan to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they considered dozens of possibilities for
scripts, including even blunter messages. One that was shelved
featured Steve Grossman, the national chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, who had praised Clinton for his moral
leadership. But officials said they figured that the slightly more
subtle approach would be most effective _ and least likely to put
off voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge in this environment is to acknowledge its
existence and to pivot to issues that we want to focus on,'' Mary
Crawford, communications director of the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee, said of the scandal. ``If you ignore it
completely, then your message can seem phony because it is so much
on the top of the public's thoughts about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, Ms. Crawford's counterpart at the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the barrage of new ads:
``This just proves what we suspected all along, which is that this
Republican Congress is obsessed by scandal and investigating the
president. They are now sending a signal that they are abandoning
the political center and focusing entirely on appeasing their right
wing base.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the $10 million from the Republicans, Sallick
said his committee will spend $3 million on commercials in the
final days of the campaigns. The Democratic ads do not refer to the
scandal in any way.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist who was involved in the discussions
about the advertisements said they were being placed in districts
where they would have the most resonance. The spot about rewards,
for instance, is appearing only in three southern districts where
polling by the party found that Clinton is particularly unpopular
with swing voters. This strategist also said that the ads were
tailored to respond to polling that found that voters were not
upset about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky but about the
fact that he misled the public about it.
</P>
<P>
   The three districts where that commercial, about the president
``not telling the truth,'' is running are in those of three
vulnerable Democrats, Reps. John Spratt Jr., of South Carolina,
Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Bob Etheridge of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The two other advertisements are being broadcast in several of
the largest media markets in the country. In addition to those
three spots, the committee is broadcasting 29 commercials that will
run in districts throughout the country. Those will deal
specifically with issues and are tailor-made to help House
candidates in individual races.

EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO USE FBI TO GET DIRT ON SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Eisenhower administration unsuccessfully tried
to get the FBI to dig up dirt on Sen. Warren Magnuson as the
Republicans sought a way to defeat the Washington Democrat in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI refused to cooperate, a top Eisenhower aide asked
the agency to recommend a private detective who would do the work.
The bureau declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' failed attempt to come up with a scandal that
might tar Magnuson is among historical tidbits revealed in the
FBI's extensive files on Magnuson, portions of which were provided
to the Post-Intelligencer under the federal Freedom of Information
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson, who died in 1989 at the age of 84, has a fabled place
in the history of Washington state politics. The FBI files offer
nothing to dramatically alter Magnuson's place in history, but
provide a variety of previously unreported details about his public
life.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say the documents shed new light not only on Magnuson
but also on Eisenhower's de facto chief of staff, Sherman Adams,
the aide who asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to investigate
Magnuson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the political leadership in Washington to
cross an invisible line into dirty tricks or scandal-mongering, and
these documents suggest to me that some invisible line was
crossed,'' said Michael Birkner, the chairman of the history
department at Gettysburg College, who is researching a book about
Sherman Adams. ``It forces us to look a little differently at the
mainstream politicians of that era, by recognizing that the rules
were clearly more flexible than history would tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has slowly been releasing the contents of its files
since 1975, when the federal Freedom of Information Act was
expanded to cover investigatory files compiled for law enforcement
purposes. The FBI now has 400 employees screening requests for
release of files. Over the past 23 years the agency has released
more than 6 million pages of documents in response to more than
300,000 requests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being heavily edited, the 232 pages released to the
Post-Intelligencer about Magnuson shed new light on the story of
the legendary lawmaker, who from 1931 to 1981 served as a state
legislator, King County prosecutor, congressman and senator.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Magnuson had a long and complex alliance with Hoover, the
longtime FBI chief. Magnuson was on Hoover's ``special
correspondent's list'' of favored legislators. The senator invited
Hoover to his second wedding, and Hoover sent the Magnuson a copy
of his 1962 book, ``A Study of Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI carefully monitored Magnuson's comments about him,
sending thank-you notes whenever Magnuson spoke kindly of the FBI
director, but restraining its correspondence on an occasion in 1962
when Magnuson made an unspecified ``derogatory statement ...
concerning the director.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, Magnuson was addressing Hoover in writing as ``Edgar''
and the FBI was describing Magnuson as ``a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   _The FBI repeatedly examined Magnuson's background, and even did
a cursory background check on Magnuson's fiancee when the senator
sent Hoover an invitation to the wedding. The only full-blown
investigation of Magnuson was conducted in 1966, when the FBI tried
to determine whether Magnuson had used his clout as chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee to influence an action by the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The agency reported that ``no prosecutable
violation'' was found.
</P>
<P>
   _The FBI twice passed along to the Army a variety of allegations
about Magnuson's alleged contacts with organized crime,
horse-racing interests and a group sympathetic to Communists. The
FBI told the Army that it found ``objectionable'' various comments
Magnuson made, votes he took and groups he was associated with
early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson biographer Shelby Scates said the allegations in the
FBI files were not far from the truth _ he said Magnuson gambled on
horses, met once or twice with mobster Bugsy Siegel and sought the
endorsement of the Communist Party in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Scates said that Magnuson had a close relationship with Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie didn't make enemies, and Hoover was a very powerful
man,'' Scates said. ``My hunch is that they both saw that they
could use each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents also shed light on a variety of bizarre incidents
in Magnuson's long career, ranging from the FBI's discovery of a
box of Magnuson's possessions lost on a railway car in 1946, to the
agency's investigation of a man who impersonated Magnuson in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents offer a window on the conflicted views of
Americans during the Cold War. In 1951, Magnuson forwarded to
Hoover a letter from a constituent urging the FBI to place
Communists in concentration camps; in 1954 Magnuson forwarded a
letter from another constituent accusing the FBI of ``police
state'' tactics for allegedly arresting suspects at ``unseemly''
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson's run-in with the Eisenhower administration occurred on
May 5, 1955, when Eisenhower's special assistant Adams called
Hoover ``with the request that we check our files to see what we
have on Warren Magnuson,'' according to a memo from Hoover to his
aides.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI told Adams that it knew nothing derogatory other than
some unsubstantiated allegations that, according to one memo,
claimed Magnuson was ``allied with gambling and racketeers in the
Seattle area,'' and according to another memo, ``ties Magnuson in
with bribes and associations with the criminal element.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was unimpressed _ the White House had already heard the
same rumors _ and he wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adams stated that it should be obvious that the reason for his
check with us is political,'' said an FBI memo written later that
same day. ``He stated that Magnuson is scheduled to run for
re-election in 1956, and that the White House would like nothing
better than to see him defeated. ... Adams asked what our reaction
would be if he should request that the FBI conduct a special
inquiry type investigation regarding Magnuson.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1956, Democrats held a narrow majority in the Senate, and
the Eisenhower administration hoped the defeat of Magnuson and a
Democratic senator from Oregon would swing the Senate to Republican
control.)
</P>
<P>
   The FBI refused to conduct an investigation, prompting Adams to
ask the FBI to ``recommend to him the name of a private individual
whom he could use for investigations of this type.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI refused that as well. Adams ``seemed rather perturbed
when he hung up the phone,'' an FBI memo states.
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenhower White House wound up supporting Washington Gov.
Arthur Langlie in a nasty race against Magnuson in 1956. Magnuson
won every county in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Two scholars interviewed about the FBI reports said there has
been no previous indication of Adams trying to use the FBI for
political purposes. They said they considered it highly unlikely
that Eisenhower was personally involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole incident sounds very Cold War-esque, and there must
have been an image that the FBI was available for Adams to do
this,'' said Princeton University political scientist Fred
Greenstein, author of an Eisenhower biography. ``Adams was viewed
as a very blunt, laconic person who could be a very aggressive
partisan, but there has never been anything that would have
indicated he was trying to use the FBI for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was forced to resign his White House post because he had
accepted expensive gifts from an industrialist. He died 12 years
ago Tuesday at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its refusal to investigate Magnuson for Adams, the FBI
did conduct several background checks on Magnuson for the Army and
once conducted a full-fledged investigation. The background checks
reveal the intensity of the FBI's Cold War-era obsession with
anything suggesting sympathy with communists or communism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, prior to a trip by Magnuson to the Far East, the Army
asked the FBI what it had on the senator. The FBI described several
concerns about Magnuson's past _ he was loosely connected with the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which was alleged to be a communist group;
in the 1940s the congressman had spoken at a ``Tribute to
Yugoslavia'' dinner and had sponsored an anti-poll-tax bill. The
FBI also passed along a Post-Intelligencer article from 1942 in
which Magnuson had accused Langlie of spreading false rumors that
the congressman had associated with horse-racing interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 the Army again requested a background check on Magnuson
and other members of Congress prior to allowing them to attend a
Pentagon briefing on war plans. Similar information was passed
along.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson was directly investigated once, in 1966, in a
conflict-of-interest case involving possible improper use of
Democratic Party funds and improper influence exerted on the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The FBI has withheld most details
of the case, disclosing only that the primary target was Magnuson's
one-time aide, Fred Lordon, and that ``our review of these reports
discloses no prosecutable violation of the federal conflict of
interest statutes.''

 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Motel 6, a stubbornly utilitarian chain for most of its
36 years, has been making some fancy moves lately.
</P>
<P>
   Already the biggest chain of company-owned and -operated budget
motels in the United States, Motel 6 is now aggressively selling
franchises. And it is spending $600 million to overhaul all 85,000
rooms at its 781 existing motels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Motel 6 is considering entering the extended-stay
market, a fast-growing niche that offers low-priced rooms with
separate sleeping, working and cooking areas for penny-pinching
corporate nomads, consultants and others who need rooms for a week
to several months.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have come as a surprise to some in the hotel
industry, given Motel 6's reputation for steadfastly resisting
change or innovation for most of its 36 years. After all, the
company has stuck with the same folksy advertising line _ ``We'll
leave the light on for you'' _ since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But is Motel 6 choosing the wrong moment to strike out in new
directions? It's possible, according to some analysts. ``It will be
a difficult time for Motel 6, especially if there's a slowdown in
the economy in 1999,'' said John Rohs, the hotel analyst for
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Motel 6, the expansion comes after a turnaround
in its fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The chain, based in Dallas, was on the ropes soon after being
acquired by Accor SA of France in 1990 from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&AMP; Co., the leveraged-buyout firm, for $2.3 billion. In 1993, Motel
6 lost $40 million, hurt by accusations that its guests were easy
prey for criminals and by a downturn in the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   But after breaking even in 1995, the company turned a modest
profit in 1996 and earned $75 million before taxes last year. It
expects to earn $100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround of Motel 6 has been more difficult than we
expected,'' said Georges Le Mener, the chain's French-born chief
executive, who before the purchase of Motel 6 headed much smaller
North American and Pacific hotel operations for Accor from an
office in New York. ``But we're here for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is clearly an important market for Accor, the
world's fourth-biggest hotel company and the owner of
European-based hotel chains, including Sofitel and Novotel, that
are more upscale than Motel 6. So important was the U.S. market
that from 1991 through 1993, at a time when Motel 6 had 525 motels
and was losing money, Accor spent $700 million for 200 more
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Motel 6 accounted for only 13 percent of Accor's $5.5
billion in revenue but 30 percent of its earnings before interest
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Le Mener says that Motel 6's management philosophy is blending
European concern for people and quality with American skill at
marketing, operations and finance. The most significant change for
Motel 6 has been franchising, which it began in earnest about a
year ago. Its strategy is to use franchising to expand quickly,
primarily throughout the eastern United States, which has only
about one-third of Motel 6 properties.
</P>
<P>
   For allowing the Motel 6 name and red-white-and-blue logo on
franchised properties, the company receives 4 percent of revenue
for Motel 6 operations and another 3 percent for marketing and
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   While that is a fraction of the return possible from
company-owned properties, Motel 6 executives say franchising is a
quick and low-cost way to maximize name recognition and invade new
markets. That strategy, widely adopted in the 1960s and 1970s by
more upscale chains, fueled the expansion of Holiday Inn, Sheraton,
Hilton, Hyatt, Ramada Inn and other hotel companies, big and small.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 64 percent of the United States' 3.7 million hotel rooms
are affiliated with hotel chains, according to Smith Travel
Research, two-thirds of them through franchise arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Franchising also complements the company's strategy by putting
smaller hotels in smaller communities, cities and towns that Motel
6 formerly ceded to other chains. Unlike company-owned properties,
which average 115 rooms, franchised Motel 6s will average 60 to 80
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the chain is nearly finished with a $600
million overhaul of all 85,000 rooms in its system. And in what
passes for a radical departure from its Spartan one-type-fits-all
style, Motel 6 now offers a new prototype at 27 properties that
features central heating and air conditioning, bathtubs as well as
showers, and an emphasis on landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one is likely to mistake a Motel 6 for the Ritz.
Even the new style echoes the look and feel of the original hotels.
The chain is firmly anchored in the budget market, with an average
room rate of $37 a night, still a few dollars below what
competitors charge for a comparable room.
</P>
<P>
   But with a telephone and desktop color television set in each
room, a fax machine available 24 hours a day, and other amenities,
Motel 6 has come a long way since it started in 1962, charging just
$6 a room. When Tom Bodett, the humorist, promises ``We'll leave
the light on for you,'' the light is one it is actually possible to
read by.
</P>
<P>
   And change may have been long overdue at Motel 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 20 years, Motel 6 didn't change anything,
because as the Interstate highway system expanded, it expanded
along with it,'' Le Mener, Motel 6's chief, said. ``But even when
your price is very low, there comes a point where if you are not
perceived as giving value, nobody will buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But one possible change that has raised questions is the
proposed move into the extended-stay business. Le Mener said no
decision was expected before spring but noted that traditional
budget motels were losing customers to extended-stay properties _
an acknowledgment that seems to suggest that the company is leaning
toward getting into the business.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think it is already too late to become an
important player in that market, where the economy segment ($200 to
$350 a week) is dominated by Extended Stay America, a chain created
by Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and
Waste Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be room for new competitors: Bear, Stearns
recently forecast a shortage of extended-stay properties in about a
year in ``hundreds of lodging markets.'' Rohs, the Schroder
analyst, noted that the growing acceptance of the extended-stay
concept could make it easier for Motel 6 to enter the market _
unless the new business came at the expense of its traditional
motels.
</P>
<P>
   Le Mener expresses caution. ``With our $1.1 billion, we could
already have gotten into extended stay, but we're moving slowly,''
he said, adding that Motel 6 was well positioned to buy an existing
brand at a favorable price during the lodging industry's expected
downturn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The $1.1 billion is the amount raised from the sale of 288
properties last year to such companies as Philip Morris and U.S.
Realty. Motel 6 retains management control of the properties for 20
years, with renewable options.
</P>
<P>
   Motel 6 raised an additional $325 million in 1996 as part of a
consortium with financial companies, including Chase Manhattan Bank
and Merrill Lynch. The consortium created a holding company
specifically for buying 65 California motels, which Motel 6
promptly agreed to lease for about $270 million and convert to its
brand. The remaining funds will be spent buying additional
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``That allowed us to grow our balance sheet and revenues without
adding to our real-estate inventory and liabilities,'' said Armand
Sebban, Motel 6's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   While many changes are aimed at attracting new guests, Motel 6's
strategy is also directed at retaining the loyalty of its 33
million annual customers, few of whom are on expense accounts. Many
of them are retirees, members of the military, families with young
children, or students. A growing number are foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their motels are always clean and comfortable, the price is
very good and the people are pleasant,'' said Gail Eidukonis, a
retired bookkeeper from Wallingford, Conn., who with her husband,
Edward, is a Motel 6 enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent seven-week trip to California, the Eidukonises
stayed exclusively at Motel 6s, except for three nights when they
found no vacancies in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Oklahoma City there was a tornado scare about
4 in the morning,'' Mrs. Eidukonis said, ``so the manager invited
us to wait it out in an inside room behind the office, and had
coffee for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, some Motel 6 guests might have chosen to
brave the tornado's wrath rather than venture from their room
before sunup. Concerns about security were heightened in 1992 after
a $10 million settlement of a negligence suit brought by a woman
who was repeatedly raped by two ex-convicts who forced their way
into her room at a Motel 6 in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The rape occurred before Accor acquired the chain, but the new
management suffered the fallout. After the settlement, a front-page
article in The Wall Street Journal highlighted the issue of lax
security at budget motels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about the lawsuit, and we clearly
underestimated the problem,'' Le Mener said. ``In Europe, the level
of crime is way, way below what we found here.''
</P>
<P>
   Motel 6 sold about 100 properties that it deemed unsafe, and
beefed up security elsewhere. It installed electronic door locks
and deadbolts as well as high-intensity outdoor lights and
closed-circuit television cameras, and it put security guards at
almost half its properties. Its newest properties also have
interior corridors, which especially appeal to the growing number
of women travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Motel 6 has also emphasized cleanliness, the condition of its
properties, attention to complaints and employee attitudes toward
guests. Training and improved benefits, as well as cash incentives
and weeklong cruises to the Caribbean for top producers, have
encouraged employees to make improvements, Motel 6 executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the activity, Motel 6 remains unchanged in many
ways. It still has only a single brand. Its motels do not have
meeting rooms, suites or floors for business travelers. They do not
give frequent-flier miles or free room nights even to their most
loyal guests. The only discount is 10 percent off for members of
the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   And the chain's 12-year-old ad campaign with Bodett is also
virtually unchanged, except for having expanded to television in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Which is still the way Motel 6 likes to operate. ``The tag line
about leaving the light on, which Tom ad-libbed, conveys a sense of
warmth and caring,'' said Carol Kirby, the head of marketing for
Motel 6. ``My claim to fame,'' she added, ``is that I had the sense
not to change it.''

CARDOSO PROMISES TO CUT BILLIONS FROM DEBT-RIDDEN BRAZIL BUDGET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ Bracing his nation for a package of austerity
measures that are generally seen as a first step to restoring
Brazil's standing in world markets, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso pledged Tuesday night to cut $7 billion in spending from
the deficit-ridden federal budget next year.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after weeks of delays while Brazilians voted for a
president, Congress and governors in two rounds of elections this
month, the speech signals the end of a dangerous waiting game with
international investors, who will now take the measure of the
government's ability to deliver on a politically sensitive
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-minute televised speech the re-elected president did
not provide firm details on how the cuts would be achieved or
specify how states and municipalities would cut spending and raise
revenues. He did say, however, that tax increases would form an
important part of the effort to balance accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unprecedented cut,'' Cardoso said. ``It makes clear
the government's determination to reach fiscal equilibrium in the
shortest possible time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said that shrinking the budget by any more than $7
billion ``would paralyze the essential activities of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning Cardoso is to announce the austerity
measures in a closed-door meeting with Congressional leaders from
his governing coalition. Hours later, Finance Minister Pedro Malan
is scheduled to announce publicly the spending cuts, tax increases
and state and local efforts in a campaign to save $65 billion over
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has been under enormous pressure, ever since the collapse
of Russia's economy last August, to show investors and financial
institutions how it will reduce its chronic budget deficit, which,
at more than $55 billion, is running at 7 percent of the gross
national product. Brazilian officials are seeking a stand-by loan
from the International Monetary Fund and other sources that will
likely total $30 billion or more. To secure the loan, the
government must demonstrate how it will raise about $20 billion in
revenues next year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of confidence spells shockingly higher interest rates
on government debt. Before the Russian collapse, official
government figures projected Brazil would have to refinance $138
billion in debt next year; now, it is expecting to roll over $333
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the government fought the August crisis by jacking
up interbank loan rates to more than 40 percent to protect the
currency. Consumer lending rates of over 100 percent slammed the
economy into an instant recession that is not expected to end
before 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing worse for the country than the interest rates
that have been in effect since the international crisis began,''
Cardoso said Tuesday night. ``They hurt production and public
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures that we are proposing are meant to put an end to
the beating we are taking from high interest rates,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday night how much of the remaining $14
billion in savings would depend on cooperation from state and local
governments. David Fleischer, a political scientist at the Federal
University of Brasilia, said he expected the burden would be
divided evenly between federal tax increases, and state and local
government spending cuts and tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a division implicitly relies upon the cooperation of state
and local governments, which is far from certain after
gubernatorial elections last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's party lost governorships in Rio de Janeiro and Minas
Gerais. His endorsement of political allies may have boosted an
important ally, Mario Covas, to victory in Sao Paulo, but it also
forged a deep split within the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party,
which forms part of Cardoso's governing coalition. In the federal
district, which includes the capital of Brasilia, newly elected
Gov. Joaquim Roriz has already promised state employees a salary
boost of 28 percent.

IN MICROSOFT CASE, U.S. NOW CITES NOTE FROM APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four days spent watching lawyers for
Microsoft Corp. attack its key witness, the Justice Department on
Tuesday introduced a host of new documents, videotaped depositions
and fresh testimony to strengthen its antitrust case and undermine
Microsoft's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new evidence potentially most damaging to Microsoft
was a handwritten note describing what the government portrays as
strong-arm tactics Microsoft successfully employed to force Apple
Computer Inc. to ship Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer,
with Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence came as David Boies, the lead government
lawyer, got his turn to question his own witness, James Barksdale,
the president of Netscape Communications Corp., who Tuesday
completed his fifth day of testimony in federal court here.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple evidence consisted of a note from Apple chief
financial officer Fred Anderson to Barksdale, explaining why Apple
had agreed to use Internet Explorer on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Microsoft had ``threatened to abandon Mac'' if the
company did not make Internet Explorer the default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Anderson said, Microsoft had threatened to stop
developing its word processor, Microsoft Word, and other crucial
programs for Macintosh computers _ a threat that if carried
through, would mean ``we were dead,'' Anderson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust suit charges that Microsoft
tried to use its monopoly in operating system software to crush
Netscape, its chief competitor in the market for browsers, the
software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad as stew when I got that,'' Barksdale testified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that Apple agreed to opt for its browser as part
of broad agreement that included a $150 million investment by
Microsoft, cross-licensing of patents and settlement of an old
legal case _ not just because of Microsoft's commitment to continue
making business software for the Macintosh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In testimony given last month but first made public Tuesday, a
senior executive of America Online Inc. said that his company chose
Microsoft's browser over Netscape's in return for Microsoft's
placing a prominent link to America Online from the main screen, or
desktop, of Microsoft's Windows, the operating system shipped on
more than 90 percent of all new computers.
</P>
<P>
   David Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online, the
nation's largest online service, stated that Microsoft's
willingness ``to bundle America Online in some form with the
Windows operating system was a critically important competitive
factor that was impossible for Netscape to match.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the government, Colburn also said that his
company's March 1996 contract with Microsoft required that more
than 85 percent of all browsers America Online shipped to its
members had to be Microsoft's Internet Explorer. In the battle for
browser market share, America Online's millions of subscribers were
perhaps the biggest prize in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In an October 1996 promotional agreement, Microsoft agreed to
pay America Online 25 cents for each America Online subscriber
converted to Microsoft's browser from a rival, presumably Netscape,
and to pay a $600,000 bonus for doing it quickly. During his
negotiations with Microsoft executives, Colburn stated, ``I was
told that Microsoft had no limitations on what it could spend to
gain market share for Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Microsoft disputed Colburn's assertion that the
crucial factor in its deal with America Online was the offer of a
link on the Windows desktop _ the most valuable real estate in
cyberspace. ``Microsoft and Netscape competed for the America
Online contract, and Microsoft won on the merits of its
technology,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning Barksdale, Boies displayed several documents from
Microsoft's files intended to strengthen the government's
accusation that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape to
divide the market for browsers in a meeting on June 21, 1995 _ an
offer that Netscape did not accept.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination of Barksdale last week, John Warden,
Microsoft's lead lawyer, suggested that Marc Andreessen, a
co-founder and executive vice president of Netscape, had ``imagined
or invented the proposal to divide the markets.'' Andreessen took
notes during the June 21 meeting; they later became a key piece of
government evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After Boies produced several internal Microsoft e-mail messages
in which senior executives seemed to be openly discussing such a
deal, Barksdale said, ``This seems to corroborate exactly what we
have been saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies also displayed part of a transcript of the questioning
last summer of Chris Jones, a Microsoft executive who attended the
1995 meeting. The Justice Department asked Jones if dividing the
market for browsers had been a topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I believe there was a discussion of that nature,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1995 meeting, a pivotal part of the government's case,
has been a key point of questioning and evidence by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon session, Barksdale offered new details about
the meeting. He said that while Microsoft had prodded Netscape to
pull back from making browsers for Windows 95, it was his
understanding that Netscape, which had already created a browser
for Windows 95 by the summer of 1995, would be given a year or two
to get out of that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape and the government's account of that meeting changes
more often than Dennis Rodman's hair color,'' said Mark Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The government also submitted an internal Microsoft sales
document, suggesting how much importance the company placed on
insuring that personal computer makers bundled its browser with its
operating system _ which was required by Microsoft contracts and
done, the government contends, to stifle competition in the browser
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came on my machine, is the Number 1 reason people switch to
Internet Explorer,'' the Microsoft sales presentation from May 1998
declared.
</P>
<P>
   To which Barksdale responded, ``It just shows what I've been
saying here for a week is true _ and Microsoft knew it.''

GAY CHURCH SUES TV STATION FOR REJECTING AN INFOMERCIAL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The nation's largest gay and lesbian church filed suit
Tuesday against a Chicago television station, accusing the station
of breaking its agreement to broadcast an infomercial produced by
the church because the station considered the advertisement too
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the church, the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, believe
the station, WGN-TV, which is seen nationally when it is fed by
satellite to cable systems around the country, rejected the
infomercial ``based on their views that this is not appropriate
content for those stations,'' said a lawyer for the church,
Christopher Wolf. ``I think those are code words for homophobia and
for anti-gay discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The church spent two years producing the infomercial and tried
to market it to national cable stations over the summer. Church
officials saw it in part as a counterweight to advertising by
conservative Christian groups, including recent full-page newspaper
advertisements with people who say they are former homosexuals who
``overcame'' their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to make our voice heard against the
overwhelming onslaught of people using the media to say how bad gay
people are,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Michael Piazza. ``We wanted
mostly to reach out to lesbian and gay teen-agers but also people
living in rural areas, to tell them there is this possibility that
you can be gay and Christian, there is this possibility that you
are a child of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cable companies the church contacted said no. WGN-TV
agreed to broadcast the advertisement, scheduled five showings and
accepted a check for the first payment in July, church officials
say. Then, church officials said, a week later, WGN canceled the
agreement and returned the check.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Sennet, senior counsel for the Tribune Company, which
owns WGN-TV, declined to comment on the lawsuit or to explain the
network's version of events, saying the company would respond in
court. Sennet suggested the church might not know exactly what
happened because church officials did not communicate directly with
the station, but used a media buyer, Phil Rozansky, president of
Tower Media Advertising, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rozansky's version of events differs markedly from the church's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they're trying to do is make this a political
issue and a slam against gay rights,'' Rozansky said. ``They are
jumping to conclusions and making accusations that are not
appropriate and do not logically follow the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute infomercial begins with a montage of anti-gay
demonstrators and speeches by televangelists. The bulk of the
advertisement is devoted to happy church members, both gay and
straight, children playing and the church's inclusive philosophy.
At the end, Piazza talks about a gay minister who was so distraught
he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who considers the WGN agreement binding, said that at
WGN's suggestion, the church agreed to change the title of the
infomercial from ``Holy Homosexuals'' to ``A Cathedral of Hope''
and agreed to blur the image of Pat Robertson, the evangelist, to
make his face unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Rozansky, who said he had mistakenly believed top executives at
WGN had signed off on the deal, said there were other ``specific
issues within the show that make it inappropriate for airing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working with the ministry to make those adjustments and
they told me they were willing to make some of those changes,''
Rozansky said, ``but then they brought in the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozansky said that infomercials that touch on sensitive subjects
are routinely turned down by television stations. He said WGN had
turned down paid programming that had ``gay-bashing'' themes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the other stations, including the Discovery Channel,
Black Entertainment Television and Odyssey, had turned the
commercial down for varying reasons, including length, religious
content and controversial subject matter.

 Microsoft Hopes New Name Will Jazz Up Software  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In an effort to extend the Windows brand even further, Microsoft
Corp. yesterday said it is changing the name of its operating
system for businesses from Windows NT to Windows 2000 and
introduced an operating system for smart cards.
<P>
   The name change, announced by Microsoft officials in San
Francisco, is aimed at creating the same consumer awareness for the
more powerful NT operating systems that Microsoft now has with its
Windows 95 /98 PC operating software.
</P>
<P>
   And at a Paris trade show, Microsoft launched its first
operating system for smart cards _ which contain microchips that
store personal or financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will compete in the chip card market with systems
based on Sun Microsystem's Java software. The worldwide market for
chip cards will jump from $1.4 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion in
2002, according to Dataquest Inc. of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Elgan, editor of Windows magazine, said the two
announcements get rid of a ``bad name'' (NT was short for new
technology) and signal a further move by Microsoft to create one
standard in the minds of all consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft really does
want to put a Microsoft operating system on anything that is even
remotely computerlike,'' Elgan said. ``They want to be the center
of the universe. They want to be the ocean that everyone swims
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is on trial in Washington on federal antitrust
charges that it misused its monopoly position with Windows 95 and
98, announced it is changing all of its business operating software
to Windows 2000, with specific products taking on the name of the
markets they serve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Windows NT Server becomes Windows 2000 Server,
while Windows NT Workstation becomes Windows 2000 Professional. The
company also announced a new product called Windows 2000 Datacenter
Server, aimed at bigger corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Beilinson, Microsoft's Windows 2000 product manager, said
company research showed business customers didn't fully understand
Windows NT and confused it with alternative operating systems like
Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The new Windows 2000 name brings the old NT more in line with
Windows 95/98 in the minds of consumers and businesses, he said.
Beilinson added that future versions of Windows 98 might be called,
for example, ``Windows 2030 Consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgan said the name change may also mean a future ``Windows 2003
Home, or Windows 2003 Family or Windows 2003 Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The name change is purely perception manipulation,'' Elgan
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft unveiled a Smart
Card for Windows, an operating system with a memory capacity of 4.5
kilobytes. The smart card system is smaller than Windows CE, which
runs on 300 kilobytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   During an announcement at the Cartes '98 smart card trade show
in Paris, Microsoft also said 20 hardware companies now make smart
card products that will use the system, including two of the
biggest, France's Gemplus and Schlumberger Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it will cost $2 to $5 to produce a card using
Smart Card for Windows, compared to $15 for Java-based cards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smart card market is in now Europe, where they are
used as prepaid phone cards and bank cards. But analysts have said
Microsoft's entry may hasten development of the smart card market
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another facet of Microsoft's long-running campaign to
make Windows omnipresent,'' said analyst Christopher Galvan of
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.

MUSIC INDUSTRY LOSES BID TO STOP INTERNET RECORDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A federal judge has refused the recording
industry's request to halt production of a hand-held device that
can record and play back digital music found, often illegally, on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the court's announcement late Monday, Diamond
Multimedia Systems, the San Jose company that makes the device,
known as the Rio, began producing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, the powerful
trade group that had sued to prevent Diamond from shipping the Rio,
vowed Tuesday to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio, which sells for $199, can store up to 60 minutes of
music, functioning as a sort of a personal stereo, much like
portable CD and tape players. But given the near-CD fidelity of the
digital recordings, the record industry sees the Rio as far more
dangerous than cassette tapes. The industry fears that by enabling
users to grab unlicensed digital music off the Internet with the
click of a mouse, the device will encourage widespread music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the trade group asked U.S. District Judge
Audrey Collins in Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction
preventing Diamond from shipping the Rio. Her denial of the
injunction effectively enables Diamond to manufacture and ship the
Rio for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The case underscores the formidable challenge facing the music
industry as it tries to protect the rights of musicians and
distributors at a time when illegal music can be distributed
freely, anonymously and widely over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA, which represents 90 percent of the creators,
manufacturers and distributors of commercial recordings, said it
had found dozens of sites that in all offered tens of thousands of
unlicensed recordings free.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge,
Mass., estimates that 10 million people already have software that
enables them to get and listen to MP3 files, the audio format the
Rio supports. Even Microsoft Corp., media player for Windows is
capable of playing MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio weighs less than 2.4 ounces. After being attached to a
computer with a cable, it finds music on the Internet and stores
it. Eric Schmitt, a research associate at Forrester, said it was
the first of several similar devices expected to hit the market in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia says it does not condone piracy and that it
is not fair to blame the company if some people use its product
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the recording industry wants to go after piracy, it should
go upstream to the pirates themselves,'' said Ken Wirt, Diamond's
vice president for corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The request for a preliminary injunction hinged primarily on
whether the Rio met the definition of a digital audio recording
device under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. That law
requires makers of digital audio recording devices to pay artist
organizations royalties of 2 percent of the wholesale price of the
device.
</P>
<P>
   Although Judge Collins said the court was ultimately very likely
to find that the Rio met the definition, she refused a key request
of the trade group _ that Diamond be forced to install a technology
that would prevent the device from copying unlicensed music files.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Sherman, general counsel for the RIAA, said that since it
was logistically impossible to go after all the people who offer
pirated music on the Internet, the association thought it made more
sense to regulate the technology used to ``receive'' the music.
Manufacturers of such devices ``have a moral obligation to protect
creative works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bridges, a partner with Palo Alto-based Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich &AMP; Rosati, , which is representing Diamond, argues that the
association is not entitled to derail new technology while it
determines how to protect its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they saying no one can develop a new technology without
their permission?'' Bridges asked.

 Health Industry Urged to Embrace Internet  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A pair of powerful voices from the worlds of computing and medicine
_ Intel Corp. Chairman Andrew Grove and former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop _ said yesterday the health care industry needs to
follow its customers onto the technology bandwagon.
<P>
   ``Tens of millions of consumers are online,'' Grove told a press
conference at Internet Health Day, an event that drew 700 people
and 20 health-related technology companies to the Hyatt Embarcadero
Hotel in San Francisco. ``Members of the health care community can
either participate in this revolution or become bystanders to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to a third of all Internet users seek out health and medical
information online, and their numbers are growing by 70 percent
annually, according to research by ING Baring Furman Selz LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who is now a scholar at Dartmouth University and an
entrepreneur who's founded a health-related Web site at
 &LR; www.drkoop.com &LR; , hailed the Internet as a way for patients to go
beyond what their doctors tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Koop said he's always told patients, ``Take charge of your
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day of managed care, I can add, `If you don't, nobody
else will,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the health care industry has been reluctant to embrace
computing, a new crop of startups is springing up to offer
health-related information to online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter, a San Francisco startup for new and expectant
parents, showed yesterday that it's moving from merely providing
information to adding electronic commerce to its Web site. ``We
just closed a $10 million round'' of venture financing, said Matt
Glickman, 32, the chief executive and founder of the 55-employee
company. ``People see huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's esteemed Mayo Clinic was on hand to tout its newest
offering, Web sites that employers can link to to give workers
information about wellness and how to prevent health problems. The
clinic, a nonprofit venture, also has a public site with
information for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For the workplace site, companies like Intel, Dow Corning,
Lucent Technologies and Dell Computer have already signed up,
according to Michael Casey of Mayo HealthQuest. ``As more and more
people have PCs and Internet access, it's just a natural
progression,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly is Intel's hope. Grove acknowledged that for the
world's largest maker of computer chips, which sponsored
yesterday's event, ``it's in our enlightened self-interest that
this process should go on. It's another reason for people to own
and use computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grove also acknowledged that, on the issue of health, his
interest is as much personal as it is economic.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1994 and has spoken
publicly about how he's followed a course of treatment that is
sometimes at odds with his doctors' recommendations, such as
foregoing surgery in favor of hormone therapy, high-dose radiation
and a new diet. He said yesterday that his health was fine.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 article he wrote for Fortune magazine, Grove told how
he used the CompuServe online service to gather information and get
support while he struggled with his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I experienced the powers of it,'' he said yesterday. ``I was
overwhelmed by the amount of information that was available.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers going online for health information must exercise
caution, experts said. ``The right information and the wrong
information glows on the computer screen with the same intensity,''
Koop said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged people to take information to their doctor for
validation, although he also cautioned patients not to be ``health
nuts who bring in reams of information.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ansley, medical editor of OnHealth Network Co., a Web site
based in Seattle, said consumers should not just seek advice from
doctors on the Web, but also look to journalists and to fellow
patients. ``For breast cancer patients, women who have been through
it will tell them things the hospital and the doctor aren't going
to tell them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grove uses a simple test before relying on a Web site for
information. ``When I get on a Web site, I ask it questions to
which I know the answer,'' he said. ``If the Web site coughs up the
wrong answer, I'm out of there.''

 HP, Cisco Link Up on Communications Products  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard Co. are teaming up to make it
easier for consumers to use the Internet for everything from
placing long-distance calls to forwarding e-mail to any electronic
device imaginable.
<P>
   Cisco of San Jose and HP of Palo Alto said yesterday they plan
to collaborate on designing products that integrate voice, video
and data communications. By combining their technologies, HP and
Cisco said they can develop products for service providers that are
looking for ways to integrate the two distinct networks that now
manage voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is another step in Cisco's campaign to fend off
competitors like Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom. Those
companies, which have traditionally supplied equipment to
telecommunications providers, have been moving into Cisco's
networking turf as their primary customers look for ways to
integrate voice and data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom companies have seen a sharp increase in the amount of
data flowing over their networks and are looking for ways to route,
manage and control the information. Cisco and HP plan to develop
products that can help with that task. They plan to start shipping
products in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole telecommunications industry is up for grabs,'' said
John Chambers, president of Cisco. ``Service providers have to move
to a new revenue stream and are going to look for companies that
will help them move into this new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, companies will have one network that controls both
their phone and computer systems. Cisco and HP want to make
products to hasten that advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the two companies are well positioned since Cisco
makes devices that route and control data and HP designs software
that sends voice calls over traditional phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to capture market share by offering
additional services that make it easier to operate on a single
network.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first offerings will be a product called ``universal
follow me.'' It will allow a person to forward all phone calls,
e-mails, voice mails, pages and faxes to a single communications
device, such as a wireless phone. The information will be routed
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Guidon, a senior vice president at HP, said the
companies are also working on ``click-to-talk'' products that allow
a person to communicate with others over their computers. For
instance, a person surfing the J. Crew Web site could click on a
sweater and be instantly connected to a sales representative. The
two could have a conversation over the Internet while looking at
the product on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Another product the firms are collaborating on is call waiting
for the Internet. When a computer user is online, an icon would
flash indicating that someone is trying to get through on their
telephone line. The user could click on the icon and take the call,
then go back to surfing the Web without ever signing off.
</P>
<P>
   While the announcement piqued some interest among industry
watchers, most said they needed to hear more specific product ideas
before deciding whether this is an important step or just a lot of
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this announcement is that big of a deal,'' said
Scott Heritage, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read LLC in New
York. ``It's too difficult right now to tell what exactly the
products are and how much revenue there might be.''

 NetRatings Joins Nielsen to Track Web Audiences  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NetRatings Inc., the underdog in the Web-ratings business, is
teaming up with Nielsen Media Research, the well-known television
ratings company, to track Web audiences.
<P>
   The companies' announcement of a strategic alliance yesterday
came just two weeks after Media Metrix, the top Web
audience-measurement company, announced a merger with No. 2 ranked
Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies use panels of computer users to project
which Web sites receive the most visitors. They also identify key
demographic information about surfers such as their age, gender and
household incomes.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings of Milpitas has been criticized for its research
methodology, particularly its small panel size, which includes
3,500 people, compared with 40,000 for Media Metrix. Nielsen of New
York, meanwhile, has been trying to launch a Web measurement
service for about two years but has not gotten it off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance will combine Nielsen's methodology and
NetRatings' tracking technology into a service called Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen will take a ``significant equity position'' in
NetRatings, and two Nielsen executives will join NetRatings' board.
However, the companies will remain separate entities. Financial
details were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Monahan, of the San Francisco interactive ad agency Left
Field, said there appears to be enough Web business to support both
Media Metrix, which is headquartered in New York, and Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We subscribe to Relevant Knowledge and to NetRatings'' because
they offer slightly different services, said Monahan, a media
supervisor. ``It's almost going to be a question of personal
preference.''

   Russia: U.S. is asked for food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has formally asked the United States for food aid for the
winter, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said, as indications
grew that financial help from the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank will not be turned on again this year. The IMF, which
sent $4.8 billion to Russia in July, has suspended its $17 billion
financial bailout package because the government has not yet
published a budget and is printing money to pay its debts, sending
inflation soaring.

<P>
   A day after he canceled a trip to Vienna, pleading exhaustion,
President Boris Yeltsin checked into a sanitarium outside Moscow

   Germany: Bavarian abortion ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's highest court ordered Bavaria to fall in line with the

Court ruled that a Bavarian law prohibiting such clinics was

 A Plan To Tarnish BofA?   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The North Carolina bank that bought BankAmerica Corp. exaggerated
recent losses in order to discredit managers of the old BofA and
consolidate its control of the combined institution, insiders of
the former San Francisco bank said.
<P>
   NationsBank Corp., the Charlotte, N.C., bank that took over BofA
at the end of September and adopted its name, orchestrated
reporting of third-quarter investment banking and trading losses to
leave an impression that the old BofA was out of control, the BofA
insiders maintained.
</P>
<P>
   To tarnish the old BofA, the insiders said, the combined bank
reserved more money than necessary to cover investment and trading
losses, and wrote down the value of investments more than market
losses warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have been trying to make things look worse than they
were,'' said Sandy Robertson, a former director of the old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank rejected the charge that it manipulated losses for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assertions we took actions for internal purposes are
inaccurate,'' spokesman Robert Stickler said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, NationsBank insiders pointed out that the recent
earnings report prompted more than a dozen lawsuits charging the
bank with failing to disclose losses as they became known, rather
than exaggerating them.
</P>
<P>
   The new BofA reported October 14 that third-quarter net income
fell 78 percent to $374 million after it set aside $1.4 billion to
cover loan-losses.
</P>
<P>
   When analysts and investors reacted harshly to the report,
NationsBank Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl moved swiftly to
oust David Coulter, CEO of the old BofA. Coulter quit under
pressure last week, seven days after the new BankAmerica reported
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one at BofA is accusing NationsBank of falsifying
financial results. Nor do BofA insiders deny that the San Francisco
bank had significant losses.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, insiders admit, the bank's controversial $1.4
billion loan to D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a New York investment firm
specializing in computer-based securities trading, caused big
losses when prices of most nongovernment bonds plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The more subtle point of  &LR; made by BofA insiders is that managers
have discretion over how much money they must set aside to cover
potential losses and used that leeway to make problems seem worse
than they were.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank, for example, reserved $500 million to cover
``uncertainties in global economic conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA insiders said the amount was arbitrary and had the effect
of overstating the bank's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of nonspecific loan-loss reserves,'' said
Robertson, a Coulter confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank also wrote down the value of the portfolio of
mortgage loans the old BofA serviced by $250 million because
falling interest rates were spurring borrowers to pay off loans
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime BofA employee familiar with the situation estimated
the bank would have written down the portfolio's value by just $80
million to cover real losses of income had it remained independent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the larger write-down came from shifting from BofA's
accounting assumptions to NationsBank's to determine the
portfolio's value, a NationsBank spokesman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   One matter that especially disturbed analysts was NationsBank's
description of the mortgage servicing portfolio as ``unhedged,''
meaning that the old BofA hadn't protected it from falling interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  That characterization was misleading, the employee said.
BofA's practice was not to hedge each specific business, but to set
up bankwide protections against interest-rate moves.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the old BofA protected itself from losses in the
mortgage portfolio by buying securities whose value rises when
interest rates fall. That securities portfolio had gains that
offset mortgage banking losses, the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hedges worked,'' the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to specific allegations about its earnings report,
NationsBank said the $500 million nonspecific reserve simply
replenished unallocated funds the old BofA set aside that were used
to cover third-quarter losses.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's earlier statement that the mortgage portfolio wasn't
specifically hedged is correct, Stickler said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, analysts said the way NationsBank officials
reported earnings left the impression that the old BofA had severe
financial and risk management problems.
</P>
<P>
   When the combined bank reported earnings two weeks ago, Thomas
Theurkauf, an analyst with the New York brokerage Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, slammed the old BofA's management for failing to put in
place adequate risk controls.
</P>
<P>
   Theurkauf's opinion has since changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies suffered in terms of trading, but the initial
perception was that all problems related to the old BofA,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement that the bank hadn't hedged its mortgage servicing
portfolio ``contributed to that view,'' he said. &LR;

   NEW YORK _ One of the landmark sights at Kennedy International
Airport, the parabolic arch at the entrance of the Terminal Four
arrivals hall, will soon be demolished, along with the hall. Both
structures will be replaced by a temporary arrivals area that opens
Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal Four, the former International Arrivals Building, is
undergoing a $1.2 billion reconstruction, jointly developed by
Schipol USA, the U.S. unit of Amsterdam Airport Schipol; LCOR Inc.,
a privately held developer based in New York; and Lehman Brothers,
the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The new terminal is being built around the old one, which will
continue in use, except for the original arrivals hall, until the
project is completed in 2001. Construction of the new terminal _
which at 1.5 million square feet will be Kennedy's largest,
accommodating some 50 airlines _ began in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary arrivals hall, which air travelers must pass
through to find ground transportation, will house a meeting area,
as well as a fast-food restaurant, a newsstand, a flower kiosk and
a hotel reservations center. The temporary arrivals hall will
remain open until the rest of Terminal Four is finished.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs and Immigration will remain in its existing place
in Terminal Four until the new terminal is finished.

   Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic has opened a 2,200-square-foot

   Rating the Airlines
</P>
<P>
   Egon Ronay, the London-based hotel and restaurant critic,
recently surveyed the trans-Atlantic economy-class service of 10
U.S. and overseas airlines and, not surprisingly, found it sorely
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Ronay and his staff flew each airline at least twice between
August and October, during the day and at night, and rated each for
check-in procedures and efficiency; comfort and size of seats;
friendliness and efficiency of staff; quality of food; in-flight
entertainment; pilots' in-flight comments; and the condition of
lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   In a complicated rating procedure, Virgin Atlantic came out on
top overall with a score of 66 percent, followed by KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines (64 percent), Continental Airlines (59 percent), Air
France and U S Airways (58 percent), Delta Air Lines (57 percent),
UAL's United Airlines (55 percent), British Airways (51 percent),
American Airlines (48 percent) and Northwest Airlines (47 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the food rating, Air France scored highest, with 54 percent,
followed by Delta, KLM and Virgin Atlantic (50 percent); US Airways
(43 percent); American Airlines (38 percent); British Airways (34
percent); Continental and United (29 percent), and Northwest (25
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Ronay chastised all airlines for their ``lamentable attitude
toward passengers' convenience and comfort'' and called the seats
``corsetlike and knee-crunching,'' the food ``disgusting'' and the
lavatories ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised at the poor conditions and discomfort,
redeemed only by the friendliness of the majority of in-flight
staff and the sometimes good in-flight entertainment,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE NEW NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: adds `New York' to lede.)   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question raised in the full-page ad from the Anti-Defamation
League in Sunday's New York Times was plaintive: ``Is there no
moral responsibility at NBC News anymore?'' What prompted the ad _
an open letter to NBC's president, Bob Wright _ was Louis
Farrakhan's appearance on ``Meet the Press'' the previous Sunday.
Under the cover of the flimsiest of news pegs _ the otherwise
unremarked third anniversary of the Million Man March _ Farrakhan
had been invited on air to give his opinion of ``the president's
moral behavior and his possible impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Nation of Islam did have a unique perspective
on this issue: He saw Monica Lewinsky as a possible Zionist plot to
skew the Mideast peace negotiations. But ludicrous and bigoted as
his comments were, it would be unfair to accuse NBC of pushing any
ideological agenda. No, the only agenda here was entertainment, and
Farrakhan is far more diverting, particularly if you're not Jewish,
than a sobersides like Orrin Hatch. Farrakhan was, in his
freak-show way, the perfect bookend to Matt Drudge _ the equally
entertaining and specious novelty act for which ``Meet the Press''
took heat way back at the dawn of Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ``New News'' _ as it has been appropriately
christened by Marvin Kalb, in a paper just published by the
Shorenstein Center on Press and Politics at Harvard. While the
extent of Monicagate's stain on our civic institutions is not yet
fully known, its effect on our culture is already profound. The
10-month saga has solidified for good a 20-year trend in which the
media _ especially the electronic media, by which the vast majority
of Americans get the news _ have steadily replaced journalistic
standards with those of show business. Crowding out the old ideals
of public service and truth-seeking are the imperatives of star
performances, suspenseful plot twists, sex, celebrity and
box-office profit.
</P>
<P>
   Monicagate didn't create this culture. The gulf war, O.J. and
the death of Princess Di were all dry runs for the premise that
news could be produced as long-form entertainment in the style of
nonfiction mini-series like ``Roots'' (and at far lower cost). But
Monicagate was the first of these real-life dramas to arrive on a
media field that had expanded to include three competing 24-hour
cable news channels and a full-throttle Internet. Just as
crucially, it arrived after all three major networks and CNN had
been swallowed up by media giants, some of them (Disney, Time
Warner) show biz incarnate. Now there's no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   As the old journalistic rules don't apply in the ``New News,''
so the old journalistic yardsticks for critiquing it are outdated.
Last week, for instance, the Committee of Concerned Journalists
released a much-heralded report tracking the factual accuracy (or
lack of same) of the reportage on such Monicagate scoops as the
dress, the cigar, the ``second intern'' and the authorship of the
talking points. Good or bad, that accuracy record _ the historic
criterion for journalistic quality _ is now almost beside the
point. The real flavor of the Monica marathon could be found during
the days and sometimes weeks when there was no news at all, and the
story filled up endless hours anyway. The time was passed with
show-biz stunts: new bit players, mindless speculation that became
the journalistic equivalent of sideshows, and Emmy-caliber
hyperventilation by star newscasters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than count up factual errors to assess the excesses of
this orgy, it would be more telling to add up the stories that,
like the pope's visit to Cuba, were dumped or ignored for its
duration. There should also be counts of the eyelifts performed on
Monica talking heads (including moonlighting print journalists)
since January, the number of creative network logos the ``crisis''
inspired, and the hours of Super-Bowl-style hype that preceded and
followed every new twist of the plot (however inconsequential).
</P>
<P>
   This ``New News'' format will be with us long after Monicagate
is history, and stories that don't fit it don't rate. Show-biz
criteria now dictate not only  &UR; how &LR;  news is covered but  &UR; what &LR;  news
is covered. Next in line for disproportionate mini-series
treatment, accordingly, is John Glenn's flight _ provided that it
doesn't go too smoothly to serve as cliffhanger entertainment, or
that a younger and sexier star doesn't upstage him much as Monica
did the pope.

YANKEES BEGIN EFFORT TO RETAIN BROSIUS
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Story was previously budgeted as BBA-YANKS-CONE)  
(sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the Yankees began their efforts to retain Scott
Brosius at a bargain price, Bernie Williams on Tuesday added an
ingredient to his agent's argument that he should receive a bigger
contract than Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had already contributed a 1998 batting
championship and Gold Glove to Scott Boras' arsenal, emerged as the
topranked outfielder in the American League as well as the
top-ranked player among the league's outfielders, first basemen and
designated hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Boras, speaking before the annual statistical rankings were
released, signaled his intentions for Williams by making various
points, but one in particular stood out. ``Piazza pure and
simple,'' he said of the new $91 million man, ``is a slugger.'' Can
baseball's first $100 million contract be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said the club had
not yet prepared an offer for their center fielder, meaning George
Steinbrenner hadn't authorized one. But it's highly unlikely that
the Yankees will offer anything close to what the New York Mets
gave Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, however, had Williams in mind when he spoke on Tuesday
with Tony Attanasio, the agent representing Brosius, the Yankees'
third baseman. Cashman, noting that it would take a lot of money to
sign Williams, did not make a formal offer regarding Brosius, but
acknowledged discussing ``some numbers'' in an effort to ``get some
parameters set.''
</P>
<P>
   The parameters Cashman had in mind did not appeal to Attanasaio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it known that Brosius wants to come back, and we
understand he may not get what he deserves on the open market,''
Attanasio said by telephone from San Diego. ``Notwithstanding that,
should he be penalized for that? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said the numbers Cashman mentioned could have wrapped
up Brosius in a three-year deal in August, but not after he drove
in 98 runs, hit 19 home runs, batted .300 and was named the World
Series most valuable player. He declined to say what numbers
Cashman discussed, but they were believed to be less than $5
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, meanwhile, filed for free agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Brosius, who played for $2.75 million this year, was going
free, his infield mate, shortstop Derek Jeter was joining Williams
as the top-rated player at his position. They were the only members
of the Yankees designated No. 1 in the rankings that have been
compiled by the Elias Sports Bureau since they were created in the
1981 collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are designed to determine compensation for free
agents, but they are the only means by which players are rated and
compared.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is No. 1 for the second consecutive year. The outfield
rankings, based on five offensive statistics, basically complement
the Gold Glove he won for his defense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Padres' Kevin Brown was ranked No. 1 among National League
pitchers, the first time since Jose Rijo of Cincinnati was first in
1992 that the top-rated N.L. starting pitcher did not work for the
Atlanta Braves. Roger Clemens of Toronto was the top American
League starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter beat out Nomar Garciaparra of Boston and Alex Rodriguez of
Seattle in the A.L. shortstop rankings. Jeter was not lower than
eighth in any of the five offensive and two defensive statistical
categories. Fielding percentage hurt the other two. While Jeter was
eighth, Rodriguez was 13th and Garciaparra 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera of the Yankees fell from No. 1 reliever to No. 6,
replaced at the top by Mike Jackson of Cleveland. Rivera was hurt
by number of appearances and innings.
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. rankings had plenty of repeaters: Barry Bonds of San
Francisco, No. 1 in the outfield for the eighth consecutive year;
Craig Biggio at second base for the fifth time in a row; Jeff
Bagwell of Houston at first base and Barry Larkin of Cincinnati at
shortstop, each for the fourth straight year; Piazza as the catcher
for the third time in a row, and Trevor Hoffman of San Diego as the
relief pitcher for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, however, had to share his No. 1 ranking for the first
time. He was tied by Mark McGwire of St. Louis, whose total number
of plate appearances the past two years kept him from supplanting
Bagwell. Vinny Castilla of Colorado and Chipper Jones of Atlanta
tied for the N.L.'s top spot at third base. &QL;

GREENVILLE, Maine: of evergreens. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a moose does for most of its life is eat _ a lot. A
thousand-pound adult consumes 25 pounds or even 50 pounds of
vegetation a day in the summer and 10 or 12 pounds of evergreen
branches or twigs in the winter. (Moose are partial to Christmas
trees, i.e., balsam fir.) One year, Schwartz said, it took a crew
of 10 people all summer to collect enough vegetation to feed four
moose for two weeks in a research project on moose digestion.
</P>
<P>
   In its constant search for food and security from predators, a
moose is served by only so-so eyesight. But its senses of smell and
hearing are acute. Its long ears move in an almost 360-degree arc,
helping the animal detect sounds far off. Moose ``are capable of
hearing sounds humans would be oblivious to,'' Schwartz said. He
has seen them perk up their ears and turn in a common direction, he
said, while he has heard nothing. ``Five minutes later, a vehicle
comes driving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet moose tend not to flee from much of anything. One reason,
experts say, is that _ at up to six feet at the shoulder and 1,500
pounds _ they are just bigger than most other objects in their
world. They have few natural enemies, and even against predators
like wolves they stand their ground; moving might prompt the
predator to attack, and in any case moose are formidable fighters.
Unfortunately, they also tend to stand their ground against
oncoming cars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, moose are considered the most docile of the deer
family, and the most tolerant of people's presence. But there are
exceptions. Douglas Kane, the state's regional biologist here, says
that mature bull moose hereabouts have become more skittish and
harder to see. ``When they smell a human, they're gone,'' he said.
It may be, he speculates, that bulls are shyer because they are the
primary quarry in Maine's short, one-week moose hunting season in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any given moose can be dangerous, and all should be
approached cautiously and in some cases not at all, experts say.
There are two situations in which moose are especially dangerous:
when a human comes between a cow and its calf, and during the rut,
or mating season, from about mid-September to mid-October. That is
when bulls establish dominance, with intimidating displays and
sometimes clashes of antlers, and cows signal with moans and wails
that they are in the mood, a condition that normally lasts less
than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Anything or anyone invading a moose's turf then risks injury or
even death. More people are killed by moose, in fact, than by
grizzly bears, said Dr. Joel Berger, a biologist at the University
of Nevada at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, moose have become so comfortable with people
that, like deer, they have started raiding gardens and crops in
some localities. ``A few of them in northern Maine are beginning to
understand the concept of broccoli,'' Ms. Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   When a moose calf is a year old, its mother drives it away (to
make way for the next year's calf) and it must find a new territory
of its own. Moose are now so numerous in northern New England that
the youngsters are being forced southward.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a young moose cow apparently got lost while
searching out new territory and wound up in Boston. She led police
and state biologists on a frantic chase, at one point crashing
through the yards of row houses near Boston College. ``You could
hear the chain-link fences going down,'' said Dr. John McDonald, a
wildlife biologist for the state. Eventually the moose was
tranquilized and taken to a zoo, where she died; although moose
have sometimes been used as draft animals, they generally do not do
well in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   With a breeding population estimated at 200, moose are no longer
a novelty in Massachusetts. ``As they become more common,''
McDonald said, ``people report them less frequently. Once you've
seen your third or fourth moose, it's not a big deal any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In northern New England, and especially in Maine, moose-car
accidents have become epidemic. Besides being unintimidated by
vehicles, moose are drawn to roads because they love to lick up the
salt left over from deposits made by snow-clearance crews.
Sometimes they lie down in the roadway to do this, presenting an
unexpected traffic hazard. Another problem is that moose are dark
in color, sometimes almost black, and they are so tall that their
eyes do not shine in car lights. So at night, motorists often do
not see them until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris, the state biologist, said Maine averages more than
600 moose-car accidents a year. About 15 percent of the motorists
involved require medical treatment. And while Ms. Morris could not
cite human death statistics for Maine, she said the state's
mortality rate in moose-car accidents was probably about the same
as the rate measured in Sweden: about 1 in 400 accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The moose dies much more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some wildlife specialists in Maine favor loosening restrictions
on hunting to reduce the numbers of both moose and accidents.
Permits for the one-week October hunt are rationed; this year's cap
was 2,000. But other interests, mainly the tourist industry, want
to keep the number of moose high.
</P>
<P>
   New logging practices that rely less on clear-cutting and more
on selective removal of trees may well shrink the area of prime
moose habitat in future years, and as today's second-growth forests
grow out of the reach of moose their population may decline, Kane
said. ``It may be close to a stable herd now,'' he said, ``stable
or low growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the foreseeable future, the evolving new relationship
between people and moose seems likely to continue.

EDITORIAL: THE SOFT-MONEY DODGE IN 1998  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly 75 years for the United States to enact laws
protecting elections from the corrupting influence of campaign
contributions. But it has taken only four years to eviscerate those
reforms. The wanton fund-raising this year by both parties,
especially the Republicans, has returned the nation to the system
prevailing at the turn of the last century, when businesses and
special interests bankrolled presidential and congressional
campaigns. This cannot be what Americans want.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument for undoing many decades of reform is the use of
unregulated ``soft money'' from corporations, unions and rich
donors for so-called ``issue ads'' on television and radio.
Attorney General Janet Reno has ordered an inquiry into whether
President Clinton's direct involvement in such maneuvers was aimed
at illegally circumventing the regular spending limits on his 1996
campaign. But this year, while Republicans are pushing for a
special prosecutor, they do not want to live by the limits any more
than Clinton did. As a result, according to a report by Jill
Abramson of The New York Times, House Republican leaders will be
funneling $20 million in soft money into 60 congressional districts
in 30 states, Senate Republican leaders are channeling at least $6
million, and Senate and House Democrats are sending at least $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, it has been against the law for corporations to
contribute directly to campaigns. Since 1947 it has been against
the law for unions to do so. Since 1974 there have been strict
limits on contributions by individuals and political action
committees. But these curbs have all been rendered meaningless by
the soft-money evasion.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse application of this subterfuge, Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican fund-raiser in chief, is
using his power over soft money to punish candidates who dared
speak up for campaign finance reform. In Wisconsin, Senator Russell
Feingold, a co-sponsor of reform legislation, faces a tough
re-election challenge because of a flood of attack ads on abortion,
taxes and other issues, paid for by the Senate Republican
fund-raising arm.
</P>
<P>
   So great is McConnell's determination to perpetuate a corrupt
system, he is actually withholding campaign money from the
Republican Senate candidate in Washington, Rep. Linda Smith, who is
running a closely fought race against the incumbent, Patty Murray.
Ms. Smith has stood for campaign reform throughout her career. That
McConnell would withhold money from her suggests that he is more
interested in killing reform than in electing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The soft money raised by McConnell has come heavily from
interests affected by legislation before Congress, such as the
tobacco, banking, energy and mining industries. Both parties assert
that because the ``issue ads'' never directly tell viewers to vote
for or against anyone, they need not be governed by longtime
election laws. But that contention is absurd, since these ads use
the same images and words of the regular campaign ads, and they are
targeted to specific races that the parties think they can win.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department need
to declare that the soft-money gambit is an illegal circumvention
of the election laws. The next Congress has no higher priority than
closing the loophole and enacting genuine reform in the tradition
of what Americans have demanded since the dawn of the modern
political era.

   My young brother asked me what happens after we die. I told him
we get buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies. I
guess I should have told him the truth--that most of us go to Hell
and burn eternally--but I didn't want to upset him. --Age 10
</P>
<P>
   I once heard the voice of God. It said `Vrrrrmmmmm.` Unless it

   Hear about the fellow that was talking to his buddy, and he
said, `I don't know what to get my wife for her birthday - she has
everything, and besides, she can afford to buy anything she wants,
so I'm stumped.`
</P>
<P>
   His buddy said, `I have an idea - why don't you make up a
certificate saying she can have 60 minutes of great sex, any way
she wants it - she'll probably be thrilled.`
</P>
<P>
   So the fellow did. The next day his buddy said, `Well? Did you
take my suggestion?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, I did,` said the fellow. `Did she like it?` His buddy
asked.

</P>
<P>
   `Naw,` the man hollered back, `they ain't been around for

</P>
<P>
   Feeling safe, the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the

the gators?`
</P>
<P>
   `We didn't do nothin',` the beachcomber said.

EDITORIAL: SPIES FOR PEACE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency's role in instituting and
monitoring the new Middle East peace agreement has touched off a
useful debate about whether the agency's activities in the region
will corrupt its analytical work. But consideration of this matter
should not labor under the naive belief that the agency is somehow
entering unexplored territory. The CIA has long mixed action and
analysis, often with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   That need not be the case this time, but the Clinton
administration and Congress must be mindful of the agency's history
as they review the plans for the Middle East. The problem in the
past was not only that the CIA supported nefarious though friendly
foreign governments and trained their security services, but that
in doing so it compromised its ability to generate independent
assessments about those countries. Perhaps the best example was
Iran, where the agency's support of the shah blinded it to the
rebellion brewing in the streets before the 1979 Islamic
fundamentalist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Because CIA political and security operations are usually
conducted at the request of the White House, the temptation can be
great to tailor intelligence assessments to fit policy goals.
George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, must fiercely
protect the independence of his analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's role in the Middle East will be primarily to help
Israeli and Palestinian forces combat terrorism and to monitor
their compliance with the security plan, the last details of which
are still being worked out. The agency is already versed in this
area, and its augmented activities can be a productive model for
similar assignments elsewhere. But the agency will have to guard
against taking sides, or becoming involved in punitive actions that
make the United States a protagonist rather than a mediator in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Providing ample security for agency officials and technicians is
also imperative now that their work is no longer secret. The
Pentagon and the State Department have repeatedly failed to protect
American troops and diplomats stationed in the Middle East.
President Clinton has made an extraordinary and appropriate
commitment of American resources to help bring peace to the Middle
East. If the CIA is careful about avoiding past mistakes, it can
make an important contribution.

IBM BOARD AUTHORIZES REPURCHASE OF ITS SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM Corp. said Tuesday that its board had authorized the
repurchase of an additional $3.5 billion worth of common shares.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of IBM gained 62.5 cents, to $143.6875, on the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Like other companies, IBM regularly repurchases shares as a way
to increase per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares
outstanding. Although popular with selling shareholders _ typically
large institutions that receive cash _ the practice is also
controversial, particularly for technology companies and other
so-called growth sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies are expected to create new products and services
that should generate earnings growth, rather than buying growth by
share repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which last week reported stronger-than-expected
third-quarter earnings, said it planned to buy shares on the open
market from time to time, depending on market conditions. The
company has about 922.9 million shares outstanding. IBM announced a
$3.5 billion buyback in April as well, and has authorized eight
repurchases totaling $23 billion since the program started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was pretty much expected because they had run down much
of the last repurchase,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``I think it's a reasonable use of cash. How
many investment opportunities do they have that can return cost of
capital? They should be investing up to that point, and beyond that
they should return cash to the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, called the
repurchase a ``Wall Street perversion,'' that benefits selling
institutions to society's detriment and artificially inflates
current earnings and growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has already spent several small countries' GDPs on share
repurchases _ $23 billion and counting _ without creating a single
product or a single job,'' he said. ``It's a signal they don't have
the imagination or creativity to employ the capital more
productively.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week IBM reported a quarterly profit of $1.49 billion, or
$1.56 a diluted share, compared with $1.36 billion, or $1.35 a
share, in the 1997 quarter. Revenue for the period increased 8
percent, to $20.1 billion. The results were slightly above
analysts' expectations of $1.53 a share, according to First Call.

AMGEN INCOME BEATS FORECAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Biotechnology drug developer Amgen Inc.
has reported a 23 percent gain, stronger than expected, in
third-quarter earnings, driven by sales of the popular anti-anemia
drug Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday for the quarter that ended Sept. 30,
Amgen announced net income of $221 million, or 87 cents per share,
on sales of $700.9 million. The results beat the consensus forecast
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., who expected Amgen to
earn just 79 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's performance was also well ahead of its numbers from the
1997 third quarter, when the company reported income of $83.8
million, or 31 cents per share, on sales of $598.3 million. That
included a one-time charge of 35 cents per share stemming from a
lawsuit by Ortho Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Epogen, the company's most profitable product, paced
Amgen's recent strong performance. The Thousand Oaks company in
Ventura County west of Los Angeles sold $350 million worth of the
anti-anemia drug in July, August and September, a 23 percent gain
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen benefited from Medicare's loosening of reimbursement
guidelines for use of the drug in dialysis patients. Medicare last
year restricted payment for the drug to patients whose red blood
cell counts fell below a certain level in a 30-day period, but
reversed itself after intense lobbying by Amgen. Medicare is the
single biggest purchaser of Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate the power of a politically savvy
management,'' said analyst Charles Engelberg at San Francisco-based
AmeriCal Securities. ``They've done all the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen also announced Tuesday that its board of directors has
approved the repurchase of $1 billion worth of Amgen stock, a move
that typically puts upward pressure on an issue's price. The
company recently completed a buyback of similar size that it began
in October 1997.

`A MAN IN FULL': WOLFE TURNS `BONFIRE' UPSIDE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs lede to insert first `The' in `The Bonfire of the
Vanities')   (editors: publication notes at end of review)

 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Tom Wolfe's first novel, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities''
(1987), gave us a satiric portrait of New York in the giddy go-go
years of the 1980s _ those heady years when bond salesmen could
think of themselves as ``Masters of the Universe'' _ his sprawling
new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' gives us an equally entertaining
portrait of Atlanta in the 1990s, an era when greed has begun to
give way to debt, capitalistic hubris to premillennial doubts.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, almost from the start, that ``A Man in Full'' (which
will be available in stores Nov. 9) is a big if qualified leap
forward for Wolfe as a novelist. The cartoonish cast of ``Bonfire''
_ a collection of physical and sartorial tics animated by heaps of
authorial malice _ has been replaced by characters who bear more of
a resemblance to real, sympathetic human beings, and Wolfe's
novelistic canvas has expanded persuasively to include not merely
the powerful and rich but also the poor and middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Wolfe's nimble, often enthralling
orchestration of several rollicking story lines _ cross-cut
cinematically to build tension _ comes to a screeching halt in the
last few chapters of this novel as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus,
of all people, is introduced as a crude deus ex machina cum
self-help guru to provide this thick, Dickensian novel with an
abrupt, unsatisfying ending.
</P>
<P>
   As in Wolfe's last novel, an interracial incident that threatens
to be as incendiary as the Rodney King trial or Tawana Brawley case
holds center stage in this volume. In ``Bonfire,'' a white yuppie
stood accused of injuring a young black man in a hit-and-run
accident; in ``A Man in Full,'' a black football star named Fareek
Fanon is suspected of raping the daughter of a wealthy white
businessman. This incident not only provides Wolfe with ample
opportunities to satirize racial politics in Atlanta (not to
mention the politics of political correctness) but also gives him a
convenient pivot around which he can put several plot lines into
play.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those plot lines is the story of a blustering real
estate developer by the name of Charlie Croker, the so-called
``King of the Crackers,'' who presides, like a foul-mouthed
antebellum lord, over a 29,000-acre plantation and a vast
conglomerate of enterprises, including Croker Global Foods. These
days, however, Charlie has slipped into a late midlife crisis: at
60, he is suffering from a bad knee, doubts about his 28-year-old
trophy wife and high anxiety over the half-billion dollars he owes
his creditors. His money problems draw him willy-nilly into a
political scheme cooked up by the mayor of Atlanta to promote his
own re-election while defusing the explosive Fanon case.
</P>
<P>
   While Charlie is having trouble living on several million
dollars a year (much the way Sherman McCoy, in ``Bonfire,'' had
trouble living on $980,000 a year), Wolfe's other characters are
having similar difficulties on their far more modest incomes.
Raymond Peepgass, the mousy banker with Charlie's chief creditor,
PlannersBanc, can't make ends meet on $130,000 a year: he's already
maxed out 19 of his 22 Visa cards and owes his lawyer thousands
more for handling a paternity suit. As for Conrad Hensley, an
earnest young man who works in a Croker warehouse and finds his
life bizarrely colliding with his boss', he sees his dreams of
buying a condo for his family rapidly slipping away on his
$14-an-hour paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent the better part of his career as a reporter who
ardently documented his subjects' lives with dozens of physical and
sociological details, Wolfe tends to build up his characters from
the outside in. The reverse of a Method actor, he's a craftsman who
believes that people can be defined by externals like money and
clothing, that their behavior is largely driven by social context
and status (or lack of it).
</P>
<P>
   And so, Wolfe tells us what sort of cars his characters drive:
``a silver-gray four-door Lexus sedan,'' a ``rattling old Hyundai''
or a rented ``black Volvo 960 with veal-beige leather seats.'' What
sort of clothes they wear: ``a new hard-finished worsted navy suit
from Gus Carroll, a high-necked tab-collar shirt and a pale-blue
crepe de chine necktie with a &UR; perfect  &LR; dimple.'' And what their
accents sound like: `` `Unnh-unnh- &UR; unn
</P>
<P>
   There's Fareek Fanon, the football star, ``225 pounds of
attitude,'' wearing around his neck ``a gold chain so chunky you
could have used it to pull an Isuzu pickup out of a red clay
ditch.'' And there's Fanon's accuser, Inman Armholster, the sort of
ornery ``fat white man who exists only in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But if these characters are thorough stereotypes, Wolfe's main
men (Charlie Croker, Conrad Hensley and Raymond Peepgass) are more
three-dimensional, more fully fashioned human beings. Writing from
their point of view, Wolfe endows them with frustrations, fears and
conflicts that turn them into recognizable individuals while at the
same time using their picaresque adventures to try to create the
sort of big work of social realism, based on research and
reporting, that he has long advocated as a means (in his view,
 &UR; the &LR;  means) of capturing the Zeitgeist of ``this wild, bizarre,
unpredictable, Hog-stomping baroque country of ours'' as it
slouches towards the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``A Man in Full'' aspires to giving the reader an
inside look at how deals are struck in big city politics, how real
estate empires can be built on debt, how alpha males struggle to
achieve dominance on the football field, in business and in high
society.
</P>
<P>
   And Wolfe does give us some dazzling, funny, wrenching set
pieces, all rendered in his exclamatory, adrenaline-laced prose,
that take us from a plantation deep in the heart of Georgia to a
prison in Alameda County in California, from a glittering art
opening in Atlanta to a numbing night shift in a warehouse stocked
with frozen food.
</P>
<P>
   In his controversial 1989 Harper's manifesto for ``the new
social novel,'' Wolfe dismissed the notion that American life was
too ``chaotic, fragmented, random, discontinuous'' to be captured _
roped, tied down and branded _ by contemporary fiction writers, and
the strongest sections of ``A Man in Full'' do in fact leave us
with a sense of what it's like to live in the ``billion-footed''
world of today.
</P>
<P>
   The book's hokey, stage-managed ending, however, suggests that
Wolfe sees the world as such an absurd place such a chaotic,
fragmented, random, discontinuous place _ that he could cavalierly
(or desperately) tack on a ending that has virtually nothing to do
with what has gone before, a conclusion that subjects his
characters to fates that seem preposterous even in the ``age of
anomalies'' so energetically conjured up in this bold but flawed
new novel.

AT THE OPERA, WORDS TO LAUGH BY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Words, words, words: opera finds it hard to do without them. In
the 1950s, the German composer Boris Blacher wrote a wordless
``abstract opera,'' to which he gave the imposing title ``Abstract
Opera No. 1,'' though he never repeated the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   He left that to Gyorgy Ligeti, who in the next decade wrote
``Adventures,'' followed by ``New Adventures,'' for three singers
who communicate with one another and with their audience by
nonverbal means: muttering, cajoling, shrieking in surprise. And in
the decade after that, Philip Glass, in ``Einstein on the Beach,''
and Karlheinz Stockhausen, in ``Thursday,'' dispensed for long
stretches not only with words but also with onstage singers, to
create opera as mime.
</P>
<P>
   But these will probably remain special cases. Opera in general
needs singers, and singers need words. The problems start when we
come to what the audience needs.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that opera has to be sung in the
original language. Only that way can a word appear where the
composer wanted it to appear, at a particular point in the melodic
phrase, with particular details of harmony and orchestration in the
accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, so the argument goes, the sound and
structure of the language are essential to the sound and structure
of the music. And indeed, a lot of the differences between Wagner
and Verdi stem from differences between German and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that operas have to be done in the
language of the audience. Opera is theater; it's about people
expressing themselves to you in a language you understand. Why else
should a singer take trouble to enunciate and color the words? Why
else should a composer make sure those words will be
comprehensible?
</P>
<P>
   The history, the forms and the textures of opera all bear
witness to this constant urge to get the words across.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in this longstanding debate are right, of course, but
both sides can be satisfied only if the original language is one
the spectator understands. Under this condition, very few people
would be able to enjoy everything the Met is putting on this
season: ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' (Italian) and ``Moses und Aron''
(German), ``Khovanshchina'' (Russian) and ``Katya
Kabanova''(Czech), ``Carmen'' (French) and ``Susannah'' (English).
</P>
<P>
   For a while now, supertitles (or at the Met, seat-back titles)
have been taken as providing the best solution: the singers sing
what the composer wanted, while the audience sees what it can
understand. But to see words on a screen is not at all the same as
to hear them sung.
</P>
<P>
   Words on a screen are blank of affect: unaccented, untimed, they
are passionless. Nothing could be more different from how words get
treated by opera singers. There are, too, enormous difficulties in
translating librettos for the purpose of titles, in finding the
right voice for these unsung words.
</P>
<P>
   Take the New York City Opera's ``Partenope'' this season. For
the most part, the titles overhead adopted a formal diction
appropriate to Handel: ``I yield not to your valor but to my
fate,'' or ``A tempest of ferocious passions rages in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally a more contemporary phrase cropped up: ``Shut
up! _ I'm not saying anything,'' or ``Let's forget this _ Whatever
you say.'' Early in the third act you could almost hear the gears
changing as the titles went from ``This is a new disaster for me,''
``What troubles you?'' and ``My end is near'' through ``You worry
too much'' to ``I'd like to have your problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Such slips into the modern vernacular bring unintentional
comedy. The audience may not laugh as much as it did when, on the
day the Starr report was released, one character in the opera
announced, ``I admit my mistake if you'll forgive me.'' But laugh
it will. And the singers will try, as they tried in ``Partenope,''
to act up to accommodate the laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The humor comes not only from the incongruity. It comes from the
fact that somebody is addressing us, literally, over the
characters' heads. Somebody is in the know about what these people
are really saying, behind their 18th-century masquerades. To quote
again from the ``Partenope'' titles: ``Something doesn't feel right
_ Don't be silly.''
</P>
<P>
   The titles, flashing us news about the opera, invite us to
collude in a feeling of superiority over the characters. Instead of
bringing us closer to what the characters are expressing, the
titles take us farther away.
</P>
<P>
   We are given the sense that thanks to the titles, we are privy
to secrets the characters are trying to hide, with all this Italian
of theirs. That impression may make us feel comfortable, but it
does not involve us in the opera.
</P>
<P>
   The Met seat-back titles avoid such unseemly complicity. Because
audience members are all in control of their own cribs, the titles
conjure a private voice whispering in the ear, not a public voice
giving the lowdown from high up. This is more like the situation in
an 18th-century theater, where each audience member could have been
armed with a printed libretto, to be followed during the action in
the undimmed auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   If there are going to be supertitles, though, they could be used
in other ways. After all, there is no reason to assume that a
projection of the dialogue in English translation _ least of all a
projection of the dialogue in vulgarized English translation _ will
tell us what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   One might rather have supertitles that read: ``Allegro molto,
2/4 time, G major,'' or ``Cavatina with solo horn,'' or ``Neat
doubling of muted trumpet with clarinet and violas.'' And let the
characters sing for themselves.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If Houston is going to beat out Los Angeles to
get the 32nd NFL franchise, it would help to have the support of
Texas' other team owners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee's Bud Adams and Minnesota's Red McCombs are not sure
if the NFL will expand to a 32nd city any time soon, but both have
pledged to support Houston when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Jerry Jones favors expansion to a 32nd city, but he
calls Houston a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL meetings Tuesday, Bob McNair led the Houston
contingent that made its presentation to the owners. Houston was
sandwiched between the two Los Angeles groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Los Angeles, the second-biggest market in the
country, out there, and that's what Houston has to overcome,''
Jones said. ``Los Angeles is such a great market. I don't see an
appetite to expand by two teams at this time, so we've got two
cities for one team. That's what we've got to reconcile.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he isn't wavering in his support of Houston to get a
team to replace the Oilers. Some believe Jones would work against
Houston because the Cowboys have so many fans in the Houston area,
but he insists that isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to be realistic about it,'' Jones said. ``I
support Houston. The fans down there deserve an NFL team. It would
be great to have another NFL team in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of outstanding people are involved, and a lot of hard
work has been done. I know what a plus it would be to have that
Houston group in there, but that's what they have to overcome.
Otherwise, there wouldn't even be a question.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said Houston is the nation's fourth-largest city and
10th-largest television market. He doesn't believe size should make
a difference when the owners make their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is to look at the last two franchises that
were granted,'' McNair said. ``How big are the Jacksonville and
Charlotte markets? There were markets much larger that got passed
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (owners) look at those three legs of the
foundation that (commissioner) Paul Tagliabue has talked about as
being the criteria: the ownership, market and stadium. I feel very
comfortable about all three.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the only NFL owner who resides in Houston, was impressed
with McNair's presentation. Although the Oilers are struggling in
Nashville on and off the field, he claims there is no lingering
bitterness over what happened to him in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   About McNair's presentation, Adams said: ``I sure like what I
saw. I wish I'd had that, but we had the wrong mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown has taken the opposite approach of his
predecessor, Bob Lanier. Rather than go to war with the NFL, Brown
is lobbying the owners on behalf of the city to get a team. Brown
points out every opportunity he gets that he went to college on a
football scholarship, has ``sacked a few quarterbacks'' and loves
football.
</P>
<P>
   Adams doesn't favor expansion in the next couple of years,
because he doesn't want to divide the network-television pie by
another slice. Eventually, though, the NFL will expand.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue favors expansion to 32 teams by 2002 at the latest.
What Tagliabue wants, he usually gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a team come to Houston, but I don't know if
we're ready for expansion,'' Adams said. ``I would support Houston
if the timetable's right. Of course, I'd support Houston over Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who left Houston for Nashville because the city and
Harris County refused to build him a downtown domed stadium, has
tried to help McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud has been very helpful to me,'' McNair said. ``He's given
me any information I've asked him for. Any time I've asked him to
look at information we've put together and give his judgment
whether it's valid, he's responded.''
</P>
<P>
   No NFL owner is more excited than McCombs, who bought the
Vikings for $245 million. The Vikings are the NFC's only unbeaten
team, and they have a good chance of reaching the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When McCombs purchased the Vikings, he said he would support
Houston over any city other than San Antonio, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm not opposed to expansion,'' McCombs said. ``I applaud
Houston's presentation. I was very impressed.''

L.A. LENDER TO ABOLISH WHOLESALE DIVISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amid turmoil in the subprime lending market,
PacificAmerica Money Center is discontinuing its wholesale loan
division, which accounted for 75 percent of its business, the
company announced.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage lender, a specialist in loans to people with credit
problems, said Tuesday it will focus instead on its retail loan
division.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale loans accounted for $235 million in revenue vs. $86
million from retail loans for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the
mortgage lender said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to take a big hit in fourth-quarter
financial results. Shares of PacificAmerica dropped 18.75 cents to
93.75 cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in loan volume has a direct impact on revenues. The
company makes money from the spread between the loan interest that
homeowners pay and the interest that it pays investors in these
securities.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale loan division has been hurt by uncertainty in the
subprime market as securities investors flee to the safety of
Treasury bonds and other government paper.
</P>
<P>
   In wholesale, PacificAmerica makes money by selling the paper on
loans made to individuals with credit problems as rebundled
securities. These securities are sold to investors such as
insurance companies, pension funds and others.
</P>
<P>
   But the global economic crisis has made investors wary about
riskier investments, drying up demand for subprime securities, said
G.U. Krueger, deputy chief economist at the California Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Since mortgage lenders also typically borrow the money they lend
out, these companies are caught in a crunch between low demand for
subprime securities and pressure to repay what they have borrowed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is new borrowing readily available for these lenders,
Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the money used to warehouse those loans has dried
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the subprime lending market also derailed
PacificAmerica's merger with Fremont General Corp. in Santa Monica
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, PacificAmerica's shares have dropped 97
percent from a high of $27.75. It now has a market capitalization
of $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica executives declined to comment.

AMERICA ONLINE EARNINGS SET RECORD IN FIRST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. reported record first-quarter profit and
revenue Tuesday, surpassing Wall Street estimates, on strong growth
in membership, advertising and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies now provide Internet service, analysts
said, none have emerged with the brand recognition of America
Online. And because America Online still provides substantial
content and specialized online functions of its own, users tend to
spend more time with the service than they do on other so-called
Internet portals. This ability to retain users' attention helps
draw advertisers and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, America Online reported earnings
of $108.4 million, or 39 cents a diluted share, more than triple
the $31.7 million, or 13 cents a share, it posted in the quarter a
year earlier. Revenue rose 65 percent, to $858.1 million, from
$521.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding tax benefits accrued from losses in previous years,
America Online earned $68 million, or 26 cents a diluted share,
compared with $19.2 million, or 8 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected America Online to earn 23 cents a share
excluding the tax benefits, according to First Call Corp., which
tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   America Online announced its results after the close of the
market. Its shares rose $1, to $122, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it increased its membership by 951,000
during the quarter, bringing its total to 13.5 million on Sept. 30.
Over the last year, the online service has added 4 million members.
America Online raised the price of its unlimited dial-up service to
$21.95 a month, from $19.95, on April 1, but the growth of its
subscriber base has continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trends were consistent with what I expected, but the ultimate
financial results were better,'' Steve Case, the chairman and chief
executive of America Online, said in a telephone interview.
``Subscription growth, in a seasonally slow period, was pretty
remarkable, particularly following on the heels of the earlier
price increase,'' he said. ``We're moving now into a seasonally
strong period, so things look pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from subscriptions climbed to $714.7 million, up 65
percent from last year's first quarter. Revenues from advertising
and electronic commerce climbed 133 percent, to $102.8 million,
compared with $44.1 million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also said Tuesday that its board had voted to
declare a 2-for-1 split of the company's common stock, effective
Nov. 17. The split is America Online's second this year and its
fifth since November 1994. A stockholder who bought 1,000 shares
for $11,500 at the initial public offering on March 19, 1992, and
held the stock would, after the latest split, own 32,000 shares
valued at $1.9 million.

NEW REPUBLICAN ADVERTISING BLITZ CENTERS ON PRESIDENT'S SEX
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(subs lede to reword characterization of GOP ads) 
 (ATTN.: Ga, N.C., S.C.) (Also moving in `p' category) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sudden strategy reversal during the last week
of the campaign season, the Republican Party on Tuesday night
opened a $10 million nationwide television advertising blitz that
uses President Clinton's sex scandal as a theme, both directly and
with winking innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, party officials had stayed clear of Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky in their advertisements,
expressing concern that it would prompt a backlash from voters who
have grown weary of the scandal and the looming impeachment
hearings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   But after debating strategy throughout the weekend, officials at
the National Republican Congressional Committee decided that recent
surveys showed enough evidence that the scandal weighed heavily on
the minds of voters they were trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, they believe, might prod those voters to go
to the polls. So as part of their final get-out-the-vote push, the
committee bought the advertisements, settling on three 30-second
commercials that will be broadcast in up to 70 media markets in the
closing week of the campaign. The Republicans' decision could again
move the Lewinsky matter to the forefront of the national political
discourse before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials try to link the scandal to specific issues. In
one advertisement, the narrator does not mention the scandal at
all. It closes with footage, but no sound, of Clinton, in slow
motion, wagging his finger at the camera as he did when he misled
the country in January by publicly declaring that he had not had
``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That advertisement opens with tape of Clinton changing his mind
on how many years it will take to balance the budget. Then the
announcer says, ``It took the Republicans just four years to get
the job done. And get the budget balanced. Now there's a budget
surplus. And a Republican plan to save Social Security. And a
Republican plan to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. America
needs the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Clinton appears on the screen wagging his finger, the
narrator says, ``Remember, it's your choice. For balance. Vote
Republican.'' The image of the president freezes on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In another commercial the tone is set with ominous background
music. Against grainy black-and-white shots of people at the polls,
the announcer asks: ``Should we reward Democratic plans for more
big government? More big spending? Should we reward their
opposition to more welfare reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``And should we reward not telling the truth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the question of this election. Reward Bill Clinton.
Or, vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The third commercial features a conversation between two women
in their 30s. ``What did you tell your kids?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to say,'' the other says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong. For seven months he lied to us,'' the first one
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But aren't there other things to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And say it's OK to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, the Republicans are doing them. They cut taxes. They
helped balance the budget. And they're putting people on welfare
back to work. And now they have a plan to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they considered dozens of possibilities for
scripts, including even blunter messages. One that was shelved
featured Steve Grossman, the national chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, who had praised Clinton for his moral
leadership. But officials said they figured that the slightly more
subtle approach would be most effective _ and least likely to put
off voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge in this environment is to acknowledge its
existence and to pivot to issues that we want to focus on,'' Mary
Crawford, communications director of the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee, said of the scandal. ``If you ignore it
completely, then your message can seem phony because it is so much
on the top of the public's thoughts about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sallick, Ms. Crawford's counterpart at the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the barrage of new ads:
``This just proves what we suspected all along, which is that this
Republican Congress is obsessed by scandal and investigating the
president. They are now sending a signal that they are abandoning
the political center and focusing entirely on appeasing their right
wing base.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the $10 million from the Republicans, Sallick
said his committee will spend $3 million on commercials in the
final days of the campaigns. The Democratic ads do not refer to the
scandal in any way.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist who was involved in the discussions
about the advertisements said they were being placed in districts
where they would have the most resonance. The spot about rewards,
for instance, is appearing only in three southern districts where
polling by the party found that Clinton is particularly unpopular
with swing voters. This strategist also said that the ads were
tailored to respond to polling that found that voters were not
upset about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky but about the
fact that he misled the public about it.
</P>
<P>
   The three districts where that commercial, about the president
``not telling the truth,'' is running are in those of three
vulnerable Democrats, Reps. John Spratt Jr., of South Carolina,
Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Bob Etheridge of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The two other advertisements are being broadcast in several of
the largest media markets in the country. In addition to those
three spots, the committee is broadcasting 29 commercials that will
run in districts throughout the country. Those will deal
specifically with issues and are tailor-made to help House
candidates in individual races.

CLEVELAND WINS NFL'S 31ST FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cleveland has a team. It begins play next
season and becomes the National Football League's 31st franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Three other groups _ one from Houston and two from Los Angeles _
made presentations to the NFL owners here Tuesday at their annual
fall meeting explaining why each should be selected as the NFL's
32nd franchise. That team would begin play as early as in year 2001
and no later than the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presentations were extremely well done,'' said Paul
Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner. ``We've been working with these
cities and expected that. We'll be working together through the
first quarter of the year. It's realistic to expect we'll have an
answer by then if we have a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. McNair, leading the Houston bid, said that his group
was the only one of the three that ``has the land, infrastructure,
design, money and is ready to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Football Group, led by Michael S. Ovitz, said his group
is ready ``to move swiftly from proposal to playing field.'' Edward
Roski leads the L.A. New Coliseum group and said his group has ``a
great project, a great story to tell and a great city.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, listened to all
three proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three made wonderful presentations but we will have a
better idea of where things stand in a couple of days. I personally
think it is important to have a franchise in Los Angeles. I don't
want another generation of young people growing up without a team
there. Houston, however, is ready to go and has the financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, said: ``We have to
expand to 32 teams to have an even number for scheduling and other
factors and I'd rather see it happen sooner than later. Houston has
all of its ducks in the water, as it said. But the L.A. groups have
beautiful stadiums proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed Tuesday were league Internet and NFL Properties
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The owners on Wednesday will discuss issues relating to
Cleveland's request for relaxing tampering rules so that it can
interview assistant coaches and other personnel besides head
coaches currently employed by NFL teams. And 1999 league game
scheduling changes due to Cleveland's addition will be discussed.

NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN NBA NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The meetings have not been billed emergency sessions,
but with the National Basketball Association scheduled to announce
the cancellation of more games today, negotiations between owners
and players may go a long toward settling the nearly
fourth-month-old labor impasse and salvaging the season.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and representatives from all 29 teams
will meet with Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and as many as 200 of
their peers Wednesday at a midtown Manhattan hotel. The meeting
represents the best hope for the two sides to try to work out a
revenue-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   With three bargaining sessions in the past four days, there are
clear signs that both sides are beginning to compromise. As the
financial losses mount _ player losses in salary may reach $200
million if cancellations are announced Wednesday _ much of the
rhetoric and posturing has begun to subside.
</P>
<P>
   The perception among many players is that the owners were merely
waiting for the players to lose paychecks before genuinely
exploring a deal. With an estimated 200 players standing firm for
the moment, the question now is whether the two sides can agree on
numbers in time to avert losing the season.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have pulled back on their insistence on a hard salary
cap, while the players have offered alternatives to help the owners
bring salaries in line with the league's revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, have indicated
that an agreement needs to be in hand by early December to prevent
losing the entire season. The league lost its first two weeks on
Oct. 13, the first time games were canceled in the NBA's 52-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a quick settlement, the rest of the November schedule _
and probably some December games _ will most likely be canceled
Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and Ewing, its
president, along with other players met with NBA legal
representatives Tuesday at a Manhattan law firm for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides discussed non-economic issues relating to player
conduct, including discipline and adding marijuana and
performance-enhancing drugs to the list of banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the owners' labor relations committee held its own
meetings and was apprised of developments from Monday night's
marathon bargaining session in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like two armies massing and moving toward the front, the two
parties fortified their positions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're talking and we seem to be talking about
the same thing,'' said Danny Schayes, a member of the union's
executive committee. ``The most important economic things are the
things we're farthest away on. But there is some hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Schayes was one of 13 players who took part in Monday night's
talks, a session that several participants said was the most
productive since the lockout began July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The key development seemed to be an agreement on an economic
framework that could be used to divide revenue and could lead to
the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement, a precursor
for starting the season.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, it would entail a hybrid from proposals on both
sides. For the first two years of the deal, a luxury tax would be
employed to bring salaries in line with revenue growth. The next
two years would involve the league's plan for an escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
   If total revenue devoted to salaries had not dropped to 52
percent, enough of that escrow money would be returned to the
owners to hit the league's targeted percentages _ 52 percent in the
2000-01 season, 50 percent in 2001-02 and 48 percent in 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   While the players have said the escrow fund amounts to a hard
salary cap _ which they said they will not accept _ the compromises
being discussed Monday night would not involve all escrow returned
to the owners. Instead, the sides discussed possibly instituting
the cap-tightening mechanisms the union has offered in its previous
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   There are reservations on both sides over whether the system
would work, but the fact that the owners and players seem to be
closing in on a concept represented initial hope that the season
could begin before next year.
</P>
<P>
   After the league's board of governors convenes at 8:30 a.m.
Tuesday, nearly half the league's 400-plus players are expected to
file into a midtown hotel for their own meetings. Both sides plan
to face off sometime in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the executive committee, most players will observe
the talks rather than participating directly in the bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting on player-conduct issues was the first time
both sides talked at length about issues other than economics since
late last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The players, as concerned as the league about the image problems
of some of their peers, have made several concessions on behavioral
matters. Few specifics were agreed on, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a lot of issues, but I can't say we made a lot
of progress,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal
counsel.

HURRICANE MITCH BATTERS HONDURAN COAST, MOVES OMINOUSLY TOWARD
YUCATAN PENINSULA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico _ One of the most dangerous hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean in a decade meandered ominously in the region on Tuesday,
forcing thousands of residents and tourists to abandon homes and
resorts in Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, a Category 4 storm, one class below the most
powerful, battered the coast of Honduras and the Bay Islands
offshore Tuesday night, and sent tropical-storm force winds and
heavy rains into Guatemala, Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the countries ordered thousands to evacuate their
coastal homes for shelters on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico declared a ``maximum alert'' for three states on the
Yucatan Peninsula, closed 37 ports up and down the Gulf and
Caribbean coasts, and sent nearly 1,500 army troops into Quintana
Roo state to prepare for relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Fear-stricken vacationers besieged Cancun airport, seeking
flights that would take them away from Mitch, described by U.S.
forecasters as potentially one of the most catastrophic ever to
buffet the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph with higher gusts,''
a statement from Miami's National Hurricane Center said Tuesday
night. ``Some weakening is forecast during the next 24 hours, but
Mitch is still expected to remain a very dangerous hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, when Mitch's 180 mph winds made it a
Category 5 storm, forecasters said that only three other Atlantic
storms were stronger _ Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor
Day hurricane of 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of Honduras and Central America were warned to expect
up to 20 inches of rain, and forecasters said there was a
significant chance of life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.
Coastal flooding from strong offshore winds and large battering
waves was occurring over much of the northwest Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   At least five deaths were reported in the past days associated
with the storm's rains, two in Honduras, and one each in Jamaica,
Panama and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch's eye was located about 45 miles north of the Honduran
coast late Tuesday. Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 60
miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extended up
to 175 miles.
</P>
<P>
   After slowly traveling west northwest for 24 hours, Mitch
changed course Tuesday to head west-southwest at 6 mph. It was
expected to move on that course until sometime Wednesday afternoon,
the hurricane center said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's path was hard to predict because of its slow
movement and because of a malfunction on a key U.S. government
satellite, one of two the U.S. National Weather Service uses to
track weather. U.S. forecasters said planes and the other satellite
were tracking the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican Caribbean resort of Cancun on the northeastern
tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, many tourists heeded the storm
warnings and fled the area Tuesday. Hundreds jammed the airport,
trying to grab a precious seat out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the predictions of such a destructive hurricane we're
heading to Mexico City,'' said Elaine Gardner, a retiree from
Chicago. ``All morning people were checking out, everybody was
leaving. People are sitting in the lobby with their bags packed.
It's time to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner and her husband were among the lucky ones; they were
able to get on a plane bound for the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was far more serious for the mostly poor people who live in
the low-lying coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon the weather took a rapid turn for the worse
with the sky turning as black as night as rain started to fall
heavily. Winds picked up, bending palm trees along the built up
promenade that runs the length of Cancun's Caribbean coast. Fierce
waves pounded the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, really wild,'' said Melissa Weber, an American
who fled nearby Cozumel island on Tuesday morning. ``The ocean was
violent. People wanted off that island!''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said she was prepared to take a plane to anywhere but
after being told there were no more spaces left on a flight to
Houston, she resigned herself to a anxious night in a wind-lashed
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well,'' she said ``Where's the hurricane party?''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel managers promised guests they would find alternative
accommodations if they deemed it necessary. Cancun authorities set
up several shelters in schools, churches and community centers and
urged locals to go there if they felt unsafe in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists said some Cancun residents advised visitors to get out
if at all possible. Many people here have lived through hurricanes
before, including the devastating Hurricane Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natives were telling us if you have an opportunity to get
out then go,'' said Louis Clemente, a New York accounts executive.
``They know more about this than we do. We've decided we are taking
off and hopefully we'll get out of here before Mitch arrives. It's
an eerie feeling. There's a lot of confusion and you can feel the
tension.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, workers at the modern new airport taped up windows
and reinforced plate glass walls with heavy wooden beams. Airport
personnel were calm yet apprehensive about what they believed was
in store for the coming hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is going to be very powerful,'' said laborer Reyes
Polanco. ``I lived through Gilbert and according to what they say
it was nothing compared to what this will be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Those gloomy predictions were laughed off by one south
California couple who after ``watching the weather channel for
days,'' decided they they were not going to let a hurricane ruin
their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have an adventure,'' said Linda Dewitt, a Los
Angeles resident who touched down at the airport as everyone else
was trying to take off. ``We could tell coming through the airport
that with all these people leaving we might have made the wrong
decision. (But) it won't be L.A. All we ever get there is sun.''

`SWAN LAKE': IS IT THEATER OR DANCE, GAY OR STRAIGHT?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthew Bourne's production of ``Swan Lake'' opened on Broadway
as something of an anomaly. Word from Los Angeles, where the
production played last year, was that the show was touching but
campy. Earlier reviews in England, where the show originated,
tended to dwell on what this ``Swan Lake'' was not, particularly
among the older dance critics.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most famous (and in some circles infamous) English
reviews, the peppery veteran critic Clement Crisp sounded relieved
to report that the relationship between the prince and swan was not
homosexual. ``The swans are oddly sexless,'' Crisp wrote in The
Financial Times in September 1996, when the production opened at
the Piccadilly Theater, ``and when (Adam) Cooper appears as the
Black Swan at the ball _ a brutish incarnation of erotic force _
his activities are as blatantly heterosexual as they are
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The move from a small dance house to the London equivalent of
Broadway effectively took this version of the ballet classic into
the realm of larger issues. Was it theater or dance? Was it
straight or gay? One of the pleasures of this ``Swan Lake'' is that
it is open to so many interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   That richness, which has made the production a widely discussed
entertainment event, comes in part from Bourne's failure to carry
some of his themes through. Succumbing to the youthful, unthinking
impudence that makes his production so much fun, Bourne, who was in
his mid-30s when he created ``Swan Lake,''fails entirely to prepare
the viewer for his ending, when the swans savagely peck their
leader to death in a major departure from the ballet scenario.
</P>
<P>
   And the Private Secretary _ in the ballet the evil magician
Rothbart _ is involved in so many plots to drive the already
fragile young prince crazy that it is sometimes almost impossible
to figure out what is going on in Bourne's version of the ballet's
third act.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bourne is full of imaginative, yeasty ideas.
His best-known innovation, aside from all those male swans, is his
use of the ballet plot to spoof England's royal family. An easy
target for parody these days, certainly, but Bourne handles the
humor with a remarkable lack of heavy-handedness. And while his
choreography for the swans is unimaginative, his social-dance set
pieces are witty, knowing responses to the Tchaikovsky score and to
the classical ballet idiom.
</P>
<P>
   That idiom is what gives the show its weight and surprising
degree of formal grandeur. It is unfortunate, then, that this
``Swan Lake'' is being so energetically marketed as theater,
particularly when the producers, perhaps hedging their bets and
going for the largest possible audience, have left the ballet name
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it have made more sense to rename the show ``The
Broadway Swan Lake'' or even sever the umbilical cord and call it
``Cob Lake''?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, theater critics were recruited for the opening reviews
in New York, though dance reviewers were welcomed. ``More like a
musical that happens to be danced,'' an early press release
adroitly reassured reviewers. Radio advertisements quote theater
writers and even pull in one improbable reference to Marlon
Brando's Stanley Kowalski. Does it matter if ``Swan Lake'' is dance
or theater? ``Only at Tony time,'' one of the heavily courted Tony
award voters said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway musicals do tend to sell better than straight theater
or dance. ``This is not ballet,'' Cameron Mackintosh, a producer of
the Bourne ``Swan Lake,'' commented on a recent edition of the WNET
public television show ``City Arts.'' ``I (italics)hate(end
italics) ballet. I would never go to see a ballet. It would send me
off to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Not having seen any ballet, apparently, Mackintosh may be
forgiven for his ignorance of the fact that dance and classical
story ballets, like ``Swan Lake'' in particular, are as much
theater as his ``Cats'' or ``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not coincidence that Bourne and most of the performers in
``Swan Lake'' have extensive training in dance. It is also not a
coincidence that two major ballet companies have chosen to call
themselves American Ballet Theater and Dance Theater of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are no words in Bourne's ``Swan Lake,'' apart from
``Ole'' and ``the odd grunt,'' as the lead performer Adam Cooper
engagingly puts it. But harried ballet directors work hard to raise
money for the kind of spectacular sets and costumes that are de
rigeur for productions of such classics as ``Swan Lake,''
``Giselle'' and ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' all examples of the kind
of narrative dance that has helped to define classical ballet in
the 19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Do away with the dancing in ``Swan Lake,'' whose
characterizations were always fraught with the kind of Freudian
tangles that Bourne has seized upon, and what would you have? That
script about an unhappy boy meeting an unhappy girl, falling in
love and then losing his girl when her naughty look-alike seduces
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne does not parody ballet itself, with the exception of a
dreary anachronistic ballet-within-the-ballet in the first act. And
he has left his ``Swan Lake'' open to more than one interpretation
sexually, though he is said to have been taken aback when a writer
suggested, at a Dance Critics Association conference this year in
New York, that Bourne's doomed prince had been ``punished for being
queer.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling similar reactions in Los Angeles, Bourne has talked
publicly of his surprise that the prince would be assumed to be
gay.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility is hard to ignore in the ballet ``Swan Lake,''
whose prince is bored by the princesses dancing for him on his
birthday but lavishes loving attention on the crossbow his mother
has given him. And it is clear that Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' has a
powerful effect on many gay men.
</P>
<P>
   Male audience members stand with their arms casually about one
another on the street during intermission, with an openness that is
dangerous even in the city's predominantly gay neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Men do not dance together with impunity on Broadway except in
tango shows. And there is considerable flirtation and sexual sadism
in Bourne's choreography. The men may be wearing feathers, but
those bare backs and powerful wingspreads are anything but effete.
</P>
<P>
   One of the high points of the production occurs after the
prince's first encounter with the swans, when he suddenly
communicates, without a word spoken, the liberating realization
that he may not be so different after all. It is a moment that
cannot help to resonate with any class of people trained to
isolation, particularly in Ben Wright's poignantly innocent
interpretation of the role.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't gay audiences be turned on by homoeroticism,
as one gay audience member observed, particularly in a musical
comedy with a score such as Broadway has never heard? He, after
all, had spent a lifetime having to get his ``jollies'' from
straight stories.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' arrives in
perilous times for classical ballet and for gay men and women.
Until recently, it has been possible to tune out the kind of
public, government and church-sanctioned homophobia that fills the
American media these days, in a time when homosexuals have begun to
claim their place as mainstream citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal symbolism of the killing of Matthew Shepard may make
it difficult _ or even impossible _ to appropriate Bourne's icons
with anything like the old, comfortably wistful identification.
</P>
<P>
   And ballet? `` `Swan Lake' is in bad shape on our stages,''
Crisp wrote in a commentary that rings true for ballet everywhere.
``I cannot think of one local ballerina able to perform
Odette/Odile in the grand manner, nor do our productions make sense
of the old ballet. Bourne's revision, to judge by its success,
represents what the public wants of this masterpiece: jokes and
shocks and a whiff of tragedy. The real tragedy is about ballet
itself, and has to do with the fate of `Swan Lake' in our time.''

   BOSTON _ Listen up, Zoomers and Ubbi Dubbi linguists of all
stripes, childhood pleasures are coming around again.
</P>
<P>
   PBS is reviving ``Zoom,'' the daily variety series for
6-to-12-year-olds that was one of the most popular children's shows
of the 1970s. Considered a coupling of ``Sesame Street'' and
``Laugh-In,'' the series was second only to ``Masterpiece Theater''
in its power to attract public-broadcasting viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For a culture now gripped with nostalgia for the bell-bottoms
and tie-dyed T-shirts of that decade, WGBH, the public television
station here, has shot 40 new episodes of the show, replete with
the old secret language Ubbi Dubbi, and scheduled a nationwide
premiere for January.
</P>
<P>
   The 90s ``Zoom'' hosts have shorter hair, rounder faces and
narrower bell-bottoms than their predecessors _ and no need to ask
if hockey can be a girl's game. But what the producers of ``Zoom''
are trying to re-create is not the 1970s version of youth culture
as fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond disco music, polyester leisure suits or drug-dazed
daffiness, they seek to extol the deeper values of the 1970s:
peace, love, activism, power to the people and free, creative
expression, recurrent themes of the original series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about empowering children,'' said Kate Taylor, the
executive producer. ``We want to give kids the power _ in a safe
and supportive way _ to write down their ideas, guide us and, as a
reward for taking the risk of reaching out, give them a TV show and
a continuous dialogue with us.''
</P>
<P>
   No puppets or animation here. ``Zoom,'' which focuses on
literacy, science and math, did and does again call upon real
children from around the country to provide the show's contents.
</P>
<P>
   For the new series, for instance, Patrick of Flatwoods, Ky.,
sent in a video depicting the construction of a paddleboat from
styrofoam trays and rubber bands. The video was made part of one
show, showing the final result: the vessel was launched and even
floated.
</P>
<P>
   Striving for education through participation, ``Zoom'' urges
young viewers to send in ideas for games, puzzles, recipes, poems,
skits and conversations. The station responds via a newsletter and
e-mail. Viewers are also asked, over the air, to summon up enough
confidence in their own creativity to turn off the television and
do the activities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's interactive (among other things). And that interactive
format should position ``Zoom'' to take advantage of digital
television when it introduces real-time two-way communication, said
Peggy Charren, founder of the advocacy group Action for Children's
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show has positioned itself for the digital future by
reviving some of the deeper values of the 70s past,'' she said.
``Zoom'' also has a Web site (www.pbs.org/zoom) and an e-mail
address (zoom(at)wgbh.org).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Charren believes there's good reason to revive ``Zoom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been anything like it before or since,'' she
said. ``A lot of the '70s nostalgia is banal, but `Zoom' teaches
children what they need to know to function in a democracy and
helps busy parents organize creative play for them. It's for and by
kids; it's not based on selling merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent day at WGBH, on the purple, yellow, orange and acid
green ``Zoom'' set, the new show's hosts, ages 9 to 14, were hard
at work. Alisa, David, Jared, Keiko, Lynese, Pablo and Zoe _ all
from the Boston area and none of them professional actors _ are
known by first names only to avoid creating a star system, said Ms.
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Passing out pieces of bubble gum for one segment, the children
asked the age-old question ``Who can blow the biggest bubble?'' In
response, they chewed and puffed as the sticky stuff burst on
freckled cheeks, pigtails and noses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pack of gum can be fun for hours,'' they chanted. ``If you
like what you see, turn off the TV and try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Zoe, un-self-consciously wearing a blue bicycle helmet,
presented her flea circus. She coaxed the imaginary but
nevertheless fabulous Fernando to do his death-defying back flip on
a seesaw made of a ruler laid over a cork. As the ``flea'' soared
in the air, the other children did the sound effects off camera:
barking dog, drum roll and slide whistle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Zoe had patiently spent a half-hour trying to perfect the
30-second bit, she momentarily deflated and curled onto the carpet
for a catnap.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the children divided up for a relay race in which
each team had a suitcase of old clothes. The children pulled the
oversize shirts and slacks over their own clothes, ran to their
teammates on the other side, then peeled off and repacked the
clothes for the next contestants.
</P>
<P>
   While most children's shows have adult hosts, an educational
show with real children as hosts helps build young viewers'
self-esteem and interest them in learning, said Joanne Cantor, a
professor of communication arts at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television has a potentially limitless power to positively
affect viewers if the money and effort are put in,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that was true for ``Zoom'' the first time around.
When it was introduced a generation ago, the show was unusual
because it received praise from children, parents and television
critics. Wildly popular among children, the show received about
10,000 letters a week, but it also received two Emmy Awards for
outstanding children's series.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times described the
show's success as ``almost startling'' and attributed that to
``first-rate editing and presentational techniques'' plus the
``spontaneous creativity of children'' and their ``infectious
exuberance.'' Any young viewer, he said, could believe ``that he or
she would be sensational on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless in 1973, faced with a chronic shortage of funds,
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in Washington threatened to
cancel ``Zoom.''
</P>
<P>
   In an act of '70s-style political activism, ``Zoom'' hosts asked
viewers to press for the show's continuation by sending letters to
CPB. Deluged by about 190,000 pieces of mail, CPB found the
necessary $700,000. Today it costs $8 million to produce one
season.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the revival of the show, which ran from 1972 through
1979, is also a matter of timing. ``As people in their 20s and 30s
have children, they reminisce about their own childhood,'' said Ms.
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are risks in retreads. Old Zoomers may not like
the new features (among them, shorter segments, more dynamic
graphics, a bolder color scheme and Zoomchats in which children
talk about major issues from starting school to divorce). And young
viewers may resist watching a show with which their parents
identify.
</P>
<P>
   As they wrap up shooting, it's clear that making the show has
been like an extended summer camp for the Zoom cast, which will
change next season. In June, the group bonded through a
two-and-a-half-day Outward Bound-style retreat in a nearby suburb.
At WGBH, the children had their own private playroom, where they
learned the material for each segment, rehearsed, ate and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   And they are learning at least one very adult lesson. As David,
age 10, said, ``The hardest thing is, I don't want this to end.''

`SWAN LATE': A JOLT FOR THE NEEDY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Broadway. Of three recent arrivals, the one production to
become a critical hit is not only in for a limited run, but also
isn't really a Broadway show at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a full-length ballet, ``Swan Lake,'' Matthew Bourne's
exuberantly free and satiric reinterpretation of the standard
version of the ballet as choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev
Ivanov in 1895. Though the Tchaikovsky score remains more or less
intact, Bourne, an English modern-dance choreographer and director,
has come up with his own cheeky, sometimes remarkably poignant
version of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   If the reviews pay off, ``Swan Lake'' could well duplicate the
production's success in the West End two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if it does, ``Swan Lake'' will be saying a lot less about
classic ballet as a future Broadway trend than about the hunger of
Broadway audiences for theater that offers the possibility of
astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   The two other recent Broadway arrivals are going to have to
fight to hang on. ``Footloose'' is a big generic teen-age musical
designed to attract those audiences that have been at loose ends
since ``Grease'' closed. ``Getting and Spending'' is the kind of
straight play that aims very carefully to please, and misses. It is
a soberly silly comedy about a sweet young woman charged with
insider trading on Wall Street and the brilliant lawyer who defends
her on the eve of taking his vows in a religious order.
</P>
<P>
   Do they fall in love? Is she really as greedy as she never quite
seems? Does he get her sprung? Will he turn away from God? Where
have you been all your life?
</P>
<P>
   That the new Broadway season is beginning so uncertainly was
underscored by my New York Times colleague, Jesse McKinley, in the
On Stage and Off column of Oct. 23. According to the report, the
only certifiable hits of the season to date are three unusual
straight plays, each running in a comparatively tiny Off Broadway
house: Margaret Edson's ``Wit'' at the 99-seat MCC Theater, the
revival of Tracy Letts' ``Killer Joe'' at the 199-seat SoHo
Playhouse and the revival of Charles Ludlam's ``Mystery of Irma
Vep'' at the 250-seat Westside Theater/Downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic public response to these productions has
resulted in advance ticket sales that are phenomenal by Off
Broadway standards ($125,000 in one three-day period for ``Killer
Joe,'' and more than $350,000 for ``Irma Vep''), while the
producers of ``Wit'' are frantically looking for a larger theater,
possibly one on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet considering the state of our theater today, and the state of
mind of theater audiences, would Broadway provide a happy home for
``Wit'' or for either of the other two hits? I'm doubtful, and not
necessarily because of the huge amounts of money needed for such
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   When people go to ``Wit'' at the MCC Theater on West 28th
Street, they have to make a real physical effort. The theater is
not easy to find. The stairs to the second floor space are steep.
By the time they sit down, they have made an emotional commitment
to what they are about to see.
</P>
<P>
   They also have some idea of what is in store: an extraordinary
actress, Kathleen Chalfant, in a small, rich, devastating play
about a woman in the process of losing her life.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets are inexpensive, but audiences don't go to one
theater instead of another to save money. It's cheaper and easier
to stay home. Audiences go Off Broadway because they are informed.
They haven't been steered by friendly ticket brokers; they have
made conscious decisions on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the state of mind of the audience that informs
the performance, but also the physical nature of the theater
itself. Move that exact same production to a theater six, seven or
eight times as large uptown, on Broadway, and priorities as well as
expectations shift.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will be in attendance not because they have any
interest in the play itself but because it is this week's must-see
hit, or because they couldn't get tickets to something else. Some
people seeing ``Wit'' unprepared, having paid $55 to $60 a seat,
might hate it. They might also hate the entire idea of serious
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The SoHo Playhouse, which in an earlier age was the Vandam
Theater, is as ramshackle as any Off Broadway space I know, which
makes it the ideal location to see a white-trash comedy like
``Killer Joe.'' The place has a kind of clammy authenticity to it
that matches the slovenliness of the characters on the stage. In
much the same way, the alarmingly low ceiling at the Westside
Theater/Downstairs on West 43rd Street reflects the pinched budgets
and limited resources of old-time B-movies that are so lovingly and
hilariously evoked by Everett Quinton and Stephen DeRosa in ``The
Mystery of Irma Vep.''
</P>
<P>
   As matters now stand, these hits are subsidized most directly
not by any government arts programs, private foundations or
commercial producers, but by the actors, directors, writers and
crafts people who make them possible. They work for peanuts in the
expectation that they will transfer to larger spaces producing more
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A few productions can move without damaging the original
product. Others, like ``Wit,'' ``Killer Joe'' and ``The Mystery of
Irma Vep'' have to pay attention. They might easily get lost, not
only in the economics of Broadway but also in its larger, airier,
more impersonal spaces. It's an impossible situation, but Off
Broadway and the nonprofit companies continue to go their own way,
sometimes triumphantly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of ``Swan Lake'' is the opportunity to see
what is essentially a classic, full-length ballet in a theater the
size of the Neil Simon. The Neil Simon is certainly not a small
Broadway house, but it is an intimate space when compared with the
Metropolitan Opera, the New York State Theater or some of the newer
barnlike Broadway theaters where one usually sees such attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the sightlines good, but also the sound has the
purity of something untampered with. The orchestra, conducted by
David Frame, fills the theater without the crude, electronically
amplified emphases by which our song-and-dance shows communicate
emotions and tell us when it's time to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Technology never gets in the way of Bourne's update of the old
tale, now seemingly set in what often suggests London of the
mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The generic unhappy prince of old, originally called Siegfried,
now simply the Prince, is recognizable as a sympathetic spinoff of
Prince Charles. As a boy, he clutches a toy swan when he sleeps. As
an eligible young bachelor, he is charmed by the wrong women,
drinks too much, frequents low dives and dreams of escape from a
life of empty ritual.
</P>
<P>
   His chilly mother is a sexually rapacious queen who, apparently,
buys not British but French; her costumes suggest the kind of
clothes Givenchy made for Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the enchanted swan princess has become a swan
prince, identified in the program simply as the Swan. He is
attended by a flock of aggressively territorial, often threatening
male swans (the corps de ballet), who leap, thrust, turn and leap
again, always in edgy concord with their leader. Shoe-less and
bare-chested, the swans wear only knickers made of feathers, which,
in the case of their leader, just as easily suggest the fleece of a
goat.

 UNDATED: a goat.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Swan materializes as the sodden Prince considers suicide in
a park in the lost hours of the night. The creature is half man,
half swan, seducing and seduced, both savior and satyr. This
initial encounter, a series of love duets danced with increasingly
furious passion, ends the first half of ``Swan Lake'' on a level
that the performance doesn't achieve again until the spectacularly
choreographed death-and-resurrection finale.
</P>
<P>
   he performance has its soft spots for someone like me, who is
not a committed ballet fan. There are gestures in narrative ballet,
such as the miming of dialogue, as in a silent film, that seem only
to break the spell created by music and dance. I would rather such
conventions were eliminated completely. The story isn't all that
subtle anyway, but when it is, it is sometimes more fun to be
confused than filled in.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne has a high old time sending up royal routine and dropping
in isolated references to some of the Windsor family's recent
problems. There is a red-headed Duchess of York figure
(uncharacteristically, rail-thin), a young woman who behaves badly,
and even a mechanical dog recalling Queen Elizabeth's fondness for
corgis.
</P>
<P>
   If you laugh at Bourne's comic conceits, it is not because they
are so witty but because they are recognized. They are extremely
thin compared to the genuinely dramatic impact of the dark fable of
a love that truly cannot be. Bourne is less effective as a satirist
than as a poet of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   At the intermission of the performance I attended, a man said
rather brusquely to his woman companion, ``I guess this is what
they call homoerotic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no more than partly true. In fact, transforming the swans
from dainty tutu-wearing toe dancers into marauding males
eliminates the camp aspect of the story. The magical thing about
this muscular ``Swan Lake'' is that Bourne's choreography, though
sometimes suggestive, seems far more romantic than erotic, and the
Prince's escape from life is, indeed, a kind of triumph. Carnal
knowledge is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Two sets of dancers are alternating in the lead roles throughout
the Broadway run. I saw Scott Ambler, who actually looks somewhat
like Prince Charles, as the prince. Adam Cooper, who has the
sinister good looks of the youthful Sting, played the dual role of
the Swan and his evil counterpart, who turns up at the Queen's
ball, wearing black leather and carrying a riding crop, where he
spurns the prince and dallies with the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has the more spectacular assignment, but Ambler, as both
a dancer and an actor, gives the production its center of gravity.
Each performer is superb. ``Swan Lake'' is a memorable
one-of-a-kind event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Footloose,'' the 1984 movie on which the musical at the
Richard Rodgers Theater is based, was directed by Herbert Ross, a
notable choreographer as well as a witty, sure-footed director.
When Ross makes foolish films, you can bet that he knows exactly
what he's doing and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footloose'' is a foolish film that was cannily targeted at the
teen-age market, with which it immediately connected. Set in a
small town where dancing is outlawed, it is about nervy teen-agers
who flirt, dance, play chicken with tractors, dance, smoke dope,
make out and dance.
</P>
<P>
   It has a gorgeous setting (somewhere in the west where the
distant mountains are always snow-capped), a cast of pretty young
performers headed by Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer, and a pulsating
rock soundtrack score that, like the boom-box in the street, hardly
ever stops. It made no sense whatsoever, and nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the show tries its darnedest to make sense, to
integrate the songs into a story that doesn't exist, and even to
explore the character of the dopey Christian minister responsible
for the law against dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Bobbie, director of the smash revival of ``Chicago,''
wrote the book with Dean Pitchford (author of the screenplay) and
staged the result, while A.C. Ciulla is officially credited as
choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footloose'' is without character, charm or wit and after two
acts, it just sort of stops. The dancing is busy, if without much
verve. It looks mostly like exercise. The score, contributed by
various composers and lyricists, makes use of a number of songs
from the film, supplemented by new songs, all of which eventually
sound alike.
</P>
<P>
   As Ren, the young outsider who fights the good fight to make
dancing legal again, Jeremy Kushnier sings and dances with energy
and the promise of an emerging style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Chepiga's ``Getting and Spending,'' at the Helen
Hayes Theater, is not a disaster. It is an extremely mild,
resolutely uncontroversial comedy-drama about characters who are
simply too nice to be allowed anywhere near a Broadway stage, where
they come across as self-satisfied, politically correct bores.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Phillips (Linda Purl) pulls off a series of
insider-trading deals to net $18 million to help needy families.
Richard O'Neill (David Rasche) is in the process of giving up a
successful law career to get in touch with his inner being (and
God) as a monk. Before taking his final vows, he returns to the bar
to defend Vicki.
</P>
<P>
   The other characters include a couple of comic, ``Going My Way''
monks, a gruff judge (who is a sweet guy underneath) and one of
Vicki's faithful suitors, who also comes up trumps. Watching the
play is like being in an especially cheery 12-step program for a
problem you can't remember.
</P>
<P>
   The actors cannot improve the material, nor can John Tillinger,
a director of taste and humor. James Noone's scenic design
initially looks quite jazzy: a set of two perpendicular and two
horizontal bars, the height and width of the stage and studded with
tiny light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   These may spell out stock prices or quotations from Bartlett's.
The bars also move swiftly up and down and from side to side to
define playing areas, sometimes (as if by accident) forming the
occasional cross. After 15 minutes, they become seriously annoying.

DOMINIQUE MOCEANU, PARENTS SETTLE TEEN'S SUIT TO BE CERTIFIED AS AN
ADULT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dominique Moceanu and her parents on Tuesday settled
the 17-year-old gymnast's lawsuit to be certified an adult, lawyers
for both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Details will be released Wednesday, but Dumitru and Camelia
Moceanu have dropped their opposition to her being certified as an
adult, said a source who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Yarrell, Dominique's court-appointed attorney, said she
approved the agreement on Dominique's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached at the first face-to-face meeting
between Dominique and her parents since she ran away from their
Spring, Texas, home Oct. 17. It will be presented to state District
Judge John Montgomery Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional time for all three of them, and they
worked through their differences of opinion and reached an
agreement,'' said Yarrell.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Dominique and her parents said they would not
comment until Wednesday, releasing only a joint statement, saying,
``The parties have met amongst themselves and as a family unit have
resolved their differences. It is anticipated that an agreement
will be submitted to Judge John Montgomery for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties met during what was scheduled to be a deposition of
Dominique by her parents' attorneys, at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will remove an Oct. 19 temporary restraining order
keeping the Moceanus away from Dominique, said their attorney,
Jimmy Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement only addresses Dominique's request to be certified
as an adult, not her claims that her parents have squandered her
earnings since she turned professional at age 10, Yarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy W. Moore, an attorney hired by Dominique, would not say if
she might take further action against her parents to get an
accounting of her money _ which would require that she be certified
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Dominique will also be able to sign contracts and
earn endorsement money, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   To be certified an adult, Moore said last week, Dominique must
prove she is living apart from her parents and is financially
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus have denied that they have squandered their
daughter's trust fund, which she won't have access to until she
turns 35.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu, 44, has said he has spent all of Dominique's
trust fund to build a gym _ which his daughter wanted _ at 6120
Louetta in Spring, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggins, a friend of Dominique's who has helped her hide
from her parents, has said the gym cost about $4 million to build
and equip. Huggins provided professional services during the
construction of the 70,000-square-foot gym, which opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu has declined to say how much the gym cost, but
his lawyer, Katherine Scardino, said Monday the cost was about $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said all the gyms' revenues go to Dominique's parents.
She said Dumitru Moceanu has told her that he earned $15,000 last
year from the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said she proposed to settle the lawsuit with the
Moceanus last Friday by asking them to agree to Dominique's adult
status and allowing a third party to supervise her trust fund. She
said they refused, because the trust fund was a ``family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, the only member of the 1996 U.S. gold medal women's
gymnastics team still competing in all gymnastics events, has said
she hopes to compete in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique and her parents had been scheduled to go to an
emergency hearing Wednesday on her parents' concern about her
safety. They said Dominique was not being adequately supervised by
Yarrell and was under the influence of an undocumented immigrant
and two men of suspect motives, the latter three having helped
Dominique run away.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said the Moceanus were initially opposed to allowing
Dominique to be certified as an adult because they feared the three
people who had been helping her flee and hide would leave her
``penniless.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said that fear was groundless and that Dominique has
said she had acted entirely on her own. Dominique said she is
confident her coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26, will be able to stay in
the United States even though she is in the country on a work visa
and was fired by Dominique's father on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The two men accused of influencing Dominique, Huggins and Jeff
Pudlo, another coach who was fired Oct. 17, have said they are only
trying to help Dominique. &QL;

   TRUE BLUE, Grenada _ Seen from the campus here, the Caribbean
Sea appears so serene and breathtakingly beautiful that it may be
hard to remember that just 15 years ago this month the United
States fought a sort of war to save St. George's University.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 troops were sent by President Ronald Reagan to rescue
medical students he feared would be taken hostage by a hostile
government allied with Cuba. But even in the midst of that
conflict, a few soldiers found the setting so congenial that they
later returned as students.
</P>
<P>
   For an institution barely two decades old, St. George's
University has had a remarkable history. Begun in 1977 and run
privately by Americans as an offshore program for aspiring doctors
unable to gain admission to American medical schools, it has
survived both political turmoil here and skepticism about its
quality abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with an enrollment of nearly 2,000, up from 760 during
the invasion, St. George's is poised for a burst of growth. The
university is building a 45,000-square-foot library, classrooms,
laboratories and student housing, the fruits of a $25 million
building program.
</P>
<P>
   But the most profound changes have to do with academics. Trying
to become a truly Caribbean university, St. George's has begun both
a School of Arts and Sciences for undergraduates and a School of
Graduate Studies, allowing students to specialize in public health,
tropical medicine, anthropology and other subjects of regional
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our attractive location and our diverse student
body, we have a unique opportunity,'' said Dr. Peter Bourne, the
university's newly appointed vice chancellor and formerly an
adviser to President Jimmy Carter on health and science. ``Within 5
or 10 years, we can become the eminent academic institution in the
Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the university, though, remains its medical school,
which has trained nearly 2,500 doctors. C.V. Rao, the dean of
students, who began there as an anatomy professor, recalled, ``We
started with 200 students and 5 faculty members, teaching in a
wooden hall so small that they had to repeat their lectures, and
today we have a faculty of nearly 600.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, enrollment was drawn primarily from students whose
grades fell short of what American medical schools were demanding.
Though many a B-movie has poked fun at offshore universities as
havens for slackers, the truth is that students at St. George's are
comparable to those at many American medical schools: the average
college grade-point average of enrolling students is 3.4 on a 4.0
scale, compared with 3.56 for those at medical schools in the
United States, according to the Association of American Medical
Colleges; the average Medical College Admissions Test score of
applicants to St. George's is 26 out of 30, compared with 26.5
nationally. St. George's also has a healthy pool of seven to nine
applicants for every slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the people the U.S. schools didn't want because we
didn't quite fit the profile,'' said Christopher McWhorter, a
23-year-old second-year student who graduated from the University
of Georgia. ``For the past few years, the bar keeps getting raised
higher and higher, so I just decided to go abroad and come down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   During St. George's early years, virtually all the students came
from the United States or Canada. More recently, the university has
stepped up recruiting in Africa and Asia, especially in countries
that retain a British educational structure from colonial days and
use English as a language of instruction. Since 1993 the percentage
of non-American students has increased to more than 1 in 5, from
less than 1 in 10; the college is aiming for a 50-50 split.
Fifty-nine countries are represented this year.
</P>
<P>
   Studying in an international environment, particularly in a
third-world country, has some disadvantages, McWhorter said, but
overall the experience has been better than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to see the mix,'' he said. ``Just think, last night I
was playing cards with students from Iran, which is something that
could never have happened if I had stayed back in Georgia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate students from different educational backgrounds,
St. George's has arrived at ``a hybrid medical curriculum''
combining the North American and British systems, to use the phrase
of Dr. Allen Pensick, dean of basic sciences. ``We mix
problem-solving sessions along with didactic teaching,'' he said.
``For an international student population, we think that approach
is best.''
</P>
<P>
   For foreign students, enrolling at St. George's assures clinical
tryouts at affiliated hospitals in the United States and Britain,
often a prelude to obtaining a residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from India,'' said Ajay Malhotra, a native of Delhi who
attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook, ``it is
easy for me to adapt to a place like this, and they have very good
board pass rates here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-three percent of St. George's graduates passed the United
States Medical Licensing Examination on the first try, in June
1997, a figure comparable to that for graduates of American medical
schools and far above the 58 percent rate for graduates of other
offshore medical schools. According to St. George's records, 99
percent of its American graduates have been accepted for
residencies at 364 hospitals in 41 states, with 21 percent going on
to become chief residents, a designation bestowed only on the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pass rate is better than some of the Philadelphia schools
I couldn't get into, which I guess just goes to prove that grades
and MCAT scores have nothing to do with your clinical abilities,''
said Shira Gertz, 23, a Bard College graduate who majored in
biology and music and plans to become a neonatalogist.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the students it attracts, St. George's University
has struggled. Two years after the medical school was founded,
Maurice Bishop and his New Jewel Movement assumed power on the
island in a coup, established a Marxist government and allied with
Cuba. The leaders invited the Cubans to build an international
airport barely a mile from St. George's main campus.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1983, a more radical faction of the party overthrew
and killed Bishop, which led to fighting and fears that the nearly
1,000 Americans on the island, most of whom had some connection to
St. George's, might be taken hostage. After efforts to evacuate the
Americans failed, President Reagan ordered ``Operation Fury,''
which took the Cuban forces prisoner, flew the students to the
United States and installed a friendly government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 15 days, we were in Piscataway, N.J., conducting
classes at Rutgers Medical School with a new set of cadavers,'' Rao
recalled. The campus here reopened on Jan. 10, 1984, in a
significantly changed environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government brought in a lot of aid, and by 1990,
people began to look at this as a more stable place,'' Rao said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, who has been in office since
1995, said the university ``has played an enormous role'' in the
development of Grenada, not only providing jobs and tax revenues to
the island of 100,000 citizens but also a chance at higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean's leading institution of higher education is the
University of the West Indies, which this year is celebrating its
50th anniversary and has campuses in Jamaica, Barbados and
Trinidad. But with a population that exceeds 6 million people, the
English-speaking Caribbean produces 123,000 high school graduates
each year, far beyond the capacity of the University of the West
Indies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many of the region's most promising students have
gone on to colleges in the United States, Britain or Canada,
swelling the brain drain for which the Caribbean is famous. But
because of recent immigration restrictions _ and limitations on
federal grants to university and medical programs _ ``it is
increasingly difficult for students from third-world countries to
get into U.S. institutions,'' said Bourne, chairman of St. George's
department of psychiatry before being appointed vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the School of Arts and Sciences here, which, like the
medical school, has begun humbly, with 196 students, many of them
Caribbean residents, who are entitled to a reduced tuition rate of
$4,000 a year, compared with $10,400 for non-residents. School
officials, though, are planning to accommodate 1,000 students in
the near future, eventually as many as 5,000. St. George's, which
receives no money from the Grenadian government, relies on tuition
to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion comes in response to ``a great need to move into
areas where we can be of greater service to the Caribbean,'' said
George McGuire, associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences
and a former Minister of Education here.
</P>
<P>
   Programs of special interest to the Caribbean, like marine
biology and tourism, are under development. And in what Mitchell
called ``one of the more noble initiatives of the university,''
there is even a new Cricket Academy, intended to train promising
young West Indian players for international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be head and shoulders above everything else in the
Caribbean, to cease to be a foreign body in the area and face up to
the fact we are a Grenadian institution,'' Bourne said. ``We are
about halfway there, and I suspect that when we get there, there
will still be a lot of room for further expansion.''

SOCCER COLUMN: NEW AMERICAN COACH TRIED FOOTBALL FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Arena wanted to play quarterback, just like his
brothers, Paul and Mike. The problem was, when he reached the ninth
grade, he was not able to see over his linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a starting tackle, a friend of mine, who was 6-9, 320
pounds,'' Arena recalled Tuesday. ``I was maybe 5-1, 100 pounds. I
started for the freshman team, but it was pretty obvious I wasn't
going to be a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Bill Zito told him about another sport that was
played on crisp autumn afternoons at H. Frank Carey High School in
Franklin Square, on Long Island. And that was how the new American
national coach was introduced to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   This was not one of those ethnic deals, mom and dad and maybe a
bunch of uncles turning an infant on to the favorite sport of the
old country. This was a boy, already 14 years old, learning he
could be pretty good at a sport that requires a low center of
gravity and does not require a player to give up his creativity.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 14, of course, Diego Armando Maradona had already
been perceived as a prodigy. Real soccer nations produce feral
children who must score goals or live in shacks the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States has done quite nicely in producing a
national coach like Bruce Arena, now 47, who played soccer (and
lacrosse) for his high school and later for Nassau Community
College and Cornell University. In 1978, he began developing the
University of Virginia into the great men's program of its time,
winning five national titles.
</P>
<P>
   (He picked up motivational techniques by eavesdropping on
halftime talks by intense Dean Smith of North Carolina and
gregarious Jim Valvano of North Carolina State, through the vents
of the visiting basketball locker room.)
</P>
<P>
   When major-league soccer began in 1996, Arena led DC United to
the first two championships and a recent loss in the finals. Now,
instead of hiring somebody from another culture, the national
federation has hired its second straight home-grown coach,
following the Californian Steve Sampson, whose team could not beat
Iran (or Germany, or Yugoslavia, either) in the recent World Cup in
France.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were so scornful when the Yanks finished a statistical
32nd that Sampson tendered his resignation before he got his
boarding pass. Not long afterward, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands
and even Brazil, the runner-up, eased out their coaches, while the
French coach retired while he was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, by griping when our soccer lads cannot connect
on a pass, or cover a corner kick, Americans have finally joined
the world of nations. We have come of age.
</P>
<P>
   Arena predicted flat out Tuesday that the United States would
not win the World Cup in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge of my career will be qualifying for the
final 32 in Japan and South Korea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Americans could live with that realistic expectation,
Arena noted that Spain, with its great players and expensive
professional league, had failed to get out of the first round, so
it was no disgrace for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans can look at tennis and hockey,'' Arena said. ``The
international levels are so high that America has trouble winning.
Look at the Winter Olympics. We don't win as many medals as small
Scandinavian nations, and people accept that. Baseball? We invented
that. But we haven't arrived yet in soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena has a reputation for giving rather blunt advice on how MLS
should be run, but as Commissioner Doug Logan noted, Arena does not
``overcoach,'' but allows his players to perform. This was one of
the worst traits of the Sampson team in France: The players
bickered and yapped off the field, but seemed trapped inside a
rigid and dysfunctional system on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the crabby old guard from 1998 won't be back, and Arena
said he would favor the American players who perform the best
``week by week'' in MLS. He also debunked the theory that there are
Latino and other foreign-born players who have been overlooked by
the federation. This theory is much like the famous legend that
there are alligators lurking in the New York sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a myth,'' Arena said, referring to the alleged
soccer stars waiting to be discovered in parks in Long Island or
New Jersey or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there any Ronaldos walking around New York City?'' he
asked. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think there is a bicycle messenger pedaling
around Manhattan, with an American-born parent, to say nothing of
dancing feet educated in some Brazilian neighborhood. But for the
moment, the United States has a mediocre mix of home-grown and
imported players, and a coach who started off with the very
American dream of wanting to be a quarterback.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another Columbus Day had rolled around, and with it,
the annual Peter Vallone Columbus Day Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council and the
Democratic candidate for governor, stood on a dais at the Princeton
Club as the party faithful rhapsodized about his warmth, his
integrity, his leadership skills. After a particularly rousing
speech by Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, Vallone took the microphone
and spoke admiringly of his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been a contender if I had that,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   But in his 25 years in politics, Vallone's strength has never
been the passionate speech or the dramatic stroke. He is best known
for his equanimity, which has served him well as a legislative
leader but not in the campaign, where slick sound bites seem to
resonate more than ponderous policy discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbent Gov. George Pataki is only slightly more
charismatic. But he is popular and extremely well-financed, making
Vallone's first statewide race a constant exercise in frustration.
And throughout the campaign season, the governor's race has been
overshadowed by a highly charged contest for the U.S. Senate,
making it even harder for Vallone to catch voters' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles were apparent long before Vallone announced his
candidacy last winter, and political consultants warned him to stay
out of the race. But the normally pragmatic speaker remained
resolute. After all, term limits will force him to leave the
council by 2001, so this was his last chance to run for governor
with the fund-raising powers and connections he has as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   And so Vallone, who has never run for office outside his home
district of Astoria, Queens, and rarely vacations outside the
metropolitan region, has shopped himself around the state, trying
to convince voters that his vision extends beyond New York City and
that he can work Albany better than Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has painted himself as a politician who can fix problems
that he says Pataki has cavalierly ignored: the state's campaign
finance system, the high price of college tuition and the
inefficiencies of the managed care system, for example. When it
became clear that his proposals were not leaving voters breathless,
Vallone took the unusual step of defending President Clinton in a
television ad.
</P>
<P>
   But his boldest and most uncharacteristic strategy came in the
form of an attack on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Throughout his
campaign, Vallone has assailed the Republican mayor's plan to build
a new baseball stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan. He called for
a referendum that would let voters decide whether to spend public
funds on such a project.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's referendum proposal attracted a lot of attention, even
though a court ruling knocked it off the ballot last week. But less
than a week before Election Day, the candidate himself is still
struggling to make an impression. He is pleasant as can be when
pressing the flesh, but rarely seems to connect with people on a
deeper level.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of a poor neighborhood in Buffalo, Vallone smiled
benevolently as the owner of a dry-cleaning shop complained about
the pressures on small businesses. But he did not offer any
insights, and his thoughts were elsewhere as he left. ``Did you
ever see so many suits inside one place?'' he asked his aides.
</P>
<P>
   A picture that Vallone drew when he was 11 suggests that he saw
Astoria not just as home, but as the family fief. It shows the
neighborhood dotted with businesses run by his relatives: Uncle
James' barbershop, Aunt Helen's beauty parlor and the Astoria Civic
Association, founded by his father. ``All the bussnes' in the place
seem to be part of this family _ Ahem,'' the young Vallone, with a
child's uncertain spelling, wrote at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud,'' the council speaker said the other day in
his district office on Ditmars Boulevard, where the drawing hangs
amid photos of Vallone with Mother Teresa, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis (``You look like a movie star!'' she wrote on the picture)
and even Mr. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fortunate Vallone was born in Astoria on December 13,
1934, the son of a lawyer and a teacher whose families immigrated
from Sicily at the turn of the century. Charles Vallone, who
eventually became a Queens judge, taught his sons to treat everyone
as their equal. Vallone loves to recount the time his father
marched in a ``brotherhood'' parade through Astoria, his arms
around a rabbi and a Protestant minister. Catholic elders
disapproved of such displays, and a priest in the family's parish
was so angry that he blocked Peter's admission to the local Roman
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, church became part of Vallone's daily life when he
was 13 and his mother, Leah, developed ovarian cancer. A nun took
young Peter under her wing and persuaded him to attend Mass every
morning, saying it would help his mother recover. She did, and her
son faithfully attends morning services to this day. ``The nun said
if you go to church and pray, make that sacrifice, everything will
be all right,'' said Vallone, who keeps a list of people to pray
for in his shirt pocket and tells colleagues who disagree with him
that they are in his prayers. ``I never forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone attended Fordham University, his father's alma mater,
where he studied history and especially remembers a poetry class
where he learned to write in iambic pentameter. After graduating in
1956 he wanted to join the Air Force, but was rejected because he
had hay fever. So he continued in his father's footsteps, enrolling
in Fordham Law School and becoming active in the Astoria Civic
Association and his neighborhood political club, the Taminent
Democratic Club.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Vallone was 23 when he married Tena Buttigheri of Jersey City,
N.J., whom he met at a camp near his family's vacation bungalow in
the Catskills. They bought a little brick house around the corner
from where Vallone grew up, and had three sons: Peter, now 37;
Perry, 35, and Paul, 31. Vallone opened a small law office a few
blocks from home, specializing in trusts and estates.
</P>
<P>
   He became a celebrity in the neighborhood, succeeding his father
as the person to whom Astoria residents came for help. It was
hardly a role he minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the way my father lived,'' Vallone said. ``He was the
busiest man I ever met, out every night doing civic work. But he
was always home with us for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Vallone would come home every night in time to
hear the sons say their prayers _ then go out again for meetings.
``He didn't involve us in his political life,'' Perry Vallone said.
``He wasn't a disciplinarian but he taught us values, mostly by
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone first ran for office in 1970, seeking a congressional
seat but narrowly losing the primary to Herman Badillo of the
Bronx. He wanted to go to Washington as an elected official because
he was angry about the government's failure to withdraw troops from
Vietnam, he said. But while he longed for the opportunity to vote
on the issue, he shied away from anti-war protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too much of a patriot to openly demonstrate against
government,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, at 38, Vallone won a seat on the City Council
and went to work representing Astoria. He was a relatively quiet
member, taking diligent notes at meetings and never challenging the
leadership. From 1975 to 1985, he worked on revising the city's
3,150-page administrative code, tedious work that won him little
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone gained a reputation as loyal and hardworking, and in
1986 he was chosen to be the council's majority leader, an
arrangement worked out by Bronx Democratic leader Stanley Friedman
and Queens Democratic boss Donald Manes. A municipal corruption
scandal soon afterward left Friedman in jail and Manes a suicide,
freeing Vallone of political bosses.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately set out to make the council, long derided as a
rubber stamp _ if even that _ a more powerful force. But his
efforts were mostly in vain until 1989, when the U.S. Supreme Court
declared the city's powerful Board of Estimate unconstitutional.
Vallone played a prominent role in a subsequent revision of the
city charter that gave the council more budgetary and land-use
powers. He also increased the council's staff, started a political
action committee to raise money for incumbents and encouraged
members to speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is more socially conservative than many on the council.
He favors capital punishment and personally opposes abortion,
though he supports abortion rights as a legislator.
</P>
<P>
   But as speaker, he has let a few controversial issues come up
for a vote. In 1994 he allowed a vote on a bill to make it illegal
to block access to abortion clinics. And in 1986, shortly after
becoming the council leader, he permitted a vote on a gay rights
bill that his predecessor had blocked for years. Vallone voted
against the bill, which banned discrimination based on sexual
orientation, but it still passed.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has since become a supporter of gay issues, sponsoring
legislation last spring to make domestic partners the legal equals
of married couples in city contracts, housing and death benefits.
``We should never substitute our conscience for anyone else's,'' he
said in a recent interview. ``We should never think we know it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his talk of consensus-building, colleagues say,
Vallone is at heart a clubhouse-style politician who favors
stealthy negotiation over confrontation. He has stripped rebellious
council members of committee chairmanships, and he saves the most
lucrative council stipends for his loyal allies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, critics say, Vallone has rarely shown his
tough side to the executive branch. Even when he was trying to
procure more power for the council in the late 1980s, he almost
never battled publicly with Mayors Ed Koch or David Dinkins, both
Democrats. And Vallone coexisted quite peaceably with Giuliani
until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter never wants to have a fight about anything, but you
can't win recognition that way,'' one council member said. ``He has
never made his job a platform for Democratic principles.'' Vallone
bristled at that characterization, saying he has been friendly to
mayors only because ``they usually agree to what I ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has raised only $6 million and saved little of it for
the final week of the campaign, hardly enough to bombard the
airwaves with commercials. Polls show him slipping further and
further behind.
</P>
<P>
   What compelled Vallone to take on such a seemingly hopeless
race? Some colleagues say the decision was made by his closest
aides, who they say are more ambitious than the speaker and wield
considerable influence over him. But Vallone dismissed that notion,
saying he wanted to go to Albany ``to change the way things work.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of being a relatively powerless legislator, he
said, he is eager to be a chief executive. He has proposed cutting
public college tuition in half for students who excelled in high
school, replacing health maintenance organizations with a state-run
health care system and requiring government agencies to give hiring
preference to New York firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials say Vallone is better suited for the job
of New York City mayor than that of New York state governor, and
they question why the speaker would not prefer to run the city he
loves and knows well. But while Vallone says he has not ruled out a
mayoral run, he worries that the job would be too demanding for
someone who likes to be home for dinner and spend at least one day
a week with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be married to the city,'' he said in an interview.
``The mayor is in the public eye 24 hours a day. It's different if
you're governor. Do you have any idea where Governor Pataki is
right now?''

 &HT;    Bowden affair bitter loss even by Auburn standards
 &HT;    By Rheta Grimsley Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta criminal defense lawyer Timothy Herring is an
Auburn man. Bleeds orange and blue. (A lot.) Keeps his ear to the
ground and his eye on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   I called Tim to see which story he was buying about coach Terry
Bowden's midseason resignation, the shock heard 'round the Auburn
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tim hadn't picked a theory yet, said the whole l'affair de
Bowden seems hopelessly hydra-headed.
</P>
<P>
   But he had written a country song:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up football this year, and here's the reason/Can't
drink enough to finish this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn fans are singing the blues. All of us. Not so much
because of the losing, though that's bad. When all you have to
celebrate is a victory over Louisiana Tech the day after your head
coach takes a hike, times are hard.
</P>
<P>
   But we've lost before, Lord knows. Auburn wrote the sequel to
Job. There was 1950 when coach Earl Brown went down 0-10-0. In more
recent years Auburn fans studied advanced stoicism under kind,
hapless Doug Barfield, those steadily depressing, low-down,
mind-messing seasons when we got whupped often as the family mule.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that gargantuan shadow cast by the
cross-state legend, Bear Bryant. While he was alive and growling,
even in the years we won, we lost.
</P>
<P>
   This is much deeper, much worse. This is an internal squabble
that makes us look ridiculous to the outside world, and that hurts
like hell. It is hell. And maybe we are ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely turmoil in Terrytown,'' William White says.
White is editor of the Auburn Bulletin. He tried to set the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years at Auburn have been pestilence and plague
years of constant infighting _ the governor vs. the board of
trustess, the board of trustees vs. the faculty, budget slashing,
Bowden-bashing. Bowden's abrupt adios last week was the straw that
broke the tiger's back.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that everyone's stunned proves, for my money, that very
few Auburn fans were ready to fire the coach. Yell at him, maybe.
But fire him?
</P>
<P>
   Some students rolled Toomer's Corner when the news got out.
That's the Auburn ritual reserved for a big victory. But students
can be notoriously short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden met with his players, told them he was finished and then
sped away in his car to his farm in nearby Notasulga. The players,
bless their hearts, spent Friday night in a Lanett, Ala., motel,
where they wouldn't be disturbed by anything but their own
thoughts. Those were disturbing enough. They hadn't wished Bowden
gone.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of potential villains here. Bobby Lowder's
name keeps cropping up. He's a rich man who builds things in
Montgomery and _ some say _ is working overtime in Auburn tearing
things down.
</P>
<P>
   If you were rich enough, you might buy a professional sports
franchise, or an island. Lowder prefers to run Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder has denied it, but many believe he was calling the Bowden
shots. (Several years ago ``Lowder University'' bumper stickers
were seen about campus; he's that ubiquitous.) He certainly had
been instrumental in hiring Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Did Lowder buy himself a football coach, then decide to return
him, slightly used?
</P>
<P>
   Others blame the athletics director, David Housel. His strained
relations with Bowden were no secret. Housel is a straight-arrow
and probably does prefer his coaches cast in the Big Daddy mold.
But I, for one, don't think he made this decision.
</P>
<P>
   You give a few dollars to your alma mater and hope they'll buy a
new book for the library. If you're a sports fan, you'd prefer they
put a weight machine in the jock gym.
</P>
<P>
   If you give enough, you get good tickets to the games. If you
leave the school your entire fortune, they might even name a
building after you.
</P>
<P>
   But really big decisions at Auburn _ like running off the
football coach _ should swell from the ground up, be a consensus
that roars. And this was nothing like that.
</P>
<P>
   This was either wrong and premature, or we haven't heard
somebody's really good reason yet.

 &HT;    Spurrier says Dogs nicer under Donnan
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ After Georgia upset Florida 37-17 in Jacksonville
last season, for the Bulldogs' first win in the series in eight
years, many observers probably figured the rivalry had regained
some of its bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Gators coach Steve Spurrier, who seems to think the
Dogs are more cordial to him under coach Jim Donnan. Spurrier says
Georgia's players have stopped bad-mouthing him since Donnan
replaced former coach Ray Goff in Athens in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Goff) was there, you could tell how nasty the players
talked about me,'' Spurrier said. ``That meant that Ray Goff was
talking that way about me to his team, which I think is sort of
silly that he thought that would help. I've noticed the difference
now. Their players, they don't talk nasty about me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it's actually Spurrier who has toned down his
comments. His feud with Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer has been
well documented _ until this year, when the Vols handed Florida a
20-17 loss in overtime on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed Tennessee's players have stopped doing that, too,
for some reason,'' Spurrier said. ``Maybe I need to say something
to get them to start talking nasty about me again. We've not talked
too nasty. They've just interpreted everything we've said as being
nasty or arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess coaches have realized that getting mad at the
other coach doesn't help you beat them. I think that's been proven
over the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind routes
</P>
<P>
   Florida wide receivers Steve Shipp and John Capel were two of
the Gators' more heralded recruits in recent memory, with both
earning Parade All-America honors.
</P>
<P>
   But Shipp, a 6-foot-1, 193-pound redshirt freshman from
Charlotte, doesn't have a catch in his second season in
Gainesville, and Capel is being used only on reverse runs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Florida wide receivers coach Dwayne Dixon is using some
unique tactics to improve their pass-catching ability. Shipp and
Capel, one of the nation's fastest recruits a year ago, have been
running routes in practice with blindfolds to improve their route
running and feel for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make us feel through our routes like if we
have a defender on us,'' Capel said. ``It's scary, but since I've
been doing it, I've actually been running my routes better.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching Quincy
</P>
<P>
   Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter rushed for a career-high 114
yards in last week's 28-26 win at Kentucky, but he could have a
tough time breaking the Gators' containment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Against LSU, Florida shut down Tigers tailback Kevin Faulk and
forced quarterback Herb Tyler to beat them. Tyler was sacked four
times, and LSU rushed for only 57 yards, averaging just 1.6 yards
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want (Carter) to run it quite as much as he did
against Kentucky,'' Donnan said. ``We don't want them taking their
shots at him. Kentucky dictated a lot of that, letting him keep it
on the option.''
</P>
<P>
   This and that
</P>
<P>
   Donnan says strong safety Kirby Smart is questionable with a
bruised shoulder. ... Florida tailback Terry Jackson, who leads the
Gators with 577 yards and three touchdowns, returned to light
running on Monday, but he remains doubtful with a badly sprained
right ankle. Sophomore Bo Carroll is back from a bruised knee and
will play. ... Florida kicker Jeff Chandler's father, Donald
Chandler, was a Georgia letterman in track.

 &HT;    Despite 6-1 record, many are unhappy with Florida's offense
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Going into Saturday's big game with Georgia
in Jacksonville, Florida has a 6-1 record and is ranked No. 5 and
No. 6 in the major polls. If the Gators win, they still have a shot
at going 10-1 and landing an at-large berth in the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it looks as if Florida is having another very
good season. But if you listen to the Gator fans, you would think
that the school ought to drop the sport right now and start pouring
all that money into volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Auburn game Oct. 17. After Florida took a 24-3 lead at
halftime, coach Steve Spurrier decided to pull in the reins of his
offense. It appeared to be sound strategy, because word has gotten
around the SEC that Auburn's offense is so bad that it can't score
on a good defense. And Florida has a very good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our defense was playing, the only way we lose is if
the offense messes up and gives them the ball deep in our
territory,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   The 85,000-plus at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium did not agree. First
came the chorus of boos. Then, they stormed the exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking up late and wondering, `Where did everybody
go?' '' Spurrier said. ``I knew that some day they'd get tired of
my act. I didn't know it would be when we had a 21-point lead
against Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet the monster that Spurrier has created. From 1991 through
1996, Spurrier and the Gators won five SEC championships and one
national title, in 1996, by rolling to huge numbers with an offense
known as the Fun 'n' Gun. Florida didn't just beat people, they
stomped them into submission. And Gator fans loved it.
</P>
<P>
   For a group of fans that never saw an SEC championship until
1991, it has been a quantum leap on the expectation scale.
</P>
<P>
   In the national championship year of 1996, Florida led the SEC
with 46.6 points per game. Now, the Gators are averaging 31.6
points per game, and they have fewer than 25 points in four of
their five SEC games.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators have struggled at times on offense because of three
key factors: inconsistency created by shuffling quarterbacks Jesse
Palmer and Doug Johnson, Palmer's subsequent shoulder injury and
running back Terry Jackson's ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, our fans have gotten kind of spoiled,'' defensive
tackle Reggie McGrew said. ``They're not happy unless we're rolling
up these huge numbers. Winning doesn't seem to be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The past two years have seen the departures of such NFL talent
as quarterback Danny Wuerffel, running back Fred Taylor and
receivers Ike Hilliard, Reidel Anthony and Jacquez Green. As a
result, Florida finds itself in 1998 with an average and
mistake-prone offense _ by its standards.
</P>
<P>
   After three games this season, Florida led the nation in
turnovers with 15. So far, Florida has fumbled the ball 21 times,
losing 13. The Gators also have thrown eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, I know people got used to us scoring 40-50 points a
game but right now we're just not playing the way we used to,''
Spurrier said. ``Maybe we don't have the same kind of talent. I'm
not down on our guys. We just have to coach them to play smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida almost gave away its 16-10 victory at Alabama. Running
back Terry Jackson fumbled going into the end zone, and then Tony
George got beat deep late, giving Alabama a chance to win.
Afterward, Spurrier said his team wasn't ``playing like champions''
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I calmed down after about a day,'' he said. ``But if we had
lost that one, there would have been a lot of sad Gators around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Spurrier is taking more of a low-key approach to the
offensive woes. And he says the situation is not as bad as people
think:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida is one of only two schools in the nation ranked in the
NCAA's top 10 in both total offense and total defense. The other is
No. 1 Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida is sixth in the nation in passing offense (348.9 ypg)
and 10th in total offense (470.6 ypg).
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida ranks third in the nation in TD passes with 23.
</P>
<P>
   The yardage numbers remain respectable, but they have been hurt
by turnovers and the inability of the offense to score touchdowns
once it gets inside the opponent's 20-yard line. In Florida's last
14 trips inside the ``red zone,'' the Gators have scored only three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Florida's 1996 team had 59 trips inside the red
zone and scored 43 touchdowns for a success rate of .729.
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday's meeting with No. 11 Georgia, Spurrier is hoping
for a low-scoring game, as strange as that might sound. If
Spurrier's offense can give him a lead _ any lead _ going into the
fourth quarter, he'll shut down the offense and turn it over to the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job here is to win football games,'' Spurrier said, ``not
just run up a bunch of stats.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, things have really changed around here.

 &HT;    Hamilton status remains unclear
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two practice days into Georgia Tech's preparation for
Maryland, the quarterback question doesn't appear to be much
clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Hamilton, who suffered a hip pointer and left
Saturday night's Florida State game late in the third quarter,
returned to practice Tuesday but only to do very limited individual
work. During the first 20 minutes of practice, Hamilton took only a
couple snaps and made a couple short throws, moving gingerly all
the while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe needs to pick up a lot more if he's going to play on
Saturday,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said after practice.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, O'Leary, while still calling Hamilton
questionable, was more optimistic about his return and that of
running back/receiver Charlie Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good shot at getting both back,'' O'Leary
said during his lunchtime press conference. ``If anybody's taken
hits throughout these two years, it's been Joe. He handles these
things very well. Charlie does, too. I'd expect both of them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary told Hamilton not to speak with the media until he was
able to participate in practice fully. That may come as early as
today.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was not expected back in practice until today but was
able to do some light running during practice Tuesday. He was not
wearing a sling like he had been while watching practice Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said Rogers' injury was initially thought to be a
shoulder separation but the problem is more related to a nerve in
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for him to get a little bit more feeling back in
his arm,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   The real test should come today when both Rogers and Hamilton
are expected to give team drills a try.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, backup quarterback George Godsey has taken over
running the first-team offense. After getting thrown into the fire
Saturday night against Florida State, Godsey is using extra film
work, extra meeting time with offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen
and the extra practice time to get ready for a possible start and,
at the very least, playing time against Maryland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey, a redshirt freshman, has played in four games but his
most extensive playing time came against FSU when he was 5 of 10
for 63 yards passing. In his previous three appearances he had gone
2 for 8 for a total of 13 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was a learning experience for me against Florida
State,'' Godsey said. ``This week is going to be a challenge, too,
if Joe's healthy or if it's my turn. Either way, I've got to
prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Godsey said he's gotten support from Tech's running backs,
receivers and offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of timing and being used to someone,''
receiver Dez White said. ``Joe's real quick in his dropback and his
release. George is taller and his release is slower. I think George
will do fine.

LOW-KEY STYLE LONG SERVED VALLONE WELL, BUT NOW LEAVES HIM
STRUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `p' code) 
 (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another Columbus Day had rolled around, and with it,
the annual Peter Vallone Columbus Day Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council and the
Democratic candidate for governor, stood on a dais at the Princeton
Club as the party faithful rhapsodized about his warmth, his
integrity, his leadership skills. After a particularly rousing
speech by Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, Vallone took the microphone
and spoke admiringly of his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been a contender if I had that,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   But in his 25 years in politics, Vallone's strength has never
been the passionate speech or the dramatic stroke. He is best known
for his equanimity, which has served him well as a legislative
leader but not in the campaign, where slick sound bites seem to
resonate more than ponderous policy discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbent Gov. George Pataki is only slightly more
charismatic. But he is popular and extremely well-financed, making
Vallone's first statewide race a constant exercise in frustration.
And throughout the campaign season, the governor's race has been
overshadowed by a highly charged contest for the U.S. Senate,
making it even harder for Vallone to catch voters' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles were apparent long before Vallone announced his
candidacy last winter, and political consultants warned him to stay
out of the race. But the normally pragmatic speaker remained
resolute. After all, term limits will force him to leave the
council by 2001, so this was his last chance to run for governor
with the fund-raising powers and connections he has as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   And so Vallone, who has never run for office outside his home
district of Astoria, Queens, and rarely vacations outside the
metropolitan region, has shopped himself around the state, trying
to convince voters that his vision extends beyond New York City and
that he can work Albany better than Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has painted himself as a politician who can fix problems
that he says Pataki has cavalierly ignored: the state's campaign
finance system, the high price of college tuition and the
inefficiencies of the managed care system, for example. When it
became clear that his proposals were not leaving voters breathless,
Vallone took the unusual step of defending President Clinton in a
television ad.
</P>
<P>
   But his boldest and most uncharacteristic strategy came in the
form of an attack on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Throughout his
campaign, Vallone has assailed the Republican mayor's plan to build
a new baseball stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan. He called for
a referendum that would let voters decide whether to spend public
funds on such a project.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's referendum proposal attracted a lot of attention, even
though a court ruling knocked it off the ballot last week. But less
than a week before Election Day, the candidate himself is still
struggling to make an impression. He is pleasant as can be when
pressing the flesh, but rarely seems to connect with people on a
deeper level.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of a poor neighborhood in Buffalo, Vallone smiled
benevolently as the owner of a dry-cleaning shop complained about
the pressures on small businesses. But he did not offer any
insights, and his thoughts were elsewhere as he left. ``Did you
ever see so many suits inside one place?'' he asked his aides.
</P>
<P>
   A picture that Vallone drew when he was 11 suggests that he saw
Astoria not just as home, but as the family fief. It shows the
neighborhood dotted with businesses run by his relatives: Uncle
James' barbershop, Aunt Helen's beauty parlor and the Astoria Civic
Association, founded by his father. ``All the bussnes' in the place
seem to be part of this family _ Ahem,'' the young Vallone, with a
child's uncertain spelling, wrote at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud,'' the council speaker said the other day in
his district office on Ditmars Boulevard, where the drawing hangs
amid photos of Vallone with Mother Teresa, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis (``You look like a movie star!'' she wrote on the picture)
and even Mr. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fortunate Vallone was born in Astoria on December 13,
1934, the son of a lawyer and a teacher whose families immigrated
from Sicily at the turn of the century. Charles Vallone, who
eventually became a Queens judge, taught his sons to treat everyone
as their equal. Vallone loves to recount the time his father
marched in a ``brotherhood'' parade through Astoria, his arms
around a rabbi and a Protestant minister. Catholic elders
disapproved of such displays, and a priest in the family's parish
was so angry that he blocked Peter's admission to the local Roman
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, church became part of Vallone's daily life when he
was 13 and his mother, Leah, developed ovarian cancer. A nun took
young Peter under her wing and persuaded him to attend Mass every
morning, saying it would help his mother recover. She did, and her
son faithfully attends morning services to this day. ``The nun said
if you go to church and pray, make that sacrifice, everything will
be all right,'' said Vallone, who keeps a list of people to pray
for in his shirt pocket and tells colleagues who disagree with him
that they are in his prayers. ``I never forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone attended Fordham University, his father's alma mater,
where he studied history and especially remembers a poetry class
where he learned to write in iambic pentameter. After graduating in
1956 he wanted to join the Air Force, but was rejected because he
had hay fever. So he continued in his father's footsteps, enrolling
in Fordham Law School and becoming active in the Astoria Civic
Association and his neighborhood political club, the Taminent
Democratic Club.

 &HT;    White, team ready to take on Terrapins
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech receiver Dez White got an earful from
some Florida State defenders last Saturday night, one of whom
looked into a television camera and said ``Dez who?''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the game in constant company of good single and
double coverage and making only one catch for a 9-yard gain out of
the handful of passes that came his way, Tech's leading receiver is
looking forward to the Maryland game on Saturday, not to mention
next year's matchup with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have another opportunity,'' White said. ``I'm
going to get a chance to talk my own trash.''
</P>
<P>
   White meant that in a figurative way, because he's not a talker
on the field. Even so, he wouldn't have had much to say Saturday
night; Florida State held him below four catches for the first time
this season and kept him out of the end zone for the first time
since the Boston College game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated the whole time,'' White said. ``There were a
lot of times I was open, and we couldn't take advantage of it. We
beat ourselves more than anything they did, with penalties and
turnovers and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Maryland, White and company will be facing what has been
the league's weakest pass defense. Opposing quarterbacks have the
ACC's highest passing rating against the Terps, 145.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic about the game,'' White said. ``I'm
looking forward to going out and playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   If White has hung his head about his performance against FSU,
Tech coach George O'Leary said he hasn't noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows great emotion,'' O'Leary said, ``but he never shows
great sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary nomination
</P>
<P>
   The Football Writers Association of America has included O'Leary
among its 10 nominees for the Eddie Robinson national coach of the
year award. The winner will be announced Dec. 10. The others were:
Arkansas' Houston Nutt, Kansas State's Bill Snyder, UCLA's Bob
Toledo, Oregon's Mike Bellotti, Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, Tulane's
Tommy Bowden, Tennessee's Phil Fulmer, Arizona's Dick Tomey, and
Missouri's Larry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley on the net
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Charles Wiley, who will have surgery Thursday to repair
his torn anterior cruciate ligament, sent a message of thanks to
Georgia Tech fans on the Internet on Tuesday morning, writing, ``I
have been overwhelmed with your outpouring of concern and
sympathy.'' He received at least 40 responses from Tech fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley still has not made a decision on whether to apply for a
medical redshirt following this season, but he would have the
option because he suffered a season-ending knee injury his
sophomore year only three games into the season. Wiley is a senior
and is on pace to graduate in June.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards in line
</P>
<P>
   Junior linebacker Chris Edwards is coming off his best game this
season, with nine tackles, including one tackle for a loss, and a
quarterback pressure against Florida State, and he might work his
way into a starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards tied with Travares Tillman, Delaunta Cameron and Jesse
Tarplin for the team lead in tackles for the game.
</P>
<P>
   If Edwards starts, he would have to beat out either senior
Justin Robertson at weakside linebacker or senior Cameron at
outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Grantham to start
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle John Grantham, a former walk-on, got his first
career start against Florida State after a good week of practice
moved him ahead of Guenter Kryszon. He had to leave the game with a
sprained ankle and has been limited in practice this week. Grantham
was a back-up played backup on the offensive line last year before
moving over to the defense in the spring. The senior from Lakemont
earned a scholarship before the 1996 season.

 &HT;    Who's No. 1? Sorry, Duval. Your colleagues seem to favor O'Meara
 &HT;    WITH GLFNOTES
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Afew months ago, a more heated discussion could have
erupted about metal spikes vs. Softspikes. Mark O'Meara with two
majors captured in one season? How could there be any doubt about
him winning the PGA Tour's Player of the Year Award, voted on by
the players?
</P>
<P>
   To listen to many of the players assembled here this week for
the Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club, with David Duval
owning four wins and the chance for a $3 million season, the matter
is still pretty much settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look strictly at money,'' Tom Lehman said. ``David's
had a phenomenal year, but I'd say it's O'Meara by two lengths.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No contest,'' said Nick Price, the last player before O'Meara
to win two majors in one year, in 1994. ``Even if Duval wins here,
it's not going to make any difference to me, and I don't think it's
going to make too much difference to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's really a question, in my opinion,'' Phil
Mickelson said. ``What I look at is that four wins have been done
as recently as '96, but two majors in the same year (has) been
donewhat, (twice since) '82? I'd be surprised if Mark didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   The player to win four in 1996 was Mickelson, and he did not get
player of the year. Offering a slight disclaimer, Mickelson said,
``But if David were to win this week and surpass $3 million, I
might have to reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair brings up an interesting approach. Here in the
same town where Georgia Tech once shared a national title with
Colorado, he said, ``NCAA football has co-national champions. What
would be so wrong with having co-players of the year?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember that David also finished second in the
Masters,'' Mayfair said. ``If Mark doesn't make the putt, David's
in the playoff. I think if David goes over $3 million this week
with five wins, that's pretty hard to beat. ... But then again, as
long as I've been out here, nobody's ever won two majors in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was player of the year in 1994, when he took wins at the
British Open and PGA, becoming the first to win two majors since
Tom Watson won the British Open and U.S. Open in 1982. Lehman's
victory in the Tour Championship in 1996, which had followed one at
the British Open, pushed him to the top of the player voting. Even
if Duval were to win $720,000 this week and surpass $3 million,
many players still treat the majors as unique. Most also give
strong weight to O'Meara's World Match Play win over Tiger Woods
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark O'Meara, Mark O'Meara,'' Jeff Sluman said. ``They've both
had unbelievable years, but from what I've read, I don't think
David would say he deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson said, ``I think the overall weight of winning a
couple of majors in a year is the most important thing. I remember
in 1980 I won the British Open and five other tournaments and won
PGA of America player of the year, but there was a lot of weight
given to Jack Nicklaus because he won the PGA and the U.S. Open
that year.''
</P>
<P>
   While O'Meara has spoken modestly in discussions about the
player of the year voting, there seems to be a part of him
wondering lately: What do I have to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to a guy that for many years came in the media
room and everybody asked, `Why can't you win a professional major?'
'' O'Meara said Tuesday. ``Now I've won two major championships,
finished fourth at the PGA and had a reasonable showing at the U.S.
Open. Whether I get the vote or not, I'm not going to let that take
away from everything that's happened.

 &HT;    Lehman hanging in despite hurt shoulder
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least Tom Lehman hurt his right shoulder in the
process of being a good dad,at the British Open in July. Other
athletes strain their shoulders falling off bar stools. Lehman was
playing with his kids at an amusement park in Southport, England,
when the injury occurred. The physical damage was still the same,
however, and Lehman, with a slight tear in the shoulder, has not
been the same since. He has suffered a huge power loss that
probably will not improve until the shoulder gets complete rest.
``That big, hard draw has become a little fade,'' Lehman said.
After the shoulder kept him from playing at the Sprint
International the week following the PGA and Pebble Beach in
August, Lehman took off for a month, until Kingsmill. Fortunately,
he still had enough surplus cash _ $945,673 _ to maintain the 26th
position and a spot in the Tour Championship at East Lake. ``I'm
glad to be here,'' Lehman said Tuesday. ``I didn't know if I was
going to make it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade almost certain for Sarazen
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Billy Andrade has all but officially secured a spot in
next week's Subaru Sarazen World Open through one of 10 Squire's
Selections extended by the tournament. The spot became available
when John Huston qualified from the money list, having moved to No.
9 through his win Sunday at Walt Disney World. Indications are that
this week's unseasonably warm weather will continue into next week,
warming up what frequently has been a chilly adventure at Chateau
Elan. Last year, temperatures were in the 40s for the first round.
``You knew it was cold,'' tournament director Lon Fellenz said,
``when Craig Stadler put on a sweater.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, Jeff Sluman and Lee Janzen tied for low round in
Tuesday's pro-am with 3-under-par 67s. ... Mark O'Meara already has
won the PGA of America's Player of the Year Award, gathering 130
points to 88 for David Duval, 56 for PGA champion Vijay Singh and
44 for Tiger Woods. The Vardon Trophy, which goes to the lowest
scoring average and was won last year by Nick Price, is treated
nearly as respectfully by the players. Woods and Duval will battle
for the Vardon beginning Thursday. Woods holds a slight edge, 69.10
to 69.14. ... The PGA Tour Wives Association has tickets remaining,
at $100 apiece, for tonight's charity ``Golf Jam'' at the Hard Rock
Cafe. Lehman, Love and Jeff Sluman are among the players attending.
Call 404-527-7101 for information. ... Under the PGA Tour's new
television contract, purses are climbing dramatically in 1999. The
Doral-Ryder Open will go to $3 million, with $540,000 to the
winner. The three World Golf Championship events that debut next
year are $5 million purses, with $1 million first prizes. ... The
autograph policy this week permits autographs only after a player
has finished, from behind the iron fence from the scoring tent to
the clubhouse.

 &HT;    Alignment not likely to change

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barring a dramatic change of heart by NFL owners, the
new Cleveland Browns will play in the same division as the old
Cleveland Browns when the historic franchise is resurrected in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney will present a realignment
plan that would turn the AFC into a conference with four divisions
of four teams each in '99, his typically intransigent peers will
use the proposal only as a model for the long-term. The Browns will
be slotted into the AFC Central, making it a six-team division,
when the owners conclude two days of meetings in Kansas City this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says we need to shake things up, reshuffle the
deck,'' Rooney said. ``But it's the same, old story: `I'm for
change as long as it doesn't affect me.' The fans must think we're
ridiculous when it comes to (realignment), and they're right.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their placement, the Browns may win some
concessions from the league on anti-tampering rules. Owner Al
Lerner lobbied- Tuesday for a relaxing of the rules so Browns
president Carmen Policy might get a jump on interviewing head
coaching candidates. The current rules prohibit discussions until a
coach's season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Owners heard detailed presentations on Tuesday from three groups
_ one representing Houston and two from Los Angeles _ vying for the
league's 32nd franchise. That team likely will begin play in 2002,
and Houston businessman Bob McNair was said by several owners to
have made an impressive pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The league is expected to announce the site for Super Bowl XXXVI
in 2002 today, with New Orleans a slight favorite over San Diego.

 &HT;    New coach Arena looking to youth for U.S. rebuilding
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first lineup card that Bruce Arena will fill out
next week as the U.S. national team coach figures to have a number
of unfamiliar faces, but his long-term challenge of reviving
American international soccer fortunes might depend in part on how
well he can heal the wounds from last summer's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Arena, 47, who won the first two Major League
Soccer titles with D.C. United, was introduced formally Tuesday
after signing a four-year deal as coach and technical director
reportedly worth $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``New names and faces'' will grace the roster Arena will reveal
today for a U.S. friendly match with Australia Nov. 6 in San Jose,
Calif., but he also said, ``We haven't ruled out anybody'' as the
rebuilding process begins toward the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to talk to every player who was in the player pool
for France,'' Arena said. ``But right now is a great time to look
at young players and give them a chance to get some experience at
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those players could be former Parkview High star Josh
Wolff, who played the final 11 minutes Sunday as the Chicago Fire
defeated Arena and United 2-0 in the MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Arena will coach United a final two times in the Interamerican
Cup against South American club champion Vasco de Gama of Brazil on
Nov. 14 in Washington and Dec. 5 in Fort Lauderdale. Then in
January, he turns his full attention to the Confederations Cup in
Mexico, where the U.S. is grouped with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to worry about wins and losses initially,'' said
Arena, who won five NCAA championships at the University of
Virginia. ``Our goal is to build a team that will be able to
qualify for the final 32.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to revisit the World Cup debacle, in which the U.S.
finished last among the 32 teams and was torn by internal strife
between team veterans and his predecessor, Steve Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went wrong? They didn't win any games,'' Arena said. ``I
don't want to get into the inside of that, but it was a big
accomplishment getting to France.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena's appointment comes in a transition period for the U.S.
The veterans who helped raise the American soccer profile in the
1990 and 1994 World Cups are gradually passing from the scene, but
young players buoyed by the creation of the three-year-old MLS
haven't had enough experience under their belts to step into their
place.
</P>
<P>
   One World Cup veteran who might not be on Arena's first roster
is defender Alexi Lalas, a wannabe rock star who will appear on
tour with Hootie and the Blowfish in Europe next month.
</P>
<P>
   Fire goes for double
</P>
<P>
   Most teams that win championships get a celebration in their
honor; The Fire gets to play another game. After a downtown Chicago
rally in their honor on Tuesday, the MLS champions began preparing
for Friday's U.S. Open Cup finals against the Columbus Crew at
Soldier Field.

 NEW YORK: Democratic Club.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vallone was 23 when he married Tena Buttigheri of Jersey City,
N.J., whom he met at a camp near his family's vacation bungalow in
the Catskills. They bought a little brick house around the corner
from where Vallone grew up, and had three sons: Peter, now 37;
Perry, 35, and Paul, 31. Vallone opened a small law office a few
blocks from home, specializing in trusts and estates.
</P>
<P>
   He became a celebrity in the neighborhood, succeeding his father
as the person to whom Astoria residents came for help. It was
hardly a role he minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the way my father lived,'' Vallone said. ``He was the
busiest man I ever met, out every night doing civic work. But he
was always home with us for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Vallone would come home every night in time to
hear the sons say their prayers _ then go out again for meetings.
``He didn't involve us in his political life,'' Perry Vallone said.
``He wasn't a disciplinarian but he taught us values, mostly by
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone first ran for office in 1970, seeking a congressional
seat but narrowly losing the primary to Herman Badillo of the
Bronx. He wanted to go to Washington as an elected official because
he was angry about the government's failure to withdraw troops from
Vietnam, he said. But while he longed for the opportunity to vote
on the issue, he shied away from anti-war protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too much of a patriot to openly demonstrate against
government,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, at 38, Vallone won a seat on the City Council
and went to work representing Astoria. He was a relatively quiet
member, taking diligent notes at meetings and never challenging the
leadership. From 1975 to 1985, he worked on revising the city's
3,150-page administrative code, tedious work that won him little
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone gained a reputation as loyal and hardworking, and in
1986 he was chosen to be the council's majority leader, an
arrangement worked out by Bronx Democratic leader Stanley Friedman
and Queens Democratic boss Donald Manes. A municipal corruption
scandal soon afterward left Friedman in jail and Manes a suicide,
freeing Vallone of political bosses.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately set out to make the council, long derided as a
rubber stamp _ if even that _ a more powerful force. But his
efforts were mostly in vain until 1989, when the U.S. Supreme Court
declared the city's powerful Board of Estimate unconstitutional.
Vallone played a prominent role in a subsequent revision of the
city charter that gave the council more budgetary and land-use
powers. He also increased the council's staff, started a political
action committee to raise money for incumbents and encouraged
members to speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is more socially conservative than many on the council.
He favors capital punishment and personally opposes abortion,
though he supports abortion rights as a legislator.
</P>
<P>
   But as speaker, he has let a few controversial issues come up
for a vote. In 1994 he allowed a vote on a bill to make it illegal
to block access to abortion clinics. And in 1986, shortly after
becoming the council leader, he permitted a vote on a gay rights
bill that his predecessor had blocked for years. Vallone voted
against the bill, which banned discrimination based on sexual
orientation, but it still passed.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has since become a supporter of gay issues, sponsoring
legislation last spring to make domestic partners the legal equals
of married couples in city contracts, housing and death benefits.
``We should never substitute our conscience for anyone else's,'' he
said in a recent interview. ``We should never think we know it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his talk of consensus-building, colleagues say,
Vallone is at heart a clubhouse-style politician who favors
stealthy negotiation over confrontation. He has stripped rebellious
council members of committee chairmanships, and he saves the most
lucrative council stipends for his loyal allies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, critics say, Vallone has rarely shown his
tough side to the executive branch. Even when he was trying to
procure more power for the council in the late 1980s, he almost
never battled publicly with Mayors Ed Koch or David Dinkins, both
Democrats. And Vallone coexisted quite peaceably with Giuliani
until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter never wants to have a fight about anything, but you
can't win recognition that way,'' one council member said. ``He has
never made his job a platform for Democratic principles.'' Vallone
bristled at that characterization, saying he has been friendly to
mayors only because ``they usually agree to what I ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has raised only $6 million and saved little of it for
the final week of the campaign, hardly enough to bombard the
airwaves with commercials. Polls show him slipping further and
further behind.
</P>
<P>
   What compelled Vallone to take on such a seemingly hopeless
race? Some colleagues say the decision was made by his closest
aides, who they say are more ambitious than the speaker and wield
considerable influence over him. But Vallone dismissed that notion,
saying he wanted to go to Albany ``to change the way things work.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of being a relatively powerless legislator, he
said, he is eager to be a chief executive. He has proposed cutting
public college tuition in half for students who excelled in high
school, replacing health maintenance organizations with a state-run
health care system and requiring government agencies to give hiring
preference to New York firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials say Vallone is better suited for the job
of New York City mayor than that of New York state governor, and
they question why the speaker would not prefer to run the city he
loves and knows well. But while Vallone says he has not ruled out a
mayoral run, he worries that the job would be too demanding for
someone who likes to be home for dinner and spend at least one day
a week with his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be married to the city,'' he said in an interview.
``The mayor is in the public eye 24 hours a day. It's different if
you're governor. Do you have any idea where Governor Pataki is
right now?''

 &HT;    Bulldog Jacksonville natives eager for home spotlight
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ They left Jacksonville a few years ago unheralded,
not regarded enough as college-football prospects to draw genuine
interest from in-state schools Florida or Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Now, defensive back Jeff Harris, wide receiver Tony Small and
offensive tackle Chris Terry return to their hometown Saturday as
starters for No. 11 Georgia, which faces No. 5 Florida in a SEC
showdown at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to go back and play in front of all the people
that watched you play growing up,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none of the three players, all of whom were signed by
former Bulldogs coach Ray Goff in his final two recruiting classes
in 1994 and '95, could have imagined how far they've come. Harris
and Terry started their college careers at different positions,
while Small waited his turn in a deep Georgia receivers corps. Now,
all three have evolved into late bloomers at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Small, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound senior, was perhaps the most highly
regarded of the trio, earning state preseason Super 11 honors as a
senior at Nathan Bradford Forest High. Small, whose older brother,
Eddie, was a star receiver at Mississippi, played as a true
freshman at Georgia in 1995, seeing action in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Small had just six receptions in his first two seasons, then he
finally came into his own last year as the Bulldogs' No. 3
receiver, behind seniors Corey Allen and Hines Ward. Small finished
'97with 26 catches for 362 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just turned into a very good receiver,'' wide receivers
coach Greg Williams said. ``The guy had the patience and guts to
wait his turn. A lot of guys don't wait that long and turn sour.
</P>
<P>
   Small is making the most of his opportunity. The split end is
second on the team, behind two-way player Champ Bailey, with 26
receptions for 371 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 6-foot, 181-pounder, started his career at wideout. A
kicker and defensive back at Allen D. Nease High, he moved to the
secondary as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody told me that he played soccer in high school,''
Georgia strong safety Kirby Smart said. ``There were guys here,
like (former Dogs tailback) Torin Kirtsey from Jacksonville, saying
that he was a kicker in high school. That's all they knew about
him. I was like, `What in the world did we sign this guy for?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris has solidified his position at right cornerback,
opposite Bailey, a junior All-America candidate. With opposing
quarterbacks often reluctant to throw to Bailey's side, Harris has
been a popular target this season. But he's answered the challenge
_ he's seventh on the team with 36 tackles and is tied with Bailey
with seven pass breakups and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being in the background and the shadows,'' Harris said.
``I'm not a person that likes to be in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound senior from Ribault High, spent his
first three seasons on a crowded defensive line. He moved to
offense in 1996 when Goff was replaced by Jim Donnan, who liked
Terry's size and extremely long arms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Terry played in the shadows of All-America left
tackle Matt Stinchcomb. But Terry has caught the attention of NFL
scouts, some of which say he could move past his teammate in next
year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising to look back,'' Terry said. ``I never thought
I'd be playing on offense. But I'm not there yet. I've worked hard
to get this far, and I'm going to continue working.''

 &HT;    Joyner big asset to Eagles
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adrian Peterson and Greg Hill had a major impact on
Georgia Southern's victory over The Citadel last week, but senior
slotback Corey Joyner also was instrumental in the Eagles' victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9, 183-pound Albany native had three receptions for
70 yards, including a 47-yarder that helped Georgia Southern in its
second-half comeback. Joyner also returned two kickoffs for 68
yards and had a 40-yard punt return that put the Eagles in position
for another score.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson had 231 yards and five touchdowns, and Hill added 212
yards of total offense and two rushing TDs, but Joyner's
performance was a third offensive key for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good, solid player, especially with the ball in his
face,'' Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner's role as a pass catcher has become increasingly
important for the Eagles, who lost starting receiver Chris Johnson
to a fractured ankle two weeks ago. Joyner, a three-year starter,
has emerged as Hill's top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question he's our best receiver,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest day of Joyner's career came this time a year ago
against East Tennessee State _ Saturday's opponent for the No.
1-ranked Eagles (8-0, 6-0) at Paulson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In helping Georgia Southern prevail 38-30 in Johnson City,
Tenn., Joyner returned a kick 100 yards for one touchdown and
scored the go-ahead TD.
</P>
<P>
   Nice bounce back
</P>
<P>
   After being drubbed 53-6 by I-A opponent Mississippi State the
week before, East Tennessee State (2-5, 2-3), picked in the
preseason to finish second or third in the Southern Conference,
managed to bounce back this past weekend to beat Furman 22-19 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of our guys because when you're 1-5, it's
easy to lose a game like that,'' Buccaneers coach Paul Hamilton
said. ``But we're not a bad football. We had the tough schedule
(including Miami), but we had a chance to win the Appalachian State
game (lost 22-17), and we lost to Western Carolina (31-24) in
overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes
</P>
<P>
   All-Amercan offensive guard Mark Williams, who aggravated a neck
injury against The Citadel, is listed as questionable for
Saturday's game. If the 6-1, 307-pound senior from Albany isn't
ready to go, either Michael Anderson (6-0, 250) or fellow sophomore
Dietrich Everett (6-1, 285) will start.

 Why Are eBay Insiders Champing at the Bit to Sell the Stock?  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If eBay is so hot, why are its insiders so eager to sell the stock?
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It turns out that eBay insiders can unload their common stock
about two months sooner than the underwriting industry usually
requires. And considering the meteoric rise of eBay's shares,
venture capitalists and angel investors must wish they could sell
today.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stock fans and short-sellers that scrambled to cover
their bets helped eBay shares shatter the $90 barrier yesterday.
Shares of the electronic commerce darling finally settled down to
close at $82.50 a share, up $9.13 for the day. EBay shares are now
trading more than four times their initial offering price of $18,
which was set just four weeks ago. Goldman Sachs was the lead
manager.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason, then, that eBay must be the best thing to
happen to the World Wide Web since AOL or Yahoo. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as they say at Hertz, not exactly. At least, that's what a
nugget buried deep in eBay's IPO prospectus implies. Federal
filings show that eBay insiders won't have to wait as long as
original investors of most other freshly minted public companies
have had to in the past. And that seems to indicate that some big
shareholders may be champing at the bit to sell their eBay shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a venture capitalist and I owned eBay at a dollar a
share or something, I would want out now,'' notes one hedge fund
analyst, referring to the stock's unearthly share price.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not uncommon for early-stage investors, such as
venture capitalists or angel investors _ usually wealthy
individuals _ to cash out after a company goes public. What is
extraordinary about eBay's case is that the company's board managed
to wangle a shorter than usual lock-up period.
</P>
<P>
   A lock-up period is a stipulation in the offering's prospectus
that requires inside stockholders to hold their shares for a
specified number of days after the company goes public. The normal
length of a Silicon Valley lock-up clause is 180 says, says Michael
Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter in Half
Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Such is not the case with eBay. ``As a result of (the) lock-up
agreements ... none of these (inside) shares will be saleable until
121 days after the date of the final prospectus,'' states the most
recent filing on the offering with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, eBay insiders can begin cashing out of their shares before
the end of January. Yet if the Internet auctioneer is supposed to
be such an electronic commerce marvel, why wouldn't insiders hold
their stock? That's because some original shareholders may know
more about the long-term prospects of the company than the Internet
stock addicts who are driving up the share price, skeptics say.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, eBay's board managed to negotiate the shorter
lock-up at a time when the IPO market was tanking. (EBay's hugely
successful IPO in late September was widely heralded as a sign that
the IPO market was bouncing back.)
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks that underwrite offerings ask for the lock-up
clauses so their sales people can assure institutional investors
that there won't be wanton selling immediately after a stock is
issued.
</P>
<P>
   And given that September was such a rocky month, it is even more
remarkable that the bankers would concede to the abbreviated
lock-up at that time. ``In this kind of (volatile) market, you hope
that the insiders would stay in for six months to a year,'' Murphy
says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, IPO prospects capable of attracting capital in the
stormy market were hard to come by and competition for the eBay
deal was assuredly intense. Investment bankers call the courtship
of IPO candidates ``bake-offs,'' where the prospective clients try
to negotiate the best terms by pitting underwriters against each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at the time, Goldman Sachs itself was planning to go
public. (It has since shelved such plans.)
</P>
<P>
   So, it's not hard to conceive that the influential investment
bank had good reason to grant the shortened lock-up: to win the
deal and use it to jump start the idled IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Goldman's motives to lead manage eBay's offering
are understandable, it isn't clear why insiders seemingly pushed so
hard for the right to sell their shares sooner rather than later.

ADVERTISING: CITIBANK TEAMS WITH SONY TO MARKET A CREDIT CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citibank, one of the United States' largest issuers of credit
cards, has teamed up with Sony, the giant electronics and
entertainment company, to introduce a co-branded card they are
promoting with an extensive national multimedia campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The card, which the companies call the ``official currency of
playtime,'' allows holders to earn one ``Sony point'' for each
dollar charged, and additional points for purchases of Sony
products or for purchases at retailers that participate in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Points can be redeemed for credit toward the purchase of Sony
merchandise, which includes electronics and music products as well
as movie tickets at Sony, Loews and Cineplex Odeon theaters.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeffrey Dorn, senior vice president of Sony's
card-business division, the company chose to enter the highly
competitive credit-card industry because it enables Sony to pursue
``relationship marketing, to reward and thank our loyal
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a wonderful way to communicate with them,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, will use the Sony card to bolster
its credit-card business, which received a setback last year when
Ford Motor Co. discontinued its co-branded card program. Industry
analysts said that the program, which gave card holders a 5 percent
rebate on every purchase _ payable toward a new Ford vehicle _ was
poorly promoted and too costly for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Before Citicorp merged with Travelers Group this year to become
Citigroup, it bought AT&AMP;T's Universal card business. It also issues
the co-branded Advantage credit card with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Bonnette, marketing director for Citicorp Credit Services,
a Citibank subsidiary, said the intended market for the new Sony
card was adults 25 to 49 years old who are ``interested in
electronics and entertainment'' and who would find the card's
reward structure, ``with its notion of free time and playtime,''
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   To reach those prospective customers, the companies are running
a broad campaign created by Wunderman Cato Johnson, a unit of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York. Citibank's ad agency, Y&AMP;R Advertising,
was also chosen by Sony this month to handle advertising for its
U.S. consumer electronics business.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics, computers and telecommunications products
generated U.S. sales of $10.5 billion for Sony in its most recent
fiscal year, which ended in March.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the campaign are one-page print ads that show people
engaged in playful activities; one depicts a briefcase-wielding man
playing hopscotch on a city street, with text attributing the
platitude that ``hard work never killed anybody'' to ``some dead
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads urge readers to ``use the new Sony card and turn the
things you buy into everything Sony'' and reminds them that they
can use the card to buy movie tickets, music, electronics and
games. These ads will run through early next year in magazines like
People, Premiere, Entertainment Weekly, GQ, Rolling Stone and
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also features an eight-page insert that will run in
the December issues of all magazines published by the Hachette
Filipacchi unit of the Lagardere Group and select Time Warner
magazines. The insert, which declares ``Sony and Citibank invite
you to come out and play,'' depicts consumers involved with
different Sony products, such as a couple entering a Loews movie
theater and a family watching a Columbia Tristar home video.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the print advertising, the campaign includes
outdoor advertising in eight cities; direct mail that is being sent
to purchasers of Sony products and individuals selected by
Citibank; 60-second direct-response cable TV commercials asking
viewers to call in and sign up for the card, and material to be
distributed by Sony dealers and with Sony products.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card will also be promoted in a sweepstakes that
starts later this month at Loews and Cineplex Odeon movie theaters
and on the sony.com World Wide Web site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Bonnette said the budget for the campaign was comparable to
money spent to advertise the credit card co-branded with American
Airlines, which is owned by AMR Corp.; according to Competitive
Media Reporting, the budget for the airline card was close to $12
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McKinley, president of Cardweb Inc. in Gettysburg, Pa.,
which tracks the credit-card industry, questioned the size of the
Sony card budget and predicted Citibank and Sony would ``probably
have to put quite a bit more behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the companies' cooperative efforts won praise from William
Keenan, the president of Creative Solutions in Hockessin, Del., a
direct-response advertising agency that specializes in financial
services. Sony, which Keenan said was not usually in ``control of
its relationship with consumers,'' would be able to use the card to
``develop a captive database of known Sony buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent loyalty and bonding strategy.'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And Jennifer Scutti, who follows the credit-card industry for
Prudential Securities, suggested that Citibank had adopted a ``very
good strategy by targeting Sony, because people will identify
quickly and easily with Sony's products, especially the younger
generation of card holders.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HARDLY THE BOYS NEXT DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro basketball players seem puzzled over the public's failure to
embrace their ``struggle'' against National Basketball Association
owners. They seem to ask, ``Where's the outpouring of sympathy for
fellow workers?''
</P>
<P>
   They might try to give the public a different look. A few weeks
ago, LaPhonso Ellis spoke about the economic confrontation, one in
which the two sides argue over how escalating league profits will
be apportioned in coming seasons. Ellis spoke with ease and grace
about the hazards of being locked out, but what you noticed was
that he seemed to be speaking from poolside at some resort.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the players gathered in Las Vegas, Nev., of all
places, to plan a strategy session. Amid slot machines they voted
not to accept a hard salary cap. Earlier this week, an article in
The New York Times quoted Kenny Anderson, the Boston Celtics point
guard and former New York City high school legend, about the impact
this lockout was having on his cash flow. He spoke of possibly
having to sell one of his eight luxury cars; he spoke of how paying
child support for two children he fathered with two different women
``really burns a hole in your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met in New York on Monday, and the union couldn't
seem to decide whether there was progress or regress. Danny
Schayes, a member of the union's executive committee, saw some
progress. Jim McIlvaine of Seattle growled: ``Danny Schayes didn't
stay for the entire meeting.'' Billy Hunter, executive director of
the union, said: ``I guess Danny has a different interpretation.
Maybe I was looking for a lot more than Danny did.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players have expressed concern that the league's high
concentration of African-American athletes will cause a more severe
reaction to the lockout than either baseball or hockey experienced.
A sports talk show in Philadelphia recently gave voice to a similar
idea. A poignant moment in the show occurred when the station's
general manager called in and said the racial angle, with
(italics)this(end italilcs) particular group of African-Americans,
was not relevant, because, he felt, the issue was purely economic.
The general manger was African-American.
</P>
<P>
   My reaction to the concern about racial backlash was: They must
be joking. All of a sudden they've discovered a collective
awareness of being black? They sold that to NBA Properties a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
   The current players aren't sympathetic figures simply because
they never wanted to be and never worked to be. The owners aren't
sympathetic figures, either, because they were silly enough to
create the monster _ and keep feeding it _ in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, striking football players picketed, tossed eggs at
strike-breakers and wore their hearts on their sleeves. Basketball
players, it seems, sip mint juleps under honeysuckle trees and sing
``Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.'' They are stylish in their
incongruity.
</P>
<P>
   I hate phrases like ``the American People,'' and I don't know
who the average United States citizen is, but my sense is that the
mass of workers are feeling more alienated from professional
athletes with each successive season. Most see sports labor as a
contradiction in terms. Clearly this lockout is not a
life-or-death, knockdown, drag-out war. We're not talking about
closing down factories, laying off workers, shipping jobs to
overseas plants. This is a skirmish between the rich fighting the
wealthy for a greater portion of huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   As for some kind of sustained backlash directed at the league:
It'll never happen. Watch what happens when the doors reopen:
people will come briskly walking in because basketball, like it or
not, is in our blood.
</P>
<P>
   People rejoiced that baseball came back this year; for a while
the nation was thrown into a fit of longing for the ``good ol'
days,'' when the grass was real. There have been all sorts of
rumblings that people don't care about the NBA anymore. These are
the delirious ramblings of patients recovering from a severe bout
of baseball fever. The patient will get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Knick City Dancers, Laker Girls, Keith Van Horn and _ who knows?
_ Michael Jordan, will draw them back. Baseball is a classic drama;
basketball is steamy, fast-paced soap opera. Money? The beautiful
people sitting courtside know about money. They can relate at some
level to Kenny Anderson's situation. After all, everything is
relative.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, if some players end up going to the poorhouse,
there's comfort in knowing they'll have plenty of cars to take
them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love this game?
</P>

ABORTION CLINIC IN BUFFALO VOWS TO CONTINUE SLAIN DOCTOR'S WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ With federal marshals posted outside and
protesters waving pictures of aborted fetuses from the sidewalk,
the clinic where Dr. Barnett A. Slepian performed abortions until
he was slain on Friday night reopened here Tuesday and its director
vowed to continue his work.
</P>
<P>
   Short-staffed even before Slepian was fatally shot by a sniper
who hid in a wooded field behind his home, the clinic, Buffalo
Women's Gynecological Services, scrambled to find doctors to cover
his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the clinic performed no abortions Tuesday and saw only a few
patients, said the director, Marilynn Buckham. Instead, she said,
the staff spent the day mourning. ``We needed to talk about the
loss of our friend,'' she said after a series of staff meetings.
``We discussed how badly we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and tearful interview in her office, Ms. Buckham said
she had received calls from doctors around the country who offered
to perform there and said some would be flying to Buffalo as early
as Wednesday. ``We will be doing abortions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sniper attack that killed Slepian left many women here, most
of them poor or working-class, expressing outrage that a bullet had
deprived them at least temporarily of one of the few options they
had to end an unwanted or unhealthy pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is the only one left in Buffalo, New York State's
second-largest city, that specializes in abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The anger could be seen in people like Karen Jones, 25, who
dropped off a friend at the clinic Tuesday morning, only to be
swarmed by anti-abortion protesters who screamed, ``Be strong!''
and ``Save the baby!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's none of their business if someone wants to have an
abortion,'' she said, nervously taking a drag from a cigarette as
she sat in her car, awaiting her friend. ``Are they going to be
around to help raise the baby? No they won't. This decision is
between a woman and her God.''
</P>
<P>
   As the staff at the clinic scheduled appointments for the rest
of the week _ one staff member said the clinic was fully booked for
Thursday and Friday _ local and federal investigators reported
little progress in their search for the sniper who shot Slepian,
52, through an undraped window as he stood in his kitchen in the
nearby suburb of Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were working on the theory that his killing is
linked to four other sniper attacks since 1994 on doctors who
perform abortions here and in Canada. Three of the attacks took
place in Canada, and one in Rochester, though no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, according to a friend, Lynne Slepian, the doctor's
widow, was trying to spend time alone with their four young sons,
talking about what had happened to their father and the
consequences for their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, she is worried about the kids' safety and
well-being,'' said the friend, Ellen Fink. ``Yes, she is worried
about how she is going to support them. But that is tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government dispatched United States. Marshals here
Tuesday to assist clinic workers in their efforts to reopen Tuesday
morning, though there was no visible protection from local law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that the marshals would be on hand to
protect doctors who plan to arrive here from around the country to
fill in for Slepian. They gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to provide a high level of security for the doctors
and patients who come here,'' said one federal law enforcement
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the women who live in this poor end of town, Slepian's
death stirred not only sadness but also practical concerns about
what they will do should they or their daughters become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ashley, 43, recalled that teen-age a friends showed up at
the clinic about a year ago, only to be confronted by anti-abortion
protesters who convinced her to keep the baby.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, the young women was so unprepared to be a
mother that child welfare authorities took the child away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told her that they would help her,'' Ms. Ashely said of
the anti-abortion protesters. ``But they didn't do anything. They
left that girl on her own. What you had was a child trying to raise
a child.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Doctor Slepian helped a lot of people. Women around
her don't have many options now. I think what you are going to see
is young girls trying to give themselves abortions. It's like we're
going back to the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Roseboro, 31, remembers showing up at the clinic as a
young girl to get an abortion after the man she lived with left
her. As far as she is concerned, Slepian gave her a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had had that child, I'd be stuck on welfare or
something,'' she said. ``I was a child. I couldn't take care of my
own self. How could I take care of a child? I think it was the best
decision I could have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hodlen sees the issue in terms of class and race. More
affluent women, she says, can go to private doctors who will
perform abortions. But poor women like herself have had to rely on
people like Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a kind man, a good man,'' she said. ``I think a lot of
people in this community feel a sense of loss. This is an outrage.
The anti-abortion people say they want to save lives, but they have
also taken lives now.''

EDITORIAL: RE-ELECT CARL MCCALL COMPTROLLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 28: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York voters have traditionally elected governors and state
comptrollers from different parties. That may be an accident of
history, or an instinctive feeling that the comptroller ought to be
a watchdog over the state's fiscal health who is not politically
beholden to the chief executive. This year, at least, we believe
the precedent is worth following. We have endorsed the re-election
of the Republican governor, George Pataki, and now recommend that
Carl McCall, a Democrat, be re-elected as comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's most important job is managing and investing
the assets of pension programs for state and local government
employees. McCall demonstrates a judicious mix of concern for the
security of the portfolio and the social implications of the
system's investments. We certainly prefer his approach to that of
the Republican candidate, Bruce Blakeman, whose advocacy of reduced
municipal contributions to the system and increased pension
benefits seems irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has also been energetic in carrying out his
responsibilities to audit city and town agencies, and has
frequently called attention to the growth of debt and other
potential dangers in the state's fiscal picture. But one blot on
his record is his practice of soliciting campaign donations from
companies that do business with his office. This is the same
behavior we have criticized Pataki for, and the fact that the abuse
is bipartisan does not make it more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman has said that if he is elected he will limit the size
of these contributions, and McCall has said he will call on the
state legislature to ban them for all officeholders. Neither
approach is sufficient. The comptroller should simply not
compromise his independence by taking contributions from people who
are hoping to get business from his office. We will never be fully
satisfied with McCall until he changes his practices. But Blakeman,
who is running his campaign firmly tied to Governor Pataki's
coattails, does not seem likely to be an improvement. On the basis
of the rest of his performance, we endorse McCall.

CALIFORNIA: GIFT COMES BACK TO HAUNT CANDIDATE  
 MASSACHUSETTS: POLITICAL BRAWL IN HISTORIC BOSTON  
 KENTUCKY: LOOKING FOR BACKLASH IN CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, after he won election as treasurer of California, Matt
Fong had some campaign money left over. So he sent a $50,000 check
to a conservative Orange County group, the Traditional Values
Coalition, which was promoting a ballot initiative to ban same-sex
marriage in California, a ban he favored.
</P>
<P>
   Now that gift has come back to haunt Fong, a moderate Republican
who this fall is trying to unseat Sen. Barbara Boxer, a liberal
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   When he made the gift, he did not announce it. But a couple of
days ago, word of it leaked out and he has been scrambling to keep
from losing ground in a race so tight that a miscue at this point
by either candidate could mean defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, Fong picked up the endorsement of the
Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative gay group.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of the $50,000 gift, Log Cabin officials
considered retracting the group's endorsement. But then they
decided to stick with Fong, provided he would sign a pledge of
support for a list of gay issues, among them greater financing for
AIDS research and new protection for gay employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to clear the record,'' said Kevin Ivers, a Log Cabin
official.
</P>
<P>
   Fong signed, saying the written pledge merely ``codified'' what
he had orally pledged earlier. As for same-sex marriage, he said he
stood by his $50,000 contribution to the ``defense of traditional
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said Fong supports ``the extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong's contribution shows that he is out of the mainstream,''
she declared at a rally on Monday. ``This is a hate group. You
write a check to a hate group, you're making a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Political Brawl in Historic Boston
</P>
<P>
   They love a good political fight in Boston, always have. But on
Monday night, things got a bit out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   At Faneuil Hall, in the center of the historic downtown area,
Acting Governor Argeo Paul Cellucci and Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger were having a debate. Locked in a race for governor
that is too close to call, Cellucci, the Republican, and
Harshbarger, the Democrat, were vigorously disagreeing on every
issue that arose, when suddenly Harshbarger raised the verbal ante
and blurted: ``Tell the truth! Tell the truth! Try that for a
change!''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, borrowing a line from Jack Nicholson in ``A Few Good
Men,'' shot back: ``Scott, you can't handle the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, things went downhill and the give-and-take
deteriorated into a mean-spirited yelling match.
</P>
<P>
   Then the audience joined in, hooting and taunting the debaters,
raucous and rowdy as a revolutionary rabble. The moderator, Charles
Ogletree, a Harvard professor, could not quiet them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hall, supporters of Cellucci and Harshbarger _ at
least 10,000 of them, the police said _ were having at one another
with shouts and bullhorns and slashing, whacking placards and, now
and again, fists and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 75 of Boston's finest managed to get things under
control. So it goes in the city of the Last Hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for Backlash in Clinton Scandal
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates have been trying for some time to
capitalize on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal in their advertising. On
Tuesday the party kicked off a $10 million national advertising
campaign that focuses on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats think they see signs of a backlash, whatever the
Republicans might see, and some now believe there is political hay
to be made out of the hay the Republicans are trying to make.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for instance, Chris Gorman, a Democrat who is taking
on Rep. Ann Northup of Kentucky, became the third Democratic
challenger in a highly competitive race to begin broadcasting a
commercial that suggests Republicans are overplaying their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, leaning on a fence post and looking into the camera,
says: ``If you want to spend another two years investigating the
president's sex life, vote for Ann Northup. After four years and 40
million dollars, Ann Northup voted with Newt Gingrich to continue
the investigation. They're so focused on getting Bill Clinton that
they've forgotten about the rest of us. The president needs to be
punished. But we need a Congress that'll end this mess.''

EDITORIAL: A BABY'S AVOIDABLE DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial Wednesday, Oct. 28: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Department of Health has concluded its
investigation into the death of Shannell Coppage, a six-week-old
girl who died of malnutrition because her young mother, Tatiana
Cheeks, had failed to breast-feed her adequately. The investigation
suggests that the hospital where Ms. Cheeks sought help blundered
badly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheeks had taken the baby to an outpatient clinic of New
York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn for her one-week checkup after
birth. But the baby was turned away because her mother did not have
a Medicaid card for the child and could not pay $25.
</P>
<P>
   Under state regulations, hospitals must provide patients with
generally accepted standards of care and are not allowed to
discriminate based on the source of payment. The Brooklyn hospital
failed on both counts. There was no need for a Medicaid card
because infants are automatically covered for one year if their
mothers are on Medicaid, as Ms. Cheeks was. State investigators
concluded that this was an isolated case of incompetence at the
hospital. The hospital has ordered its staff to undergo more
training, but will face no other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   After Shannell's death, Ms. Cheeks was jailed on charges of
negligent homicide. The charges were dropped when pediatricians
testified that many breast-feeding mothers cannot easily tell
whether their babies are growing normally unless the infants are
weighed and monitored regularly. Nursing support and education
about breast-feeding might have alerted Ms. Cheeks to danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheeks' other child, taken from her when she was arrested,
remains in foster care with a relative. This family's life has been
horribly altered, all for want of access to basic medical care that
should be the birthright of every child.

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ By most ordinary reckoning, Parris Glendening
should be a shoo-in as he seeks re-election as governor of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He is a moderate-to-liberal Democrat in one of the nation's most
reliably Democratic states. He has presided over a state that has
prospered more than most in the strong national economy. And he has
been endorsed by the leading newspapers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Glendening is in the race of his life, an election that
seems even closer than the one in 1994, when he won by fewer than
6,000 votes, or four-tenths of 1 percent, over the Republican
candidate, Ellen Sauerbrey, who is his opponent again this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, Glendening is at a
loss to explain why the race is so close, although some analysts
suggest the reasons range from a subtle shift in the state's once
staunchly liberal leaning to the governor's indecision over whether
to embrace or shun President Clinton during the height of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post poll found that among people who say they are
certain to vote, 50 percent favor Mrs. Sauerbrey and 49 percent
Glendening, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the most bitter primary,'' the governor said at a
campaign stop here in vote-rich Montgomery County, just outside
Washington, as he searched for an explanation for the closeness of
the race. ``We've taken on the tobacco lobby, the National Rifle
Association, the casino and slot industry. Your enemies remember
more than your friends do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issues he offered as reasons for his poor poll showing
have been used successfully by candidates in states considered less
liberal and less Democratic than Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sauerbrey, on the other hand, has several possible
explanations as to why she, a conservative Republican, is doing so
well in the polls and has an excellent chance of being elected
Maryland's first Republican governor in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1994 election showed that Maryland is not as liberal as
everybody thought,'' Mrs. Sauerbrey said as she also campaigned in
Montgomery County, which she does not expect to carry but where she
hopes to reduce Glendening's majority. ``There has been a net gain
for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics at the Maryland Board of Elections confirm that. From
August 1994 to last August, the Democrats increased their
enrollment in the state to 1,459,760, a gain of 25,854. But the
Republicans, starting with a smaller base, did better, rising to
767,391, an increase of 92,331. So the Republicans had a net gain
of more than 66,000 over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Uslaner, a professor of government and politics at the
University of Maryland, said Glendening had failed to build on his
popularity because of some early decisions that were not popular
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   One was state support for the construction of a new football
stadium for the transplanted Cleveland Browns, now the Baltimore
Ravens. It was partly financed by the state lottery and, Uslaner
said: ``People thought that some of that money should have gone
into education. It was especially opposed in Montgomery County.''
</P>
<P>
   Uslaner was asked in an interview whether Glendening's seeming
aloofness, verging on dullness, had contributed to his lack of a
strengthened base. In its editorial endorsing the governor for
re-election, The Baltimore Sun said politely, ``He is not
charismatic.'' The Washington Post, which also endorsed him, said
Glendening had a ``plodding personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just dull,'' Uslaner said. ``He doesn't connect
well with the voters. He was a professor. Some of us just don't
make great political candidates, and being from a one-party area,
he cut his teeth in an old-fashioned machine, where loyalty to a
party can be more important that establishing a rapport with a
large number of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, 56, taught political science at the University of
Maryland for 27 years before he was elected governor. He was
previously on the Prince George's County Council and served as the
county executive, working his way up through the ranks until being
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sauerbrey, 61, lives in Baltimore County, the suburb
outside the city, and taught biology in high school before being
elected to the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 election, Glendening carried only the three most
populous areas in the state: Montgomery and Prince George's
counties, both Washington suburbs, and Baltimore. Mrs. Sauerbrey
carried all other voting districts, but they did not provide enough
votes to overcome Glendening's big margins in the areas he carried.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's campaign has not been a smooth one.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the two leading elected black officials in the
state _ Prince George's County Executive Wayne Kurry and Baltimore
Mayor Kurt Schmoke, both Democrats _ put off endorsing the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, on Oct. 8, less than a month before the election,
they did it without much enthusiasm and without even notifying
Glendening that they were doing it. Glendening badly needs the
black vote to carry the state, and both Prince George's and
Baltimore are predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening's biggest problem involved Clinton. In September, the
governor sought to distance himself from the president over the
Lewinsky scandal by canceling a fund-raising event with him and
then did not appear at a visit by Clinton to a school in Montgomery
County. But later Clinton campaigned for the governor _ again in
Montgomery County _ and the two were reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reversal in an interview, Glendening said: ``We
did what we believed to be right. The president has done a great
job. However, his actions were wrong and he should have apologized.
Then he did apologize. He asked for forgiveness. Not one of us has
not made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he made a mistake as great as the president?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Glendening said. ``Not a doozy of a mistake.''

GOVERNOR RETAINS 2-1 LEAD OVER RIVAL, SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The following story, previously eliminated from N.Y. Times News
Service budget, is now restored)  
(lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki continues to hold a 2-to-1 lead
over his Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone, but voters are
paying scant attention to the race as Election Day draws near,
according to a statewide New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor is favored by 56 percent of likely
voters, while Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council, is
supported by 21 percent, according to the poll. Pataki's standing
among voters has barely changed since early this month, when a
similar poll found him favored by 54 percent of the voters and
Vallone by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, was favored
by 9 percent of respondents in the new poll, and Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party candidate, was supported by 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from
Oct. 21 through Oct. 25 with 1,235 registered voters, of whom the
pollsters considered 639 likely to vote. The poll has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows a wide lead for Carl McCall, the state
comptroller, giving him a 42 percentage-point lead over his
Republican challenger, Bruce Blakeman. The margin between McCall
and Blakeman has increased since the earlier poll, which was
conducted the first week in October. Sixty percent favored the
incumbent this time, 18 percent favored the challenger and 19
percent remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll also found that Dennis Vacco, the state attorney
general, was now leading his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer,
by a margin exceeding the poll's margin or error. Vacco is now
favored by 48 percent of the voters, Spitzer is supported by 36
percent, and 14 percent are undecided, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures changed from a Times/CBS News poll conducted in
the first week in October, which found Vacco favored by 43 percent
of voters and Spitzer by 41 percent, a gap that for polling
purposes is the equivalent of a tie.
</P>
<P>
   While most respondents said they knew whom they would support
for governor, the poll found a widespread lack of interest in the
race. Only 21 percent of respondents said they were paying a lot of
attention, roughly the same number as in the poll earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of respondents said they were only giving some
attention to the race, and 24 percent said they were not paying
much attention. Sixty percent described the race between Pataki and
Vallone as dull, and only 35 percent called it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 53 percent of respondents described the closely
contested Senate race between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles
Schumer as interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that Vallone is still not making a strong
impression on voters. A third of the respondents said they thought
he was spending more time attacking Pataki, while a third said he
was spending more time explaining what he would do if elected. The
remaining 30 percent of the respondents were unable to say one way
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the respondents had not seen or heard about
Vallone's television commercial defending President Clinton, which
the Vallone campaign hoped would draw attention to the candidate.
And with Election Day approaching, 71 percent of voters were unable
to say whether their overall opinion of him was favorable or
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates for comptroller and attorney general are also
still struggling for name recognition, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of the respondents said they did not know
enough about Vacco to say whether their opinion of him was
favorable or unfavorable, and 79 percent said they could not form
such an opinion of Spitzer.

CLAIBORNE DECIDES CLAMORING IS CALLED FOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lead-by-example days are officially over for
USC linebacker Chris Claiborne, who has become possibly the most
vocal player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was not bashful letting the Trojans' offensive
assistant coaches or offensive players know that it was time to
perform at the start of the second half of the Trojans' 17-13 loss
to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily the coaches. It's the offensive
players,'' Claiborne said. ``I get on them and they should get on
us (the defense).''
</P>
<P>
   It's a major role change for the middle linebacker, who has
usually been a soft-spoken leader during his USC career. Claiborne
said he is more outspoken because he is a junior and no longer has
two or three years to hope for improvement by the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the future anymore,'' Claiborne said. ``The
future's now.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional strain of the season, and mounting losses, are
beginning to take a toll on him. He took Sunday's practice off
because he felt worn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired,'' Claiborne said. ``It's not the physical part,
it's the mental. The year's been hard on me. Certainly, it's hard
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne remains noncommittal about whether he will turn pro
after the season but said Tuesday he's ``having fun at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy and content where I am. College is something
you only do once in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne intends to check with NFL scouts after the season and
it will be surprising if Claiborne stays in school if he remains
projected as a top-10 pick. Claiborne said he will purchase an
insurance policy if he chooses to return, to protect against a
career-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Defensive lineman Aaron Williams suffered a neck
stinger in practice and might miss today's practice. Linebacker
David Gibson (sore knee) and cornerback Daylon McCutcheon (sore
calf) rested Tuesday but are OK.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano (sore thigh) returned to practice,
however, and is expected to play this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty encouraged,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``We're
going to have him at the tail end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan remains the same: Mike Van Raaphorst is the starting
quarterback, but Hackett at least left a sliver of doubt about the
possibility that Carson Palmer might start. ``I don't think we'll
make a change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No regrets: Hackett said he was unconcerned about criticism he
received for kicking a field goal instead of going for the
touchdown while trailing Oregon 17-10 with 4:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has an opinion about the field goal. Whether they
agree with it or believe in it, I'm the coach and they're not,''
Hackett said. ``It didn't work and it's easy to say when something
doesn't work that I should have done it differently. That's
hindsight. Now people come back and say what if and how come, but
that's ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, one regret: Hackett did say the one thing he would have done
differently is let Petros Papadakis carry the ball on a third-and-1
situation in the third quarter. Papadakis was stopped for no gain
on a third-down play at the start of the second half, so Hackett
let Chad Morton carry on the next third-down play. Morton was also
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely take that one back,'' Hackett said.
``Instead, we tried something a little different with Chad and he
had the same result Petros did. In retrospect, I would have went
back to Petros, which got us where we were, and we do it again.''

VALLONE ENJOYS RARE SIGHT OF HEARTY CAMPAIGN RALLY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Speaking to what has been a rare sight in this year's
political campaigns _ a large live audience _ Peter Vallone
exhorted several hundred union members and low-income New Yorkers
on Tuesday to go to the polls next week, telling them that Gov.
George Pataki ``may have a lot of money, he may have a lot of
power, but he doesn't have you, he doesn't have your votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the City Council speaker and Democratic candidate for
governor, was addressing a rally at St. Vartan's Armenian Church in
Manhattan organized by the Working Families Party, which was
started this year by several labor unions and the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group with
low-income members.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is at the top of the new party's ticket, and its
organizers are hoping to win 50,000 votes, which will insure the
party a spot on the ballot in future elections.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone received a boisterous reception from a chanting crowd of
about 450. The enthusiasm seemed to enliven Vallone, who is usually
a rather subdued speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your election,'' he said. Then, building a crescendo
that brought the audience to its feet, he thundered: ``I promise, I
promise, I promise, I will do my job, I will vote for you. You vote
for me and we together, together, together, will take this state
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate,
is also running on the Working Families Party line. He was also
supposed to appear at the rally, but party organizers said he was
running late.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Vallone attacked Pataki for refusing to
debate him. ``It's now 7 days, 11 hours, 44 minutes and 36 seconds
until polls open next Tuesday at 6 a.m.,'' Vallone said. ``My
question for George Pataki is: Where are you and when do you expect
to debate? This is no longer a game. This is an insult to all New
Yorkers.'' He also assailed what he termed questionable
fund-raising practices by the Pataki campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Pataki, who has said previously that campaign aides
were working on arranging debates, said he was concerned that
Vallone would use a debate for personal attacks. ``I want to make
sure we discuss the issues,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the governor went to Astoria, Vallone's home
base, to accept the endorsement of the Queens Aldos Independent
Democratic Club. He was met by Vallone supporters dressed as ducks
to draw attention to what the Vallone campaign describes as the
incumbent's ducking of debates.

TONE NEGATIVE; MORE GAMES LIKELY CANCELED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guarded optimism gave way to guarded pessimism within a 24-hour
span in the NBA's four-month-old labor schism, and the league will
probably cancel the rest of November's games by the close of
business today.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-hour negotiating session Monday in New York produced
signs of compromise _ ``There's hope,'' Atlanta center Dikembe
Mutombo said afterward _ but by Tuesday the reviews had turned
negative, following a four-hour meeting on noneconomic issues that
failed to bridge any gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a lot of issues. I can't say we made a lot of
progress,'' said Jeff Mishkin, chief counsel for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Issues discussed Tuesday included player conduct and discipline
clauses _ raised in the wake of the Latrell Sprewell incident _ and
adding marijuana to the league's list of banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   Mishkin led the league's negotiating five-person contingent
while commissioner David Stern and deputy Russ Granik attended
owner meetings. The players association had about a dozen
representatives at the meeting, led by attorney Jeff Kessler. Union
director Billy Hunter did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   That the sides are talking at all, and often _ 13 hours in two
days _ is perhaps the best sign since July 1, when NBA owners
imposed the lockout. Still, the NBA's board of governors is set to
meet today and afterward the league will probably announce more
game cancellations as the lockout enters Day 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to salvage as much of the season as possible,''
Hunter said. ``I'm optimistic we're going to get a deal. I can't
say it's going to happen this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter's expression of optimism was tempered by other
statements in which he poo-poohed positive assessments of Monday's
marathon session, during which the key economic issues were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no progress.... Nothing got done,'' Hunter said
Tuesday morning, responding to comments from some players that
headway had been made the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Granik also sounded negative: ``It's hard for me or anybody to
come out of this meeting encouraged,'' he said late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has reportedly backed off insistence on a hard salary
cap, however, opening the door for compromise. The league and union
have proposed tax-based systems to inhibit salary growth, though
the two initial proposals were vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting reportedly produced talk of a ``hybrid''
system, in which the players' luxury tax would be used for two
years, followed by a two-year period with the league's modified
hard cap.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's board of governors will meet this morning, while the
players and union leadership meet separately. The two sides will
resume negotiations around noon eastern time.

SUDDENLY DREADLOCKS  
 FUN WITH FOOD, FOR A CAUSE  
 THREE-PART NAME ON AUTOBIOGRAPHY

   NEW YORK _ BROOKE SHIELDS, on a two-week break from her sitcom,
``Suddenly Susan,'' has gone almost unrecognized in Manhattan: She
had to talk her way into the ``Saturday Night Live'' cast party the
other night. She does look different from the way she did in
``Endless Love,'' ``The Blue Lagoon'' and all those television
commercials in which nothing came between her and her Calvins.
</P>
<P>
   She has been wearing dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me absolute, almost complete anonymity,'' she said.
``The only thing is, it's hard to wash your hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The new look is for the James Toback film ``Black and White,''
which is being shot this week on the Upper East Side. Miss Shields
plays a documentary filmmaker who chronicles a group of white high
school students trying to imitate hip-hop stars. Also in the cast
are ROBERT DOWNEY JR., BEN STILLER and CLAUDIA SCHIFFER.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Shields is like a postmodern Cinderella, making the
rounds of New York night spots while the clock ticks toward her
flight back to Hollywood. ``I'm not sure this is going to ring so
wonderfully with the `Suddenly Susan' crew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fun With Food, for a Cause
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First the writer A.E. HOTCHNER talked about two
women, of whom one treated her sore throat with spaghetti sauce and
the other put balsamic vinegar on her sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   Then GLENN CLOSE read a recipe. Not your usual script.
</P>
<P>
   Then PAUL NEWMAN went to work. He and JOANNE WOODWARD, along
with their daughter, NELL NEWMAN, and Ms. Close judged seven dishes
made from recipes that call for products made by Newman's Own, the
food company he started that gives its after-tax profits to
charitable groups.
</P>
<P>
   They named as the winner a dish made with salsa and salad
dressing, which was entered by DIANE REILLY, a fourth- and
fifth-grade teacher from St. Albans, Vt. Newman's Own is donating
$50,000 to her school, the North Avenue Christian School, and to a
camp for children.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was not the only one who gave something away at the
lunch, which was held at the Rainbow Room in the GE Building. Ms.
Reilly's students had bought a snowboard for Newman, along with a
voucher for 10 snowboarding lessons. Ms. Reilly said that the
school had an after-school program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bones are a lot more brittle than they used to be,'' Newman
said, ``but I'll give it a whack anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-Part Name on Autobiography
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first-name-only media couples were out in force:
DIANE and MIKE (SAWYER and NICHOLS), CHARLIE and AMANDA (ROSE and
BURDEN), JANN and MATT (WENNER and NYE), and MARLO and PHIL (THOMAS
and DONAHUE).
</P>
<P>
   They crowded into Elaine's, the watering place on Second Avenue
near 88th Street, for a cocktail party honoring the designer DIANE
VON FURSTENBERG and her autobiography, ``Diane: A Signature Life''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster). The editor of Vanity Fair, GRAYDON CARTER, and
the chairman of USA Networks, BARRY DILLER, sent out the
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   KATHARINE BETTS of Vogue and the novelist DOMINICK DUNNE, both
quoted in blurbs on the book jacket, were there. But one person was
noticeable by his absence: Diller, who gave Ms. Von Furstenberg a
present of 29 diamonds on her 29th birthday. He was said to be
stuck in meetings in California.

DR. LAURA FILES SUIT AGAINST POSTING OF NUDE PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CLANCY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger, whose moral advice reaches about 18
million listeners a day, is battling with an Internet site over 12
nude photographs taken of her in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, whose stern solutions to callers' dilemmas have
made her a media phenomenon, won a temporary injunction against the
Internet Entertainment Group on Friday, eight hours after the
pictures were posted, forcing IEG to remove the photos.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was the first step in a lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court by Schlessinger against IEG and Bill Ballance, a
longtime Southern California radio host who gave Schlessinger her
start.
</P>
<P>
   Ballance, 80, took the photos during an affair with
Schlessinger, 51, that lasted more than two years, he said in an
article on the IEG Web site. Schlessinger was married at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ballance was a pioneer in talking about sexual issues on the
radio. He gave Schlessinger her start when he was intrigued by her
answer to a question he posed during one of the many programs he
did on Southern California radio. The question: Would you rather be
widowed or divorced? Her answer: Widowed, because you don't feel
guilty, and people feel sorry for you.
</P>
<P>
   He now refers to her as ``this monster I've created'' and has
been vocal in his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The day the photos were posted, he told syndicated talk show
host Tom Leykis that Schlessinger ``has been stealing my material
for years.'' He also accused her of lying about the length of their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ballance told Leykis that IEG offered him substantially more
money for the photos than the tabloid newspapers, which made offers
in the tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   IEG is the company that put the infamous Pamela Anderson Lee sex
tapes on the Internet. It operates a variety of sex-oriented sites.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Dalton, a company spokeswoman, said it will try to have
the injunction overturned at a hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident of a reversal,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the few hours the pictures were available were
the busiest hours in IEG history. She refused to give out
specifics, however.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Schlessinger _ known to her callers simply as ``Dr.
Laura'' _ nor an official from Premiere Radio, the program's
syndicator, responded to numerous messages. She has not talked
about the situation on her daily program, nor has she issued a
statement. Her attorney has refused interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, whose program runs from 3 to 6 p.m. daily on
KFYI-AM, has written several books, including one called ``Ten
Stupid Things Women Do to Messup Their Lives.'' Her latest is
called ``The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in
Everyday Life.' ' Each of her books has sold well. Schlessinger's
advice column appears Tuesdays in ``The Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   She has acknowledged that her past doesn't live up to her
present advice.
</P>
<P>
   She tells callers to mend family relationships but has been
estranged from her mother for 14 years, according to a long profile
in a recent issue of ``Vanity Fair'' magazine. She also rails
against divorce, despite her own marital breakup.
</P>
<P>
   She told the magazine, ``There are things that I am ashamed of.
With the mind-set I have now, there are certain things I would not
have done. I am repentant, I have moved on. I see no reason to
embarrass myself.'' &QL;

SOME HIGH-PROFILE HELP FOR D'AMATO AND SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `a' code)

</P>
<P>
   Turning to his protege for help at a critical juncture in his
re-election campaign, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato barnstormed across New
York state with Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday, seeking to take
advantage of the governor's high ratings in the polls and of his
large campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   As D'Amato toured five cities from Long Island to Lake Erie, his
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer, campaigned in
Westchester County and Manhattan with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
assailed the three-term Republican senator as an arch-conservative
who had voted to cut federal spending on programs for the poor and
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' use of high-profile surrogates to help kick off
their final week of campaigning reflected their concerns that
turnout Nov. 3 might be anemic among some of their core
constituencies _ for Schumer, among women, and for D'Amato, among
upstate and suburban Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, Tuesday's tour represented something of a role
reversal from 1994, when he helped guide Pataki, then an unknown
state senator, to an upset victory over Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was the governor who played the master of ceremonies
and lead cheerleader for the senator, in splashy events upstate in
Albany, Rochester, Niagara Falls and Buffalo and in the Nassau
County town of Hicksville.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Pataki hailed D'Amato as ``an excellent partner
in Washington'' who had helped direct federal money to New York for
hospitals, mass transit, disaster relief and several local
projects.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato continued his assault on Schumer for missing votes in
Congress this year, even as he was coming under fire for missing
votes himself in 1980 when, as presiding supervisor of Hempstead
Township on Long Island, he first ran for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more important than making speeches and campaigning
and racing around to say, `Look at me,' is to go to work,'' D'Amato
told a crowd of workers outside the Super Steel factory in
Schenectady. ``Just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, Mrs.
Clinton and Schumer accused D'Amato of being a comrade-in-arms with
conservative Republicans led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, voting
to cut Social Security and Medicare, as well as to outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to undermine the Older Americans Act, Meals on
Wheels, to literally take food out of the mouths of people living
slightly above poverty thanks to Social Security, to finance a tax
cut for the wealthiest of Americans,'' Mrs. Clinton said of
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't vote,'' she added, ``you are in a sense
abdicating that choice to others who have a very different
agenda.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, which was held by gay Democrats and raised
$200,000, Mrs. Clinton and Schumer criticized conservative
Republicans for blocking passage of legislation that would increase
penalties for hate crimes. Both invoked two recent killings, those
of a gay college student in Wyoming and a Buffalo doctor who
performed abortions, as evidence of the need for such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Matthew Shepard's murder and Dr. Barnett Slepian's
murder, just in the last few days, has shocked the nation and made
clear once again that there is no room for intolerance in our
country,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``There is no place for hate crimes,
those who advocate them, those who tolerate them and those who
commit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer attacked D'Amato for opposing abortion and for voting
against legislation to protect abortion clinics from violent
protesters. The congressman said that D'Amato's staunch
anti-abortion position placed him well outside the mainstream of
New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you represent New York and vote against the most basic
protections for those who work in clinics?'' Schumer said. ``The
answer is simple: You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to a New Rochelle senior center earlier, Schumer and
Mrs. Clinton sought to exploit Gingrich's low approval ratings in
New York by hammering at D'Amato for voting for provisions of
Gingrich's Contract With America that reduced federal spending on
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was leading the fight'' against the contract, Schumer
said. ``Where was Al D'Amato? Well, when Al D'Amato had to choose
between Newt Gingrich and seniors, he chose Newt Gingrich. Al
D'Amato voted to cut Medicare 12 times.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and Pataki's events Tuesday kicked off four days of
joint campaigning that will have them crisscrossing the state in a
swirl of rallies and news conferences. The tour provides D'Amato
with help from Pataki's large campaign coffers, because the
governor, who is also running for re-election but is widely thought
to have a comfortable lead, can foot much of the bill for things
like hotel rooms, loudspeakers, jets and cars.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that the tour was mainly for D'Amato's benefit.
Pataki spent half of each of his speeches praising D'Amato. The
news releases handed out at each event focused solely on what
D'Amato had done for each region he visited. And the senator
himself, while offering praise for Pataki's stewardship of the
state, spoke almost exclusively about himself.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, D'Amato talked of fighting in Washington to
increase financing for mass transit and to pass legislation
protecting credit unions. He also said that he saved the state and
its hospitals $2 billion with legislation that exempted New York
from certain Medicaid rules, even though it was never clear that
the federal government was going to enforce those rules.
</P>
<P>
   At his events in Schenectady and Rochester, D'Amato spoke before
crowds of blue-collar workers _ people his advisers clearly thought
would be angered about Schumer's missed votes. In Buffalo and
Rochester, he also mentioned individuals in the crowd whom he had
helped, including a mother whose children had been taken by her
former husband and a family who had had trouble qualifying for
federal aid for their disabled child.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the potholes I have the privilege to repair,''
D'Amato said, introducing the Buffalo mother he had helped reunite
with her children.

CANDIDATE ADMITS FATHER'S ROLE IN FUNDING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For months, Eliot Spitzer's political rivals in the
race for state attorney general have attacked him by raising one
essential question: Who has paid for his campaigns?
</P>
<P>
   After repeatedly contending that he alone paid his campaign
bills this year and in 1994, Spitzer, the Democratic candidate,
acknowledged in interviews with The New York Times this week that
his father, a wealthy real-estate developer, has played an
extensive role in helping to finance his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaigns, Spitzer created the impression that he
wanted the job so badly that he was willing to spend millions in
his own money to win it. It is not clear whether his father's
involvement violated any campaign laws or will simply turn out to
be a political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said, ``I would say that what I have done absolutely
complies with the law, and that is the critical issue here.'' Asked
why he had been less than forthright about his campaign finances,
he said he wanted to spare his family more unwanted publicity.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came after The Times raised questions about his
ability to pay for his campaign expenses, particularly the interest
on $4.3 million in bank loans that he secured in 1994 to finance
his first run for public office, in the Democratic primary for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on how he had been paying off the 1994 loans,
Spitzer said for the first time that his father, Bernard, had lent
him the money in late 1994 after the election to repay the bank. He
provided copies of promissory notes and checks to demonstrate that
he has been repaying his father, though at a much slower pace and
lower rate than he would have had to repay the bank. He also made
available copies of his income-tax returns for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   After Spitzer discussed the financing of his campaigns in
interviews over the last several days, his spokesman, Steven
Goldstein, released a statement to news organizations Tuesday night
acknowledging that Spitzer received loans from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Loans in 1994 and again this year have been essential to
Spitzer's campaigns. A lawyer and former prosecutor with no
previous experience in politics, Spitzer had no natural political
base or core of financial supporters. He had to spend millions on
advertising to make himself known to voters, and he financed both
campaigns fundamentally from two sets of loans: $4.3 million in
1994 and $4.8 million this year, both from J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., the
New York banking company.
</P>
<P>
   But his political rivals, first in the Democratic primary race
that he won last month and now in the general-election campaign
against the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, have questioned how
Spitzer could afford the more than $9 million in loans. Opponents
contended that his father had given him money in excess of the
amounts permitted by campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said repeatedly that he alone was paying the debt and
that he had used as collateral eight Manhattan apartments that he
owns, which he said were worth between $7 million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income-tax returns which I have revealed all the way back
for five years show more than enough income to pay the interest and
necessary principal payments on these loans,'' he said in an Oct. 8
interview on New York 1 News. ``That is the end of the issue. It
has been looked at. There is absolutely no issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Spitzer's tax returns from every year except 1997
showed that he could not afford to pay even the annual interest on
the bank loans. Nor were there any ``necessary principal payments''
required either by the bank or his father over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The interest on the $4.3 million bank loan would have come to
$344,000 a year, which is more than Spitzer's after-tax income in
1994, 1995 or 1996. It is unclear precisely how much he has been
paying his father annually in interest on the loan that repaid the
bank loans. He initially said last Thursday that he was paying ``a
couple hundred thousand'' a year to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer then provided copies of 10 checks he had written
over the last four years to his father, which indicated that he had
paid an average of about $100,000 a year since 1994. Asked on
Monday if that was the actual amount he had been paying in
interest, Spitzer said, ``I don't deny the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in his rush to assemble documentation on his loan
from his father, he was uncertain whether he had made copies of all
the checks he had written and unsure of what the annual payments
amounted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write checks when I get a note telling me that it is time to
pay,'' he said. He said his payments to his father were lower than
what he would have owed the bank because his father had deferred
the principal payments and most of the interest.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer contended that the loan from his father was proper and
followed state campaign-finance laws and federal tax laws. State
law permits Spitzer to spend as much of his own money as he wants
but limits his father to campaign donations of about $260,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service, he said, permits his father to
defer the repayment of principal and some interest on the loans,
provided that the interest rate is competitive. Otherwise, the
loans could be construed as a gift for tax purposes. Some of the
loans from his father call for 7.16 percent interest; others are
for 7.69 percent. The bank loans averaged about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The favorable loan terms from Spitzer's father would probably
not be construed as a campaign contribution, said Thomas Wilkey,
executive director of the state Board of Elections, because the
bank loans and the loan from his father were personal loans, which
Spitzer then gave to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkey said election officials could not rule on the loans'
legality, because they have not investigated them, and would not
say if the board would conduct an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The state law, among the least restrictive in the country, lays
out rules for loans given directly to campaigns but does not
address personal loans to candidates, state election officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that he had been careful to follow the law,
Spitzer also acknowledged that he had used an aggressive strategy
of borrowing to raise millions of dollars for his campaigns. He has
only just begun to repay the $4.8 million in bank loans this year,
which would cost more than $380,000 a year in interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I been aggressive in the way I've done this?'' he said in
an interview on Monday. ``You bet. But I'm up against a Republican
Party that has been more than aggressive.''

</P>
<P>
   Spitzer decried the current system of financing campaigns. ``Is
the system one that absolutely has to be overhauled?'' he asked.
``Yes, and I've said so from Day One. But am I playing by the rules
set up by the IRS and the state campaign-finance law? Absolutely. I
do not feel that by taking advantage of the way the law is written,
I am doing anything that is in any way improper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer went to significant lengths over the last month to
avoid having to reveal the financial help from his father.
Specifically, he has repeatedly misstated the status of the 1994
bank loans when attacked by Vacco on his campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Sept. 28, Vacco has accused Spitzer of having
failed to disclose, in annual reports filed with the state attorney
general's office, that he had used the eight apartments he owns at
200 Central Park South as collateral for the 1994 bank loans. Vacco
said that Spitzer had either failed to file the required disclosure
documents or that he had lied about the source of his campaign
money.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Spitzer at first said that he was uncertain whether
his lawyers had filed all the appropriate documents and that he
would tell them to make sure to follow all proper procedures. Two
weeks later, when asked about the issue by The Daily News, Spitzer
said, ``It will be corrected, but it doesn't go to the issue of
whose money it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco pressed the matter hard during a debate in a Long Island
cable television studio last Friday. ``My answer to him is,
humbug,'' Spitzer said. He said there was a promissory note that
proved that he was spending his own money, and he accused Vacco of
waging a campaign through news releases smearing Spitzer's father.
</P>
<P>
   What Spitzer did not say during that debate, or during a
subsequent one on Sunday, was that the promissory notes for the
1994 loans were to his father, not to J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also admitted that the reports on the cooperative
apartments filed with the state had, in fact, been accurate: He did
not need to notify the state that the apartments he owned were
encumbered, because the 1994 bank loans for which they had served
as collateral had been paid off.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview on Monday, Spitzer was asked why he had not
spoken more accurately about the reports to the state and more
candidly about how he was paying off the 1994 campaign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been attacked and having had my father attacked by
Dennis Vacco, it simply reached a point where I felt I had
responded sufficiently,'' he said. ``I didn't wish my family to go
through any more. I am confident that everything I have done is
legal and proper. I felt that enough was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another noteworthy financial connection between Spitzer
and his father, a review of his income tax returns for the last
five years showed.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in May 1994, just as Spitzer was beginning his first
statewide race, he has been paid about $200,000 a year in
consulting fees for managing his father's investments. In the last
four years, this has been more than the wages he earned as a
lawyer. In 1993, his adjusted gross income was $288,000; in 1994,
$270,000; in 1995, $240,000; in 1996, $507,000, and in 1997,
$1,007,000, of which half was in capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting fees clearly help Spitzer's personal finances,
and thus make it easier for him to repay the loans by his father.
Spitzer said that was not the purpose of the consulting
arrangement, stating emphatically that he had worked hard to manage
his father's investments and had earned the fees. He also said he
began the work in 1994 because he had left a large Manhattan law
firm to run for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent an enormous amount of time managing a stock
portfolio,'' he said. ``That income is well earned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked long, long hours for my dad and for various
businesses,'' Spitzer said. ``Look, I'm not saying that I am
underpaid. But any effort to challenge the propriety of that fee is
way off base.''

JOHNSON RETAINS ONLY TWO COACHES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
named his coaches Tuesday, retaining only former manager Glenn
Hoffman and pitching coach Charlie Hough from last year's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hired former Dodgers catcher and minor-league manager
Rick Dempsey as third-base coach, replacing Joey Amalfitano who
retired after 16 years with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, longtime catcher and bench coach under Tom
Lasorda, Bill Russell and Hoffman, was replaced by Jim Tracy, who
held the same position the past four years for manager Felipe Alou
in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The final new coach is hitting instructor Rick Down, who
replaces Mickey Hatcher. Down began in the Angels organization but
gained a reputation as one of the best in baseball during six
seasons with the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who replaced Russell on June 22, is expected to coach
first. Hough received high marks from the pitching staff after
replacing Goose Gregson a week later. Pitchers responded to his
easy manner and knowledge acquired during a 25-year major-league
career.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Mota, who begins his 30th season with the Dodgers, was
retained as a part-time coach and liaison to the Latin players on
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were very important decisions,'' Johnson said Tuesday
from his home in Orlando, Fla. ``These are the guys there every day
at 2 o'clock preparing this team to do battle. The Dodgers have had
some great coaches over the years and these guys will honor that
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials head today to their spring-training base in
Vero Beach, Fla., for four days of organizational meetings. Down,
who lives in Las Vegas, will fly to Orlando and make the 1{-hour
drive to Vero Beach with Johnson. When Down was Johnson's hitting
instructor with the Orioles in 1996, Baltimore hit a
major-league-record 251 home runs. In Down's first two seasons in
New York, the Yankees led the American League in batting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wanted Amalfitano to return as third-base coach
in 1999 but balked when Amalfitano asked about the bench-coach
position.
</P>
<P>
   Amalfitano said the third-base job ``was discussed but not
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm walking away,'' Amalfitano said. ``It's the right time,
they're going in a different direction. I decided to walk away. If
someone decides to pick up the phone and talk about a job and is
serious, I'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and John Shelby, who joined Hoffman's staff in late June
after the firings of Gregson, Reggie Smith and Mark Cresse, have
been offered minor-league positions with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict hired: The Dodgers also hired Chatsworth High product
Jim Benedict as the organization's new minor-league pitching
coordinator. Benedict, who also attended Valley College and Arizona
State, replaces Guy Conti.
