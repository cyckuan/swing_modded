DEVICE MERGES CELL, REGULAR PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHBOROUGH, Mass. _ If you're a cellular phone owner whose
love of staying wirelessly connected keeps sloshing into your hours
at home, a little start-up company called Vox2.com has just the
thing for you _ and it's coming right in time for the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic ``What-took-them-so-long-to-think-this-up?''
device that allows you to connect all of your household phones, or
your home-office phone, to your wireless phone number.
</P>
<P>
   That means you can use the bedroom or kitchen phone to answer a
call coming in over the cell phone, or place an outbound call from
home over your wireless plan during those night and weekend times
when cell calls are free.
</P>
<P>
   Vox2, for now the archetypical 10 guys at card tables on the
second floor of a Route 20 strip mall, expects to have the units
out in November. They'll probably sell for $180 to $200 through
wireless phone companies, office and electronics superstores, and
perhaps yuppie gizmo catalogs such as those from Sharper Image or
Herrington.
</P>
<P>
   The device looks like a charging station, and works like one,
too. By plugging a standard phone line from the base station into a
wall jack, and putting your Nokia or Ericsson phone in the base
(units for other brands are still in the works), every phone in
your house is instantly connected to the wireless service that you
use.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep your existing land-line connection at home,
you have to get two-line phones and designate the second (or first)
line as the wireless-based connection.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a business wireless phone that you want to use in a
home office only, you can plug the Vox.Link device into the back of
a two-line desk phone and have it ring only there, instead of in
the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you are among the growing hundreds of thousands of
Americans who have gone all-wireless for your telecommunications,
you can use your existing one-line home phones as extensions of
your wireless device by cutting the cord with Verizon or your local
carrier and plugging in with Vox.Link.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use the device to replace land-line service at a
summer home where you need phone service only a few weeks a year.
Or you could use it as an alternative to a new Verizon or AT&AMP;T land
line or if gabby teenagers _ or a dial-up, Web-surfing spouse _
have pushed you into the market for a second phone line at home.
</P>
<P>
   The product, being manufactured by Century Electronics in
Marlborough, is kind of a modern-day story like the one about how
Dupont engineers accidentally invented Teflon. Last year, Vox2 was
at work on a complex home networking system for people with
broadband Internet connections. The system suffered the fatal flaw
that you couldn't explain what it did in 30 seconds. Among other
things, it would let you use standard phones to place calls over
the Internet through a computer-based service like Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   However, one element of the system _ almost an afterthought _
was the set-up that let you run your home phones off of a wireless
unit.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of trade show schmoozing and meetings with investors,
Vox2 executives found that the wireless link was what turned people
on. In January, ``We came home, and we literally put the rest of
the system in the closet'' and focused on developing the wireless
application as a commercial product, said Ken Holberger, Vox2's
vice president of marketing. He's a former Data General techie who
became a serial entrepreneur in the data-networking world. ``We
picked the best idea from the collection,'' Holberger said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the system cannot get around: poor wireless
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't do is improve your signal,'' Holberger said. One
trial user who is a Bell South executive, however, has found an
admittedly clumsy way to deal with this by putting the Vox.Link
device in his second-story bedroom, where it gets a strong signal,
and running a phone line to the basement home office, where he
actually takes and places calls on the wireless number.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trick to the system: If you look at the bottom of a
typical wireless phone, it has a series of little bars that are
roughly analogous to the serial port on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   By plugging these bars into the base station, you can connect
other phones to the wireless unit and get it to do things like
translate touch tones from a table phone into a digital packet used
to place a wireless call, or convert the ring of a cell phone into
a distinctive pitched ring on your home phones.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several inventors have patented roughly similar
systems. Motorola and GTE are among the companies that took a stab
at developing a similar cradle unit or devices to turn a wireless
phone into a cordless phone at home.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all instances of people who were ahead of their
time and stayed that way _ in part because wireless calling rates
were still so high years ago that there was no market for
encouraging people to use their wireless calling plan when their
standard Bell System local service was much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The former USWest, now Qwest Communications, and Linx
Communications of Newton have offered for several years a popular
one-number service that rings both your your home or business phone
and your cell phone. It's a different cut at solving the two-phones
problem that doesn't necessarily offer the benefits of arbitraging
your phone use between wired and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, with big local wireless coverage areas and fixed-rate
national roaming plans, you can easily pay less to make what would
be a long-distance or in-state toll call by using your cell phone
instead of your land-line phone _ and pay zero on nights and
weekends if you have a plan when calls then are free.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Zawel, a senior wireless analyst with Yankee Group in
Boston, said that Vox2 is ``a solution that's targeted at a real
problem,'' meaning the hassle of dealing with two different phones.
Zawel said it could accelerate a trend called ``wireline
displacement'' by making it that much more comfortable to use your
wireless as your home phone.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, a Yankee Group survey found that 2 percent of US
cell phone owners used them as their sole phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that number has doubled'' when
results of a new poll are reported next month, Zawel said,
reflecting in particular the growing population of supermobile
people in their 20s for whom getting locked into a home phone
number is a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond total displacement, Yankee has also found people are
using wireless units for a much bigger share of their total voice
calling, growing from 6 percent to 13 percent between 1998 and
1999. Some wireless companies are looking to encourage this trend
by giving you a discount for calls you make from your home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges Vox2 found in developing the
system was that the dominant wireless phone maker, Nokia, was not
interested in sharing specifications on how its phones work. So
technicians had to spend long hours figuring out what goes on
inside the phone to make it function with the base unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, however, opened up its documentation to Vox2 to help
it develop a system.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which rounds out the Big Three of wireless phone
makers, is being moderately cooperative with Vox2 about developing
a unit for Motorola phones.
</P>
<P>
   Holberger and others at Vox2 are confident they can sell
hundreds of thousands of the units, and have some ideas in mind for
future improvements _ which, understandably, they are staying quiet
about for now, so you won't wait to buy the 2.0 version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the industry we show this to,'' said sales vice
president Michael H. Schwartz, ``says the same thing: `We have been
looking for that for years.' ''

JUDGES CAN'T ACCEPT FEES AND APPEAR IMPARTIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief justice of the United States has lost a sense of
judicial balance. He has forgotten that the faith of the people in
the judicial system depends upon the belief that judges are
impartial.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a letter to Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., supporting speaker fees for federal judges
to augment their salaries. His request reveals a serious lapse in
judgment. Such fees would invite influence peddling and eventually
destroy any appearance of judicial impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   Abner J. Mikva, professor of law at the University of Chicago,
who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from
1979 to 1994 and was its chief judge for four of those years, said
in an interview Friday, ``There is a crying need to raise the
earnings of federal judges and I hope Congress addresses it. But to
try to do it through the back door by letting them take honoraria
is a very bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, let's just talk about the appearance. The
appearance is that the private sector, whoever is providing these
honoraria, is buying some kind of access to the judges. Now, I
happen to know that most judges are not for sale. The overwhelming
majority of judges are not for sale, but the appearance of these
matters is almost as important as the substance. And if a judge
goes off and collects a $5,000 honorarium, or even a $1,000
honorarium from some group that has an interest in litigation that
comes before his court, the appearance is going to be that
something was transacted. We ought not do it. That appearance of
impartiality is perhaps the most important prerequisite for having
a justice system that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed an ethics reform bill back in 1989 that
prohibits members of Congress, judges and senior officials of the
executive and legislative branches from accepting honoraria for
speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed precisely because there were widespread
allegations that interest groups and businesses were using those
fees to buy special consideration and influence.
</P>
<P>
   The reform should stand without any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   However, acting on Rehnquist's letter, senators have inserted a
provision in the appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, State
and Judiciary that would end the ban on speaking fees for federal
judges.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bill was passed by the Senate Appropriations
Committee in July and awaits a vote by the Senate. The House
version of the appropriations bill does not have the speaker-fee
provision.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist complains in his letter that ``the disparity between
salaries of the judicial and legal profession cannot continue
indefinitely without compromising the morale of the federal
judiciary and eventually its quality. ... It is now to the point
that in today's legal market, a first-year associate in a law firm
could make as much in salary as a federal judge. Such disparity
harms the ability of the judiciary to retain and recruit the most
capable lawyers from all socio-economic classes and geographical
areas, particularly in high cost-of-living urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual salary of the chief justice of the United States is
$181,400. Associate justices on the Supreme Court earn $173,600.
Federal appellate judges are paid $150,000, and federal district
judges make $141,300.
</P>
<P>
   While those salaries may be more than adequate in rural states,
Rehnquist is right: They aren't competitive in urban settings.
</P>
<P>
   Mikva agreed with Rehnquist on salary levels. He noted, ``Almost
every lawyer who appears before a federal judge outearns him or her
twice or three times over. That's not appropriate. Something should
be done about it. But not by removing the ban on honoraria.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin of the Congressional Accountability Project, a
nonprofit watchdog organization, calls the honoraria ``graft for
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's approach to raising salaries of federal judges by
allowing judges to accept speaker fees shows an abysmal disregard
for the people who appear in federal courts and expect fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Sloan, executive director of the bipartisan
Constitution Project in Washington, D.C., underscored that concern:
``Judges must avoid creating even the appearance of partisanship or
a conflict of interest. Yet this is just what would happen if
judges supplement their salaries through paid speaking engagements
before interest groups and others with matters before the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress should raise the salaries of federal judges
appropriately, especially now when the nation is experiencing a
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But senators may have another motive for chipping away at the
ban on speaker fees. They may want to include themselves in the
exceptions to the ethics rule at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Although appropriations bills rival encyclopedias in their
number of pages, this speaker-fee provision should be ferreted out
and debated on the Senate floor. It isn't likely to survive in open
debate. It shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-fee provision could do a serious injustice to our
federal judicial system.
</P>

GETTING ON THIS PARTY LIST TAKES CREDENTIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an area with more schmoozers and networkers
per square inch than anywhere else on the planet, Monica Lee is
Silicon Valley's ultimate matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Wild Card Wednesday'' parties and events have led to jobs,
business deals, romances _ even a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a self-described geek from Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lee put on her monthly soiree for the Silicon Valley
``Swing Set'' _ so called not for their dating habits, but for
swinging from one start-up to another. These are young
professionals, 25 to 35 years old, most of whom have master's
degrees in business administration and advanced engineering
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Lee began Wild Card Wednesdays six years ago, as an informal
gathering at a bar in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just started a job as a venture capitalist, and I wanted
to celebrate my first investment,'' said Lee, 32. ``So three of us
went to a bar. Because it was a Wednesday, we wondered who the heck
would be out drinking in Palo Alto in the middle of the week.'' Lee
remembered warning her drinking buddies beforehand that ``It'll be
a total wild card!''
</P>
<P>
   Since those humble beginnings, the organization has exploded. It
has a mailing list with more than 4,000 people linked to a
full-blown job network and bonded by events that include
sky-diving, snowboarding, hang gliding, diving for abalone,
heli-skiing, surfing (the ocean, not the Web), and cocktail parties
at ``emerging'' San Francisco nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   With a playlist like that, it's not surprising that getting on
the Wild Card mailing list can be tougher than getting admitted to
MIT. Lee declined to describe any criteria; members are referred by
the creme de la few and added to list because of a certain je ne
sais quoi.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the qualifications, it was hardly a snooty crowd
Wednesday at the Bas Bar and Nightclub. But because of the Formula
One car-racing theme, the ``hunk ratio'' was higher than normal,
said Susan Doherty, a volunteer cohost.
</P>
<P>
   The party's theme might as well have been ``All Roads Lead to
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty met Lee in a study group when both were undergraduates
at Harvard. She started dating her now-husband, a chemical engineer
from MIT, at a Wild Card event in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another cohost, Sashi Sabaratnam, met her boyfriend, a former
biochemist at Brandeis University, at a Wild Card party. Through
other connections at Wild Card, she also found her current job with
SquareTrade, a San Francisco company founded by three Harvard
Business School graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Chinoporos, a Boston native who worked for Lotus
Development Corp. and moved to the Bay Area two years ago, finds
the New England connections at Wild Card functions comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every month I can come and see familiar faces,'' said
Chinoporos, who is now with Escalate, a Silicon Valley start-up
that helps retailers set up online shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a well-beaten path between Boston and Silicon
Valley that there are just a lot of random coincidences involving
Boston,'' said Neal Day, chief technology officer of Wal-Mart.com.
A Weston native, he was the Wild Card cohost.
</P>
<P>
   With such strong ties, Lee is contemplating starting a Wild Card
chapter in other technology hubs such as Atlanta, London, Boston,
New York, and Seattle. But for Lee, it's not just about sun and
fun. She also plans to start a venture fund linked to Wild Card
events and members. Last year, the events began to take on sponsors
that pay several thousand dollars to host an event. And while
posting jobs is free, it's not likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   In a market obsessed with recruiting workers, Lee knows that
access to members of Wild Card, technology professionals with MBAs,
can be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, what's the hardest thing about starting a
company?'' Lee asked rhetorically. ``It's finding the right people.
We can help facilitate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vision Inc., a sponsor of last week's event, paid less than
$10,000 for the privilege, money that Vision executives believe was
well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Card has a reputation for having decision makers at their
events,'' said Michael Blum, director of business development for
Vision. ``It's not just a job fair. You can actually go and close
business at these events.''

WEB CONSULTANTS FEEL DOT-COM PINCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet consultants delighted Wall Street investors when their
stock prices soared and customers lined up at their front doors,
anxious to build vibrant Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge couldn't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, the dot-com turmoil that began when
investors began spurning virtual retailers spilled over to the
technology consultants that helped create the new marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Triggered by Viant Corp.'s warning that its third-quarter
earnings would fall short of expectations, the stock prices of
consultants like Scient Corp., Breakaway Solutions Inc., and
Sapient Corp. spiraled downward.
</P>
<P>
   Also feeling the pinch is Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.,
which said that bad debts from dot-coms and other problems
contributed to a larger-than-expected loss in the second quarter,
ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn has been blamed on dot-com companies that are
backing out of projects and, in some cases, failing to pay their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fortune 1000 companies no longer feel the
pressure to race to the Web, now that their virtual rivals are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are becoming more conservative. Mark D'Annolfo, a
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst in Boston, recently whittled his
``strong-buy'' recommendation list of consultants to Scient,
Sapient, Proxicom Inc., and Diamond Technology Partners Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undergoing a transition where the dot-com mania has
really exited the market,'' D'Annolfo said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some accepted more dot-com business
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, money-losing Internet firms have been spurned
by investors, suppliers, landlords, advertisers, and even
landlords. The skeptics asked for cash upfront.
</P>
<P>
   Wary consultants have also kept dot-coms at arm's length _
though some exercised more caution than others.
</P>
<P>
   Most consultants receive less than 5 percent of their revenue
from Internet upstarts, according to a report by SG Cowen
Securities analyst Moshe Katri.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly choosy is Proxicom, a Reston, Va., technology
consultant that takes in less than 2 percent of its sales from
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, on the other hand, gets 15 percent of sales from
dot-coms, and Viant, between 15 percent and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Sapient spokeswoman said the Cambridge company already
carefully screens dot-com customers but would not say whether
executives planned stricter policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Viant officials, who watched their stock price plummet to
record levels, may soon tinker with their dot-com selection and
payment policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, with the market changes, we're going to take an even
more conservative approach than we have in the past,'' said Tara
Knowles, chief marketing officer of Boston-based Viant. ``The bar
to entry is going to get much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict a wave of consolidation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict Wall Street's backlash against technology
consultants will be followed by a wave of consolidation in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of small players that have sprouted up in Boston and
other high-tech markets, relying on revenue from dot-coms, may soon
drop out of the race, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are being supported and may expand over time,''
said Eric Ross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
Boston. ``The also-rans and the me-too's are being neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   But several consultants downplayed Wall Street's reaction,
saying the financial markets were only taking a more realistic turn
after sending their stocks on a roller-coaster ride for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the market is just sort of getting back to normal
after the rushes of last year and this year,'' said Ingrid Ekstrom,
a Sapient spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's just sort of steadying out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, analysts expect stronger consultants skilled in
integrating software systems will continue to attract large
corporations as customers.
</P>
<P>
   These projects will be more expensive and complex, thought they
will take more time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget and sales cycles will look a lot different than
those for a dot-com,'' said Christine Overby, an analyst with
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.

ONLINE, PRIVACY'S A GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, Dani Leto figures Web sites know more about her than she
knows herself.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she didn't mind sharing information, believing
Internet companies could make better recommendations if they were
given insight into her shopping habits. So she has told them what
music, books and software she prefers, as well as her credit-card
numbers, home address and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   But two online experiences made Leto uncomfortable with the
notion that Internet companies are taking snapshots of her every
mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Youknowbest.com, which provides consumer information about
products, accidentally revealed another customer's account
information to her. She learned his name, address and possibly
other information. And nothing more than a typo entered on BMG
Entertainment's music site revealed that the company had been
selling her information to a host of marketers.
</P>
<P>
   At BMGmusicservice.com, she had accidentally written ``Letro.''
``Next thing I knew, I had all this mail in my e-mail box for Dani
Letro,'' said Leto, an account executive in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leto, millions of consumers have invited Internet companies
into their lives, sharing personal details that allow Amazon.com,
SmarterKids.com and other firms to suggest suitable products and
fine-tune their marketing pitches. The practice is known as
``personalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say consumers should be more concerned
with how their information is used. There is little regulation of
the Internet. And while policymakers debate how to protect
consumers without slowing down the new marketplace or efforts to
offer personalized customer service online, many sites continue to
violate their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 76 percent of
Internet companies were not in compliance with the privacy
statements made on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly growing Web businesses often aren't aware of the
breaches, privacy experts say. Others know but don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure as long as they don't get caught, it's OK,'' said
Larry Ponemon, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who specializes in
privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the fine print helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   BMGmusicservice.com, for example, said it will occasionally
provide e-mail and postal addresses to selected companies _ though
shopper Leto complained that the policy is tucked away in the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Youknowbest.com has a more stringent privacy statement, though
the policy had little to do with Leto's experience. Leto managed to
access another customer's information during a test of the site
because both consumers had used the same network password. The
problem has been fixed, a company official said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Internet companies that hoped to avoid scrutiny
have found themselves wrestling with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Living.com, a online furniture retailer that recently filed for
bankrtupcy protection, received a stern warning from Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn. If the company sells customer data, Cornyn
said, it risks violating state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has stepped into the privacy
debate, too. The agency now is charged with protecting the privacy
of youths under age 13, under the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also filed suit against Toysmart.com, an Internet toy
seller based in Waltham, Mass., after the company collapsed in May
and tried to auction off its customer database.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Toysmart.com had promised never to sell
personal information, which included customers' shopping
preferences and children's birth dates.
</P>
<P>
   Both state and federal regulators have been watching DoubleClick
Inc., which tracks Internet users on an anonymous basis to help
companies target their marketing.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick ignited controversy when it announced plans to merge
its anonymous information with personally identifiable consumer
data collected by off-line companies that are members of Abacus
Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies argue that consumers should be more
worried about a cyber-world in which there is no personalized
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   They point to catalog retailers and other off-line companies
that have long swapped and sold lists of suitable shoppers, in
effect decreasing the number of mass mailings. Imagine what would
happen to your mailbox before the holiday season if companies could
only guess what you liked, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers also argue that their personalization efforts make
them better merchants. And the more information that you provide,
they say, the better they can serve you.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup Inc. and other companies, for instance, can offer
personalized financial Web sites that combine large quantities of
sensitive information, including a person's assets, net worth, and
airline mileage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites _ Travelocity.com and Expedia.com are two examples
_ say that they can help you find bargains on air fares, car
rentals, and hotels if you tell them where you like to vacation.
CDnow.com will suggest Ella Fitzgerald or Louis Armstrong if it
knows you like jazz.
</P>
<P>
   At SmarterKids.com, parents can build profiles by entering their
children's ages, educational levels, and interests. The Needham,
Mass. online retailer uses that information to suggest appropriate
educational toys and games.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also can get extensive information on how their infants
should be developing and what their children should be learning at
various grade levels. The site then offers various test-preparation
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Customer profiles also help SmarterKids.com turn more repeat
buyers into loyal shoppers. A frequent buyer, for example, receives
marketing pitches. On the other hand, those consumers who return
items or seek only marked-down merchandise might find themselves
deleted from the company's marketing list.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com _ with more than 23 million customers, it's the Web's
largest retailer _ has become one of the leaders in
personalization. Watch the bottom left corner as you click on
items. As you browse, Amazon.com begins updating that space to
reflect your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com shoppers can receive recommendations based on what
they like, what their friends like, what their colleagues like, and
even what people in Boston like (``All Souls: A Family Story From
Southie'' in books, ``The Usual Suspects'' in video).
</P>
<P>
   But such extensive feedback comes only if customers open up _
which they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these customers who are passionable about sharing
information about the things they love or don't like,'' said J.J.
Jacobi, Amazon.com's director of community.
</P>
<P>
   Although many consumers readily hand over details of their
lives, regulators and policy makers say the need for stronger
enforcement of online privacy will grow as more Web sites begin to
collect and analyze consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 bills now in Congress would address online privacy.
The FTC is backing legislation that would force Internet companies
to tell consumers whether their information is being collected, how
it will be used, and what kind of security measures will protect
their data from prying eyes. Web sites also would have to include
an opt-in provision, meaning consumers would have to grant
permission before their personal data could be collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet industry is preparing its own solution. The World
Wide Web Consortium has been planning a system that would allow
Internet users to define the information they are willing to share.
When a Web site does not meet the Internet surfer's standards, a
warning would appear on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this debate is healthy,'' said Matt Cutler, cofounder
of NetGenesis, a Cambridge, Mass. maker of software that helps Web
sites analyze visitors' behavior. ``There will be a period of
adjustment to decide what is appropriate and what is not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Amazon.com apparently decided that what they were
doing did not pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Seattle-based online retailer revamped its
privacy statement, spelling out exactly how it has used _ and could
use _ customer data. The Web giant now says it will pass along
customer data if it is sold to another company. It also
acknowledged that it has been sending e-mail marketing pitches on
behalf of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's actions were designed to prevent
future controversy over its privacy policy, which had been
criticized as vague.
</P>
<P>
   Whether many customers really stop to peruse privacy policies is
another question. Ponemon, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, estimated
that 2 to 3 percent of consumers read privacy statements.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't blame the busy consumer. Internet companies often
bury their privacy statements on their Web pages. And even if
customers find the policies, they often must read pages and pages
of confusing text written by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Web sites) don't realize,'' Ponemon said, ``is that some
of these policies say, `We don't respect your privacy. Don't trust
us.' ''

 &HT;    Horns, punt away those `easy' teams
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I thought the University of Texas football schedule was supposed
to be easy this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is easy? How can it be easy when Stanford has Tiger Woods
on the sidelines, and all we've got is Matthew McConaughey? But it
was supposed to be easy, because the experts and the fans said so.
It was so easy that ESPN's Beano Cook said the Longhorns were
contenders for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   That's the last time I'm taking the word of a guy named after a
gas medicine. What's that they say about Beano the medication?
Helps stop gas before it gets started? I would expect the same next
time from Beano Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm Mister Smarty Pants, I've got this whole mess figured
out. Texas should have dumped Stanford off the schedule instead of
Hawaii. That way Texas could have gotten a win, a nice tan, a Don
Ho tape and a couple of rum drinks with flags.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what they say about national titles: Here today,
gone to Maui.
</P>
<P>
   What do you have to do to get out of some of these other easy
games? Does Texas have to play Oklahoma and Texas A&AMP;M? What about
Colorado? Couldn't we switch Oklahoma, A&AMP;M and Colorado for Ball
State, RPI and William and Mary? I'd rather see RPI than RIP, if
you catch my drift.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the good news: The Longhorns can invite the Boy Scouts
back into Royal-Memorial Stadium for Saturday's game against
Houston. For 57 years, Boy Scouts worked as backup ushers at UT
home football games. After fans were seated, the Scouts found empty
seats and watched the game. But this year, the Scouts weren't asked
back, because there wouldn't be enough seats _ thanks to all those
easy games.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Stanford, you can bring back the Boy Scouts. In his
magic crystal ball, the Swami Kelsoni sees many seats left vacant
by the Longhorn fickle for the Houston game. If the Longhorns lose
to Houston, they'll have enough room to squeeze in the 3rd Armored
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, why do the Boy Scouts have to sit? They're strong.
They're kids. They can earn their merit badges for standing.
</P>
<P>
   The timing on this loss is a marketing disaster. In Sunday's
newspaper, I found an ad for a miniature Texas Longhorns '53 Chevy
pickup from -- he Danbury Mint. ``Crafted from more than 150
individual parts!'' the ad says. For a mere $145, ``payable in five
convenient monthly installments of just $29,'' Longhorn fans can
buy a bookshelf-size orange and white pickup fit for tiny
``fan-tasy'' tailgate parties.
</P>
<P>
   The toy truck mirrors the Texas offense: It doesn't run. But it
comes with two miniature coolers, a little Hook 'Em steer figurine
with large nostrils, a director's chair and a teeny Weber grill.
</P>
<P>
   A Weber grill? Real Texans don't barbecue on Weber grills. Real
Texans smoke on barrels on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The truck lacks some of the realistic touches. It needs a
replica of a whiny Longhorn fan sitting in the director's chair,
moaning about Mack Brown's two-quarterback system.
</P>
<P>
   These little trucks would move off the lot quicker if Stanford
hadn't let the air out of the Longhorns' tires. But we'll get 'em
next time. Hook 'em.

 &HT;    Bowdlerites keep legacy alive
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In the early1800s, Thomas Bowdler, an English
doctor of medicine, as well as an accomplished man of letters, set
about cleaning up Shakespeare's bawdy tales. His intention was to
buff the bard's deftly turned,
</P>
<P>
   but occasionally shocking stories into G-rated works _ something
a father might read aloud to his family without exposing them to
the corruption of smut.
</P>
<P>
   Bowdler's intentions were commendable, I guess, and he is
credited with producing a work in 1818, ``Family Shakspeare''
(sic), that was acceptable to a much wider audience than the
licentious brutes (royalty included) who went big time for the real
stuff back in the 16th century. Nevertheless, the word
``bowdlerize'' has become a disparaging synonym for expurgation and
censorship, which apparently is just as alive and well now as it
was back in Mr. Bowdler's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter,'' and ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''
have been bowdlerized in school libraries around the nation. So
have Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' and Harper
Lee's, ``To Kill a Mockingbird''.
</P>
<P>
   Christian groups are attacking the Potter series because it
deals with witches and wizards. Sure am glad these folks weren't
around back in the late `30s, when every Saturday morning I
hunkered down beside the old GE radio, the
</P>
<P>
   one with the shiny green tuning eye, and listened raptly to
fairy tales as they spun over the airwaves and into my living room.
``Let's Pretend,'' had it all _ witches, ogres, wizards, and wolves
that ate up little girls. Even a loose
</P>
<P>
   woman by the name of Snow White who lived with seven short guys.
</P>
<P>
   Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is No. 3 on
the list because it ``portrays white people as being horrible,
nasty, stupid people.'' So, bowdlerizers, what's your point? Many
of us are.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the thought, what about the town that has banned
Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' because it ``conflicted with
the values of the community''? Tell me please, what kind of a
community has values that exclude family, love, kindness, and equal
justice for all, even an uneducated black man and a backward boy?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain is accused of using ``offensive and racist
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically speaking, he was writing in the accepted lingo of
the time and why now, after we have come such a long way, even
though we have miles yet to travel, why backtrack and attempt to
alter history by eradicating all literary
</P>
<P>
   reminders of our darker ages? Why not enjoy Twain for the
spirited observer of human nature that he was and let it go at
that?
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, J.D. Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye'' made the list.
It always does because it's loaded with ``profanity, sexual
references, and centered around negative activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody been in a junior high school lately?
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking to find Maurice Sendak's ``In the Night
Kitchen'' on the list. For weeks that was on my young son's list of
favorite bedtime reads. Nightly, we'd snug into his bottom bunk
and, as I put words to Sendak's magic, he would trace the splendid
illustrations with a pudgy baby finger, chortling with delight as
the story came to life.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? He grew up okay. He's not afraid of the dark and
he worships no graven images, except maybe his putter on a good
day. He's neither a bigot nor a racist, and as far as I know, he
still commutes to work in an old Mazda truck _ not on a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Sendak, Angelou, Steinbeck, Salinger, Huxley, Vonnegut, Stine _
my son has read them all and I suspect, had the would-be
bowdlerizers done the same, they might not be so quick to suspect
evil lurking behind every dustjacket.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother used to say that some folks always had a real
keen nose for sniffing out the devil. Said she suspected that was
because they knew what they were looking for and where to find it
better than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Bowdlerize that one.

 &HT;    Students follow different rules at Learning Tree Farm
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't run!
</P>
<P>
   Don't climb!
</P>
<P>
   Don't get out of line!
</P>
<P>
   Don't touch!
</P>
<P>
   Kids live in a world of don'ts.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers live in a world of vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   So when they step off that field-trip bus, it takes a little
time to become acclimated to the Learning Tree Farm, a hands-on,
traditional family farm in Jefferson Twp., Ohio, that has been
putting schoolchildren in touch with nature for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   When they step off the bus, the grown-ups find it hard to resist
the impulse to shout, Don't run! Don't climb! Don't touch!
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while to realize the rules here are different. Wood
fences are meant to be climbed, sheep meant to be petted, hay
fields meant to be explored.
</P>
<P>
   The motto is, ``If they touch it, they remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers Jean Ryan and Sally Keyes founded the Learning Tree
Farm with the dream of bringing schoolchildren closer to the
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, they are still fulfilling that mission for some
8,000 schoolchildren a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was while running the phys-ed program at St. Agnes School
that the teachers noticed something: Some students became more
responsive in the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some students, four walls spelled failure,'' Keyes said.
``But in nature, there were new opportunities to succeed. You could
be the first to perceive a bird's nest or a pretty purple bug.''
</P>
<P>
   And, over the years, they have noticed a difference in the
children who come to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   The students are more tentative, seem to have less endurance.
Students and teachers alike seem more out of touch with the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from house to garage to air conditioning to car,'' Ryan
said.When children are stationed in front of their computers in
air-conditioned comfort, they don't experience what it's like to
``feel the rain and see the effect of lightning on the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids sometimes arm themselves with sticks before striking out
into the woods. ``Are there bears?'' they will ask.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they leave, they are much more at ease, exhibiting a
sense of ownership, talking about ``our'' farm. They've climbed
trees, scrambled up the tractor, swung on the tire swing. They've
petted the sheep and the cattle and the Dorking chickens (a rare
breed brought over by the early settlers). They've visited the
stables and made friends with the Sicilian miniature donkeys, the
Pygmy goats and the hogs being raised for market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the family farm experience, known as ``Hands on
the Farm,'' the Learning Tree Farm offers schoolchildren science
workshops and a ``Hands on the Past'' program, which explores the
1800s life of early Ohio settlers. The ``Pumpkins on the Farm''
program is offered from September through October. Family
memberships are available, allowing members to visit the farm
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Tree Farm enjoys a cooperative, friendly
relationship with better-known field trip destinations such as
Carriage Hill and Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Keyes don't consider themselves in competition with the
larger farms, believing they offer a more intimate environment
``that's as close to an old-fashioned family farm as you can get,''
Keyes said. ``We're holding a little bit of history for everybody _
an experience less and less available to the majority of
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The two friends have never regretting starting the farm, and
have remained friends through all the struggles of keeping it
afloat. ``We don't have time not to be friends,'' Ryan quipped.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running school programs, the women and their
staff are running an active farm _ everything, including getting
hogs to market and harvesting pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are business plans and marketing strategies to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to sustain,'' Keyes said. ``Every time a school
levy fails, field trips are the first thing they cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear it every day: 'I never knew this place was here; I
didn't know Dayton had a farm,''' Ryan said. ``I wish I had a
nickel for every person who said that this is the best kept secret
in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   So come on out, everybody. Better yet, bring a child you know.
</P>
<P>
   Tell him to run, climb, explore.
</P>
<P>
   And by all means, touch.

 &HT;    No excuse for not being plugged in
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The smallest violin in the world is now playing for a
New York magazine columnist who recently wrote that he did not have
the time to pay attention to this summer's pop-culture TV
phenomenon ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   His excuse: he was way too busy covering the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles and following the events surrounding the
doomed Russian submarine and other stories of import and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   To say something like this _ let alone write it down and publish
it in big magazine _ ought to be pretty embarrassing. Wasn't there
a remote control on the TV set in his Los Angeles hotel room? And
excuse me, but didn't he have a laptop with Internet access to he
could log on to the Web and periodically check the news and
whatever else he wanted to keep up with while he was reporting from
the convention floor?
</P>
<P>
   Even we lowly reporters down here in the boonies of Atlanta have
Internet access when our newspaper sends us out into the world to
cover the news. You'd think the boys from the big city would have
arrived in L.A. loaded down with every piece of electronic gear
from laptops, to cell, phones, wireless pagers and who knows what
else.
</P>
<P>
   But as the political pundits say, all of this is off point. What
we're talking about here is a failure to communicate, or rather a
failure to use communications tools effectively. In a media pundit,
or any kind of pundit for that matter, this is just inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Democratic Convention was important and there were many
interesting moments, from President Clinton's farewell speech, to
Joe Lieberman's emotional acceptance speech to Vice President Gore,
his wife Tipper and ``that kiss.'' I watched the convention in
prime-time and even if I didn't, CNN, C-Span and even ABC's ``World
News Now'' were running repeats of the proceedings for the people
who missed the convention because they wanted to see who got
bounced off the island or were watching baseball on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   For the plugged-in crowd, there were any number of Web sites,
running streaming audio and video of the speeches, providing still
photos and text of what was actually said. And if you wanted to see
how this festival of American politics was playing around the
world, who knows how many international Web sites had their own
take on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on to ``Survivor.'' Yes, perhaps Sue's bitter,
bile-filled farewell tirade doesn't quite rank up there with the
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a
Dream'' speech, but you have to admit it was good television. Not
that it matters, but I particularly enjoyed ``it's time for the
snake to eat the rat'' line. It was right up there with Lieberman's
line about the Republican Convention, Tom Hanks and acting. (Need
to catch up with elections goings-on? Try www.alllpolitics.com for
a good overview.)
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? If you didn't see it, there are plenty of
places online to catch up with the show, or at least gain some
passing familiarity with it, now a necessity for any party
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, for example, had entire sections devoted to both the
convention and ``Survivor'' with links to official sites, excerpts
from speeches, and analysis from the New York Times to almost
everybody with an opinion personal or professional on either story.
(Miss the whole ``Survivor'' phenom? There are a million places to
catch up, start with www.Survivorsucks.com for a quick pop-culture
history lesson.)
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, we cannot forget the Kursk submarine story. The tragedy
of the Russian sailors trapped beneath the bottom of the sea was a
horrifying and continually unfolding drama. The Internet was the
ideal place to follow the daily turn of events, mostly because
unlike the conventions or ``Survivor,'' news was continually
breaking. Sites like CNN, MSNBC, ABCNews.com, the British
Broadcasting Company and even America Online have proven time and
time again that they can grab the breaking news stories, put them
online and have them available for users any time. CNN in
particular had dramatic pictures of the families of the sub victims
waiting for news that was as powerful as anything shown on
television. (Want more sub information? Check out
www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/submarine/) But more importantly it was
there when I wanted it. I didn't have to wait for Headline News to
circle back to the story. I could go to a Web site, and choose the
news I wanted to read.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers, including serious-minded New York media
pundits, often don't have the time or even the inclination to keep
up with every breaking news story, TV show or political stump
speech. But the news is out there, and there is more than one way
to retrieve it or catch up with news you've missed. You can watch
TV, read newspapers, listen to the radio _ and you can do all three
of those things on the Internet, if you are so inclined. With new
products from Microsoft and additions to the news Web sites, it's
sometimes possible to do all those things online _ and all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Or you just have the headlines downloaded to a phone or a
wireless pager. You can get big gulps from 24-hour cable networks
or tiny sips on a pager. The choice is up to the individual. When
it comes to catching up on the latest news, whether it's Indiana
University coach Bobby Knight's firing, or George W. Bush's
subliminal campaign ads or who won an Emmy last Sunday night, it's
all out there. All anyone has to do is look.

 &HT;    No excuse for not being plugged in

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The smallest violin in the world is now playing for a
New York magazine columnist who recently wrote that he did not have
the time to pay attention to this summer's pop-culture TV
phenomenon ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   His excuse: he was way too busy covering the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles and following the events surrounding the
doomed Russian submarine and other stories of import and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   To say something like this _ let alone write it down and publish
it in big magazine _ ought to be pretty embarrassing. Wasn't there
a remote control on the TV set in his Los Angeles hotel room? And
excuse me, but didn't he have a laptop with Internet access to he
could log on to the Web and periodically check the news and
whatever else he wanted to keep up with while he was reporting from

 &HT;    Under 'zero tolerance,' even kids who do right get burned
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whole idea of ``zero tolerance'' is to send a message to
children. In Galveston last week, that message was: Do the right
thing, and you'll get it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to a 7-year-old who got caught up in a
two-pronged cavalcade of error.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the second-grader learned in the process. Next time
you find a gun, don't tell. Throw it in the bushes. Flush it down
the toilet. Don't bring it to a teacher. You'll get suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The child in question went to school not knowing that his mom's
idiot boyfriend had put a handgun in his backpack. When he
discovered it looking for pencils and paper, the boy told his
teacher. It was exactly what he should have done.
</P>
<P>
   The boyfriend was dutifully charged with a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The boy? Reasonable people would have patted him on the head and
let him get on with his childhood. Instead, citing the Texas
Education Code (which is not as clear as the district implies), the
school district suspended him for three days, supposedly to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said eventually the boy might get a
commendation, even a reward. That doesn't excuse what they did in
the name of zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   For acting like winged monkeys rather than rational human
beings, they should be suspended three days from the order of
higher primates.
</P>
<P>
   Zero tolerance, first implemented to combat drugs in schools,
then pumped up to counteract violence, has become a chilling
monstrosity.
</P>
<P>
   On the pretense of curbing assaults and taking threats
seriously, children can be punished severely for acting childishly.
</P>
<P>
   Zero tolerance takes judgment out of the equation at a time
when, with tender psyches at stake, judgment is most needed.
Consider these atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Pennsylvania kindergartner was suspended for bringing a toy
ax to school as part of his Halloween costume.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A 14-year-old boy mistakenly left a pocket knife in his book
bag after a Boy Scout camping trip. He was expelled even though his
Scout leader vouched for his explanation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Four New Jersey kindergartners were suspended for playing cops
and robbers during recess. The words, ``Bang. I shot you.'' were
judged to be a ``terroristic threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case some higher primate could legalistically say the
zero-tolerance policy was violated (That's an ax, even if orange
and plastic). But here's where we're supposed to be separated from
the winged monkeys. We're supposed to use reason.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we set hard and fast rules and hide behind them like
torch-bearing hordes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rush to make an immediate response (to school safety
concerns), rhetoric has won over common sense,'' said a blistering
report on zero tolerance by the Harvard Civil Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators point out that that zero tolerance pre-dates
Columbine, Paducah and Springfield. It goes back to the Reagan era
and ``just say no.''
</P>
<P>
   So we have instances like the high school boy who got suspended
for drug possession after he convinced a classmate to hand over
some over-the-counter pills when she was talking about suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick-thinking hero. But there's no time for reason in
Zero-T. Quick. Summon the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Galveston gun incident is the quintessence of what's wrong
with ``zero tolerance.'' Here you had a child who did exactly _
exactly _ what a child should do in a bizarre situation. Instead of
saying, ``We'll investigate this thing before disrupting his
schooling,'' school officials decided to disrupt first, then
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, they were safe. Technically, the little boy broke a
law. He brought a gun to school. Of course, he had no idea he was
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of treating him like a child, they treated him like a
police officer due an inquest.
</P>
<P>
   They call it zero tolerance. We should start talking about what
it's become, which is zero common sense.

 &HT;    Study suggests happiness improves health
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent article published in the journal of the American
Geriatrics Society, 2,300 Mexican Americans, age 65 and older,
participated in a study on the relationship between emotional
well-being _ happiness _ and physical health. The article also
examined their ability to maintain independence in activities of
daily living over the two-year study period.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were given questions reflecting their feelings
of present happiness, hopefulness for the future, self-esteem and
overall enjoyment of life. At the beginning, all subjects were
measured on their ability to perform daily routines such as
dressing themselves and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the study, researchers found those individuals who
had reported the most positively on the measures of emotional
wellness were less likely to have experienced declines in
activities of daily living. Higher levels of emotional well-being
were also significantly associated with faster walking speeds two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The positive affect, feelings of happiness and well-being,
seemed to protect individuals against physical decline in old age.
This association between emotional well-being and good health was
evident even after researchers controlled for variables such as
chronic diseases, weight, gender and education, and health habits
such as smoking and drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Several reasons were given for this positive association between
emotional well-being and improved physical health including the
possibility that positive affect could bolster the immune or
endocrine functions of those in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional well-being and good mental health may also be related
to such factors as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to accept unchangeable reality and make the most
of less than satisfactory situations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Possessing the ability to accept emotional support from others
and also provide empathy and care to those in need of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freedom from debilitating fears that reduce the ability to
change and be flexible when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perception of life as the opportunity to learn from experience
rather than focusing on failures and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Possessing the ability to develop and maintain satisfying
relationships with others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to recognize, label and experience the entire
range of human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to anticipate problems and avoid them when
possible, or cope with them if they do occur.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to manage emotional factors after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to see life's difficulties as challenges and
opportunities rather than threats and catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to find humor in difficult situations and laugh at
one's own human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be returning to this important topic of emotional wellness
in future columns.

daily living over the two-year study period.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were given questions reflecting their feelings
of present happiness, hopefulness for the future, self-esteem and
overall enjoyment of life. At the beginning, all subjects were
measured on their ability to perform daily routines such as
dressing themselves and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the study, researchers found those individuals who
had reported the most positively on the measures of emotional
wellness were less likely to have experienced declines in
activities of daily living. Higher levels of emotional well-being
were also significantly associated with faster walking speeds two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The positive affect, feelings of happiness and well-being,
seemed to protect individuals against physical decline in old age.
This association between emotional well-being and good health was
evident even after researchers controlled for variables such as
chronic diseases, weight, gender and education, and health habits
such as smoking and drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Several reasons were given for this positive association between
emotional well-being and improved physical health including the
possibility that positive affect could bolster the immune or
endocrine functions of those in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional well-being and good mental health may also be related
to such factors as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to accept unchangeable reality and make the most
of less than satisfactory situations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Possessing the ability to accept emotional support from others
and also provide empathy and care to those in need of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Freedom from debilitating fears that reduce the ability to
change and be flexible when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perception of life as the opportunity to learn from experience
rather than focusing on failures and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Possessing the ability to develop and maintain satisfying
relationships with others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to recognize, label and experience the entire
range of human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to anticipate problems and avoid them when
possible, or cope with them if they do occur.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to manage emotional factors after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to see life's difficulties as challenges and
opportunities rather than threats and catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to find humor in difficult situations and laugh at
one's own human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be returning to this important topic of emotional wellness
in future columns.

3-1 VICTORY OVER KUWAIT PUTS U.S. MEN INTO SOCCER QUARTERFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ There is no such thing as a golden boy in
sports. Too many bottles of peroxide have been dumped on too many
athletes' heads.
</P>
<P>
   So Landon Donovan's shining aura is not unique, even though he
was golden in igniting the United States to an unprecedented berth
in the Summer Games quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Kuwait
Tuesday night. The Americans have never been this far in the
history of Olympic soccer.
</P>
<P>
   They will play in Adelaide on Saturday evening against the team
that finishes second in Group D _ Japan, Brazil, South Africa or
Slovakia, all of them with different styles and physical makeups.
</P>
<P>
   The coach does not want this to develop into one of those raging
controversies all over the soccer-playing world when coaches seem
to go out of their way to sit players who can score goals. Lothar
Osiander, the coach of the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, went into
coaching gyrations to avoid using Steve Snow, who had scored in
five consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Charles, the man who decides whether Donovan runs or sits,
knew there were fans back in the States who were squawking over the
Internet when Donovan did not play against the Czech Republic or
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Czechs are just big,'' Charles said Tuesday night. ``And
those Cameroon guys just run right at you. But this game had Landon
Donovan written all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' Charles said. ``If we were playing
Czechoslovakia in the next game, he'd be sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who coaches both college men and woman at the
University of Portland in Oregon, and doubles as the national
under-23 coach, knows about the impetuosity of youth. He
understands that Donovan was getting antsy, being called back from
the soccer factory in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old gave up college and major league soccer to take
a $400,000 four-year contract and currently plays on the reserve
squad for Bayer Leverkusen in the German Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play in the first two U.S. games, both disappointing
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't kid you, I was disappointed,'' Donovan admitted
Tuesday night. ``I get some people saying, `You should be playing,'
but they're not part of the team. I know we have a lot of good
players, and I just want to be part of the program. I told myself,
`Quit being a baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game began in a driving rain, and Charles' own
college player, Conor Casey, a strapping forward, had trouble
planting his thick legs and moving his thick trunk. He was flopping
all over the wet grounds, as Charles displayed either genius or
overdue common sense _ depending on which chat room you are reading
_ and sent Donovan into the game in the 30th minute Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly kick-started the U.S. squad from a stolid state into
something approximating fluidity and grace and intuition, all
extremely un-American.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albright moved up and Donovan became an attacking
midfielder, finding seams that hadn't existed until he came into
the game. Albright missed a header, Ben Olsen was wide left,
Frankie Hejduk misplayed a Donovan backheel. And in the 40th
minute, Danny Califf headed in a corner kick from Jeff Agoos.
</P>
<P>
   The United States kept up the pressure in the second half, with
Albright digging out a goal between a defender and the goalkeeper
in the 63rd minute. Kuwait came back in the 83rd minute and scored
a goal by Najem Bader after a lovely run down the middle by Naser
Alotman. But in the 88th minute, Donovan and Josh Wolff staged a
crisp 2-on-1 fast break with Wolff giving the ball back to Donovan
for an easy tap goal. And afterward, Charles raved about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him, he was a skinny little kid with
talent,'' Charles recalled. ``We need to get him some experience
without the press saying, why isn't he playing. My job is to find
the best time to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that Landon Donovan does better than anybody
on the squad,'' Charles added. ``And there are things Landon
Donovan does not do better than anybody on the squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The third goal was Donovan's reward for surviving a bad case of
bench madness. But there are no guarantees he won't resume his
relationship with the bench on Saturday.

   TRAINER-GROUNDED (San Antonio) _ The Air Force has ordered the
T-6A Texan II grounded three weeks after one of the planes crashed
near here. The Texan II, introduced to the Air Force's inventory
four months ago, will be grounded while an engine oil coolant
system is replaced, said Dave Smith, a spokesman with the Air
Education and Training Command at Randolph AFB. There currently are
15 T-6s at Randolph. By SIG CHRISTENSON.

   CASINO-SHIP (Corpus Christi, Texas) _ U.S. immigration officers
are refusing to let more than 130 foreign-born crew members for a
new gambling ship come ashore, saying the Bahaman-registered vessel
must do more than make daily excursions off the Texas coast in
order to qualify as a cruise ship. If the ship would visit a
foreign port at least once every 29 days, its crew members would be
eligible for visas, which would permit them to come ashore, an INS

designer who this summer took the Council of Fashion Designers of
America's Perry Ellis Award for the best new talent. Varvatos'

   BRACELETS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Rubber-band bracelets are replacing
powerbeads as this fall's fashion-only accessory for the wrist. But
these aren't your ordinary desk-drawer variety. Instead, they're
rubber bands emblazoned with phrases like ``Snap Out Of It,'' ``I
Flunked Gym,''' a bar code with ``Human Being'' stamped beneath it

   VIDEO-MERMAID-REVIEW - ``The Little Mermaid II: Return to the

made-for-video _ `998's ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' _ the
original title character has grown up, wed and produced rebellious
offspring. In ``Mermaid II,'' due in stores Tuesday (Sept. 19),

created a whole new genre to cash in on his past: the tell-all

   OLY-WOMEN'S-WATER-POLO (Sydney, Australia) _ This is not to
suggest Maureen O'Toole is old, exactly, but she did join the U.S.
national women's water polo team at its inception, before several
current members of the squad were even born. She's been around long
enough to have retired twice and made as many comebacks. She's the
only player on the team able to be congratulated in victory and
consoled in defeat by her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly. By JOHN
CRUMPACKER.

   OLY-MEDIA (Sydney, Australia) _ There was a strange noise in the
Main Press Center the other day. It was a sharp tapping sound,

ancient device called a typewriter. Some people, apparently, still

But with all these uppity foreign opponents grabbing at their

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Despite her visibly failing health, Attorney
General Janet Reno may have the strongest shoulders of anyone in
Washington, D.C. Since being but the third choice of Bill Clinton
for that post in his cabinet in 1993, she has fended off rancorous

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In the early1800s, Thomas
Bowdler, an English doctor of medicine, as well as an accomplished

His intention was to buff the bard's deftly turned, but

   KELSO-COLUMN _ I've got this whole mess figured out. Univertsity
of Texas should have dumped Stanford off the football schedule

will range from the threat of chain stores to the future of books
themselves. ``The very definition of a book is changing,'' says Tom
Payton, president of Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the
lovingly composed, designed and printed paper artifact to that of
bits and bytes downloaded onto handheld readers.'' To deal with
some of these uncertainties, Payton and other members of the
Publishers Association of the South have arranged a quarterly
series of roundtable discussions open to the public. (O'Briant,

   SPANGLISH _ You've heard about ebonics, but what about
Splanglish, the English-Espanol hybrid that many Latinos here and

nothing wrong with creations of words like ``troca'' for ``truck''
instead of standard Spanish ``camion.'' We talk to everyday folks,
language experts and others about Spanglish, which is generating
debate, a college course at a northern school and a dictionary.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Despite her visibly failing health, Attorney
General Janet Reno may have the strongest shoulders of anyone in
Washington, D.C. Since being but the third choice of Bill Clinton

   IRVINE, Calif. _ Perhaps the most macho quip in Silicon Valley
history _ often attributed to that most macho of chip-industry
executives, Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices _ is ``Real men
own fabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The put-down referred to the growing semiconductor industry of
outsourced semiconductor production, often to offshore specialists,
who assumed the risks of maintaining fabrication facilities, or
fabs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody bothered telling Broadcom co-founder and CEO
Henry Nicholas that he's not a real man because his company makes
its money simply by designing and selling semiconductors, not by
making them. The weightlifting, three-piece-suited, goateed and
peripatetic CEO has taken his company from nearly nothing in 1997
to about a billion dollars in annualized sales and an astounding
$52 billion in market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom's ascendance as the company to beat in integrated
circuits for the communications industry is so complete that titan
Intel, the first strategic investor in Broadcom, is locked in
litigation with it over alleged patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas's willingness to leave the fabrication of his chips
to someone else comes at a price. The company, based in this
defense-industry suburban sprawl south of Los Angeles, produced
gross profits of 58 percent in the second quarter on revenues of
$245 million. Mighty Intel, the world's biggest maker of
microprocessors for PCs _ and it makes its own _ had gross margins
of 61 percent in the same period, on sales of $8.3 billion. (Intel,
by the way, runs the gold standard investor-relations Web site, a
role model for weaselly companies everywhere who talk about
shareholder relations but don't post the beefy information for all
to see.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some day, if Broadcom keeps getting bigger as it plans,
it just might find that controlling its own production destiny
could be the difference between success and failure. Nicholas, a
forceful man with whom it's best to disagree from a distance, begs
to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fabless model is the correct one,'' he says, after a
remarkably calm presentation here Saturday afternoon to a group of
technology-oriented business journalists. ``We have the ability to
remain fabless for the next five to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but what if you get so big that unlike today, you account
for, as you put it, a ``material'' portion of the world's
semiconductor production, a goal you've pegged with a five-year
time frame?
</P>
<P>
   ``I succeed through my customers,'' says Nicholas, naming 3Com,
Cisco and Nortel, though he also ought to have named Motorola,
which earlier this year purchased major Broadcom customer General
Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian foundries on whom Broadcom relies _ TSMC of Taiwan and
Chartered Semiconductor of Singapore,'' will have to succeed
through us.''
</P>
<P>
   General audiences like to hear Nicholas wax philosophical about
technology because he has all the geeky candlepower of a Bill Gates
but with the rich, he-man savoir faire of a Ted Turner. He jokes
that he can make the same PowerPoint presentation last 20 minutes
or six hours, and he promotes a vision with absolute certainty of
where the communications industry is going.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he scoffs at notions that DSL, the high-speed
Internet connection through phone lines, soon will trump cable
modems, the technology on which Broadcom has achieved its early
advantage. ``They're all dead,'' he says, predicting that the
``cable network processor'' Broadcom is producing will provide the
``gateway'' to all kinds of broadband. Hmm, that sounds a lot like
what Mory Ejabat is doing at privately held Zhone Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Intel, Nicholas suggests that you won't ever see him
played for a fool by losing his temper with a prosecutor _ or a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest challenges I've had emotionally as a CEO
is trying to divorce myself from oral judgments,'' says the
40-year-old executive. I think what he means is that it's tough to
keep his trap shut regarding Intel, but he's getting the hang of
it. He takes his jabs, saying the unwarranted lawsuit is ``one of
the many tools at their disposal to achieve their business
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly points out his ``enormous respect for Intel,''
mentioning the chip giant's role as an early investor and current
role as a Broadcom customer.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas also might have pointed out that this sort of thing is
common in the chip industry. Indeed, three long years ago young
Broadcom sued a company called Sarnoff Cooperation, now NxtWave
Communications, alleging ``breach of contract, fraud,
misappropriation of trade secrets,'' and other nasty miscellany.
Lower courts ruled against Broadcom, and the case now is on appeal,
according to Broadcom's latest quarterly report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how familiar Broadcom is with the litigation process,
its investors aren't pleased by Intel's attack. Broadcom's stock,
at a recent $232, is off about 8 percent from where it was Aug. 30,
when Intel sued. Investors are right to be peeved because this type
of litigation ends up being a lot of wasteful breast-beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, because these guys will be warring
factions,'' says Mark Edelstone, chip analyst for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, a Broadcom bull who was in his role when his firm led
Broadcom's initial public offering. ``At the end of the day,
there'll be a lot of blood spilled and they'll end up
cross-licensing each other, just like everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least in the process the owner of fabs and the fabless
wonder will get to prove their manhood.

   ``It's unfortunate, because these guys will be warring
factions,'' says Mark Edelstone, chip analyst for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, a Broadcom bull who was in his role when his firm led
Broadcom's initial public offering. ``At the end of the day,
there'll be a lot of blood spilled and they'll end up
cross-licensing each other, just like everybody else does.''

3-1 VICTORY OVER KUWAIT PUTS U.S. MEN INTO SOCCER QUARTERFINALS

   MELBOURNE, Australia _ There is no such thing as a golden boy in
sports. Too many bottles of peroxide have been dumped on too many
athletes' heads.
</P>
<P>
   So Landon Donovan's shining aura is not unique, even though he
was golden in igniting the United States to an unprecedented berth
in the Summer Games quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Kuwait
Tuesday night. The Americans have never been this far in the
history of Olympic soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fifth victory for an American men's soccer team
in 25 games (5-12-8) in 12 Olympic appearances dating to 1924. The
United States will play in Adelaide on Saturday evening against the
team that finishes second in Group D _ Japan, Brazil, South Africa
or Slovakia, all of them with different styles and physical
makeups.
</P>
<P>
   The coach does not want this to develop into one of those raging
controversies all over the soccer-playing world when coaches seem
to go out of their way to sit players who can score goals. Lothar
Osiander, the coach of the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, went into
coaching gyrations to avoid using Steve Snow, who had scored in
five consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Charles, the man who decides whether Donovan runs or sits,
knew there were fans back in the States who were squawking over the
Internet when Donovan did not play against the Czech Republic or
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Czechs are just big,'' Charles said Tuesday night. ``And
those Cameroon guys just run right at you. But this game had Landon
Donovan written all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' Charles said. ``If we were playing
Czechoslovakia in the next game, he'd be sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who coaches both college men and woman at the
University of Portland in Oregon, and doubles as the national
under-23 coach, knows about the impetuosity of youth. He
understands that Donovan was getting antsy, being called back from
the soccer factory in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old gave up college and major league soccer to take
a $400,000 four-year contract and currently plays on the reserve
squad for Bayer Leverkusen in the German Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play in the first two U.S. games, both disappointing
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't kid you, I was disappointed,'' Donovan admitted
Tuesday night. ``I get some people saying, `You should be playing,'
but they're not part of the team. I know we have a lot of good
players, and I just want to be part of the program. I told myself,
`Quit being a baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game began in a driving rain, and Charles' own
college player, Conor Casey, a strapping forward, had trouble
planting his thick legs and moving his thick trunk. He was flopping
all over the wet grounds, as Charles displayed either genius or
overdue common sense _ depending on which chat room you are reading
_ and sent Donovan into the game in the 30th minute Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly kick-started the U.S. squad from a stolid state into
something approximating fluidity and grace and intuition, all
extremely un-American.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albright moved up and Donovan became an attacking
midfielder, finding seams that hadn't existed until he came into
the game. Albright missed a header, Ben Olsen was wide left,
Frankie Hejduk misplayed a Donovan backheel. And in the 40th
minute, Danny Califf headed in a corner kick from Jeff Agoos.
</P>
<P>
   The United States kept up the pressure in the second half, with
Albright digging out a goal between a defender and the goalkeeper
in the 63rd minute. Kuwait came back in the 83rd minute and scored
a goal by Najem Bader after a lovely run down the middle by Naser
Alothman. But in the 88th minute, Donovan and Josh Wolff staged a
crisp 2-on-1 fast break with Wolff giving the ball back to Donovan
for an easy tap goal. And afterward, Charles raved about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him, he was a skinny little kid with
talent,'' Charles recalled. ``We need to get him some experience
without the press saying, why isn't he playing. My job is to find
the best time to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that Landon Donovan does better than anybody
on the squad,'' Charles added. ``And there are things Landon
Donovan does not do better than anybody on the squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The third goal was Donovan's reward for surviving a bad case of
bench madness. But there are no guarantees he won't resume his
relationship with the bench on Saturday.

&HT;     WB'S `GROSSE POINTE' IS HEAVY WITH SATIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people write provocative books, others spill their guts to
the tabs. In Hollywood, slinging dirt is an Olympic-caliber sport.
</P>
<P>
   But executive producer Darren Star, late of ``Beverly Hills
90210'' and ``Melrose Place,'' has created a whole new genre to
cash in on his past: the tell-all sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe'' is at once a real Michigan town, a fictional
prime-time teen soap opera and a new WB comedy (premiering at 8:30
p.m. EDT Friday) following the off-camera machinations of a
twentysomething cast, all of whom play teens on the
soap-within-the-soap.
</P>
<P>
   If these characters seem familiar _ the golden boy who's going
bald, his stoned co-star, the blond bombshell, the insecure waif
and the mother of all rhymes-with-witches _ they should. After all,
we're talking about those lovable ex-kids from ``90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Satire can be very cold, and very funny.
</P>
<P>
   What drives this comedy (mercifully without a laugh track) is
its behind-the-scenes quality, a television conceit employed
effectively over the years (``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``The
Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' etc.). But what's
really interesting here is what happened behind the scenes of
``Grosse Pointe'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   The portrayal of one young star, Marcy Sternfeld (Lindsay
Sloane), hit a little too close to one of the WB's biggest players.
In the original ``Grosse Pointe'' pilot, Sternfeld was an insecure
girl _ with an eating disorder and multiple plastic surgeries in
her past _ who got the soap job only because of her dad, a powerful
television executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, we're talking Tori Spelling. And dad Aaron Spelling, the
executive producer of ``90210'' who hired his daughter, wasn't
happy.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Spelling described how Tori saw the original pilot
and ``cried and cried and cried.'' Daddy stepped in, which is a
noble thing to do; it helps when Daddy is among the most prolific
producers in television history and has two shows on the network
(``7th Heaven'' and ``Charmed'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren knows how I feel,'' said Papa Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the way they depicted my daughter. If you like
laughing at real people, is that funny?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never called the network for changes,'' he said. ``I talked
to Darren.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie Kellner, the chief executive of the WB, said Spelling
made a personal appeal to him to tone down the Tori-esque
character. ``He felt that it was too on-the-nose, and I agreed with
him,'' Kellner said. (Let the obvious Tori's-nose joke go.)
</P>
<P>
   The nepotism angle has been edited out, along with a scene that
shows Sternfeld, uh, purging. ``I'm not easily letting it go,''
Star said in July.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the scenes in, he added, wasn't ``worth fighting to the
point of ... perhaps not seeing the show on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   `'We're losing some good jokes, but they'll be replaced with
other jokes that are better,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some funny stuff was left. A kid in a wheelchair blackmails his
way into a speaking role on the show after seeing the Luke
Perry-ish young star (Kohl Sudduth) without his toupee. The other
male lead (Al Santos), who suggests a more burned-out version of
Jason Priestly, is a vacuous surfer who's always on the make for
women but is oblivious to the come-ons from his soap-opera dad. Of
course, the female lead (Irene Malloy) is the nastiest thing ever
to disgrace a set _ an homage to pre-reformed Shannen Doherty. The
Jennie Garth-ish blonde (Bonnie Somerville) is the naive newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tori-like Sternfeld is still a neurotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love myself. I love myself,'' she tells herself as she
drives on the set. ``I only eat healthy food, I only eat healthy
food.'' Then she wolfs down a cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   Star said ``Grosse Pointe'' isn't just a parody of ``90210'' but
of the whole nighttime soap genre, and the practice of
twentysomethings playing teens. No offense to anyone in particular,
he pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Add the wink-wink here. Hey, satire is not only supposed to be
funny but also hurt, founded in a specific reality. ``Grosse
Pointe,'' unless it wimps out, will draw blood, and maybe an
audience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Erika Lenkert and Beth LaDove learned that
the Redwood Room of the Clift Hotel was about to be dismantled,
``It was the proverbial last straw.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco natives, the women and their pals had grown weary
watching beautiful and essential elements of San Francisco
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime we met, someone would have some new real estate
horror story or tell about another longtime San Francisco business
or building that was suddenly gone,'' LaDove said. ``When Erika
found out about the Redwood Room, it was like, 'No. No. No. This
just can't happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the quick action and diligence of these two
30-somethings, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day before most of the Redwood Room was headed for the
auction block, the owners of the Clift withdrew from the sale
everything that has made the 66-year-old Art Deco lounge an
international legend. Thus, last week, when thousands of items from
the soon-to-be-remodeled hotel were auctioned off, the following
were NOT among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Four huge and luscious Gustav Klimt prints that have hung
majestically through three decades of martini and manhattan
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Breathtaking Art Deco chandeliers that adorn the room's
22-foot ceiling, matching wall sconces and the magnificent double
etched-brass front doors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The original bar. Made of redwood burl and Italian marble, it
is 75 feet long and fitted with brass elephant heads whose trunks
secure the elbow rail.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood Room was designed by the same architect who created
San Francisco's stunning War Memorial Opera House. It belongs to a
handful of fabled American hotel bars _ the New York Plaza's Oak
Room and the Beverly Hills' Polo Lounge _ that still manage to make
one drink feel like a graceful, cultured event.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clift general manager Tim McEneny now insists, ``We
don't want to tear up that room, we want to be good neighbors,''
recent history dictates caution.
</P>
<P>
   Had Lenkert not stopped in on the very day the bar's veteran
staff learned its jobs were essentially kaput, those Klimts might
be enroute to some Saudi oil sheik's palace.
</P>
<P>
   As author of the Frommer Guide ``Walking Tour of San
Francisco,'' Lenkert visited the Clift on Aug. 20 to update her
section on the Redwood Room. She was stunned to learn that the bar
would be closed until next summer for major remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing department told me that the room was going to
remain intact. But I was suspicious,'' Lenkert said.
</P>
<P>
   Good instincts. The Clift's owner, Ian Schrager Hotels LLC, is
known for hyper-trendy, celebrity-magnet sleeperies like the
Mondrian in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager's favorite designer, the minimalist-chic Philippe
Starck, appears to be allergic to the Redwood Room's style of
dense, dark, deco substance.
</P>
<P>
   So, posing as a flush dot-commer hungry for exotic bargains,
Lenkert contacted the company that handled the Clift auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it was all hush-hush because the Clift owners
were afraid San Franciscans would get upset, but that, yes, the bar
and the Klimts would be part of the sale,'' Lenkert said. ``I just
stumbled onto this in the nick of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenkert and LaDove began to get the word out. They morphed
LaDove's business Web site into a Redwood Room rescue site, formed
San Franciscans for Saving the Redwood Room, conducted civilized
cocktail teach-ins at the bar and won support from the Art Deco
Society of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Erika nor I went into this with anger,'' LaDove said.
``At first it was more like, 'Let's pay our respects.' The Redwood
Room is such a special place, we couldn't let it just slip away
without a proper burial. But then the outpouring of support was
just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the women and Art Deco Society founder Michael
Crowe were invited to meet with the Clift's architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very considerate of them and they promised to forward
our requests to their New York office,'' Lenkert said. ``But my
sense is, if we don't keep this issue before the public eye and
encourage the architects to retain the original integrity of the
room, it will look very different when it reopens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a no-growth Luddite, LaDove says she and Lenkert
recognize that ``change makes a city vital; you don't want to
preserve it in a bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   But residency for awhile in Venice, Italy, showed LaDove
something else: When a city becomes a theme park of itself,
unaffordable to the people who work there, it begins to die from
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the diversity that has made San Francisco great _ diverse
people, economics, architecture _ has to be protected,'' LaDove
said.

&HT;     IT'S A STRETCH, BUT RUBBER BANDS ARE A FASHION FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The concept is simple enough to fit into the
``Why didn't I think of that?'' category. In fact, it's quite
literally a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber-band bracelets are replacing powerbeads as this fall's
fashion-only accessory for the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't ordinary desk-drawer variety. Instead, they're
rubber bands emblazoned with phrases like ``Snap Out Of It,'' ``I
Flunked Gym,'' a bar code with ``Human Being'' stamped beneath it
and _ one of the more popular _ ``What Would Scooby Doo?'' The
bands (which retail for $2 or less) come in a every shade of the
rainbow, and some even glow in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the anti-fashion statement,'' said Maria Vrachnos,
manager of the LReport.com, an on-line youth-trend tracking report.
``It's one of the hottest things currently on the teen fashion
front.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the bracelets' popularity as a reaction to high jewelry
prices and over-accessorized looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bracelets are at the opposite end of the luxurious fashion
scene,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the mundane into a signature item isn't a new fashion
concept. Teens already wear pacifiers around their necks or
airplane seatbelts to hold up baggy pants; but unlike those trends,
the appeal of the stretchy bracelets has reached beyond the teen
market.
</P>
<P>
   Professional basketball stars Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O'Neal
sport them for good luck. Garnett can often be seen snapping the
blue loop on his wrist to remind himself to play harder. Janet
Jackson has also been spotted wearing one that has ``Joy'' written
in Chinese. Minnesota wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura, who
used to wear a feathered boa into the ring, now wears a bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion giants are snapping to attention, too. Giorgio Armani
ordered 60,000 bands inscribed with his Emporio Armani logo and a
word (``love,'' ``joy'' or ``happiness'') to put in his 1999
holiday greeting cards. Geoffrey Beene, designer of Regis Philbin's
monochromatic clothing line, is packaging his shirts with gray
bands that say ``stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Target store in the Albany suburb of Colonie can't keep up
with the demand. ``They come and they go as fast as we restock
them,'' said Shamecca Phillips, who works in the accessories
department, where the bracelets come in packages of five for $3.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mostly popular among young girls, but we had a man who
bought four packages,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Ave Green owns P. Puff Industries in St. Paul, Minn., the small
wholesale company that created and distributes Wordstretch
products, the original rubber-band bracelet line. Since the
company's inception in 1998, he said, P. Puff has sold 9 million
bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the accessory popped into Green's head in December
1998 as she was driving from California to Minnesota. She'd spotted
a man in Los Angeles wearing a plain, black rubber band as jewelry;
traveling cross-country, she saw one of the ubiquitous ``WWJD''
(``What Would Jesus Do?'') fabric bracelets for sale at a rest
stop. She combined the two and came up with Wordstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of reinventing an item you have in your house
and office and at the grocery store and making it new,'' Green
said. ``I showed them to friends, and they said it was a great
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sales grew from local specialty stores to national boutiques
and chains.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Green's career as a rubber-band mogul might be
Wordstetch's recent design of the official bracelets for the U.S.
Olympic basketball team. The gold bands have ``Dream Team 2000''
stamped on one side and ``Nothing Less Than Gold'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is competing in the
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. He is a regular Wordstretch
customer, and sported a rubber-band bracelet in Friday's opening
ceremonies; on the court, he will be wearing a specially designed
bracelet that reads ``KG 10.'' Garnett's other favorite bracelet
mottoes are ``Don't Harsh My Mellow'' and ``Life Is Sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bracelets are infused with special emollients so the rubber
doesn't tug at delicate arm hair. Needless to say, they're designed
to leave room for circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue bracelets are hot,'' Green said, ``but blue fingers from
blood blockage are not.''
</P>
<P>
   She ought to put that on a bracelet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ There was a strange noise in the Main Press
Center the other day. It was a sharp tapping sound, familiar in a
dim sort of way. What was it?
</P>
<P>
   I walked in the direction of the sound. It turned out to be a
man hunched over an ancient device called a typewriter. Some
people, apparently, still disseminate information with this archaic
machine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the same people who get their butter from a churn,
their milk from an actual cow and their entertainment from a barn
dance. I never knew there were so many Amish reporters here at
Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The helpful folks of Sydney's organizing committee (SOCOG) loan
out typewriters for those not touched by the computer age.
Available are typewriters, two each, with characters in English,
Spanish, German, Russian and French.
</P>
<P>
   Once these vintage scribes type up their reports, they hand them
to a SOCOG volunteer who faxes them off at the very modern price of
$5 per page.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day a man came up with about 20 pages hand-written,''
volunteer Cheryl Dodd of Detroit said. ``It was a $140
transmission. When you tell them it's $5 a page it's not shocking.
They don't balk at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost charming in this Internet age to come upon someone
hunkered over a typewriter, pounding away at the keyboard, then
ripping out the page to admire all the misspellings and xxxxxx's
through the various errors.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a man walked up to the help desk to fax a page
that had blackouts and arcane symbols from an age when a person
known as a typesetter understood what they meant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a typewritten page faxed off to its destination is
preferable to dictating over the phone. At the 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona I had to dictate a soccer story on deadline because I
was, and still am, an idiot when it comes to understanding the
technology given to me.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dictation is the only way to file a story.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, the insane women's
figure skating duel between good girl Nancy Kerrigan and bad girl
Tonya Harding took place late at night in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was early afternoon on America's West Coast, I had a
chance to get the story in the day's final edition. So there I was,
listening to the smart guys on Eurosport describing salchows and
toe loops and dictating what I heard back home. Made the deadline,
too.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Malcolm X theory of getting a story in _ by any means
necessary. Including those noisy typewriters.

SAN FRANCISCO _  FRITES  _ Crisp french fries _ they're the perfect

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; LEARN-CURRY &LR;  _ The other day I was browsing
through a paper about food where the author commented that one
should only cook contemporary dishes, not old-fashioned recipes. I
immediately took exception. In my view, the only two categories for
recipes are good ones and bad one. One of my favorite old-fashioned
recipes is a very good quick-and-easy curry that is perfect for
using up leftover meat.

 Best Way: Making French Fries   By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Making french fries at home is a commitment of
time and resources. But when you do choose to make them, here's the
method we found works best:
<P>
   _ Soak the fries in water before cooking them. This removes
excess starch from the outside of the potatoes and keeps them from
sticking together when frying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fry the potatoes in a two-step process. It's far superior than
frying them just once. Blanch them in a lower temperature oil to
ensure the centers are cooked, then fry them again at a higher
temperature for a crispy exterior.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, freeze the fries between the two cooking processes.
That makes them crisper still, and they hold that crispness longer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Scrub or peel russet potatoes and cut them into 1/4- to
1/2-inch-thick batons. Place the potatoes in a large bowl of water
and let them stand for 1 hour. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Pour enough peanut or canola oil into a large deep pot to come
to a depth of at least 4 inches. Heat the oil to 275 degrees. Add
the potatoes to the oil, in batches if you're doing a lot, and fry
them for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they're
tender, but not colored. Transfer the fries to paper towels and
drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the fries in a single layer on baking sheets and place
in the freezer for at least 2 hours, or until they are frozen
solid. At this point, the fries may be transferred to plastic
freezer bags and stored in the freezer for up to one month.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, pour oil into a large deep pot to a depth
of at least 4 inches. (You may strain and use the oil from the
first frying if you finish the fries the same day. Otherwise, use
fresh oil.) Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Carefully place the frozen
fries into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, working in
batches if you're doing a lot. Drain the fries on paper towels.
Season with salt and serve.

 At the Source: By the Light of the Moon: Springhill Farm grows 
 potatoes using an ancient method   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 PETALUMA, Calif. _  Farmers tend to be down-to-earth people _ no
pun intended. Increasingly, though, they are also scientifically
minded, using the latest agricultural research to produce better
and bigger crops.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Peter certainly possesses both these qualities. Yet, the
Sonoma County potato farmer might at times seem moonstruck, saying
there is wisdom in the ancient potato growers' tradition of
planting during the new moon and harvesting when the moon is full.
</P>
<P>
   Superstition? Not really. The practice, he explains, is based on
the belief that when moonlight is absent the soil contains more
moisture, and when the moon is full, the soil is drier. Dry soil is
best for planting; moist soil, for harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   The moisture content of the soil is particularly crucial in
dry-farming, the old-fashioned approach Peter learned from his
father, Virgil, and which he credits with the exceptional quality
of his Springhill Farm potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   To a city slicker, dry-farming sounds like a time saver since
there's no need to install and maintain irrigation systems.
Actually, it is a labor-intensive way to grow potatoes. The soil
must be worked deeply every week for three weeks to bring ground
water to the surface to help the young potatoes start growing. As
the soil drys over time, the plants are forced to send their roots
deeper, which is beneficial to the final product.
</P>
<P>
   The location of Peter's 320-acre farm, about halfway between
Petaluma and Tomales, brings it additional moisture from ocean fog.
At times, however, there can be too much of a good thing _ this
year an early crop was wiped out by three inches of unseasonal June
rain.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Peter is back at the many farmers' markets where his
potatoes and cheeses have a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   Springhill cheeses _ several cheddars and jack cheeses as well
as fresh curd and the recently added St. George Portuguese-style
cheese _ come from the milk of cows that graze on the land. Calves
also get to feast on any potatoes not fit to go to market.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is gourmet fare. Springhill produces a bewildering
variety of potatoes, including the familiar russet but also the
German Butterball, Red Lasoda, Oregon Blue and two kinds of
fingerlings _ Russian banana and Ruby Crescent, a tiny pink-tinged
spud that, Peter says, ``tastes like an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes are Peter's birthright. His parents farmed vegetables
near Petaluma, eventually concentrating on potatoes. He is also
descended from Irish potato farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days at farmers' markets, Peter used to make chips
and french fries. He has gotten too busy for that, he says,
especially with the addition of cheesemaking to his farm
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not too busy to indulge another of his hobbies,
hosting farm days where as many as 3,500 children a year get a
first-hand taste of the business _ digging potatoes, milking cows
and, starting next month, scarfing up homemade ice cream while
exploring Springhill's pumpkin patch.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Springhill Farm, 4235 Springhill Road (between Seavey and &LR; 
 &LR; Purvine roads), Petaluma; (707) 762-3446. The farm's potatoes &LR; 
 &LR; and cheeses are sold year-round at the Saturday Ferry Plaza &LR; 
 &LR; Farmers' Market in San Francisco, as well as farmers' markets &LR;   &LR; in
Santa Rosa, Sonoma, Novato and at Marin Civic Center. &LR;

 Food Lovers' Walks: Strolling Mountain View Brings a World of 
 Tastes  By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _  &LR; Anyone who goes hungry at lunch time in
downtown Mountain View has to be either dead broke, or a rabid
culinary xenophobe.
<P>
   Even ignoring fast-food outlets, you can have lunch for as
little as $3.95 (at  &UR; Kamei Japanese House &LR; ), and easily a dozen
restaurants offer all-you-can-eat buffets for $6.95. As to the
xenophobia: Again ignoring fast-food outlets, there is not an awful
lot of food here that would qualify as standard American.
</P>
<P>
   But if you like Asian noodle-house fare, Mongolian barbecue or a
Szechuan, Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Vietnamese, Italian, French,
Irish, Mexican, Filipino or Indian food, you're in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   If picking a nationality has you in a quandary, peruse the bill
of fare at sleek  &UR; Global Village Cafe &LR; , where you can travel to
Japan (sort of) with an ahi napoleon with wasabi cr &LR; e &LR; me fraiche;
make a Louisiana purchase with a Cajun shrimp cocktail, or visit
France via a Ni &LR; c &LR; oise salad. There is even an all-American
cheeseburger with fries in case you get homesick.
</P>
<P>
   There are other options for those times when your taste buds
point toward Indiana more than India.  &UR; Le Boulanger &LR; , the bakery
cum lunch room chain, serves hefty sandwiches and good salads.
Theirs is essentially American lunch fare _ especially if you
consider pizza American food.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiches, salads or pizza can also be expected at any place
that has the word ``bar'' in its name. At  &UR; Kapp's Pizza Bar &AMP; &LR; 
 &UR; Grill &LR;  the cleverly named pizzas (Wild West with barbecued chicken)
are supplemented by burgers, a few sandwiches and a couple of
meal-size salads.
</P>
<P>
   And you can't get much more down-to-earth American than at
 &UR; Tied House &LR; , a large brew pub with assertive beers and food to
match. On nice days, the trellised patio is an alternative to the
large, industrial/ country hangout favored by nearby tech industry
workers.  &UR; Vivaca &LR; 
 &UR; Grill &LR; , with its super-discreet minimalist decor, includes
sandwiches and a burger and fries in its California cuisine menu at
lunch.  &UR; Fibber McGee's &LR; , one of three Irish bars on the 200 block
of Castro, throws the likes of steak and mushroom pie and Irish
sausage and mash into the ethnic mix.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is a pleasant street. Trees line the sidewalks, and there
is an abundance of flowers in stone planters with built-in benches,
so you are never far from a place to sit down and enjoy the cup of
coffee or the gelato that fuels you on your stroll. (Try  &UR; Gelato
Classico &LR;  for a great selection).
</P>
<P>
   A food walk here is mainly an exploration of restaurants, which
are so numerous we would have to publish a mini version of the
Yellow Pages to mention them all.
</P>
<P>
   In the 200 block of Castro alone, there are three Indian
restaurants:  &UR; Dawat &LR;   &UR; Indian Cuisine &LR; ;  &UR; Maharaja &LR; , which features
northern Indian food and is particularly known for its well-spiced
vegetarian dishes; and  &UR; Sue's Indian Cuisine &LR; , a small restaurant
decorated with bright paintings by the owner.
</P>
<P>
   All three offer $6.95 lunch buffets. These buffet offerings are
varied and generally well executed, though it might be advisable to
consider them primarily for an early meal. By the time lunch hour
ends at 2:30 p.m., these dishes have probably been kept warm for
three-plus hours.
</P>
<P>
   For a more upscale Indian lunch, you'd have to take a pretty
long hike from the end of Castro Street along El Camino Real.
Better to drive five minutes _ it's well worth it.  &UR; Amber India &LR; 
 &UR; Restaurant &LR;  is acclaimed for one of the Bay Area's best Indian
kitchens. This buffet ($11.50 a person) is frequently replenished,
so the food is fresh and attractive, even at 2 p.m. Standouts
include lemony potato curry and the restaurant's signature dish,
butter chicken, an addictive concoction of boneless chicken in a
complex sauce that balances hot and sweet spices with tomato,
butter, cream and a touch of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Back downtown, an attractive choice among the many Chinese
restaurants are lunch specials at  &UR; Hangen Szechuan Restaurant &LR; , a
cheery place with an off-white and green color scheme. There's a
business lunch and a vegetarian lunch at $5.95, plus an ``executive
lunch'' for $6.95, all with soup and rice.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants pay homage to the area's agreeable weather with
outdoor service. The cheek-by-jowl restaurants in the 100 block of
Castro ( &UR; Florentine &LR;  Italian,  &UR; Amarin Thai &LR; , the whimsically named
 &UR; Thai-Rific &LR;  and more) share attractive sidewalk seating, and down
the street,  &UR; Valley Bar &AMP; Grill &LR;  has an umbrella-dotted patio
that's as inviting for consuming a cold brew as it is for the
popular weekend brunches.
</P>
<P>
   Should the skies be gray,  &UR; Fiesta del Mar Too &LR;  can put you in a
sunny mood. Service is among the friendliest in this friendly town;
the selection of dishes _ with an emphasis on seafood _ caters to
many tastes, and the decor and furnishings are as bright and
cheerful as a pinata.
</P>
<P>
   For light refreshments,  &UR; Printers Inc &LR; . has a mezzanine cafe
with great coffee drinks, sandwiches, lasagne and sweets. This book
store doesn't carry many cookbooks, but neighboring
 &UR; BookBuyers &LR;  makes up for that. The selection of both new and used
titles can keep any food-lover browsing for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   For something to take along on your stroll,  &UR; Hong Kong Bakery &LR; 
has cream horns and all manner of other baked goodies, but the main
draw are excellent steamed pork, chicken or vegetables buns. They
are huge, ungreasy and just 85 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   For serious Asian shopping, don't miss the  &UR; New Castro Market &LR; 
in the next block. It's filled with Asian noodles, condiments and a
huge freezer case full of hot pot base, frozen red bean paste buns,
cuttlefish balls and more. The service meat and fish counters are
stocked with a vast array (chicken feet; yard-long silvery belt
fish), and tanks hold live tilapia, black bass, mussels, clams and
oysters.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to end your stroll on a charming note, head down an
unmarked alley to 180 Castro Street and &UR; Lucy's Tea House &LR;  (it's
actually just off Wild Cherry alley, which runs parallel to
Castro). Tea snacks like tea-flavored eggs make for delicious,
inexpensive noshing, and you'll find an amazing variety of both hot
and chilled drinks that may turn out to be just your cup of tea.

 Wine Potpourri: Older Cabs Are Still Going Strong  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; One of the problems with making wine is you never
know what you're going to get. Nature doesn't always cooperate and
the fruits of your labor take years before they show their worth.
<P>
   That's why when winemakers have a chance to look at a group of
wines from two different great vintages they find the time, even in
the midst of harvest. That's what they did earlier this month at
the 25th anniversary celebration of Niebaum-Coppola winery in Napa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Francis Ford Coppola and winemaker Scott McLeod gathered a
dozen top Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines, six each from the Napa
Valley and Bordeaux, from 1985 and 1995, two excellent vintages.
The aim of the tasting, McLeod explained, was to ``follow great
properties over two vintages a decade apart and to witness
stylistic similarities and differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The California wines were Niebaum-Coppola Rubicon, Joseph Phelps
Insignia, Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard and Trailside Vineyard
(Martha's was not made in 1995), Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon
Reserve, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 and Chateau Montelena
Cabernet Sauvignon. Bordeaux chateaux included Margaux, Haut Brion,
Lafite Rothschild, Leoville-Las-Cases, Lynch-Bages and
Pichon-Lalande.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting wines when you know their identity can taint your
judgment, but it also allows the taster to work background
information and past tasting experiences of the same wine into the
matrix of tasting.
</P>
<P>
   I had not tasted many of the 1985 wines for some time, but found
them all to be holding nicely, with bright fresh fruit, good
balance and only the slightest taint of oxidation in a few wines.
</P>
<P>
   The Bordeaux wines in general showed greater finesse and better
balance and consistency than their California counterparts. While
both sets of wines changed with time in the glass, with the Napa
wines showing some improvement, the Bordeaux wines held fast to
their level of excellent balance and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The standout among the 1985s was Chateau Pichon-Lalande, a
consistently excellent wine from Pauillac. It was elegant, soft and
lush with great texture and length; a complete wine in every sense.
Not far behind was the concentrated well-rounded Stag's Leap Cask
23. These two wines show why Cabernet is considered by many wine
collectors to be the King of Red Wines, and also why we as
consumers are drinking red wines too young.
</P>
<P>
   I also liked the powerful Lafite-Rotchschild, the tannic but
elegant Chateau Montelena and the unusual Chateau Haut-Brion, with
its impeccable balance and stand-above-the-crowd idiosyncratic
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   All of these wines have long ago been sold out at the winery,
but many are still available, albeit at high prices, in select wine
stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALS Wine Auction &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Diane Winokur of San Francisco and the Napa Valley
have formed a partnership with Winebid.com to raise funds to
support research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and the formation
of the ALS Center at the University of California at San Francisco.
The Winokurs lost their son, Douglas, to ALS two years ago. Wine
auctions will take place online through Winebid.com, starting Oct.
12 and lasting through Dec. 7. Proceeds from the sale of each lot
will go to the operation of the center.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the auctions, log on to Winebid.com or
contact Diane Winokur at (415) 421-6486.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cork Harvest &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cork Supply USA, the nation's largest provider of natural cork
for wine stoppers, reports that the combined cork output from
Portugal and Spain, the two largest cork producing countries,
should yield 250,000 tons of cork bark, an increase from last year.
Cork Supply USA president, Jochen Michalski, says that winemakers
can look forward to a stable supply of wine corks due to another
good year for the cork harvest.

 Learning to Cook: Old-Fashioned Recipes Rule in This Kitchen  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The other day I was browsing through a paper about
food where the author (or the cook who wrote the piece) commented
that one should only cook contemporary dishes, not old-fashioned
recipes.
<P>
   I immediately took exception. In my view, the only two
categories for recipes are good ones and bad ones, and the only way
to find out which is which is to test them by cooking. People
cannot cook in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite old-fashioned recipes is a very good
quick-and-easy curry that is perfect for using up leftover meat.
All you need (to serve four) is 2 cups of leftover chicken, pork,
lamb or beef. You could make a vegetarian version using cubed
eggplant or small chunks of new potato.
</P>
<P>
   Steamed white rice is the usual accompaniment for curry. Cook
twice as much as you need so you can have it as a helpful leftover
for the following couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; HURRY CURRY
</P>
<P>
   Curry powder is found in the spice section of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   1 firm apple
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup golden raisins (optional)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups chicken broth or water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cubed leftover cooked beef, lamb, chicken or pork
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To prepare the onions, meat and apple: &LR;  Using a paring
knife, peel off the papery skin from the onions. Then using a
chef's knife, cut off the stem top and root bottom of the onions.
Cut each onion in half from stem to root end. Put the onion halves
flat-side down on a cutting board and cut lengthwise from the stem
end to root end in 1/4-inch-thick slices. Holding the slices
together, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch dice. Put the onions in a
bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the apple and cut into 4 or 5 wedges, leaving just the
apple core (discard the core). Cut each apple wedge into 1/2-inch
chunks. Add the optional raisins to the apples. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the curry sauce: &LR;  Put the broth into a small saucepan
and place over medium-high heat until hot. Turn off the heat and
let the pan sit on the burner while you start your sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the flour and curry powder. Put the butter into a
21/2-quart saucepan. Turn the heat on low and stand right there
while the butter melts. (Butter can burn quickly and you don't want
this to happen.) Tilt the skillet so the butter coats the bottom of
the pan. Sprinkle the flour-curry powder mixture over the butter
and, using a large spoon, stir constantly all over the pan so the
ingredients get well blended. Slowly add the hot broth to the
butter mixture, stirring constantly so the mixture blends well.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the heat to medium, but don't stop stirring, you want a
smooth creamy sauce. Stir in the onions and salt. Taste and add
more if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Add the meat and apple mixture and continue to stir and cook for
a few more minutes until the meat is thoroughly heated. Transfer to
a serving dish and take to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; STEAMED RICE
</P>
<P>
   Cook the rice while you are making the curry.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the water and salt in a heavy 2-quart saucepan that has
a tight-fitting lid. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn
the heat to low and slowly, but steadily shake the rice into the
water. Cover the pot and give it a shake so the rice levels out in
the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the rice for about 20 minutes. Check for doneness after
about 15 minutes of cooking just in case the rice cooks more
quickly. Using a fork, fish out a few rice grains and taste them.
They should be tender, not hard or mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the heat and let stand (still covered) for 10 to 15
minutes before serving.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ No magic moment this time.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after their dramatic gold-medal performance in
women's team gymnastics in Atlanta, the Americans finished fourth
in Tuesday night's final at the SuperDome.
</P>
<P>
   They missed the bronze medal, won by China, by 1.075 points.
</P>
<P>
   A solid and predictably tiny group of Romanian girl-women won
the gold medal with 154.608 points. Russia failed to catch Romania
on its last rotation, the floor exercises, despite the best efforts
of svelte superstar Svetlana Khorkina.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-5 Khorkina needed a score of 9.994 on the floor for
Russia to overtake Romania. Khorkina, who recently posed for the
Russian edition of Playboy magazine, scored 9.787 and visibly was
dejected after her performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bit disappointed because the team preparation was very
good and they were expecting gold,'' Russian coach Leonid Arkaev
said. ``They got a very low score on the beam, which put the team
down a little, but a good performance on the floor brought them
back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had an inconsistent night. They scored well in the
floor exercises and on the uneven bars but were off the mark on the
vault and balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Chow, for one, was a disappointment on the beam, in which
her score of 9.112 was the lowest on the team and thus thrown out.
She did well on the uneven bars (9.750) and floor (9.625) and
scored 9.350 on the vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped for a medal, of course,'' said Chow, who posted the
highest individual score among her teammates. ``We did all we
could. We had a lot of fun. We gave it our all and we have to be
happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow will compete next in the all-around final Thursday night.
After that, she'll perform in professional exhibitions and return
to Stanford University in January as a junior _ ineligible for the
Cardinal gymnastics team, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, 22, is one of two veterans from Atlanta on this U.S. team.
Dominique Dawes, 23, is the other. She announced her retirement
afterward, having scored 9.700 on the uneven parallel bars and
9.475 on the balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied with our performance,'' Dawes said. ``We were
in sixth place in the Worlds last year and now we're fourth. The
young girls will be pumped up for 2004. This is it for me for
competitive gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawes said she took a measure of satisfaction out of this
Olympics that she didn't four years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference I got out of this experience was a lot of team
camaraderie on the floor,'' she said. ``We came in underdogs and
all we could do was go up. We don't need a bronze medal, silver or
gold, to enjoy this experience. It would have been nice but we
don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual with U.S. gymnastics, Bela Karoyli made himself the
center of attention just by being Bela Karoyli.
</P>
<P>
   He's the coordinator of USA Gymnastics but not a coach, so he
wasn't allowed on the floor. He implied that his outsized presence
on the floor might have made a difference for the U.S. team. The
U.S. team disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life have I experienced to stand on my butt the
whole competition, which now is bleeding,'' Karolyi said in his
fractured style of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Bela-watchers concluded that his fulminations at the
SuperDome were nothing more than self-aggrandizement. He wants to
lead USA Gymnastics for the next four years, and Tuesday night was
the beginning of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have made that huge of a difference,''
Dawes said. ``Having him wouldn't have changed anything . . . He's
proved himself since 1976 with Nadia Comaneci. He's proved himself
time and time again. He's a nice kick in the butt for USA
Gymnastics. We knew he was judging us every time he saw us. He
keeps us on our toes. He's an intimidator.''
</P>
<P>
   Karoyli, who unveiled Comaneci to the world at the 1976 Olympics
in Montreal as Romania's coach and then defected to the United
States, expressed pride in the current gold medalists from the Old
Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing you never can cut from your system,'' he said.
``It is my proper country and I am very proud, especially since I
had a little part of their road to success.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Chow and Dawes are through with competitive gymnastics,
it's up to the younger members of the team to find their places in
the insular little world of international gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dantzscher is 18, and in her first Olympics she scored
9.700 on the uneven bars, 9.712 on the floor and 9.424 on the
vault. Kristen Maloney, 19, recorded marks of 9.493 on the vault,
9.537 on the beam and 9.737 on the floor. Elise Ray, 19, had a high
score of 9.725 on the uneven bars. And Tasha Schwikert is just 15,
with a high score of 9.600 on the floor on her Olympic resume.

 Secrets of Success: A Sweet-Sour Note Graces Rooster's Ribs  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Stephen Ganner has developed one of the most
interesting rib recipes I've run across, and when you see the list
of ingredients, you'll know why.
<P>
   The ribs are first marinated overnight in Guinness stout before
being baked in the marinade. Then there's the barbecue sauce that
gets a unique flavor from guava jelly, tamarind and red wine.
Chipotle chiles add a smoky note.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the far-away feel of the recipe is
Ganner's background. He was born and trained in Scotland and then
cooked on a cruise ship in the Caribbean before moving to Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He hooked up with The Rooster a few years ago and found that his
background was a great match for the world-inspired cuisine served
at this Mission-area restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has a cave-like feel and the chandeliers are made
from recycled objects such as silverware, making a cozy but very
urban-feeling restaurant with a clientele as eclectic as the menu.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Rooster, 1101 Valencia St. (at 22nd Street), San
Francisco; &LR;   &LR; (415) 824-1222. Dinner nightly. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The Guinness. &LR;  Marinating the ribs in dark beer helps to
tenderize and add flavor to the meat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Double cooking. &LR;  After the ribs are slow-cooked in a
250-degree oven with beer, they're covered with sauce and grilled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ A sweet-acidic balance. &LR;  Apple cider vinegar stirred into the
sauce at the end of cooking adds a tangy element to balance the
sweet guava jelly and to soften the smokiness of the chipotles.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TAMARIND-GUAVA BARBECUED SPARERIBS
</P>
<P>
   Tamarind pods, chipotle chile and guava jelly can be found at
most Latin and some specialty food markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds baby back ribs, cut into 4 equal portions
</P>
<P>
   1 pint Guinness stout
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups beef or chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup guava jelly
</P>
<P>
   5 large tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 tamarind pods, or 4 ounces tamarind pulp
</P>
<P>
   1 dried or canned chipotle chile
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the ribs in a large shallow container in a single layer.
Pour the Guinness over them, cover and refrigerate for at least 4
hours or preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the ribs from the beer (reserve beer). Season the ribs
with salt and pepper and place in a large baking pan. Pour the beer
over the ribs, cover tightly with foil and bake for about 2 hours,
or until the meat is almost falling off the bone, turning the ribs
once. Remove the ribs from the pan and let them cool.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium
heat. Add the shallots and saute for about 10 minutes, or until
golden brown. Add the wine and boil for about 5 minutes, or until
reduced to 1 tablespoon. Stir in the broth, jelly, tomatoes,
tamarind, chipotle and cinnamon stick. Bring the mixture to a boil,
stirring until the jelly melts.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, until the flavors
are blended and the sauce has thickened. Strain through a fine
sieve, pressing on the solids in the sieve with the back of a
wooden spoon. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a grill (medium-high heat). Brush the ribs liberally
with the barbecue sauce. Grill (or alternately cook in a saute pan)
for about 6 minutes, or until warm, turning frequently and basting
occasionally with the sauce.
</P>
<P>

 Taster's Choice: Ore Ida Crinkles Win French Fry Battle  By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The french fry obsession has reached the
supermarket freezer section with a vengeance. Customers can choose
from a dizzying array of frozen french fries in cuts from
shoestring to crinkle to curly.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 10 varieties of crinkle-cut frozen french
fries. All were baked in the oven according to package directions.
Because some fries were already salted, we did not salt them,
though salt was available for tasters to use.
</P>
<P>
   One french fry was the clear winner, but another product made by
the same company came in last _ it's made out of potatoes and
dehydrated potatoes, as well as ingredients like xanthan gum and
dehydrated onions. Panelists objected to its artificial flavor and
mashed-potatolike texture.
</P>
<P>
   That fry also was the highest in fat _ a whopping 12 grams per
3-ounce serving, compared to the 3 to 5 grams of most of the
others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ore Ida Golden Crinkles &LR;  (32 ounces, $3.49 at Safeway) took
first place by a wide margin. Panelists liked the potato flavor,
described as ``just right.'' The crunchy exterior and mealy
interior were also well liked. Two would buy it and three might.
(Beware: The packaging on Ore Ida Crispers, the least favorite fry,
is remarkably similar.)
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Safeway Restaurant Style Crinkle Cut &LR;  (32
ounces, $2.69 at Safeway). One panelist noted that this fry had
more ridges so it had a crispier texture. While most tasters liked
the flavor, two detected a ``freezer'' taste. One would buy it and
four might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cascadian Farm &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.39 at Whole Foods) came in
third. Three panelists liked the potato flavor, but others thought
it was dry and tasteless. Two would buy it, two might buy it and
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking dropped dramatically after third place, but the best of
the rest was  &UR; Springfield Crinkle Cut &LR;  (32 ounces, $2.49 at
Andronico's). The panelists thought this fry was particularly
greasy. One would buy it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Albertsons &LR;  (32 ounces, 99 cents at
Albertsons), scoring just one point below Springfield. While most
panelists enjoyed the flavor, they objected the soft texture. One
might buy it and four would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Ralph's, Safeway Crispy Fries, Safeway
Crinkle Cut, 365 and Ore Ida Crispers, but they scored too low to
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle food
columnist; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur
and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. A perfect score for any prduct would be 100. All
products are tasted blind.

 c.2000 New York Times Special Features 
<TEXT>
<P>
   La gira de Vicente Fox a Estados Unidos y Canada en agosto fue
observada tanto en Mexico como en el exterior con gran atencion.
Fue la primera de un presidente-electo mexicano, surgido de la
oposicion.
</P>
<P>
   Lo notable fue la manera en que Fox logro fijar su agenda en los
medios en Estados Unidos, en lugar de verse obligado a cenirse a la
agenda impuesta por los norteamericanos.
</P>
<P>
   El primer acto publico de Vicente Fox en Estados Unidos ya como
presidente-electo tuvo lugar con 30 lideres de la comunidad
mexicana-neoyorquina. El simbolismo de primero encontrarse con los
paisanos, y despues con ocho de los hombres de banca e industria
mas poderosos de Estados Unidos, no escapo a nadie alla.
</P>
<P>
   De la misma manera, antes de reunirse con el gobernador de
Texas, Fox se empeno en juntarse con unos 40 dirigentes de las
comunidades mexicanas de Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Los encuentros con las personalidades americanas revistieron
tambien caracteristicas de excepcion. El Vice-Presidente Al Gore
acogio a Fox en su casa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, por su parte, se salto su almuerzo para conversar con
Fox, y resistio incontables presiones de todo su gabinete y de la
infinidad de agencias oficiales norteamericanas con un pliego
petitorio para Mexico, limitando el numero de sus acompanantes a
tres: la Secretaria de Estado Madeleine Albright, el Consejero de
Seguridad Nacional Sandy Berger, y el Jefe de la Oficina de la
Presidencia John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Por ultimo, George W. Bush viajo por la tarde desde Miami para
encontrarse con Fox.
</P>
<P>
   En cuanto a las innovaciones en el formato de un viaje de esta
naturaleza, quizas el comentario mas significativo fue la
felicitacion y el dejo de asombro manifestados al presidente-electo
mexicano tanto por el Primer Ministro Jean Chretien de Canada como
por Bill Clinton a proposito de la iniciativa foxista de incluir a
tres representantes de Organizaciones No-Gubernamentales en su
comitiva, y de reunirse con un grupo diverso y nutrido de ONGs
tanto en Toronto como en Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sin embargo, la oportunidad de realizar la gira en estas fechas,
para algunas personas no fue tan bueno como para otras. Para Al
Gore y los Democratas en general, la visita de Fox y las posturas
que sostuvo durante la misma pueden haber resultado incomodas. A
ello sin duda se debe la impresion dejada entre muchos observadores
que el vice-presidente le saco menos provecho al encuentro con Fox
que su contrincante republicano.
</P>
<P>
   La explicacion es relativamente sencilla: los Democratas,
tradicionalmente mas abiertos a las corrientes migratorias y
etnicas, mas flexibles en materia de lucha contra el narcotrafico,
mas cercanos al voto latino en general y mexicano-americano en
particular, se hallan en una situacion mas delicada.
</P>
<P>
   Por un lado se ven obligados a proteger su flanco derecho y
evitar que los Republicanos los tachen de ``blandengues'' con los
mexicanos y los ataquen por no defender la frontera. Pero por el
otro deben evitar un deslinde demasiado marcado frente a un Fox
percibido como un especie de heroe por un sector importante de la
comunidad hispana.
</P>
<P>
   Una encuesta entregada a Fox en Estados Unidos mostro que mas

 c.2000 New York Times Special Features 
<TEXT>
<P>
   La gira de Vicente Fox a Estados Unidos y Canada en agosto fue
observada tanto en Mexico como en el exterior con gran atencion.
Fue la primera de un presidente-electo mexicano, surgido de la
oposicion.
</P>
<P>
   Lo notable fue la manera en que Fox logro fijar su agenda en los
medios en Estados Unidos, en lugar de verse obligado a cenirse a la
agenda impuesta por los norteamericanos.
</P>
<P>
   El primer acto publico de Vicente Fox en Estados Unidos ya como
presidente-electo tuvo lugar con 30 lideres de la comunidad
mexicana-neoyorquina. El simbolismo de primero encontrarse con los
paisanos, y despues con ocho de los hombres de banca e industria
mas poderosos de Estados Unidos, no escapo a nadie alla.
</P>
<P>
   De la misma manera, antes de reunirse con el gobernador de
Texas, Fox se empeno en juntarse con unos 40 dirigentes de las
comunidades mexicanas de Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Los encuentros con las personalidades americanas revistieron
tambien caracteristicas de excepcion. El Vice-Presidente Al Gore
acogio a Fox en su casa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, por su parte, se salto su almuerzo para conversar con
Fox, y resistio incontables presiones de todo su gabinete y de la
infinidad de agencias oficiales norteamericanas con un pliego
petitorio para Mexico, limitando el numero de sus acompanantes a
tres: la Secretaria de Estado Madeleine Albright, el Consejero de
Seguridad Nacional Sandy Berger, y el Jefe de la Oficina de la
Presidencia John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Por ultimo, George W. Bush viajo por la tarde desde Miami para
encontrarse con Fox.
</P>
<P>
   En cuanto a las innovaciones en el formato de un viaje de esta
naturaleza, quizas el comentario mas significativo fue la
felicitacion y el dejo de asombro manifestados al presidente-electo
mexicano tanto por el Primer Ministro Jean Chretien de Canada como
por Bill Clinton a proposito de la iniciativa foxista de incluir a
tres representantes de Organizaciones No-Gubernamentales en su
comitiva, y de reunirse con un grupo diverso y nutrido de ONGs
tanto en Toronto como en Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sin embargo, la oportunidad de realizar la gira en estas fechas,
para algunas personas no fue tan bueno como para otras. Para Al
Gore y los Democratas en general, la visita de Fox y las posturas
que sostuvo durante la misma pueden haber resultado incomodas. A
ello sin duda se debe la impresion dejada entre muchos observadores
que el vice-presidente le saco menos provecho al encuentro con Fox
que su contrincante republicano.
</P>
<P>
   La explicacion es relativamente sencilla: los Democratas,
tradicionalmente mas abiertos a las corrientes migratorias y
etnicas, mas flexibles en materia de lucha contra el narcotrafico,
mas cercanos al voto latino en general y mexicano-americano en
particular, se hallan en una situacion mas delicada.
</P>
<P>
   Por un lado se ven obligados a proteger su flanco derecho y
evitar que los Republicanos los tachen de ``blandengues'' con los
mexicanos y los ataquen por no defender la frontera. Pero por el
otro deben evitar un deslinde demasiado marcado frente a un Fox
percibido como un especie de heroe por un sector importante de la
comunidad hispana.
</P>
<P>
   Una encuesta entregada a Fox en Estados Unidos mostro que mas
del 56 por ciento de los norteamericanos habia oido hablar de el y
de su victoria electoral el 2 de julio, y que la proporcion
aumentaba en el Oeste, es decir en California, donde el voto
hispano puede ser decisivo para Gore. Mientras que Bush no debe ni
teme nada por ese lado: su linea dura en materia de la pena de
muerte y de la frontera le permite esquivar un distanciamiento con
Fox sin ningun riesgo.
</P>
<P>
   De alli la paradoja detectada por varios comentaristas en
Estados Unidos: si bien Gore y los Democratas albergan mayores
simpatias para las propuestas de Fox, Bush y los Republicanos
pueden permitirse el lujo de recibirlas con mayor agrado.
</P>
<P>
   Para Fox la ventana era esta: cuando siendo presidente-electo no
asumia mayores compromisos, no iba a negociar ni a cabildear, sino
solo a proponer ideas y tesis. Sin Congreso en sesion en Washington
y antes del arranque real de las campanas, era mucho mas factible

 Fast Fries, Fabulous Frites: Making or finding the perfect
french  fry isn't as simple as it seems   By Robin Davis 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Crisp french fries _ they're the perfect match for
just about everything from a McDonald's Happy Meal to Scala's
Bistro's steamed mussels. They're as at home with Champagne as they
are with beer. And they're as comfortable at a white tablecloth
restaurant as at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, you'll see a mountain of crispy shoestrings
piled on plates at Zuni, big white bowlfuls with ramekins of
a &LR; i &LR; oli at Belon, and fries spilling out of paper cones at
Absinthe. Customers clamor for the fries packed into Belgian cups
at Bouchon in Yountville and for the frites sharing a plate with
grilled steak at L'Amie Donia in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come here for the fries,'' says Patrice Romine, sharing a
plate of fries with her husband at Chez Nous in San Francisco
recently. ``If they weren't here, we'd probably spread the wealth a
little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area diners aren't alone _ french fries are an American
obsession. The average American eats 16.5 pounds each year and,
according to the American Frozen Food Institute's most recent
statistics, U.S. companies produce more than 7 billion pounds of
frozen ones each year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, french fries are so popular that many top-notch Bay
Area restaurants use some of those 7 billion frozen pounds to keep
up with customer demand. That the fries on some of the best tables
in town are frozen is just one of the unexpected twists in the
french fry world.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about french fries is that there's nothing simple
about them. Making the perfect fry _ crisp golden brown on the
outside and barely fluffy inside _ isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sensational fries at Belon, chef-owner Paul Arenstam
first peels Kennebec potatoes, then cuts them on an industrial
french fry cutter. He soaks the potatoes in water for 24 hours,
then drains them, pats them dry, blanches them in hot oil and
drains them again. They're held until an order comes in, then
they're fried in even hotter oil for a final crisping.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Browne at Absinthe and Laurence Jossel at Chez Nous follow
a similar procedure. And, like Arenstam, they also take the time to
make interesting dipping sauces like Browne's garlicky a &LR; i &LR; oli or
Jossel's spicy harissa a &LR; i &LR; oli.
</P>
<P>
   But making fries from scratch doesn't work for Bouchon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to employ someone full time just to do fries,'' says
Jeff Cerciello, executive chef at Bouchon, the wine country
restaurant that serves some of the best fries around. And in the
tight labor market, that's just not feasible, he says. For the huge
demand for fries at Bouchon, where more than 150 pounds hit the
tables each day, Cerciello relies on a frozen product called
Private Reserve made by Lamb Weston.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Scala, chef-owner of Bistro Don Giovanni in Napa, also
uses Lamb Weston's Private Reserve. The product is available only
to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason she likes it is that it's more consistent
than potatoes which can vary in texture and flavor throughout the
season. Lamb Weston's fries are made from potatoes frozen at the
peak of season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on when it's harvested, even when you double fry
them, they still get limp,'' she says. ``Frozen fries are more
consistent than a regular potato.''
</P>
<P>
   While most restaurateurs have adopted seasonality of produce as
their catchphrase, they wouldn't dream of applying that to french
fries, even though different varieties of potatoes really are
seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Halperin, culinary director of the Center for Culinary
Development in San Francisco, a consulting firm for food companies,
compares it to only making bread with freshly harvested wheat.
``The best wheat is winter wheat, so do you only make bread with
that? That's absurd,'' he says. ``So should you only serve french
fries when potatoes are fresh? That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, frozen fries aren't for every chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to serve them and let customers believe they're
fresh. I don't want to put one over on my customers,'' says
Arenstam of Belon, even though he acknowledges that it would save
him considerable time and expense. ``Maybe it's an old-fashioned
hard-headed chef thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the frozen fries showing up at restaurants weren't as good as
fresh, perhaps that would be a scandal. But the fact is these
frozen fries are excellent. That shouldn't really be a surprise
considering the company that makes them _ Lamb Weston _ also makes
some of our favorite fast-food fries, including McDonald's and
Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Bobby Horowitz, president of Lamb Weston,
these aren't the same fries as the ones used in fast-food
restaurants, either.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed a product specifically for use in high-end
restaurants. Unlike the fast-food fries, many of which have a
potato-starch coating that keeps them crispy longer, the Private
Reserve fries are steam-blanched then frozen. They're not coated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fries aren't meant to be held for an hour,'' Horowitz
explains. ``The idea is for them to be cooked and served and be
like a fresh potato.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lamb Weston does have a line of frozen fries available to
consumers _ it's sold under the Inland Valley label _ it's not the
same as what's sold to restaurants. And we found that the product
available at supermarkets was neither as good as the fries sold to
restaurants nor as good as fresh fries. Nor are they somehow as
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Even though homemade fries are time-consuming and messy to make,
you just can't get the flavor and texture of the real thing without
making them from scratch (see Taster's Choice on Page 2).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the benefits of using frozen fries, Scala continues to
play with the idea of making fries fresh at Bistro Don Giovanni.
``In my heart,'' she says, ``I want to use fresh fries.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Hints for a Great French Fry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs opt for a medium starch potato, like the Kennebec,
for french fries. There is enough starch for fluffy texture, yet
still some moisture to maintain firmness. Kennebecs are in season
from spring through summer. Chefs often soak the fries in water for
consistency since potato characteristics vary throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   The best fries are double-fried. The first frying, in oil that's
325-350, cooks and gelatinizes the starchy interior of the fry
without browning or crisping the exterior. Moisture evaporates from
the surface and is replaced by some oil. The fry is limp at this
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Our Best Way calls for french fries to be frozen after
blanching. This keeps them from breaking and also improves the
final texture and crispness. When the frozen potatoes are fried at
a higher temperature (350-400) the second time, the moisture inside
migrates to the surface. The cold fry hitting the hot oil means a
``mass transfer'' of heat and cold. This big temperature difference
causes fries to crisp up quickly, browning and sealing the outside
and steaming the insides. The end result: lighter, crisper fries
with a ``hollow,'' pleasantly mealy texture. The steam escaping
from the surface also increases the overall temperature of the fry.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Measuring Up Fast-Food Fries &QL;  &LR; 
Our love affair with french fries is fueled at least in part by
fast-food restaurants. Here's how those fries stacked up recently
for Food Department tasters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ McDonald's. &LR;  The freshness of the fries was a little uneven,
which may be the result of being dumped into a bin to hold before
being scooped up to fill orders. But the majority of the fries were
crisp and hot with fluffy interiors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Burger King. &LR;  These fries were evenly cooked, but had less
potato flavor than McDonald's. They stayed crisp even when they
cooled off, probably the result of some kind of coating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Wendy's. &LR;  The fries didn't have much potato flavor, but they
weren't greasy and their coloring was even.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ In-and-Out Burger. &LR;  The only fast-food fries made from fresh
potatoes, these had the best potato flavor but were disappointingly
pale and limp. Double-frying them might help them reach their
potential.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Carl's Jr. &LR;  Tough and cardboard-y, not even ketchup helped
these fries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Jack-in-the-Box. &LR;  These fries tasted more of oil than
potatoes.
</P>

   &QL; 
 &UR; Fun Facts About Frites &LR; 
 &UR; FAMOUS DISHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that some of the most famous potato dishes we enjoy
today were created by mistake?
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Souffled Potatoes. &LR;  Collinet, chef for French King Louis
Phillipe (reign 1830-1848) unintentionally created souffled (or
puffed) potatoes by plunging already fried potatoes into extremely
hot oil to reheat them when the King arrived late for dinner one
night. To the chef's surprise and the king's delight, the potatoes
puffed up like little balloons.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Chips. &LR;  In 1853 railroad magnate Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt complained that his potatoes were cut too thick and sent
them back to the kitchen at a fashionable resort in Saratoga
Springs, NY.
</P>
<P>
   To spite his haughty guest, chef George Crum sliced some
potatoes paper thin, fried them in hot oil, salted and served them.
To everyone's surprise, Vanderbilt loved his ``Saratoga Crunch
Chips,'' and potato chips have been popular ever since.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MOVING SPUD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Inca Indians were the first to cultivate potatoes in about 200
BC.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1536, Spanish Conquistadors conquered Peru, became aware of
the potato, and carried it to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before the end of the 16th century, families of Basque sailors
began to cultivate potatoes along the Biscay coast of northern
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sir Walter Raleigh introduced potatoes to Ireland in 1589 near
Cork on the 40,000 acres of land given to him by Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potatoes arrived in the Colonies in 1621 when the Governor of
Bermuda, Nathaniel Butler, sent two large cedar chests containing
potatoes and other vegetables to Governor Francis Wyatt of Virginia
at Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first permanent potato patches in North America were
established in 1719, most likely near Londonderry (Derry), N.H.
</P>
<P>
   _ King Louis XIV was aided by A.A. Parmentier in the 18th
century to popularize potatoes in France. Parmentier created a
feast with only potato dishes, a concept he realized was possible
while being imprisoned in Germany and fed only potatoes. Benjamin
Franklin, ambassador to France, was in attendance of Parmentier's
feast in 1767.
</P>
<P>
   _ French Fries were introduced to the U.S. when Thomas Jefferson
served them at the White House during his Presidency (1801-1809).
</P>
<P>
   _ Over the years of cultivation in Ireland the potato had become
the major food source to the Irish population. In 1845-46 a fungus
destroyed the potato crops causing the disaster of the Irish Potato
Famine.
</P>
<P>
   _ In October 1995, the potato became the first vegetable to be
grown in space. NASA and the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
created the technology with the goal of feeding astronauts on long
space voyages and eventually feeding future space colonies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POTATOES AS CURRENCY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ During the Alaskan Klondike gold rush (1897-1898) potatoes
were practically worth their weight in gold. Potatoes were so
valued for their vitamin C content that miners traded gold for
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the South Atlantic Island of Tristan de Cunha, potatoes
were once used as the country's unofficial currency. Because of the
island's remoteness, food was the most valuable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BELIEVE IT OR NOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Because the potato was unknown to them, Europeans initially
considered potatoes poisonous or evil due to their similarities to
the nightshade family.
</P>
<P>
   _ Germany's King Frederick William realized that potatoes were a
good food source and ordered peasants to plant and eat potatoes or
their noses would be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALTERNATIVE USES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Incas had many uses for potatoes other than dinner,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raw potato slices were placed on broken bones to promote
healing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potatoes were carried to prevent rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potatoes were eaten with other foods to prevent indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   _ To measure time. Units of time were correlated by how long it
took for potatoes to cook.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POTATO PRESCRIPTIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Various folk remedies recommend using potatoes to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat facial blemishes by washing the face daily with cool
potato juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat frostbite or sunburn by applying raw grated potato or
potato juice to the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help a toothache by carrying a potato in one's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease a sore throat by putting a slice of baked potato in a
stocking and tying it around the affected person's throat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease aches and pains by rubbing the affected area with the
water potatoes have been boiled in.

OVEN-BAKED FRENCH FRIES
</P>
<P>
   No method of oven-baking completely replicates the deep frying
of french fries, but these are pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 russet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick fries
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick vegetable oil spray
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bring a large pot of water to a
simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Working in batches, add the fries to the water and simmer for
about 5 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Using a slotted
spoon, transfer the fries to paper towels to drain. (The parboiled
potatoes may be stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for
several hours before being baked.)
</P>
<P>
   Spray 2 large baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Arrange
the fries on the baking sheets and lightly spray them with the
vegetable oil spray.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy,
turning once.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle with salt and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &LR; SWEET POTATO FRIES
</P>
<P>
   The Food Department staff is divided on using sweet potatoes as
french fries. But these sweet sticks are sure to be a hit, even
with traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Peanut or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick
fries
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour enough oil into a large, heavy, deep pot to reach a depth
of at least 4 inches. Heat to 275 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Working in batches, fry the sweet potatoes for about 5 minutes,
or until beginning to soften but not brown. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer the fries to paper towels to drain. Cover and place in the
freezer for at least 2 hours, or until completely frozen. If you
are planning to keep them in the freezer for longer than 6 hours,
pack them in a plastic freezer bag.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Working in batches, add the sweet potato fries to the oil and
fry for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to paper
towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   When all the fries have finished cooking, season them with salt
and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 &LR; ROASTED GARLIC-TARRAGON AIOLI
</P>
<P>
   Roasting the garlic gives this dipping sauce a milder, sweeter
garlic taste, so you can eat as much as you like without fear of
garlic breath. Use any leftovers as a spread for turkey sandwiches
or in potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 head of garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups canola, peanut or other mild tasting oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut off the top quarter of the
head of garlic, then remove much of the papery outer skin. Place
the garlic in a small baking dish and drizzle with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Roast for about 40 minutes, or until the garlic is very tender.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 15 minutes, or
until you can handle it. Squeeze the pulp from the cloves into a
food processor. Add any olive oil from the baking pan and process
until smooth and cool. Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon zest
and a pinch of salt. Process for about 1 minute, until the mixture
is thick and pale yellow.
</P>
<P>
   With the processor running, slowly add the oil in a slow thin
stream, processing until the mixture is completely emulsified.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Stir in the tarragon, taste, and
add more salt as needed. Press plastic wrap directly onto the
surface of the aioli and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour to
blend the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 3 cups.

SUN-DRIED TOMATO AIOLI
</P>
<P>
   For those who must have something tomato to dip their fries
into, this sauce does the trick. In fact, it's a great replacement
for ketchup on steak sandwiches or hamburgers. It's equally good as
a dipping sauce for boiled or grilled shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup drained (reserve the oil) and chopped oil-packed
sun-dried tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup oil from sun-dried tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peanut, canola or other mild oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Puree the tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Add the
tomato juice, egg yolks, cayenne and sugar; process for 30 seconds,
or until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   With the processor running, gradually add the oil from the
tomatoes and the peanut oil in a slow steady stream, processing
until the mixture is completely emulsified.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To store, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the
aioli to prevent a skin from forming, then refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 2 cups.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Seven years ago, Kim Soo-nyung of South
Korea decided to retire after a career as one of the greatest
female archers ever, with three Olympic gold medals and one silver
to her name. She was the queen in a country where a generation of
archers was establishing Dream Team-like dominance in international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 10-year-old girl named Yun Mi-jin was taking
up the sport in an elementary school just outside Seoul, joining
because a friend did, never knowing or even dreaming that she would
one day take Kim's place.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened Tuesday as a transition to a new era
played out at the Olympic Archery Center here. Kim, now 30, was
back from retirement, a mother with two young children who decided
that elite sports competition could be her profession. Tuesday,
however, she ran into Yun, now 17 and possessing the same type of
talent Kim did when she took the gold as a 17-year-old at the 1988
Seoul Olympics. Humble yet confident, Yun eliminated Kim in the
semifinals, then coolly outdueled another Korean, Kim Nam-soon, in
the finals to win the women's individual gold.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tense match for the gold medal. In the finals, each
woman shot 12 arrows, earning 10 points for a bullseye and fewer
points, in descending order, the farther away the arrows landed
from the center of the target. Jun led by a point, 80-79, after
nine arrows. Kim Nam-soon applied the pressure, hitting for 9
points on three straight shots. But Jun, like a racehorse who won't
be passed, answered with shots for 10 points, 8 points and 9
points, and prevailed by 107-106.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to win any medals,'' Jun said afterward. ``I
put my fate in luck.'' South Korea has dominated the sport since it
was restored to the Games in 1972, winning eight golds, including
the last five individual titles.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Soo-nyung beat Choe Ok Sil of North Korea for the bronze,
and the two women hugged afterward, another example of the
improving relations between the athletes of the two nations. Last
Friday, delegations from both Koreas marched together in the
opening ceremonies, although not all the archers did so because
some had to compete the next day. Nevertheless, Jun said the idea
of marching together made her feel ``as if two countries became one
country,'' and that she hoped they would be competing together at
the next Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jun certainly seems destined for a long Olympic career. South
Koreans consider qualifying for the Olympics the real test, because
the domestic competition from Korean rivals is so great. Jun earned
the honor with consistently high scoring throughout the year. As an
11th-grade student at Kyunggi Physical High School in Suwon, about
40 kilometers south of Seoul, she trains in the morning and does
schoolwork in the afternoon. Slight and shy, she spoke softly but
nevertheless talked of the confidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same type of confidence that propelled Kim Soo-nyung
to Olympic champion, a title that Jun appears ready to hold onto
with a strong, steady hand.

&HT;     AN OLD TIMER ROUNDS OUT U.S. WATER POLO TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This is not to suggest that Maureen O'Toole
is old, exactly, but she did join the U.S. national women's water
polo team at its inception, before several current members of the
squad were even born.
</P>
<P>
   She's been around long enough to have retired twice and made as
many comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   She's the only player on the team able to be congratulated in
victory and consoled in defeat by her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole's Olympic experience is one of patience rewarded. The
39-year-old resident of Piedmont, Calif., joined the fledgling
national team in 1978 and waited 22 long years before the sport for
women was included in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Tuesday's 7-6 defeat to host Australia
was of little consequence. This is the Olympic Games and O'Toole is
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single Olympics that went by, I thought it was going to
happen,'' she said. ``I don't think I'd be playing now if I had
been in a couple Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole's teammates appreciate the scope of her long career and
what she brings to a group of women 15 and 20 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game she busts out a move that you wonder where it came
from,'' attacker Brenda Villa said. ``You're in awe of her. She's
been around a long time and has a lot of tools. It's awesome to
have her experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome is a word O'Toole uses often to describe being at the
Olympic Games at long last. In particular, the Opening Ceremonies
on Friday will remain with her long after her playing career is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everything I expected and more,'' O'Toole said. ``It
was awesome. Walking through that tunnel knowing we were
representing our country, it was so much fun. I didn't look at the
stadium until we marched in. It was bigger than life. It was so
amazing. The Aussies put on a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her mom has been regarded as the greatest women's water
polo player ever, Kelly's favorite sport is played on land.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really into soccer,'' O'Toole said. ``We hung out with
the (U.S.) women's soccer team at the Opening Ceremony. They want
to come to our games and we want to go to theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Like little girls everywhere, Kelly O'Toole wants to meet soccer
stars Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain. That will have to wait until
the water polo tournament is over on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women have a 2-1-1 record in the preliminary round with
one game to go, against Kazakhstan on Wednesday at the sparkling
Ryde Aquatics Centre in suburban Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game against Australia was a lively one, with Aussies
in green and gold chanting ``Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oy! Oy! Oy!''
and a much smaller group of American fans responding with
thrice-repeated chants of ``USA!''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies broke a 6-6 tie in the fourth period and won the
game on Bridgette Gusterson's goal with 2:56 remaining. The U.S.
had to come back throughout the game, from a 2-0 deficit in the
first period and a 6-4 disadvantage in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Ellen Estes late in the third period and by Villa in
the fourth brought the game to a 6-6 tie. What hurt the Americans
was their poor record in 6-on-5 advantages - 4-of-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shoot that low a percentage, we were fortunate to lose by
a goal,'' U.S. coach Guy Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole was more emphatic, saying, ``Our 6-on-5 was terrible. We
beat ourselves today. We can't win like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. could meet up with Australia again in the medal round,
a possibility the Americans are savoring.

GILLETTE JUMPS ON WEAK EURO BANDWAGON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add a new excuse to the list that includes, ``The check is in
the mail,'' and ``The dog ate my homework.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``blame it on the euro,'' and as the value of the currency
has dipped sharply, ``blame it on the euro'' has been invoked often
by US companies that sell a lot of products in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Gillette Co., the Boston maker of razors, batteries, and
oral-care products, became the latest to cite the euro as the cause
for some of its woes, following similar statements by
Colgate-Palmolive Co. and McDonald's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of global consumer companies are going to be going
through sales weakness in the near term'' because of the euro, said
Patrick Schumann, an Edward Jones analyst who follows all three
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The weak euro may explain some of Gillette's problems _ the
company is also experiencing a disappointing performance from its
Duracell battery division _ but that didn't stop investors from
punishing its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette shares hit a 4-year low before bouncing back slightly
to close at $27.63, down $2.19 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's euro alert came only two weeks after it said it was
comfortable with Wall Street's earlier estimates of its
performance. But largely because of the rapid declines in the euro
and the British pound, third-quarter sales will be ``virtually
unchanged'' from the same period last year, Gillette said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without the negative impact of the euro, third-quarter sales
would have risen an estimated 6 percent, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette also said third-quarter earnings should be ``slightly
ahead'' of last year's level of 32 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe accounts for about 30 percent of Gillette's
roughly $10 billion in annual sales. If the euro holds steady,
Gillette said it should meet Wall Street's expectations for the
fourth quarter. But if the euro continues its free fall, Gillette
said it might have to revise its outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's statements Monday seemed to reprise recent comments
from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McDonald's said weaker foreign currencies could hurt
profits, and Colgate warned that third-quarter sales will rise at a
pace less than expected because of the declining euro. Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. has also cited the euro as one reason why earnings could
remain flat.
</P>
<P>
   Stock shares of McDonald's, Colgate, and Gillette have each lost
about 30 percent of their value so far this year, and lower stock
prices have made firms like Gillette subject to speculation about
possible mergers or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with high energy prices and Federal Reserve interest
rate hikes that seemed to have slowed consumer spending, the weak
euro could spell even more trouble ahead if it falls farther, said
Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fed-induced slowdown, high energy prices, a weak euro _ if
they all come together, it could really hurt earnings for the
fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How does a weak euro hurt someone like Gillette?
</P>
<P>
   US companies report performance in US dollars. When sales from
an overseas market with a weak currency are translated into a
strong currency such as the dollar, some of the value of foreign
sales and profits can be lost in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the euro was trading around $1.05. Now it is
hovering at about 86 cents.
</P>
<P>
   No one envisioned a puny euro when the currency debuted to much
fanfare at the beginning of 1999. But since its unveiling as the
common currency of 11 European countries, the euro has lost nearly
30 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Just since early July, when many US companies begin their third
quarters, the euro has depreciated by 11 percent, Gillette's chief
financial officer Charles W. Cramb said.
</P>
<P>
   One investor charged Monday that Gillette should have done a
better job of hedging against the euro's sharp declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Northstar Group president Henry Asher
told Bloomberg News. ``They should have been able to mute the
impact of foreign exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the beginning of the year, few forecasters were
predicting a big drop in the euro, however, said John Calverley,
chief economist for American Express Bank. ``And if you talk to
investment people today, there's a perception the euro is
undervalued against the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   It's partly the continuing strength of the US economy that has
hurt the euro. As the US economy continues to plug along, it sucks
up investors' money from around the world, boosting the dollar at
the expense of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, Gillette was a Wall Street star. But in
the past two years, dips in foreign currency, compounded by recent
disappointments at Duracell, have slowed its pace.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gillette, competition in the North American battery
market intensified late last year when rivals attempted to exploit
demand created by concerns of Y2K power outages and flooded the
market in free samples.
</P>
<P>
   While it was focusing on its market segmentation strategy with
the introduction of its Duracell Ultra premium battery, Gillette
was losing market share for its standard ``copper &AMP; black'' battery
line. Declaring the Duracell Ultra to be a success, Gillette now
plans to promote copper and black more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to give up (profit) margin to get back market
share in the fourth quarter,'' Cramb said.
</P>
<P>
   But winning back market share for copper and black is ``not
going to happen overnight,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Gillette has sometimes been accused of cutting its
advertising budget to boost its bottom line. Monday Gillette said
it remains committed to promoting its brands.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Gillette investor Fredric E. Russell expressed
frustration that Gillette hasn't been more forthcoming about
Duracell's disappointing sales. ``I just wish this company would be
more direct with us,'' said Russell of Fredric E. Russell
Investment Management Co., an Oklahoma firm that owns shares in
Gillette stock. ``They keep talking about a `difficult competitive
environment.' What does that mean?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the euro, Russell said, ``There are some things that may
be beyond Gillette's control.''

CRANBERRY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By David Warsh  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cranberry harvest is just beginning: Normally, it is
farmers' glory time. If you drive down Route 58 through Hanson,
Plympton, and Carver, Mass., you'll see bog after bog planted with
the distinctive vines, some flooded for wet-picking, others drained
for dry, landscapes little-changed for 150 years. Most growers will
hold on for the distinctive red color that is the berries' way of
fighting off the cold.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd better make your trip this year.
</P>
<P>
   For there is no joy among farmers at this year's bumper crop.
Nantucket has cancelled its annual festival.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Agriculture last summer ordered growers to
reduce their crop by an average of 15 percent in an ill-timed
attempt to keep prices from falling.
</P>
<P>
   And Massachusetts' largest grower, A.D. Makepeace Co., wants to
turn 10,000 acres of bogs, farms, and forest abutting Myles
Standish State Forest into an upscale development. It is the second
megadevelopment slated recently for southeast Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: record low prices. From a high of nearly $71 a
barrel in 1976, prices may decline to as little as $11 a barrel by
the time the harvest is complete _ well under farmers' average cost
of around $32 a barrel. Davis Bushnell, The Boston Globe
correspondent who has been following the story, reports that it's
the worst crisis in the industry since 1959, when a cancer scare
led to the widespread dumping of crops.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate roots of the crisis are to be found in those high
prices of 1996. The shortage that year might have led
space-travelers to plant cranberries on the moon. ``Forget Cows and
Corn,'' wrote Barbara Carton of The Wall Street Journal in the
summer of 1997 under the memorable headline ``Bog Heaven.'' It
continued: ``Let's Bet the Farm on Cranberry Crops _ Surge in
Fruit's Price Brings a Gold-Rush Mentality; Will Cran-Bubble Burst?
_ Even Fergie Puckers Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec farmers had come into the market in significant numbers.
So had growers in Michigan. Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and
the Ukraine explored extension services to teach locals the
subtleties of the crop. Potential new markets kept opening up; a
glass of cranberry juice a day may prevent urinary tract
infections. But alas, new markets haven't opened up fast enough;
supply outpaced demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the great expansion of the mid-90s, a shadow had
fallen across the industry. In 1987, a Wisconsin entrepreneur named
John Swendrowski pulled out of the Ocean Spray cooperative to which
he had been selling his cranberries and hooked up with some venture
capitalists instead. Ocean Spray in the 1960s had single-handedly
invented the modern market for cranberry products, making bog
owners rich, but for Swendrowski's purposes they were no longer
moving fast enough. He formed Northland Cranberries Inc., a
publicly traded company, and wrested away 12 percent of the US
cranberry market, encouraging large-scale farming outside of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Among local growers, there are suspicions that the sources of
the current crash in prices may go beyond the elemental forces of
supply and demand. The Ocean Spray cooperative, headquartered in
Lakeville, Mass., is increasingly dominated by its larger members _
many of them in located in Wisconsin and Quebec. Ocean Spray is
engaged in bitter competition with its rival Northland. Big buyers
like Coca-Cola have sought to muscle in.
</P>
<P>
   Has there been deliberate dumping of frozen product by Ocean
Spray, in an attempt to turn ``red gold'' into red ink that
Northland can ill afford? ``The Spray'' enjoys unique price-setting
power under the 78-year-old Capper-Volstead Act, which exempted
agricultural cooperatives from the Sherman Act. Small growers are
searching for a ``smoking gun.'' Meanwhile, the Massachusetts
cranberry industry is drying up. More than one-quarter of its 450
growers are thought to be on the verge of giving up. When elephants
fight, the grass gets trampled.

 BLACK CHURCHES TRY TO NURTURE MEMBERS' FINANCIAL GROWTH
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   In the basement of Concord Baptist Church in Boston the Rev.
Frank E. Kelley preached about resisting temptation _ not the
temptation to sin, but the temptation to spend rather than save for
a down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to buy a big-ticket item such as a car,''
Kelley recently told a group of about a dozen prospective home
buyers. ``It's time to put in extra hours on your job to build up
income and pay down debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions like these have become common around the country, as
black churches reach beyond traditional social and religious
programs to embrace economic development and personal finance
initiatives. The goal is to help blacks build wealth and attain
homeownership as the economy continues its historic runup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the concern that black churches have is, `How do you
spread the wealth around?' '' said the Rev. Alexander D. Hurt, of
the Hurt Inner-City Ministries and a member of the Ten Point
Coalition in Boston. ``How do you make sure people left outside the
circle _ in terms of wealth creation, in terms of a thriving stock
market _ how do you make sure those people are included?''
</P>
<P>
   Those questions are at the heart of a national conference this
week at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. Sponsored by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, the three-day conference will explore ways
black churches can expand their economic missions to help their
members gain greater financial security.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of white Americans own homes, compared with
just over 45 percent of blacks. And while the booming economy has
meant overall low unemployment in Massachusetts and across the
nation, the unemployment rate for blacks is more than twice as high
as for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, economic expansion has been a tide that has lifted
all boats, with per capita income going up for all groups over the
years. But in 1998, blacks still earned 39 percent less than whites
per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Rev. Jesse Jackson's new book on personal finance,
``It's About the Money,'' which Jackson co-wrote with his son, Hurt
said economic empowerment is ``the next phase of the civil rights
struggle. How do you build sustainable and economically healthy
communities, those that generate wealth and allow people to live
there in decency?''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Point Coalition and the Black Ministerial Alliance of
Greater Boston are among the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's
partners in the conference on engaging the black church in economic
development. Others include the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute at
Harvard, the Harvard Divinity School, and the American Baptist
Churches of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The black church's interest in economic development and
wealth-building may be particularly keen now because of how well
the stock market and economy have done, said Ronald Ferguson, an
economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and one of the
speakers at the Boston Fed conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that people are more hopeful right now because the
economy is in good shape,'' said Ferguson, who will lead a workshop
on community development. ``People think, `If not now, then when?'
That may be why now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Weekes, assistant vice president in public and community
affairs for the Boston Fed, said she sees the black church's
involvement in economic development as an extension of its historic
role in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a new mission for the black church,'' Weekes
said. ``I think that what we see is a request for the tools from
getting from A to Z, of really catching up with the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 people from around the country have registered for
the conference, which is being cosponsored by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as being a catalyst,'' Weekes said,``whereby
we help to provide the necessary tools that will spark this
economic engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in Boston, the black church is helping to keep that
economic engine going, through efforts of such organizations as the
Black Ministerial Alliance, the Ten Point Coalition, and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, another group that Hurt of the Ten Point Coalition
is involved with, the Urban Christian Economic Partnership, has
submitted a $3.8 million proposal to the city of Boston to develop
the boarded-up city-owned Silva Building in Grove Hall into a
retail and office complex.
</P>
<P>
   If the city decides to grant the partnership of black preachers
the project, ``what that does in terms of wealth creation, job
creation, is absolutely mind-boggling,'' said Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater
Boston and affiliated organizations have launched a 50-week program
at various Boston-area black churches to teach methods for building
financial assets and purchasing a home.
</P>
<P>
   Participants save $30 a week over the course of the 50 weeks,
for a total of $1,500, and get matching funds of another $6,000
toward a home purchase, plus closing costs paid by the city,
according to Concord Baptist Church's Kelley, economic chairman for
the alliance, and the Rev. Wesley Roberts, president of the
alliance and head of the People's Baptist Church in Boston's South
End.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent evening session at Concord Baptist Church, Kelley,
a former banker, prodded participants and gave them hope, talked of
the racism he has felt himself in the home-buying process, and
provided detailed information about adjustable mortgages and
private mortgage insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on the way,'' he told the group, which calls itself
``Eyes on the Prize,'' the prize being homeownership. Those who
attended all said they were gaining confidence that they would be
able to buy a house in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cotton, 35, a receptionist, said her 4-month-old
grandson, whom she sometimes cradled in her arms during the
meeting, ``is one of my reasons for buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly M. Nisbett, 52, who works in accounts receivable at a
Boston hospital, said she was never interested in buying a house
until rents started going up so high. ``I'm sick of people
controlling my destiny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Eron Senfuma, 36, who works at a hospital, said she looks
forward to owning a home, just as her sister does. ``It's a
privilege,'' she said.

Flashman and the Tiger 
By George MacDonald Fraser 
Knopf, 347 pp. $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You think twice about committing murder when you're over
seventy,'' muses Sir Harry Flashman at the start of the title story
of ``Flashman and the Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Flashman know he's always thought twice about committing
murder, not because of any moral compunctions but because he's
yellow to the bone. Still, over a long career he's managed to
dispatch several score of ``the Queen's enemies . . . to say
nothing of various bad men and oddsbodies who've had the misfortune
to cross me when my trigger finger was jumpy. More than a hundred,
easy, I should think _ which ain't a bad tally for a true blue
coward who'd sooner shirk a fight than eat his dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the 11th in the series of George MacDonald Fraser's
comic historical fictions chronicling the adventures of this lucky
rogue as he lies, cheats, and fornicates his way through some of
the grandest and goriest events of the 19th century _ the Taiping
Revolt, the Sepoy Mutiny, the charge of the 21st Lancers at
Balaklava, the Battle of Little Big Horn, and John Brown's raid on
Harpers Ferry, to name just a few of the tricky situations Flashy
has fled. Though ever in retreat, Flashman has managed to earn a
reputation as a hero, ``the kind of derring-do idiot who'd answer
the call of duty and danger.''
</P>
<P>
   That reputation is Flashman's curse. He doesn't deserve it, yet
he's always being called upon to live up to it. Brigadier General
Harry Paget Flashman is on the far side of 60 in each of the three
novellas that make up ``Flashman and the Tiger,'' but age hasn't
slowed him down. He's still as crooked, as cowardly, and as randy
as ever. And he's still being prevailed upon to uphold Britannia's
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has been having fun with Flashman for 30-odd years. Fans
of the series know the premise, that Fraser is merely the editor of
Sir Harry's memoirs, which turned up in manuscript form at auction
in 1966. Flashman, the cowardly bully of Thomas Hughes's ``Tom
Brown's Schooldays,'' went on to become ``the celebrated Victorian
soldier, scoundrel, amorist and self-confessed poltroon.'' So the
story goes. The conceit is that Fraser has barely edited the
Flashman papers except to correct spelling and grammar and to
append erudite (and very amusing) notes explaining the historical
context. The Flashman novels are grounded in real events, but they
needn't be read in order. You can start anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, the shortest of the three in this volume,
Flashman is contemplating murder to save the honor of his
granddaughter Selina, who faces a Fate Worse Than Death unless
grandpa intervenes. The cad menacing Selina's virtue is Colonel
John Sebastian ``Tiger Jack'' Moran, a villain from the Sherlock
Holmes stories, Professor Moriarty's right-hand man. Flashman has a
brief encounter with Holmes and Dr. Watson that is one the funniest
passages Fraser has ever written. This story has a neat twist when
Selina proves herself a Flashman through and through, to her
grandfather's dismay and delight.
</P>
<P>
   The story ``The Subtleties of Baccarat'' is set around the
Tranby Croft affair, a card-cheating scandal involving the Prince
of Wales (``Dirty Bertie,'' Flashman calls him) that rocked
Victorian society. Flashman's wife, the ``feather-brained''
Elspeth, plays a pivotal role in the scandal, revealing a shameless
cunning that shocks even her jaded husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to Charing Cross,'' the longest of the three stories,
has Flashman at first enticed, then coerced, into a plot to foil an
attempt to assassinate Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary. The
enticement comes in the form of Caprice, French showgirl turned
master spy, a character who seems more James Bond than Flashman.
Bill von Starnberg _ son of the late Rudi, the charming cutthroat
of ``Royal Flash'' _ provides the coercion. Bill is as dangerous as
his father and then some, having been sent to an English public
school to hone his villainous skills. (He quotes his father on the
subject: ``There's no education like it _ a lifetime's trainin' in
knavery packed into six years.'') The plot is vintage Flashman _
history brought to life by Flashman's refreshingly cynical view of
humankind, himself included.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The six sprite-sized Americans were sitting
as tight as piano keys on the edge of the arena floor Tuesday
night, telepathically willing a misstep by the Chinese or Russian
teams that were still competing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. gymnasts had done all they could. After finishing off
their routines with a spirited effort in the women's Olympic team
final, the competition for the defending gold medalists was over.
All they had left was the hope for an opening that would usher them
onto the stand for a bronze medal _ the perfect cure for the team's
dysfunctional state.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the Chinese revealed a steel-belted focus on the
vault, the moment the Russian Elena Zamolodtchikova blew on the tip
of her finger, as if it were a six-shooter, to punctuate her
spectacular floor routine, the American optimism was nudged aside
by the reality of an undesirable fourth-place finish. The U.S.A.
Gymnastics plan had officially failed.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the plunge of the program, to stop the embarrassing
descent of a team just four years removed from gold in Atlanta,
Bela Karolyi was pulled out of retirement last year by the U.S.A.
Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi to whip up a medal. But Tuesday
night, while the dominant Romanians were being draped with gold
medals in the Super Dome, while the Russians touched their silver
medallions and the Chinese cherished their bronze reward, the U.S.
team members were venting their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   They were just 1.075 points behind the Chinese, but that was the
difference between harmony and discord among the Americans. That
was the difference between celebrating Karolyi's impact as national
team coordinator and railing against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bela should not have had so much control,'' said Jamie
Dantzscher, who scored a 9.712 on the floor exercise. ``The
personal coaches were given no credit. He gets so much credit when
we do things right, but everyone else gets blamed when things go
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, after the United States placed a disappointing
sixth in the qualifying meet, Karolyi questioned the team's desire.
Bound to his seat in the stands because of U.S.A. Gymnastic rules
preventing non-coaches of the athletes on the floor, Karolyi was
unable to stalk the podium as he has in the past. The blustery
immigrant from Romania couldn't bear-hug the gymnasts or pound
positive vibes into their psyches; he couldn't shake their
miniature shoulders or inspire them face-to-face. If he was on the
floor Sunday night, he said he wouldn't have tolerated the flat
demeanor of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, they had much better attitude, more strength,'' said
Karolyi, who watched the team pick up their performances in every
event and show more unity as they rooted each other on. ``You could
see it, it was like, Yes, now, we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So who receives the credit for the mood improvement? Was it
Karolyi's pre-finals speech to the team? Was it the reserved
approach of Coach Kelli Hill? Tuesday night, she wore the same
conservative cloak as always, but afterward, Hill took issue with
Karolyi's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my personality to be like Bela,'' Hill said.
``It's not that I'm upset, but after I heard the things he said
following the first night, I asked him if he wanted to be out
there; and he said, No. So there you go.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the way the plan was supposed to unfold. And the
flaw in the blueprint was apparent: Colarossi should have either
given total control to Karolyi or left him enjoying his retirement.
Instead of bringing the team together, Karolyi's presence only
splintered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a great motivator, you have to connect with the
athletes,'' said assistant U.S. coach Steve Rybacki. ``There were a
number of girls on this team that he didn't make a connection
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher, One of Rybacki's gymnasts, was exhibit one. She
resented the treatment she received from Karolyi after she rolled
her ankle last week. Tuesday night, Dantzscher said she had been
ignored by Karolyi, who openly criticized her for being
inconsistent in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' Dantzscher said. ``I wasn't treated as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the gymnasts supported Karolyi, at least to an extent.
Two of the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven _ Amy Chow
and Dominique Dawes _ were in Atlanta to feel the power of
Karolyi's persuasiveness up close on the floor. Chow and Dawes
praised Karolyi for being a motivator, but Dawes wondered if his
faith in her had waned over the years.
</P>
<P>
   If so, she wanted to prove him wrong in her final competition.
Dawes helped give the U.S. a chance to medal Tuesday night by
scoring a 9.7 in the team's best event of the night: the uneven
bars. After the team scraped by on the treacherous balance beam _
with no dazzling scores, but no disastrous falls, either _ the
Americans ended their night on the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hope,'' said Kristin Maloney, who scored a 9.737 on the
floor, and was part of a great last effort by the United States.
``We knew we were still alive. Then, we had to watch and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   A collapse by the Russians might have seemed unthinkable. But
just an event earlier, the diva of the uneven bars, Svetlana
Khorkina, stunned everyone when she crashed to the mat. The Chinese
seemed unflappable, but the team had been vulnerable on the vault
apparatus before, the same event that loomed at the end of their
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there would be a mistake,'' Karolyi said. ``But it
didn't happen.'' For the first time since 1988, the American
gymnasts left the Olympic stage without a medal.

   TAKE-BOS  
 ABOARD THE M/S RIVER HARMONY IN EUROPE: ... and castles.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our first stop in Germany was Passau, a border town at the
confluence of the Danube, the Inn, and the Ilz rivers, where we
went to the 15th-century St. Stephan's Cathedral for a recital on
what we were told was the largest organ in the world. It has 17,774
pipes, 233 stops, and four carillons. In Passau, we met our first
local guide, Anita. (On some occasions, local guides conducted our
tours, but our Grand Circle guides were always there.) Anita told
us about Passau and the heavy bombing it experienced in World War
II in which 230 out of a population of 3,400 were killed. The Nazis
burned all Passau's bridges when they left the day before the city
surrendered to the United States on May 2, 1945, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities we visited, like Cologne and Heidelberg, had also
been bombed and, in talking about the war, our guides never
diminished the role Nazi Germany played in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our next port was Regensburg, a pretty town we were told was
Germany's largest, best-preserved medieval city where there was no
major bombing in the war.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the relaxed pace of the tour, we sometimes
explored a place on our own without Mike, Klaus, and Heiner.
Regensburg was one of them and it was fun to wander around a
strange place with only a map and a leaflet about it in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who weren't interested in all the tours _ very
few were not _ there was the option of staying aboard ship and
sipping cappuccino from the 24-hour coffee machine in the lobby or
something stronger at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed pace was perfect for people with walking problems.
``We find this more relaxing,'' said Juanita Garten of Towson, Md.,
who has taken five river trips with her husband, Bill. A hip
replacement and now bad knees have slowed him down, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a bus driver named Hermann drove us to Kelheim, our
next port, to visit the Weltenburg Monastery, the site of ``the
world's oldest monastic brewery.'' Our guide told us that Father
Leopold, one of the 12 monks at the monastery, ``might sing for
us.'' Father Leopold informed us that the monastery was started in
1050 and was in baroque design with an onion-shaped tower, but I
can't remember if he sang. I was too busy thinking of the Asam Bock
Beer the monks brew there.
</P>
<P>
   At Kelheim, we left the Danube and entered the Main-Danube
Canal, along which, we were told, our ship would pass through 53
locks and rise to its highest point, 1,340 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer came aboard to talk to us about the locks and told
us that, though the canal was a dream of Charlemagne in 793 as a
route through Europe for his battle fleet, it opened only eight
years ago. When we reached the ``Watershed Monument,'' the canal's
highest point, we received certificates as ``Class A River
Sailor,'' though we had done nothing but observe.
</P>
<P>
   We had all heard of our next port, Nurenberg, because of the
Nazi war crimes trials held there from 1945 to 1949, but we were
unable to enter the Hall of Justice where they were held because
cases were being heard. We had a fascinating tour of the Germanic
National Museum, part of which is housed in a former Carthusian
monastery, and we saw the house of the artist, Albrecht Durer. We
stopped to sample the gingerbread and sausages for which Nurenberg
is justly famous.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us won't forget Bamberg because Tim Collins of
Gatlinburg, Tenn., got lost there. Bamberg is a charming little
town with winding streets, lined with tall, narrow, pastel stucco
houses in the Regnitz &UR;  &LR; River Valley. It was here, at a local pub,
that we sampled ``rauchbier,'' or smoked beer. (The malt is smoked
over beechwood and it really does taske smoky.)
</P>
<P>
   We all had a good laugh at Tim's expense and he good-naturedly
laughed with us. ``I told him to stay put while I did some
shopping,'' his wife, Barb, said, ``but he came looking for me.
When I came back for him, he was gone. He got lost and hailed a
police cruiser.'' Minutes later, Barb saw the cruiser speeding by.
``That's my husband!'' she said of the man in the front seat. Mike,
our guide, radioed ahead and the police came back with a sheepish
Tim.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember Wurzburg, promoted as the ``home of Germany's
largest wine-growing estates,'' for the wine tasting at the House
of Franconia. There, our local guide, Karl Heinz Pfaff, told us
that the winery supplies wine to a home for the elderly. ``We're
not cultivating elderly alcoholics,'' he said, ``but the average
age there is 86.''
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged us to ``drink your first glass of Franconia wine
when you get up in the morning, another before going to bed, and we
guarantee you won't die in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Back aboard River Harmony, we were entertained that night by a
group playing medieval music on a shepherd's horn, a dulcimer, and
zither. On other nights, there were programs of zither and
hackbrett (a sort of xylophone) music, a glassblower at work, and a
yodeler.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, our captain set sail for Wertheim.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheim is another river town located at the confluence of two
rivers, the Tauber and the Main. It was a Sunday and those of us in
Heiner's group followed him around its winding cobbled streets
across a bridge spanning the Tauber.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner told us how Wertheim folks are one-up on the tax
collector and showed us a house that was narrow at the bottom,
where the assessment is made, and wider on the top. We also learned
that Wertheimers liked clean streets. Here and there were automatic
machines dog owners can put in a coin to get bag, gloves, and
scooper to tidy up after their pets.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, again at midnight, River Harmony sailed for
Aschaffenburg, site of the Johannisburg Castle and the State
Gallery, housing Old Dutch and German masters. From here, we took a
1 1/2-hour bus ride to Heidelberg, past vineyards and fields of
asparagus, potatoes, and grain.
</P>
<P>
   In Heidelberg _ its university boasts ``the most Nobel Prize
winners in the world'' _ we learned that the city was not destroyed
in the war, either because of its university or because the United
States wanted to garrison there, or both. We climbed the steps of
the university's graffiti-adorned student jail for pranksters or
worse. It was last used in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   While we were in Heidelberg, River Harmony sailed on to Mainz
where we started on the Rhine. When we arrived at Mainz by bus from
Heidelberg, we found River Harmony docked at a pier lined with
plane treees and learned from Klaus at a port talk that Mainz was
founded in 38 BC as a Roman garrison and now has a population of
130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Gutenberg, whose printing press produced the Gutenberg
Bible around 1450, was a native of Mainz, and we visited his
workshop at the Gutenberg Museum. Mainz has a huge cathedral on
which construction was started in 975 and is the center of the
Rhine wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhine, with its heavy river traffic and more industrial
setting, seemed different than the Danube, with its dreamy
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the pretty little town of Rudesheim by the
banks of the Drosselgasse River, we learned that it was the center
of red wine production on the Rhine and that a big wine festival is
held there every August.
</P>
<P>
   In Rudesheim, we had dinner at a restaurant off the ship, one of
several such occasions that gave us a chance to meet locals. The
Rudesheim Schloss was full of Bavarian atmosphere and musicians in
lederhosen. We all danced and drank fine wines and got a ride back
to the ship in a cable trolley.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Germany was nostalgic for many on the trip. Some of
the men had fought there in World War II. The Booths, who are
British, were living in Coventry, England, when the Germans bombed
it. Dorothy Zeck of Glenn Heights, Texas, passed up the night out
in Rudesheim for a reunion with Norbert Stoll, now 45, who had
stayed at her home in Wisconsin as an exchange student 29 years ago
while her son, Mark, stayed at his.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we docked on the Mosel River to stop at Koblenz,
which, according to our guide Mike was once an important Roman city
and was heavily destroyed in World War II. One of its churches, the
Church of Our Lady, has three styles of architecture _ Romanesque
towers, a Gothic chapel, and a Baroque, onion-shaped dome.
</P>
<P>
   At Cologne, we visited the awe-inspiring Gothic Cologne
Cathedral with its soaring 515-foot spires and stained glass
windows. We learned that the cathedral was partially damaged in the
war and that 95 percent of the city was destroyed, that it has the
most Romanesque churches in Europe _ and 20 breweries.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam was our last port of call. While some of the
passengers were to continue with Klaus by bus to Brussels for a
three-day tour, it would be goodbye for most of us the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Our last day aboard ship was full. We visited the Vincent van
Gogh Museum with the world's largest collection of his works, stood
outside the house where Anne Frank and her family hid from the
Nazis during the war, and took a cruise on Amsterdam's busy canals.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, we went on a walking tour with our guides of
Amsterdam's infamous Red Light district where the ladies of the
evening exhibit their attributes in large display windows.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner had told us no one was obliged to go on this tour, but,
as I recall, no one opted out.

   OLY-MEDIA _ Is this the ultimate confrontation between new media

other sites to get real time results (not video) of Olympic events.
Why wait 15 hours to find out who grabbed the gold when it is a key
stroke away? Nielsen/Net Ratings reports a surge in Olympic hits;
is one of those hits on conventional coverage? (Frances, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY _ Five days into the Games, everyone just
can't stop gushing about Sydney_ about much better this Olympics is
than the one in Atlanta. From transportation and atmosphere to
venues and weather, the Sydney Games seem to beat the Atlanta Games
hands down. We take a look at how Sydney managed to avoid the chaos
and crass commercialism of Atlanta and run what has been a
successful _ but costly _ Olympics. (Unger/Brock, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   OLY-STYLE _ SYDNEY _ What is the style of the Sydney Games? The
look. The flavor. The color. The scene. What are the hot selling
items. Where are people hanging. And how does it compare to
Atlanta. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 25. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-HUMMER _ SYDNEY _ The Aussie-American swimming rivalry has
to be the best rivalry in the Olympics. Thrilling races,
trash-talking swimmers, jam-packed arena of fans going nuts with
every race. Ian Thorpe gave the Aussies the upper hand with two
gold medals on the first day; the Amercan came back with two huge
wins the second day. The battle continues back-and-forth every
night at the Sydney International Aquatic Center. (Hummer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS, including one of Aussie and
U.S. flags waving together.

including Kristy Kowal going into semifinals. (Rosen, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWIM-HALL _ SYDNEY_ After breezing through a men's 100 meter
freestyle preliminary Gary Hall Jr. joked, ``It's a lot easier when
you pace yourself. Somebody should have told me that.'' Hall was
referring to the race that still resonates here, the men's 4x100
meter freestyle relay. There, he hit the wall before he touched it.
Americans aren't used to seeing Hall reeled in from behind the way
Australia's boy wonder Ian Thorpe did in that race. Not only the
relay squad, but the entire U.S. team was stunned and shaken.
(Maher, Austin American-Statesman).

(Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BELA _ SYDNEY - Not even Bela Karolyi can guarantee a medal,
it seems, but USA Gymnastics was right to give it a shot by signing
him on late in the Olympic spin cycle as national team coordinator.
Without him there is no focal point on a determined squad of
American girls who nonetheless had fourth place written all over
them in Tuesday night's team final. Without him there is no fuss,
no reason to look behind the scores and find the passion. Bela
didn't even get to stand on the floor of the Sydney Superdome, an
area reserved for coaches only, and still he burned as much energy
as any of the athletes who performed there. (George, Palm Beach
Post).
</P>
<P>
   OLY-ADS _ NBC sold more than $900 million in advertising by
telling customers primetime ratings would average 16.1 percent.
After three days, the numbers are at 14.5 percent and dropping. Ad
buyers, industry analysts and others react to the Down Under
(Projection) Games, what they mean today and what could happen in

conference. (Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 14.

<P>
   OLY-ARMSTRONG _ SYDNEY _ Lance Armstrong is the two-time
defending champion of the grueling Tour de France, professional
cycling's premier event. The Olympic competition here is a ride in
the park by comparison. Yet, the Olympics also have meaning for
Armstrong, who did not medal in two previous Games. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman).

   OLY-ARCHMAIN _ SYDNEY _ The Clark family running 800 meters. Two

   SYDNEY STYLE _ The official ``look'' of these Games may not be a
total splash. But it's safe to say the beach is back. This city is
awash in a sea of purple-blue and turquoise that's very visible.
The Sydney 2000 design team has put its wavy stamp on everything
from sports venues and staff uniforms to the paper coffee cups and
quilt comforters used in the athletes' village. (Brock, Atlanta

Australians dresses up to support their home team and a 2-column
color photo of an Olympic worker wearing a jacket with Olympic
logos.

   ANALYSIS _ How could Atlanta get it so wrong and Sydney get it
so right? As Australia pulls off an Olympic feat that ranks among
the smoothest in modern memory, that's the question everyone here
is asking. From the beauty of the city to the convenient location
of venues, just about everything about these Games is being
praised. Much of the chaos and commercialism of Atlanta is missing.
(Wendell, Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a

   TV RATINGS _ The prime-time ratings for NBC's coverage of Sydney
Games are staggering out of the starting blocks with a three-day
average of 14.5, down 32 percent from the 1996 Games in Atlanta and
10 percent from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, site of the last
offshore Summer Olympics. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CHINA-TRADE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will win Congress's
approval Tuesday afternoon for granting permanent normal trade
relations wto China, but the victory required him to buck several
key Democratic constituencies _ human rights advocates, organized
labor and environmentalists. Clinton's willingness to do so,
despite the political damage he suffered by taking the same path to
the NAFTA accord, springs from his conviction that the United
States has little choice but to wed its own economy with rapidly
developing countries around the world, even if they have
significant policy differences with us. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   GUNS-GALAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The Georgia Supreme Court Tuesday
hears arguments on the city of Atlanta's lawsuit against the gun
industry. Shortly after the city filed suit against the industry,
the General Assembly passed legislation barring such litigation.
During pre-trial motions in Fulton State Court, Judge Gino Brogdin
dismissed one part of the lawsuit but kept the rest of the suit
alive. The gun industry, saying Brogdin had no right to keep the
lawsuit alive, filed a writ of mandamus (a court petition that
demands public officials to do their job) in Fulton Superior Court.
The writ sought a judge's ruling ordering Mayor Campbell to stop
the litigation and directing Brogdin to dismiss the case in its
entirety. But Judge Themla Wyatt Cummings Moore declined to do so.
The Supreme Court hears arguments on Moore's decision. If the case
goes ahead, the city gets pre-trial discovery, something the
industry does not want at all. (Rankin, Atlanta

organized by the prestigious magazine, is sure to bring out green
envy in some Austinites during the three-day visit of the

that participants are limited to executives of companies with
assets or annual gross sales in excess of $500 million. There are a
few exceptions to the rule, however. In addition to the 150 CEOs,
the mayor, local sponsors of the event and 100 other academic,

Payton, president of Hill Street Press in Athens, ``from the

OLYMPICS COVERAGE: TRUE OR SCI-FI?

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are the Olympics taking place in the Matrix?
</P>
<P>
   I ask because the viewing experience is so . . . mediated. For
instance, I had a compelling interest in the US-China women's
soccer game; ever since Sun Wen &AMP; Co. got jobbed by Briana
Scurry-ing 5 feet off the goal line on that crucial penalty kick in
last year's World Cup, I've been slavishly rooting for the Country
Formerly Known as Red China.
</P>
<P>
   So I first learned of the 1-1 Chinese ``victory'' by logging on
to the Web Sunday morning. Soon afterward, I read a wire service
account of Kristine Lilly's missed penalty kick that would have won
the game for the Americans. Then I saw part of the game on
television early Sunday morning, on tape since it was already
Monday in Australia. Then on our Monday, I read the game story in
the Globe. But never once did I see a minute of live play.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that these Olympics are being filmed on the same
set where NASA faked the moon landings? How do we know that Bob
Ryan and Michael Holley are really in Sydney _ have you seen them
there? ``Matrix'' star Keanu Reeves visited Australia shortly
before the Olympics began. Coincidence _ or something more?
</P>
<P>
   More ravings from an Olympics-addled brain:
</P>
<P>
   --Olympic factoid: It is not true, as several American news
outlets have reported, that Sydney is the capital of Australia. The
capital of Australia, of course, is . . .
</P>
<P>
   --Bill Bryson, the reverse expatriate who has stitched together
an enviable career making sardonic comments about people
(Americans), places (Australia), and things (the Appalachian
Trail), scolds his nominal homeland _ the United States _ for its
ignorance of Aussie affairs. Fancy this, quoth Bryson: In 1997, The
New York Times printed more stories on the death of Pamela Harriman
than it did about Australia. And ``1997 was a good year for
Australian news.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? Here are two of the stories the Times did bother to
cover: March 15 _ ``Australian Prime Minister John Howard irks
Canberrans (hint, hint) by refusing to live in his official
residence, the Lodge . . . Howard prefers more cosmopolitan Sydney,
his hometown.'' April 2: ``Australian Aborigines are outraged to
learn that Leon Carmen, a middle-aged white man from Sydney, is the
true author of `My Own Sweet Time,' a best-selling book that
purports to be by an Aborigine woman named Wanda Koolmatrie. Their
outrage increases when Elizabeth Durack, a white painter from
Perth, reveals that she is the creator and seller of works of art
under the name of Eddie Burrup, a supposed Aborigine.''
</P>
<P>
   --Olympic factoid: Marion Jones posed nude for Runner's World.
</P>
<P>
   --Timing is everything: Pfizer Inc., a $30 billion
pharmaceutical conglomerate, has issued a press release touting use
of its ``natural performance enhancers'' at the Sydney Olympiad.
Champion backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg says the Pfizer program
works for him. It must; he won the gold medal in the 100-meter
backstroke Monday, which is already two days ago in Australia, but
will still be Monday when you read this in Boston. Confused? Get in
line.
</P>
<P>
   --Australian folkway you won't see discussed on NBC: Q. What's
Australian foreplay? A. ``You awake?''
</P>
<P>
   --Olympic factoid: International television networks refused to
cover the 1956 Melbourne Olympiad because they couldn't come to
terms with the International Olympic Committee on fees. So viewers
never saw one of the dramatic confrontations in the history of the
Games: Hungary's blood-in-the-pool, 4-0 water polo victory over the
Soviet Union, whose tanks were still rumbling through downtown
Budapest. If there had been a women's soccer tournament, the
Americans might have won, because China boycotted the Melbourne
games.
</P>
<P>
   --Australian folkway you won't see discussed on NBC: The cuddly
koala bear is not a bear, and it's not cuddly. It's a
solitude-seeking marsupial, and when disturbed in a tree, its first
defense is to urinate on you.

   CHINA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis. The
overwhelming Senate vote expected Tuesday comes despite many
political eruptions with China that seemed bound to blow up one of
the biggest trade deals in history: Allegations of Chinese meddling
in U.S. elections, of nuclear espionage, of arms proliferation. It
even passed at a moment when China's human rights violations are,
if anything, getting worse. But at every turn, China's economic and
political role in the world seemed to loom larger and larger. The
question now is whether China will abide by the accord, and whether
its passage will, as Clinton claims, change Beijing's behavior at
home and abroad. By David E. Sanger.

   IVORY-KING-SALMON (Undated) _ Five years ago, white king salmon
was a curiosity. But it was usually consigned to the cannery
because the demand was for the bright red flesh of wild king
salmon. White king salmon is unmistakable. Its flesh is as white as
bones. No matter that it had incomparable flavor and superb
texture. It wasn't red, or even pink. The former misfit fish is now
$20 a pound and known as ivory king salmon. And instead of being
destined for the cannery, it is bound for restaurants on the level
of Le Bernardin, Picholine and Alain Ducasse. By Amanda Hesser.

WAGE BILL GOOD FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush
are battling for the presidency, US Senator Edward M. Kennedy is
waging a battle in Congress that could affect the race for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   This congressional battle involves the Democrats' proposed
increase in the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a two-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   As many Democrats and Republicans would agree, Kennedy's
leadership is the reason the minimum wage issue is still alive this
year, and why the proposed increase has at least a chance of
passing before the expected end of this congressional session in
early October.
</P>
<P>
   The chance for passage was enhanced on Aug. 28 when GOP House
Speaker Dennis Hastert sent a letter to President Clinton proposing
a bill similar to the Senate plan to increase the minimum wage by
$1 _ 50 cents each year _ over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the GOP's and Hastert's strong opposition softened when
it became apparent that many GOP House members were becoming
vulnerable in their districts because of the Republicans' stance on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But, based on the GOP's amendments to the proposed minimum wage
increase, there is still a ways to go before the bill becomes
acceptable to Senate and House Democrats, as well as to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills calling for a raise in the minimum wage have been
passed in both the House and Senate during the past year. However,
the GOP attached so many billions of dollars in tax breaks along
with other amendments opposed by the Democrats that the bills went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main ingredients of Hastert's proposed minimum wage
increase are the same as Kennedy's bill in the Senate, the
Democrats oppose the GOP amendments attached to this bill. Among
the amendments are a huge tax break and a series of antilabor items
that include the elimination of overtime pay for millions of
workers in certain job categories.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes in the House, it will be sent to the Senate
for changes acceptable to both parties. If that occurs, the bill
will be sent to Clinton, who is likely to sign a bill that the
Democrats approve.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the Republicans apparently aware of voters'
support for a minimum wage increase, there is the possibility of a
compromise bill acceptable to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy indicated in his recently published statements, the
Democrats are on the right side of this issue. While members of
this Republican Congress found time to increase their own salaries
and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, they have not yet found
the time to pass a minimum wage increase to benefit hard-working,
low-wage Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and other Democrats argue that the minimum wage
increase, in addition to being a family issue and a labor issue, is
a civil rights issue. While African-Americans represent 17 percent
of the total work force, he said, they represent 16 percent of
those who would benefit from a minimum wage increase. In addition,
while 11 percent of the work force is Hispanic, 19 percent of the
Hispanic population would be affected directly by an increase in
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies assert that to have the same purchasing power the
minimum wage had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be $7.66
today instead of $5.15, more than $2 higher.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy concluded, it is long past time for Congress to pass
a fair minimum wage bill.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not pass a bill this year, it is likely to work
against the Republicans, including Bush. If Congress passes a bill
acceptable to the Democrats in Congress and to Clinton, it will
help Gore, who strongly backs the increase.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore and Clinton, as well as the GOP, know, if such a
bill passes, most of the credit for the increase should go to the
person who most deserves it _ Senator Kennedy.
</P>

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: BRIGHT LIGHT ON A CLOUDY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The one thing a teenager can count on is
change, abrupt and ongoing, but even by that hormonal standard,
Tasha Schwikert-Warren's Olympics were extreme. She came to Sydney
as an alternate, a dreamer, a 15-year-old with metal in her smile.
By late Tuesday night, she was hailed as the foundation and future
of the U.S. women's gymnastics team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle kid,'' Bela Karolyi raved, but only in part
because she was all he had left.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Kerri Strug, there was no Hollywood ending to
the women's team final, no U.S. medal. The only carrying on was
over Karolyi himself, a powerful and divisive presence who,
depending on the post-meet source, helped elevate the United States
to fourth place or impeded its chances to climb higher.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded like fallout from unrealistic expectation, based
on a four-year-old fairy tale. In this sport, unless you have some
kind of warehouse operation like the gold medal-winning Romanians,
four years may as well be 40. Even teenaged gymnasts have the
potential to gain weight, get bored, go to school and grow up.
</P>
<P>
   After Karolyi was rushed back this year to supervise a faltering
team, after the Magnificent Seven of Atlanta shrank to two at the
trials, it was difficult to determine if the Americans were
operating in the past or living in the present. There was around
this group an air of uncertainty, a tossing of the dice, not unlike
the craps games Schwikert-Warren's parents can be found conducting
on the night shift at Ceasar's Palace back home in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Joy, was a professional tennis player during the
1970s who played tour doubles with her identical twin, Jill. Joy
Schwikert's daughter Tasha was also a twin, but her sister died in
premature childbirth, and those two months turned out to be the
difference in Tasha's eligibility for selection as an alternate for
these Olympics under the new age restriction rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came thinking it would be a great experience just being
around the team,'' she said. Yet something strange was in the air,
the vortex of adolescent change. Seventeen-year-old Morgan White
pulled out early last week with a stress fracture in her foot. The
team's preliminary results were flat. Schwikert-Warren suddenly
found herself in three of the four routines Tuesday night, and
acquitted herself on the uneven parallel bars and in the floor
exercise with poise that even startled her coach from the Gymcats
Club in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was so enormous, I started to think she might
lose it,'' said Cassie Rice. ``But she went out on the bar and
nailed it. That's been the story of her career so far, performance
under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice had ushered Schwikert-Warren into the interviewing area
known as the mixed zone, and stood by as reporters informed her
that the great Karolyi had called her ``the one with the work
ethic, the one following directions, a leader in the next
generation.'' From high above the mats, bouncing high off muscular
legs, she hadn't looked much like the prototypical pixie. But here,
standing all of four feet 11 inches tall, it seemed incongruous,
almost unfair, to burden this 10th grader in braces with the newly
improvised set of expectations, now the result of those unmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the girls who competed here are going off to
college,'' Schwikert-Warren said. ``Realistically, I'm going to be
the only one left from this group. It is pretty scary, but I'm
going to go in there and lead the new ones the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 14-year-old sister and elite junior, Jordan, could be her
teammate by 2004, assuming, of course, that she will still have the
appetite, so to speak, for this demanding life herself. College
basketball coaches call their players kids, so what does that make
these girls? Candidates to morph into an Olympic has-been as fast
as a hand can slide off an uneven parallel bar.
</P>
<P>
   With such youth and volatility, you might expect the attending
adults to create the most stable working environments for these
girls to perform in, which was certainly not the case this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to coach the coaches,'' Bob Colarossi, the U.S.A.
Gymnastics president, said of Karolyi, and his own shortsighted
decision to bring him back as a supervising presence but not the
Olympic coach. That was Kelli Hill's job, but men such as Karolyi
do not kindly offer advice and quietly take a seat. They step on
toes with pointed heels. The Romanians, Russians and Chinese were
barely off the medal pedestals Tuesday night before the Americans
were picking sides, praising or burying Bela.
</P>
<P>
   This was one routine that Schwikert-Warren wasn't competing in.
She was too new at this, too young, and the only contact she'd ever
had with Atlanta was when she rubbed Amy Chow's souvenir ring for
good luck Tuesday night. Schwikert-Warren had the best luck of all
the Americans. A teenager's could change quickly, though,
especially if the adults in her life don't clean up their act.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In its day, Draper Laboratory worked on some of the hottest
projects in technology: strategic missiles, rescue vehicles for
submarines and the Apollo space program.
</P>
<P>
   But today that type of government research work is about as
appealing as a glass of Tang. So in a bid to move closer to the
cutting edge, and to attract the best and brightest, Draper is
dipping its toe into a new line of work.
</P>
<P>
   The lab in Cambridge, Mass. has launched a combination venture
capital fund and technology incubator, a clear recognition that the
commercial world, and the big money it offers, are a powerful lure
to today's technological elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day that was not the case,'' said Vincent Vitto,
president of Draper and a 35-year veteran of the defense research
establishment. But these days Vitto looks out his window in Kendall
Square and sees his neighbors _ the thriving electronics and
biotech companies _ throwing up new towers and hiring the talented
young scientists Draper wants to hang on to.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy seems to be: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its life, Draper was immune to commercial pressures.
From the 1930s until 1973, it was part of MIT. Founder Charles
Draper helped develop the gunsights used in World War II, and over
time, Draper and his co-workers became experts at aiming things:
bullets, rockets, missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, under pressure from Vietnam War protestors, MIT spun
off Draper as a nonprofit. The lab still does mainly government
research, much of it in the defense field. It has an annual budget
of $244 million and a staff of just over 1,000, down from a peak of
2,000 in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's new business will be called Navigator Technology
Ventures. The fund plans to invest in early stage companies in
electronics, wireless, information technology and biotechnology.
Navigator will offer start-ups money _ from $200,000 to $2 million
_ and space to work in a Draper facility. Entrepreneurs can come
from within Draper or from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Vitto is well aware that the $15 million Draper is putting up is
``small potatoes'' by venture standards. And he is under no
illusion that the world in general, and Cambridge in particular,
needs another venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   So what will make Draper's fund different?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will see a unique deal flow,'' said Gordon Baty,
cofounder of Zero Stage Capital in Cambridge, who will serve as
Navigator's chairman. ``I think they will see hard science rather
than the next furniture e-tailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Ganz, president of Navigator, makes a similar point.
``We will attract innovators with a strong technology story to
tell,'' he said. That story may be too complicated, too unsexy and
too ill-formed for the typical venture firm to consider. It may not
even come with a business plan attached. But that is OK with Ganz.
He figures that what Draper lacks in marketplace savvy, it can make
up with technological expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The lab is filled with people and equipment that can be
resources for would-be entrepreneurs. There are expensive machines
that make plastic models and clean rooms that can produce specialty
computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise _ the place feels like a laboratory. Some rooms have
flight simulators and control panels from the space program. Others
have reusable space vehicles and undersea gear. In another part of
the building people are working on miniature devices that may have
applications in biology and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the autonomous vehicle lab. The scientists who
work there all have signs on their door that read: ``My other
vehicle is unmanned.'' (It's a joke.) The lab itself is filled with
the kind of quirky inventions you might see in a James Bond movie.
There are tiny remote-controlled helicopters and a big artillery
shell that can be shot out of a cannon, and then, in midflight,
sprout a pair of wings and turn into a reconnaissance plane.
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance is a life-size robotic tuna fish,
stuffed to the gills with electronic gear. The fish was built to
see if the tuna's swimming prowess could be used in a modern
propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   Vitto hopes the venture business will have three benefits: It
will spin off money that can be plowed back into research and
employee compensation, create a bridge between the lab and the
commercial world, and give lab scientists an opportunity to be
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at a point, someone here decides they want to take the
plunge, he will be able to do it,'' said Vitto. Even without a
robotic tuna fish.

<P>
   Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   Envision Development Corp. of Marlborough, Mass., a technology
company we've been picking on since May, finally came out with
delayed news on their last fiscal quarter Monday and it wasn't
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The results: a loss of $151 million, or $13.76 per share. That's
tough stuff considering Envision only had revenue of $493,000 and a
stock price of $10.75 Monday (the news was released after the stock
market closed).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the loss didn't involve real money, but the accounting
of stock-swap deals and noncash writeoffs. Still, Envision's cash
was well below $1 million by the end of the quarter, July 29, and
the company reported negative working capital.
</P>
<P>
   Envision also said it had canceled the lease for its new
headquarters in Bridgewater; was sued by the owners of a company
acquired in a stock swap; and was fighting in court with its former
chief executive, William Patch, who the company said was fired for
cause.

Gore presses his populist challenge in North Hills, Calif.,

credibility, urging the vice president to explain his claim in
Florida that the pharmaceutical industry has forced his
mother-in-law to pay nearly three times as much for arthritis
medicine as the amount Gore pays for a similar drug used by his

WHY DOES A WHIP CRACK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What causes the sound made by cracking a whip? I can't
believe the end of the whip is exceeding the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
   _ B.C., Manchester, Vt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, the tip does indeed go faster than sound. The trick with
a whip is that it's tapered so as to be thin at the far end. If you
shake the thick end (the one in your hand), you can make a little
wave go down the whip. The energy carried by the wave depends on
two things _ how fast the wave goes and how much mass is being
wiggled. Faster motion or more mass mean more energy, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Now to keep energy conserved, the lighter parts of the rope
where it's thinner have to go faster, and the net result is that
the end can wind up going faster than sound (which is only about
760 miles per hour at sea level).
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever anything moves faster than sound, you get an
effect called a ``sonic boom.'' The idea is easy to understand.
Disturbances in air move at the speed of sound. If an object moves
slower than the speed of sound, the air around it can always get
away. If it moves faster than sound, the air it pushes can't get
away and piles up into a sharp front that your ear hears as a loud
``crack.'' And that's how a whip works.

CATHOLIC VOTE PRIZED, BUT TOUGH TO DEFINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ From the asphalt playground at St. Albert the
Great Church to the manicured gardens at St. Charles Borromeo's,
this middle-class suburb has a booming population of the voters
most in demand this election year: Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   People like Diane Fowler, a 33-year-old full-time mom, who says
she has one political concern _ abortion _ and so plans to vote for
the Republican nominee, Texas Governor George W. Bush. And Gerald
E. Dolle, a 62-year-old landscaper who says Catholics should be
concerned about the poor, so he's voting for the Democrat, Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the real targets of the presidential campaigns are people
like Margaret A. Jerome, a 78-year-old retired Navy medic, whose
vote is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care much for Gore, because he's for the abortion
business, and that's against our faith,'' Jerome said. ``But Bush
is something else with his business with medical insurance. I don't
trust either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember angry white males? Soccer moms? Well, this year, the
prized political constituency is Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conscious effort on the part of both campaigns to
focus more on the Catholic vote than ever before,'' said James S.
Nathanson, a former political director at the Republican National
Committee who is now a consultant in nearby Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics have become the constituency of the moment thanks to a
coincidence of geography and politics.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Republicans seem to have locked up much of the
South and inland West, and Democrats the Northeast and West Coast,
the election of 2000 is widely expected to be fought in a handful
of states in the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Those very states, thanks to 19th-century immigration patterns
driven by industry and agriculture, are home to above-average
numbers of Catholics. In Ohio, for example, Catholics are expected
to make up as much as 35 percent of the vote, compared to perhaps
27 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have travelled repeatedly to Ohio, which has the
seventh-largest number of electoral votes, and are waging active
campaigns here in Montgomery County, considered critical swing
territory.Last week Gore and his running mate, Connecticut Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman, spoke at a middle school in Miamisburg, near
Kettering, and Gore doubled the size of his paid staff in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic voters interviewed here last week made it clear
that it will be difficult for the candidates to craft a single
message that will appeal to large numbers of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Catholics, like Fred L. Billow, 58, of
Centerville, who are committed Republicansand disgusted, as Billow
put it, with ``the immorality of the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also Democrats, like Karyn J. Hecker, the principal of
Dayton Catholic Elementary School, who said she leans Democratic
``because I think there's so much more we can do for people, and
somebody's got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates are fighting over the swing voters in the
Catholic population: those who say they could go either way.
``They're both decent and good men, but I don't know how they will
be as president,'' said Ruth Magoto, 79, of Kettering. ``I want to
know more about the issues, like Social Security and good
schooling. They both have a program, but neither one has any idea
of what should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics _ because they were immigrants, often working class,
and members of a sometimes unpopular religious minority _
gravitated to the Democratic party in the mid-19th century, and
their loyalty was buttressed when the Democrats nominated for
president Catholics Al Smith 1928 and John F. Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Catholics has since dramatically improved ; they
are the largest single religious denomination in the country and
are on average more affluent and better educated than Protestants.
But Catholics have remained the most Democratic group of white
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics did provide important support to Republicans Richard
Nixon, in 1968 and 1972, and Ronald Reagan, in 1980 and 1984. But
they supported Democrat Bill Clinton by a larger margin than the
general public in 1992 and 1996, and some believe they will do the
same for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in Democratic Party identification among Catholics
seems to have leveled off and may even be reversing,'' according to
a new study of American Catholics, ``Catholicism USA,'' published
by Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the 1996 election, the Republican National
Committee set up a Catholic Task Force in an effort to improve the
party's showing among Catholics. The task force, now headed by
Philadelphia adman Brian P. Tierney, is doing everything from
talking up how compassionate conservatism fits the Catholic social
ethic to making sure that Republicans appear at Catholic festivals
and feast day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee sneers at the Republican
outreach effort, which DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus characterized
as ``damage control.'' Backus said the Democratic Party's social
and foreign policy positions more closely resemble those of the
American bishops, and a large fraction of Catholic voters favor
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question Catholic voters are essential, but you
can't pull them out solely based on religion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither party speaks directly to all elements of
Catholic social teaching, a philosophy described by the late
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago as ``the seamless garment'' of
life. That Catholic political philosophy embraces opposition not
only to abortion but also to capital punishment and assisted
suicide and support for programs to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy makes Catholics what political scientists call a
``cross-pressured'' group. They are pulled left by traditional
loyalties, concern for the poor, and, sometimes, attitudes toward
the death penalty. But they are pulled right by economic
self-interest, opposition to abortion, and conservatism on moral
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have both had bumps along the road in their
courtship of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attracted significant _ and unwelcome _ press attention
when he spoke in February at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist
college in South Carolina with a history of anti-Catholicism. And
Republicans in the House leadership further offended Catholics by
nixing a Catholic priest who had been recommended for House
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   But those events appear to be history; Bush apologized for a
``missed opportunity'' at Bob Jones, and the House gave the
chaplaincy to another Catholic priest. Bush attended the funeral of
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, met privately with Cardinal
Bernard F. Law of Boston, and has consulted many other Catholic
leaders, including former Boston mayor Raymond L. Flynn, over the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has had his own problems with the Catholic hierarchy
because of his support for abortion rights. In June, a bishop in
Scranton, Pa. refused to allow Gore to campaign at a Catholic
hospital. And although Gore reached out to the Catholic hierarchy
by issuing a last-minute invitation to Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los
Angeles to speak at the Democratic National Convention, the
cardinal was given a mid-day speaking slot sure to garner little
news attention for his anti-abortion message.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts question whether there really is a Catholic vote,
or whether Catholics are simply too diverse _ ethnically,
geographically, and in terms of religiosity _ to have any identity
separate from that of the broader electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are more than 62 million Catholics in the U.S.,
but there are the Catholics you see faithfully every Sunday in
church, there are the Catholics from after Vatican II who don't
vote according to church values and principles, and there are the
Catholics who are Catholic in name only,'' said Flynn, the former
mayor and ambassador to the Vatican who is now attempting to create
a stronger voice for Catholics as president of the Catholic
Alliance. ``If you put those three categories together, they make
up a pretty big chunk of votes, but they don't vote that way, so
it's one of the weakest constituencies in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Catholics are much more divided between the parties than
are either African-American Protestants or Jews, who are
overwhelmingly Democratic, or white evangelical Protestants, who
are consistently Republican. It is the failure of Catholics to
firmly align with either party that makes them a ripe target for
campaigns looking for voters to sway.
</P>
<P>
   And the days when Catholic priests could guide the voting
behavior of their parishioners are long gone. In Massachusetts, for
example, Bishop William Murphy recently wrote in a column for the
diocesan newspaper, ``I fail to understand how any Catholic can
support a candidate who is outspokenly and unambiguously
pro-choice.'' But the Bay State, which has a Catholic majority, is
represented by two Catholic Democrats in the US Senate and a
Catholic Republican in the governor's office _ and all of them
support abortion rights.

<P>
   You know whether you're right-handed or left-handed. But how can
you tell which leg you favor?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., have a leg
up on the rest of us. As they explained in the December 1998
Journal of Orthopedics and Sports Physical Therapy, you should try
kicking a ball, standing on one leg or swinging a leg over a box.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, pick up a marble with your toes, and trace a triangle
with your toes. Which leg did you use?
</P>
<P>
   If you're right-handed, you probably used just one leg for most
of the exercises _ but if you're a lefty, you probably alternated
between legs.
</P>
<P>
   The study didn't show a pattern between favored hand and favored
leg. But it did show that right-handed people are likely to have a
dominant leg, while left-handed people show less leg preference.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say knowing leg preference is important if
you're ever injured and need rehabilitation. But by then it may be
too late to find out, so you'd better start researching the matter
quickly.

MONEY FOR SCIENCE MAKES A COMEBACK

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Can we get Arthur Jaffe into that Domenici
meeting?'' Kevin Casey asked his fellow lobbyists during a
last-minute huddle on Capitol Hill last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew. Casey furrowed his brow, his mind racing.
</P>
<P>
   For it was Jaffe, a Harvard University mathematician and marquee
name in his field, who was the linchpin to Casey's day. The closer.
The man whose credentials were impressive enough that he just might
convince aides to Senator Pete Domenici
</P>
<P>
   of New Mexico _ a key architect of the federal budget _ that
Congress should pour much more money into science research.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year when many Republicans and Democrats want to
boost spending on popular programs, Jaffe and dozens of colleagues
came here last week for ``Science Day 2000,'' a daylong lobbying
campaign that, in recent years, has helped secure an explosion of
federal spending on biomedical research.
</P>

   The message, carried by professors, students, and university
presidents, is kept simple: Universities can create the Internets
and vaccines of tomorrow, but only if they have enough money from
the government to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the country's well-being today is coming from
science and inventions of 30 years ago,'' said Jaffe, whose long,
wavy gray hair marks him as an outsider among the well-shorn styles
of the full-time lobbyists. ``We're worried about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the ethos of the Science Coalition, one of the newest,
and more effective, advocacy groups for campus research.
</P>
<P>
   As lobbyists, they're more academic than Armani. But to see them
as tweedy misses the point: The coalition is trying to make a
smart, objective case, based on facts instead of flash, that
everything from the economy to health prospers from federal dollars
flowing to university labs.
</P>
<P>
   While some research experts dispute their main point _
contending the government is spending too much too hastily, without
setting the right priorities _ Jaffe and his colleagues appear to
be winning the argument with their analysis. ``I'm here as an
educator, educating,'' Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're informing people, really,'' added Jerome I. Friedman, a
physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reminding
Jaffe that, to members of Congress, ` ``educating' can sound
pejorative.''
</P>
<P>
   Employing professors as neo-lobbyists is one of several tactics
used by the coalition, which was created by Harvard, MIT, and four
other schools in 1993 to repair and strengthen higher education's
science agenda in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the end of the Cold War had deprived researchers of
their traditional weapon: Arguing that campus-led advances in
science and technology helped build a strong defense. Congress,
meanwhile, was still feeling a hangover from the last recession,
and wanted to rein in spending. And universities were reeling from
embarrassing accusations that some had overcharged the government
for research-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seemed the political consensus for federally funded
campus research _ which MIT's Vannevar Bush had so carefully built
50 years earlier _ was at risk of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real low point,'' said Charles M. Vest, the president
of MIT. ``Many of the universities, and many in the science and
engineering community, got a little bit fat and happy, and had an
attitude that what they did was really important and everyone else
ought to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest began to make monthly trips to Washington and talk up
science research to anyone who'd listen. But the times called for a
less ad hoc approach. Jim Rowe, a former Harvard official, proposed
that universities form a modern-day lobbying operation _ political
consultants, alliances, letter-writing campaigns, the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities of all kinds could come together, share notes,
share their intelligence _ and have a broad geographic reach,''
said Casey, an affable Harvard lobbyist who sits on the coalition's
steering committee. ``You could have the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas in a coalition, and then have a chance to talk to senators
from Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has since grown to include 62 institutions, which each
pay $10,000 to finance its agenda: Increase research funds for the
National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the
Department of Energy, and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the coalition's budget goes to a lobbying contract
with podesta.com, a firm co-founded by John Podesta, the current
White House chief of staff. While school officials do their own
lobbying, they rely on political advice and strategy from the paid
pros.
</P>
<P>
   Missi Tessier, a principal at podesta.com, said she tells
university lobbyists and professors to use clear examples of how
science improves everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is effective as long as people who haven't taken a
science class since the 11th grade can understand it,'' Tessier
said. ``If you can point to something on the desk _ a Palm Pilot, a
cell phone, a pacemaker _ you have to draw it back to that increase
in NSF funding.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pacemaker has proven the more powerful symbol. The
coalition, along with patient's groups, disease fighters, and other
associations, have helped persuade members of Congress _ especially
those who have suffered from illness _ to commit to doubling the
NIH's budget in five years.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the NIH _ the largest federal source of campus-based
research _ could receive as much as a $2.7 billion increase, which
would keep it on the doubling track.
</P>
<P>
   The physical sciences and engineering have not done nearly as
well as the life sciences, however. In 1970, the three received
about $5 billion each from the government; today, in constant
dollars, only the spending on the life sciences has grown _ to
roughly triple where it had been 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The stagnant budgets in the other two sectors is short-sighted,
Jaffe argues. Biomedical research can only go so far without
innovations, like the CAT scans, X-rays, robots, and other tools,
that rely on physics, mathematics, and engineering. And, while NIH
researchers helped crack the human genome, how much good will the
data be without the technologies to apply it?
</P>
<P>
   The coalition now wants a doubling goal for the NSF budget as
well, which has grown much more modestly than NIH spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go asking for just our discipline, we go asking for
what the whole country needs: Broad support for all the sciences,''
Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all supporters of science research are behind these goals,
however. Some _ including a few members of Congress _ question
whether universities have the infrastructure and ideas to absorb
huge, annual increases in spending. Some also want more
accountability: How is the money used? What are the specific
payoffs? How quickly do they come?
</P>
<P>
   Jill Chopyak, executive director of the Loka Institute, an
Amherst-based group that argues for socially responsible science
and research, said the NSF and the parts of the NIH lack detailed
spending agendas that are tied to improving the health and lives in
local communities. They do too much basic research, she said,
compared to efforts that make a direct impact.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe and his lobbying team made similar arguments on the Hill
last week. With Science Coalition buttons pinned to their lapels
and blouses, about 75 lobbyists, professors, and members of
scientific societies turned out for Science Day 2000. They
fortified themselves with a strategy breakfast of scrambled eggs,
baked apples, and tips on lobbying (``Start off all meetings by
thanking everyone''), then fanned out for more than 50 meetings
with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, in most cases, with the members' aides.
</P>
<P>
   The message _ replete with leaflets and ``open letters'' to
pledge support to the spending cause _ was generally well received,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe, meanwhile, got his meeting in Senator Domenici's office.
Which made lobbyist Casey breathe easier, confident that the star
power of a leading researcher would convey the coalition's message
in the best light possible.

<P>
   This goes beyond baseball on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball when the kids come home from school and
baseball when you tuck them in at night.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball during happy hour and baseball during closing
time.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball in the afternoon heat and baseball during the
evening chill.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball during Oprah and baseball just before Leno.
</P>
<P>
   This is as much baseball as the Red Sox ever have squeezed into
such a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   And, it is hoped, this will be baseball with no more rain.
</P>
<P>
   Five games are scheduled in the next 52 hours or so between the
Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. A night game Tuesday, followed by
back-to-back, separate-admission day-night doubleheaders. A playoff
spot is at stake; two pitching staffs are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is the result of a deluge that washed away a
three-game series between the Sox and Indians back on Easter
weekend in April. One of those games was made up June 8, when the
Sox gave up a day off between South Florida and Atlanta and flew
home to beat the Tribe behind Pedro Martinez, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the teams had no other choice but to make up the other two
games this week, during the Indians' only other trip into town. For
the Sox, this will make three day-night doubleheaders in the span
of six days, since they played two games in Detroit last Saturday,
splitting with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, meanwhile, have been saddled with another day-night
doubleheader Monday in Cleveland against different opponents: a
makeup game against the White Sox in the afternoon, followed by a
regularly scheduled night game against the Twins. That's happened
only one other time in history, when the St. Louis Cardinals played
the New York Giants and Boston Braves on the same day in
Sportsman's Park Sept. 13, 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had hoped to make up the game with the White Sox the
day after the season. But with the possibility that the outcome of
the makeup game could create a tie in the wild-card race that would
require a one-game playoff the next day _ when the playoffs are
scheduled to begin _ Gene Orza, the associate general counsel for
the Players Association, reluctantly decided that the game had to
be played Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you the Indians didn't want to play Monday,''
Orza said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's, who also are battling for a playoff berth,
haven't escaped the day-night doubleheader craze. They were
scheduled to play the Orioles twice Tuesday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be a bad year early in the season,''
Orza said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been nine day-nighters scheduled in the
American League, four in the National League, and the historic
interleague one between the Yankees and Mets, in which the teams
played in Shea Stadium in the afternoon and at Yankee Stadium that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleheaders, of course, are almost as old as the game itself.
According to the Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the first major
league doubleheader took place Sept. 25, 1882, between Worcester
and Providence, both of the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to play doubleheaders all over, every Sunday,'' said
Johnny Pesky, the former Sox shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Bresciani, the Sox vice president for public affairs,
remembers his father taking him on alternate Sundays to either
Braves Field or Fenway Park to see the Boston Braves or the Sox in
doubleheaders. Holiday doubleheaders also were a staple. But with
the advent of expansion in 1961, doubleheaders became fewer in
number, and a rare occurrence after another round of expansion in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Pesky's day, doubleheaders could be played in about as
much time as it takes to play one game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd play games in just over two hours, and a good pitching
duel would be done in less than two,'' Pesky said.
</P>
<P>
   With games routinely lasting three hours-plus today, there's no
one clamoring for doubleheaders, Bresciani said, ``except for the
nostalgia buffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But two teams, Orza said, the Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, were
given permission to schedule one day-night doubleheader a year
because they played in the smallest ballparks in their leagues and
couldn't recoup revenue lost from a rainout unless they were
allowed separate-admission games.
</P>
<P>
   In both 1971 and '72, Bresciani said, the Sox had three
day-night doubleheaders, and two in 1973. The only other year they
had more than one since then, he said, was 1989, when they also had
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, Orza said, have probably requested more
split-admission doubleheaders than any other team because they have
sold out 446 consecutive games at Jacobs Field and thus are in
position to issue rain checks when a game is washed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, they're now being hoisted by their own petard,''
Orza said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleheaders, of course, take a terrific toll on pitching
staffs. Last weekend, the Sox elected to start 39-year-old Steve
Ontiveros, who hadn't pitched in the big leagues in five years.
Wednesday night, Jimy Williams will use Pete Schourek, who needs
surgery on both his elbow and shoulder. The Indians, meanwhile,
recalled a minor leaguer, C.C. Sabathia, from the US Olympic team
in Australia in part because they may need him to pitch Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-game series against the Tigers over the weekend,
Williams used 32 of 34 healthy players on the roster. Only Tomo
Ohka and Pedro Martinez, did not play. Also sitting out were
Schourek and reliever Rich Garces, who had a strained groin but
says he will be able to pitch in this series.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sox had back-to-back doubleheaders? Six years
ago, and the Indians were involved that time, too. Both series
ended in a split. The Sox will not be satisfied with splits this
go-round. They need to win at least four of five.
</P>
<P>
   Five games. Fifty-two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves the Red Sox,'' Orza said, ``that there won't be
any more rain.''

&HT;     RICE, CITING GLUT OF RECEIVERS, LOOKS BEYOND THE NINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jerry Rice, an NFL Hall of Famer-to-be who
earlier in his career demanded the ball, now believes other 49ers
should have it more often, even if it's at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   And, with that in mind, he seemed to be saying he expects to be
playing with another team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to retire,'' Rice said in the locker room
Monday. ``I most definitely plan on playing in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes fellow wide receivers Terrell Owens, J.J.
Stokes and Tai Streets ``deserve the opportunity to play, and I
don't want to hold them back. I'll do whatever is possible so they
get the opportunity. You have to pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, whose 49er contract runs through next season, said he had
talked to his agent about his future.
</P>
<P>
   He did not reveal the details of the discussions, but said, ``I
can't walk away from something that I love and am still capable of
doing. I want to finish my career here, but it doesn't look like
that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have speculated that this will be Rice's final season in
San Francisco, as the 49ers look for more youth and more speed. A
change may be welcome by all parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry recognizes the younger receivers are anxious for their
opportunity,'' said Rice's agent, Jim Steiner. ``He's not
accustomed to playing in these conditions. It's an adjustment. At
the end of the year we'll discuss the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 37, mentioned that there doesn't seem to be enough playing
time for the current cast of four wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly wouldn't get any argument on that point from
Stokes, who barely played _ and didn't catch a pass _ in Sunday's
41-24 loss to the St. Louis Rams, after grabbing five passes for 98
yards the week before against Carolina. Stokes said he took his
case for more playing time to just about anyone who would listen in
the 49er hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let them know how I felt,'' Stokes said. ``I'm upset at not
being on the field, because I know I have a lot to offer. I feel I
should be on the field, somehow, some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes even jokingly offered to play another position, if that
would get him more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci, sounding almost apologetic, said he did
not realize until he looked at game films that Stokes ``didn't get
many snaps,'' and added, ``We've got to share the load a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   However they feel about their roles, none of the receivers is
pleased about the 49ers' 0-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said, ``The most important thing is for us to try to get a
win. The only thing that matters is wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated,'' said Rice, one of the team's last links to
its glory days. ``I wish I could do more, but you just have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice doesn't think the relative youth of the team should be used
as an excuse for not winning, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third game,'' he said. ``These guys are grown-ups
now. They're not wet behind the ears anymore. They've got to go out
and play.''

MERCURY DANGER RISING, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rain in New England contains up to four times the level of
mercury that the federal government considers safe for aquatic
life, according to a new report from the National Wildlife
Federation, suggesting that the risk of eating freshwater fish in
the region is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Coal-burning power plants, trash incinerators, and other
industrial sources in New England spew 35,000 pounds of mercury
into the air each year, which later falls into lakes and rivers
with rainfall. Less than a teaspoon of mercury can contaminate a
25-acre lake.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has already been done to reduce human exposure to mercury,
including the issuance of health advisories in all six New England
states, warning pregnant women and children especially not to eat
much freshwater fish, the National Wildlife Federation, an
environmental advocacy group, says in its report.
</P>
<P>
   But more must be done, says the report, issued on the heels of a
study showing that up to 60,000 US newborns may face neurological
damage because of mercury exposure while in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury in rain completely reverses what we've thought about
nature,'' said Andy Buchsbaum of the National Wildlife Federation,
one of the report's authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we thought that nature had ways of cleaning up
pollution, that rain cleaned up our lakes and streams,'' Buchsbaum
said. ``But now we know the opposite is true. Rain is adding
contamination to our lakes and streams, which is why we launched
this campaign to clean the rain, for the fish and for all of us who
rely on them.''
</P>
<P>
   A top New England regional official of the US Environmental
Protection Agency said the agency largely agrees with the report's
findings and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one ray of hope I can offer is that everyone involved _
the EPA, states, industries, and environmental groups _ believes
mercury is a problem and we have to take action,'' said Michael
Kenyon, associate director for air policy at EPA's Region I, which
covers New England.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is working under a Dec. 15 deadline set by the courts to
regulate coal-fired power plants, including mercury emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Quinlan Shea, senior director of environmental activities at the
Edison Electric Institute, agreed that the mercury problem must be
solved. But he questioned the report's findings, arguing there is
still uncertainty over such basic issues as how many children are
affected.
</P>
<P>
   He said the report appears designed to pressure the EPA into
regulating coal-fired power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be at least a little spin by the authors,
trying to impact the ongoing public policy debate over whether
there should be controls on the coal-fired power plants,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is a naturally occurring metal whose contact with people
and wildlife has soared in the last century because of industrial
activities that release it into the air, water, and soil. Bacteria
can convert it to the more toxic methylmercury, allowing it to
enter the food chain, becoming most concentrated in larger
predatory fish that build up mercury in their tissues after eating
smaller fish.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that rain at sites in every New England state
but Connecticut has more mercury than the EPA says is safe for
aquatic life. Monitoring sites include Acadia National Park in
Maine and the Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Why Connecticut's mercury level is lower is unclear; the report
theorizes that it may be because the state samples and analyzes
mercury differently from the other states. But given that nearby
states have a lot of mercury in their rain, it is ``highly
unlikely'' Connecticut doesn't, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering mercury reduction legislation sponsored
by US Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and US
Representative Thomas Allen, Democrat of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors say everyone can reduce the release of
mercury by conserving energy and buying products without mercury.

HIV VICTIMS FACE A NEW EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that people with HIV disease didn't have the
luxury of worrying about death from liver failure. Even though 40
percent of HIV patients are also infected with a disease that can
fatally attack the liver, hepatitis C, it hardly seemed a pressing
concern.
</P>
<P>
   After all, hepatitis-induced liver failure usually takes 15 or
20 years: What patient infected with the AIDS virus expected to
live that long?
</P>
<P>
   Now, as an unintended consequence of better drugs to treat HIV,
thousands of men and women are looking at an extended lifespan that
forces them to grapple with the potential for death from hepatitis
C. And, it turns out, they have less time than they once believed:
Hepatitis C infection progresses about twice as fast in people with
the AIDS virus, meaning their livers could be badly damaged in five
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients with HIV are approaching normal lifespans and they're
dying of liver disease'' instead of the AIDS virus, said Dr.
Douglas Dieterich, head of gastroenterology and liver disease at
Cabrini Medical Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, liver disease caused by hepatitis C is now the
second-leading cause of death of HIV patients. A Boston study of
HIV patients at the public Lemuel Shattuck Hospital showed that in
1991, 11 percent of HIV patients' deaths were from liver disease
caused by hepatitis C. In 1996, liver deaths rose to 15 percent,
and in 1998, they had climbed to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sadder than having a patient whose HIV is
undetectable, they're doing really well on their medicine, and then
their hepatitis C and liver disease starts to get them into
trouble,'' said Dr. Margaret Koziel, an infectious disease
specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million Americans _ 2 percent of the population _ are
estimated to be carrying the hepatitis C virus, a blood-borne
organism that can smolder for years and in a small minority of
cases scars the liver so badly it fails. About 8,000 to 10,000 die
of hepatitis C annually, but the toll is expected to triple in the
next decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people are infected with HIV, and if roughly 40
percent are co-infected with hepatitis C, that amounts to 400,000
persons who have them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' says Carissa Cunningham, a spokeswoman
for the AIDS Action Committee in Boston. ``It's the thing that's
bringing mortality back to HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who have only hepatitis C, liver transplants are a
life-saving possibility when their own organ is irrevocably
damaged. But people with HIV disease usually aren't eligible for
the scarce donor organs, because of their risk of premature death
from AIDS. ``Once you have co-infection, that option is gone,''
says Dr. Nezam H. Afdhal, head of the liver unit at Beth Israel
Deaconess. ``If you develop end-stage liver disease, there is no
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason so many HIV patients also are infected with hepatitis
C is that the two viruses are spread in similar ways _ through
intravenous drug use, blood transfusions before 1992 (the blood
supply is now safe) and sex, although the hepatitis virus is less
transmissable in this fashion than HIV.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall co-infection rate is about 40 percent of all
HIV-positive people, it's more like 90 percent in certain groups,
such as IV drug users and hemophiliacs. (People with hemophilia
were widely infected with the viruses before the risk was known,
and they received a clotting factor made from blood pooled from
many donors, increasing the risk of disease transmission.)
</P>
<P>
   Even a single exposure can trigger both HIV and hepatitis C:
Karen Daley, the president of the Massachusetts Nurses Association,
developed both diseases after she was accidentally stuck with a
hypodermic needle while treating a patient in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After diagnosis, Daley said her doctors ``really struggled with
what to treat first _ a not-uncommon scenario.'' Many doctors hold
that the HIV disease should be given priority because it's more
rapidly fatal. But now, some specialists are saying both diseases
need to be hit hard and aggressively with drugs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dieterich of Cabrini Medical Center told experts at
an infectious disease conference in New Orleans that they shouldn't
be afraid to tackle both diseases at once.
</P>
<P>
   But treating both diseases at once carries some risk. Both
diseases require long courses of punishing drugs that can work
against one another, while the HIV drugs can be toxic to the liver
that the hepatitis C drugs are trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are finding their doctors are speaking at
cross-purposes,'' says Lynley Rappaport, a clinical services
staffer at the AIDS Action Committee in Boston. ``They may not
agree with others'' about the need to stop the AIDS drug regimen
because of the risk to the patient's liver, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dieterich gave an optimistic report on a study of 20
coinfected patients at Cabrini Medical Center who were given
simultaneous treatment: They received interferon and ribavirin for
their hepatitis along with antiviral drugs for their HIV. Six
months later, the hepatitis C virus had disappeared in 40 percent
of the patients, signaling a probable cure. The disease was under
control, but still present, in the remaining 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't think the patients would tolerate the drugs or
would be cured,'' Dieterich said in an interview. ``I think we
showed that both are possible,'' though he said the success rate
might not be as high in a larger group of patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Daley, the co-infected nurse, her doctors decided
to attack the HIV first, but within weeks she developed acute
hepatitis, which can quickly damage the liver. So she went on the
standard hepatitis C treatment of interferon and an antiviral drug,
ribivarin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on it for a year, and by that time my body was screaming
to get off these drugs,'' Daley said recently. ``I had extreme
fatigue and shortness of breath, my bone marrow was depressed'' and
her white blood cells were dangerously depleted.
</P>
<P>
   To treat the HIV, her doctors tried several drug combinations
and finally settled on one that worked. ``I'm doing well right
now,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   A new treatment study of co-infected patients is getting
underway at several medical centers, including the Shattuck
Hospital and New England Medical Center, said Dr. Barbara McGovern,
an HIV disease specialist. Among other things, the research will
gauge the value of a new, longer-lasting form of interferon (called
``pegolated'' interferon).
</P>
<P>
   People interested in the trial may call 617-636-8186.
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess, a special unit has been organized to
care for co-infected patients: ``We see five to 10 new co-infected
patients per week,'' said Afdhal, the liver specialist.
</P>
<P>
   One of those patients, a 34-year-old man who asked to be
identified only by his first name, Bruce, contracted both
infections from hemophilia treatment in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of having hepatitis C at some point,'' he recalled
last week, ``but it was always in the background because the HIV
was the immediate issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to have severe HIV symptoms in the 1990s, but the
disease was stopped in its tracks after he began taking a cocktail
of anti-HIV drugs in 1996. Now, says Bruce, who works at an
Internet startup company, ``my HIV disease has been reduced to a
series of pills'' he takes daily.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his doctors are explaining the risk of liver damage
from hepatitis C and recommending that he begin treatment for it
soon. Bruce isn't so sure. He says that the HIV experience
``shattered my belief that I would have a long, normal life,'' so
that he can't think very far in the future.
</P>
<P>
   He's reluctant to begin a new regimen of punishing drugs for the
hepatitis. ``I just don't want to feel sick and weak again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he's undecided about whether to have treatment.
``To the doctors, it's all clear _ you should do this. But to me,
it's not at all clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live so much in the present,'' he said and is just beginning
to really feel he has a future. Now, he added, ``I guess it's time
to think about health decisions on a scale of 10 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich often sees this reaction, but he cautions, ``Patients
should not fool around _ you shouldn't stall too much. I hear them
say, `I think I'll wait two or three years to deal with this,' but
they should be thinking two or three months.''

OLD PATRIOTS' PROBLEMS HINDER NEW SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He may get a pass, a honeymoon, a respite,
whatever you call it, because he's a first-year coach and the
consensus of opinion, including that of the owner, was that the
team had gone kerplunk.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick was hired to revamp the Patriots and bring to the
table a defense that would devour young quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is 0-3 _ even though it was in every game until the
final moments _ and Shaun King of Tampa Bay and Daunte Culpepper of
Minnesota were not overwhelmed by anything Belichick threw at them.
While Belichick's scheme did contain the Jets' Vinny Testaverde for
three quarters, it did not contain him when he needed to be
contained most _ in the final five minutes, when Testaverde, the
quarterback Belichick knows better than any in the league, was
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who has the title of defensive coordinator as well as
head coach, was asked whether he was disappointed in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed we're 0-3,'' he said. ``I'm disappointed in
all phases so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick and his coaching staff can't be pleased with the
retention of the players. Is it a case of breaking old habits?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's possible,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a case of not grasping the new system? Belichick knew it
would take time, but time is not on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, much of the blame must go to the offense, though it
ranks 18th out of 31 teams (same as the defense). The defense was
supposed to carry the team until the offense caught up, but it
seems both units are struggling at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's 21-13 loss to the Vikings, the defense pitched a
shutout in the second half after adjustments were made, but in the
first half, even with Tedy Bruschi ``spying'' Culpepper, the young
quarterback took off and it often appeared the Patriots didn't know
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   There were other things Belichick was livid about, including a
missed extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the NFL,'' he said, ``At this level of football, we
should be able to kick an extra point. The coaches expect it, the
fans expect it, and players should expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league you have to do things right. I don't think it's
being done intentionally by the players, but their performance is
not there yet. It's not at a level we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, is the coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Patriots keep having red zone problems. Perhaps
the staff is working hard on this, trying new things, but there are
no results. Terry Glenn has averaged almost 15 yards per catch
since 1996; this year, he's caught 18 passes in three games and is
averaging 11.4 yards. The Patriots can't get him the ball
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as precise with the passing game as we need to be,''
said Belichick. ``The quarterbacks, the receivers, and the
protection haven't been as crisp as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   They haven't solved the protection problems and there aren't
enough deep weapons. Belichick did not re-sign Shawn Jefferson, a
proven deep receiver, because he thought Tony Simmons was ready.
Simmons was not even active Sunday because Belichick said that
Shockmain Davis, a free agent rookie, was performing better on
special teams. When Bledsoe needs to get receivers downfield late
in games, the line and backs aren't picking up blitzes. Of
Bledsoe's 15 sacks in three games, nine have come in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what the common thread is,'' said Belichick. ``We
haven't called attention to detail at the critical times. It's
frustrating for all of us. We have to continue to address the
little things and get the little things right.''
</P>
<P>
   How about nine penalties? Too many men on the field, roughing
after the whistle, jumping offside, false starts. The Patriots
avoided penalties the first two games, but suddenly they popped up
in Week 3.
</P>
<P>
   These are all things heard before here. That's why it's
difficult for Patriots fans to see progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frustrating situation all the way around,'' said Glenn.
``We just can't let it snowball. It's a total effort. We all have
to be better in what we're doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now they're losing. They're not losing by much, but, as
Belichick said, ``I'm not into moral victories. The bottom line is
victories.''

THE WOMAN WHO PUT IT TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On behalf of the beleaguered targets of
presidential politics, meet this year's heroine _ Janet Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Republican who works for a Kennedy Democrat, a Reagan
Republican, and a bipartisan board, this backstage junkie is the
main reason the country will get three 90-minute cracks at George
W. Bush and Al Gore next month, along with a 90-minute opportunity
to study Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   When it began to look as if the debates were in danger of
foundering, it was her bipartisan wisdom and discipline that
rescued them for the rest of us. Come to think of it, she has been
essential to the debates' overwhelming success in their current
form for all 13 years she has been doing her thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   The key to her work behind the scenes this year can be found
first of all in two critical facts: Governor Bush's position was
never criticized; and Vice President Gore's position was never
supported by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which she
serves as executive director. In the end, Gore didn't win this
tussle; the commission and the public did.
</P>
<P>
   As with all executive directors, Brown's authority is entirely
derivative. From the beginning, when the commission succeeded the
League of Women Voters on the recommendations of two study panels,
the Republican co-chair has been Frank Fahrenkopf, the Democratic
co-chair has been Paul Kirk, each at the time their party's
national chairman. It may have been ``somebody's got to do this''
at the beginning, but Fahrenkopf and Kirk have since become
passionate about their responsibility and scrupulous about
rejecting the occasional entreaties of partisan buddies.
</P>
<P>
   But someone has also had to walk the point all these years,
bringing major league production values to the debates, opening up
the formats, making it all work. After three successful seasons,
this will be the first in which the commission's entire schedule
has survived candidate shenanigans. Don't think it was easy.
</P>
<P>
   Through a critical period of high-stakes poker, with each side
looking for a reason to brand Brown and thus the commission a tool
of the other, she pressed three points that transcended
partisanship and therefore carried the day:
</P>
<P>
   --The commission can put the show together, partly because it
has 10 times previously since 1988, and partly because its criteria
for candidate selection have met legal tests for objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   --The public interest is in the largest possible audience for
the largest possible number of debates. The commercial networks
can't assemble this and neither can one of the candidates
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   --Format is flexible, always has been.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Bush's people tried to bust the commission's
plan to their own advantage (it could just as easily have been
Gore's people in different circumstances), that was her message.
She said it in public, but most important, she said it in private,
when things could have gotten ugly, in meetings and on conference
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Bush trying to bend things his way, he had de facto
allies in the promotion-crazed networks, two of whom (CNN and NBC)
actually got in bed with him for a spell. But the side deals
couldn't survive Brown's arguments on behalf of the public, backed
by an astonishing avalanche of newspaper editorials from all
ideologies and all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brown never gloated, but the rest of us owe this person a deep
bow. She's fourth-generation D.C., sheepskins from Williams College
and Harvard University, and experience in the White House, the
State Department of the late Elliot Richardson, and the office of
former Republican Senator Jack Danforth of Missouri, who is now a
commission board member.
</P>
<P>
   When the debates begin next month in Boston, viewers of cable
will probably see her briefly, helping set the scene and warm up
the auditorium audience. They will be seeing the best of which
politics in this country is capable.
</P>
<P>
   They will also learn the truth of her mom's strong view that she
should eat more.

ADS COULD FREE ACTORS FROM CRUMMY FLICKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Chloe Sevigny, who was nominated this year for
an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her role in ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' said she would rather make commercials than star in
some big-budget monstrosity masquerading as a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny has already appeared in clothing ads, and admits she'll
probably do more, though, she said, ``I hate myself for doing
things like that, but it's the only way I can survive financially.
I know it will be up on the telephone booths for however long, and
then it will disappear. But a film will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came from a wealthy family and didn't need the money,
then maybe I would have been able to refuse the offer (to appear in
a commercial), but I don't,'' she said. ``It's me surviving the
movie industry. I'd still rather do an ad than some romantic comedy
that I would later hate myself for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny, who was born in Springfield, is a fine, smart actress
who has starred in such films as ``Kids,'' ``The Last Days of
Disco,'' and ``American Psycho.'' At 25, she likely has her pick of
any number of insipid scripts, but thankfully respects her talents
too much to squander them, starring opposite the likes of Freddie
Prinze Jr. or Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly says something about the current state of Hollywood
filmmaking if an actress of Sevigny's caliber would rather appear
in an ad than make a lousy movie. If only others were smart enough
to follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who went to the movies this summer knows that their local
multiplex was cluttered with mediocre actors in mediocre films.
Each week brought with it some fresh hell, whether it was Keanu
Reeves in ``The Replacements,'' or, well, Keanu Reeves in ``The
Watcher.'' Having seen both films, I can't imagine anyone would
have balked if Reeves, with his beautiful, no-talent self, had
popped in a few TV commercials instead of two duds at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once actors were widely scorned for compromising
themselves artistically by prostituting themselves to Madison
Avenue. These days, television actors, even such recent Emmy
winners as Sela Ward of ABC's ``Once and Again'' and Sean Hayes of
NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' are regularly seen in commercials. But it's
always been different for big-screen stars. They're rarely forgiven
for shilling products other than their own movies. That's why some
A-list actors such as Jodie Foster and Leonardo DiCaprio make
commercials that can only be shown in Europe or Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Sevigny may be onto something. Commercials will come and go,
but a bad film will revolve in the cable cosmos forever _ just as
Dennis Quaid, who appeared in perhaps one of the worst films ever,
the botched Jerry Lee Lewis biopic, ``Great Balls of Fire.'' After
all, which is more devastating for an actor _ appearing in a
commercial or appearing in a bad film? There are actors out there,
such as Sandra Bullock, and Mr. and Mrs. Brad Pitt, to name a few,
who've dropped more bombs than the Air Force, and might consider it
a gift to the moviegoing public better if they simply made fewer
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: wouldn't you rather see John Travolta hawking
Slim Fast than have to watch him in dreck like ``Battlefield
Earth''? Couldn't Winona Ryder, who just stunk it up with the awful
``Autumn in New York'' last month, find it just as fulfilling and
meaningful pitching Gap jeans? Wouldn't the words ``Gone in 60
Seconds'' be preferable if they referred to the length of a Nicolas
Cage TV commercial instead of his numbingly mindless movie?

<TEXT>
<P>
   EGREMONT, Mass. _ Baseball is a funny business. Baseball
writing, too. (You can look it up, as Casey Stengel used to say.)
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, this reporter rang up ``Ball Four'' author Jim
Bouton at his home in the Berkshires, asking about an interview.
Bouton, the ex-big league pitcher (Yankees, Pilots, Astros,
Braves), is famous for having written one of the most entertaining
and influential sports books ever published. One that made the New
York Public Library's Books of the Century list recently (along
with ``Catch-22'' and ``In Cold Blood'') and, when it came out 30
years ago, was so astonishingly candid about ballplayers' lives
(think ``You Know Me Al'' meets ``Animal House'') that the baseball
establishment viciously turned on Bouton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball Four'' went on to outsell all other sports books before
or since, more than 5.5 million copies altogether. Bouton went on
to become a TV sports anchor, actor, novelist, McGovern delegate
(New Jersey, 1972), inventor (Big League Chew bubble gum),
motivational speaker, and cult hero. Last summer, an op-ed column
about Pete Rose and baseball gambling appeared under Bouton's
byline in the New York Times. It was every bit as puckishly
contrarian as ``Ball Four'' was, indicating Bouton had lost nothing
off his fastball. Touching base with the 61-year-old author seemed
like a natural.
</P>
<P>
   Bouton was cordial over the phone, yet oddly evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the road a lot doing corporate speeches,'' he said at
the time. ``Do we have to do this now?''
</P>
<P>
   No, of course not, he was told. He agreed to an interview anyway
_ sort of. Later he called back and begged off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he explained, ``I'm negotiating to bring out a
30th anniversary edition of `Ball Four' next fall. It would be
better for me if we talked then. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Okaaay. A year later, ``Ball Four: The Final Pitch'' (Sports
Publishing Inc.) is out as promised. Yet new material included in
the anniversary edition (updated editions have appeared every 10
years since 1970) hints at other reasons for Bouton's hesitancy.
For if the original ``Ball Four'' was _ hilariously _ about wins,
losses, and life on the road, groupies and all, then ``Final
Pitch'' is very much about wounds, losses, and lessons that far
transcend the field of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same guy who wrote Ball Four,'' Bouton writes in
the new edition. ``I'm not so cocky, not so sure of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed him, Bouton says, was the death of his daughter
Laurie, 31, in an August 1997 car accident. For two years, he
suffered from depression, to the point where he cared little about
what he ate or even whether his airplane crashed or not. At the
same time, he was going through delayed baseball withdrawal; until
1997, Bouton had continued pitching in leagues populated by college
players and ex-pros. He was one boy of summer who refused to grow
up.
</P>
<P>
   If not for his daughter's death, Bouton suggests, the past
decade would have made ``Final Pitch'' a fitting capstone to his
baseball-writing career, too, a Series-winning shutout.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bouton reconciled with ex-Yankee teammate Mickey
Mantle, portrayed in ``Ball Four'' as a hard-drinking, hard-living
kid from Oklahoma (which Mantle was). Mantle, who died in 1995, had
let Bouton know privately that the book never bothered him much.
Three years later, Bouton was back in Yankee Stadium for Old
Timers' Day, the first such invitation he'd gotten since retiring
from baseball in 1978. Yankee fans with long memories _ Bouton
pitched in two World Series and won 21 games for the New Yorkers in
1963 _ cheered when he strolled out of the dugout, a pariah no
longer. A picture of Bouton doffing his cap that day is among the
few baseball mementos he displays around his house.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Bouton writes, he was not his old, carefree, Gyro
Gearloose self after Laurie's death _ and thus presumably in no
mood to sit down with a reporter a year ago and discuss what was on
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working this out in print probably helped me get through''
Laurie's death, he admitted recently. Then he added, ``This really
is the final pitch for me as far as `Ball Four' goes. Nothing I
write is going to get more personal than this.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways baseball has been very, very good to James Alan
Bouton. He makes a handsome living these days giving pep talks to
Fortune 500 execs. He and his second wife, Paula Kurman, a
behavioral scientist, act in local theatrical productions and enjoy
ballroom dancing. They have a grandchild now, born this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Their Egrement house sits on 21 hilltop acres with a majestic
view of the Berkshires. The stonework in and around the house was
done by Bouton himself; directions to his driveway include many
references to granite pillars and stone walls, all hand-laid.
Standing on his front stoop in corduroy slacks and a tight-fitting
T-shirt, he looks like he could still go six innings against the
Red Sox despite the salt-and-pepper hair. He has a stone-handler's
body, an aging jock's carefully preserved physique. Chisled is the
word that comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room of Bouton's house is a small table holding
leather-bound copies of two of his books, ``Ball Four'' and its
sequel, ``I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally.'' Next to them
are works by Shakespeare and Lewis Carroll. A statue of Carroll's
Alice flanks the room's soaring fireplace. The juxtaposition makes
sense somehow. Thirty years ago, ``Ball Four'' took baseball itself
through the looking glass, chronicling the casual drug use (mostly
amphetamines, known as ``greenies''), clubhouse pranks, and
road-trip sexcapades that made the national pastime seem
delightfully human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula loves Lewis Carroll,'' Bouton comments without
elaboration. What drew the couple to this area, he adds, was its
proximity to New York and, as he puts it, ``the fact that real
people live here.''
</P>
<P>
   He fixes a simple lunch of garden greens, fresh tomatoes, and
iced tea, and carries it out to the sun porch. The obvious
question, first: How did a diary of the 1969 baseball season,
written by a journeyman pitcher for an expansion team that lasted
one year, turn into the hardball ``Huckleberry Finn''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I surely never thought it would have any life beyond the first
year,'' Bouton replies, chewing slowly. ``But there were a couple
of reasons for its success, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   One, he says, was its unlikely cast of characters. Unlike stars
such as Mantle and Billy Martin, who romp through ``Ball Four''
with beers and binoculars proudly raised, the Pilots were mostly
has-beens and castoffs from other teams. A year later, even Seattle
had cast them off, and the franchise moved to Milwaukee as the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were all great storytellers,'' notes Bouton. ``It was
as if every team in baseball sent a special representative to
Seattle and said, `You be in a book.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reason number two, according to Bouton, was the book's diary
format. Bouton wrote down everything during the '69 season, giving
``Ball Four'' the intimacy of a Ken Burns documentary. Finally,
Bouton says, it didn't hurt that then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried
to get Bouton to renounce parts of the book as untrue. Meanwhile,
book critics were already hailing ``Ball Four'' as an instant
classic. Baseball historian Daniel Okrent says Kuhn ought to have
thanked Bouton instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of baseball people who hated Bouton, including Kuhn,
made a fortune later by doing the same thing _ writing tell-all
books,'' notes Okrent. ``The difference was, Bouton was a clever,
amusing guy who really had something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Charlton, a New York-based book packager, roomed with Bouton
at Western Michigan University. When ``Ball Four'' came out,
recalls Charlton, ``It was one of those phenomena like Harry
Potter. It was pretty good, but you had no idea what would happen
after publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was only because he rode the bench so much,
Bouton says, that he was able to focus on the book. Ironically,
too, his father warned him that it could ruin his pitching career.
Bouton was making $22,000 at the time, and with a career record of
62-63, he was hardly destined for Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Ball Four' got this rap as being an expose,'' Bouton
continues, ``when all it did was bring people to a level of
awareness about baseball that they had about most things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No real fan was shocked by it, or liked their players less,''
he avers. ``They liked them more, in fact.'' His eyes twinkle.
``Hey, they're horny _ just like us! They drink just like we do!
Unfortunately, it's gone too far the other way since `Ball Four.'
All my sex stories were anonymous, for instance. There were no
racial or anti-Semitic remarks where I quoted the players by name.
Now, there are no boundaries at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the iconoclast, Bouton claims to care more about the
politics of baseball today than players' stats or team standings _
the opposite of most fans, who would not care if they ever read
another word about player-owner battles or revenue sharing.
Sportswriters, Bouton sneers, spread the most disinformation about
baseball economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of them believe that the more money players make, the
higher teams will set ticket prices,'' he says. ``There is zero
relationship there. Zero. Or, people actually believe the major
leagues will collapse if one team goes bankrupt. Do you know the
only team in history that did that?'' Bouton rolls his eyes. ``The
Seattle Pilots! And they were bought for $5.3 million one year and
sold for $10.8 million the next. It's absurd! Businessmen are
lining up to buy these franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Players today? Don't get Bouton started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the highlight-reel gestures, the Velcro batting gloves,
the guys running to first base like they've just discovered a new
route to the Far East,'' he says. ``Eliminate Velcro and you'd take
half an hour off the average game today.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, says Bouton, is going the route of pro wrestling. ``We
ran off the field after winning the World Series,'' he says. ``Now
you have the obligatory pileup on the mound. Guys jump on a
policeman's horse, tear off their uniform shirts. They've all
become entertainers now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton has not always prospered as an author. ``Strike Zone,''
his baseball novel, came out in April 1994. On opening day of his
publicity tour, Bouton went to the San Francisco bookstore where he
was scheduled to speak. The store seemed empty, but in a back room
he found a hundred people huddled around a TV set, watching a white
Ford Bronco weave down a highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was it for the novel,'' Bouton laughs. ``They printed
60,000 copies, and 55,000 of them are in boxes somewhere.'' So too
are the trophies, awards, and old gloves he collected during his
years in the majors. ``We never knew the uniforms we were wearing
were worth more than we were,'' Bouton quips. ``But most guys I
played with didn't have college educations. They retired at 35
without a lot of money. So they do card shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantle, he says, became ``a bigger hero in my eyes than ever''
when he spoke eloquently about his alcoholism in the weeks before
he died. Rising to clear the salad plates, Bouton gets that twinkle
in his eyes when this reporter asks if he still tosses a baseball
around now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Bouton, ``I pitch batting practice to my sushi
chef. He played baseball in Japan, and you always want to keep your
sushi chef happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He winks. ``But,'' he says, ``I always mix in a couple of
knuckleballs, too.''

EVEN IF YOU'VE SAILED BEFORE, PLEASANT SURPRISES AWAIT YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what your image is of a cruise, it's time to rethink
taking a cruise vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise vacations are evolving into a multifaceted experience.
The vacation of today is not the cruise of the '70s. Welcome to the
21st century of cruising.
</P>
<P>
   If you've said no to a cruise before, it's time to rethink that.
And if you've cruised before, it's time to rethink your next
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Why rethink? For the ``no' set, a cruise now offers a world of
possibilities and can compete very well against a land-based
resort; for those who enjoy cruises, the continued introduction of
new vessels means lower prices, which in turn means travelers can
go upscale without paying a huge sum.
</P>
<P>
   For both cruisers and ``no-goers,'' the fact that 46 new ships
have entered the market in the last four years, and another 55 are
expected by the end of 2003, means more variety, more on-board
options, new ports of call, and more competition for your vacation
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have believed that a cruise ship would have an ice
skating rink aboard, or a rock-climbing wall, an in-line skating
track, a wedding chapel, easy Internet connections, or even be a
place to hold a business meeting or convention? All this, and a lot
more is happening now.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these innovations are designed to get the
``no-goers'' out of the resorts and onto the ships, cruisegoers who
still go for the oceangoing experience will find bountiful
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise experience dates to the days of riverboating and
ocean crossings, when these were the only ways to travel, and to
travel in style.
</P>
<P>
   Riverboating along the Mississippi and other American rivers
even created some of the language of today's cruises _
``stateroom'' dates to a riverboat owner deciding to name the
cabins aboard his boat for the states. Cruising in style became
vogue with the great ocean liners and was recalled grandly in the
film ``Titanic.'' But in those days sailing was a matter of class;
only the wealthy sailed in style, and most travelers were confined
to lower decks with only limited access to an open deck.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising has become quite affordable, however, and all aboard a
ship now enjoy all the style and amenities that once were reserved
only for the wealthy. Yes, there still are windowless staterooms
and rooms on lower decks, but guests there enjoy just about all the
same amenities of those buying the highest-priced cabins, but at
far lower costs. Cruise Lines International Association, a trade
group of some 80 cruise companies, notes the fastest growing market
for cruises is for those in the $20,000-$50,000 bracket.
</P>
<P>
   For me, cruising means relaxing, unwinding, experiencing new
foods, ports of call, meeting people, being as active or passive as
I wish, being entertained. It's a vacation without a care, and,
based on one past memorable experience, a lot livelier then being
at a land-based resort.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising is about choice: type of ship (sailing, megaliner,
riverboat); ports of call; activities; dining; entertainment;
style. And while you can't stand on the bow like Leonardo DiCaprio
did in ``Titanic,'' you can do a lot more than he did as a second-
or third-class passenger.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few weeks, Royal Caribbean Cruises' will sail on its
maiden voyage. That vessel and its sister ship, the Voyager of the
Seas, are definitely resorts at sea with such features as a
miniature golf course, full-sized ice skating rink, rock-climbing
wall high above the sea on the aft deck, in-line skating track,
jogging track, health club and spa, Internet cafe, dining options
galore, huge casino, and a theater to rival Broadway. And, if you
must conduct business, there is a large conference center.
</P>
<P>
   Those 142,000-ton ships are definitely aimed at those who may be
thinking of Las Vegas rather than the sea. Even some of the choice
staterooms overlook not the ocean but a grand inside arcade filled
with shops and pubs, and along which may be found street performers
and a Mardi Gras-style parade.
</P>
<P>
   Survey after survey report that the cruise experience is one of
the most popular vacations offered. And, while cruise lines have
always been catering to their passengers, the lines are doing even
more to exceed passenger expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that passengers were looking for more choices and
flexibility on a cruise rather than the regimented product once
standard in the industry, the lines have moved quickly to meet
those needs. For example, dining options on many ships are greater
than ever. Not every one wants a formal seven-course dinner, so the
lines offer alternative options. On Princess, for example, there is
24-hour-a-day informal dining, a pizza parlor, and regular dining
room service. On some lines guests could have all their meals (most
lines offer 24-hour-a-day sandwich and beverage service as well as
breakfast in cabins) served in their stateroom. Holland America has
just added that option. Crystal Cruises was the first to offer
alternative dining rooms: One served Italian fare, the other Asian.
Other lines have followed, offering at least one alternative dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line recently introduced Freestyle Cruising and
will have the program throughout the line by next summer. The
program allows open seating and dining times _ no more regimented
dining hours or selected table partners. Dress as you wish, from
casual to formal. New entertainment programs are designed to offer
both physical and mental stimulation. There, too, is a simplified
gratuity system _ the line sets the gratuity and places it on your
final bill; you then can subtract it from your bill or, for
outstanding service, add to it. The line also promises a more
relaxed disembarkation. And, it pledges a new ship every year, all
with nine or more restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   If features such as Freestyle Cruising have appeal, talk to an
experienced travel agent when considering a cruise. Many ships
offer these features now. Holland America has had a no-tip policy
for years; many luxury vessels offer open seating in the dining
room; Seabourn stocks the stateroom with the beverages you want,
and they are complimentary; many lines bring aboard celebrities and
specialists in various fields for talks on everything from the next
port of call to international events; and even on ships where there
are formal nights, they are limited in number and business attire
is perfectly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   With information on your likes and desires from ports of call to
entertainment, a knowledgeable travel agent can make the right fit
for you. There are more than 100 ships of all sizes _ carrying from
under 100 passengers to more than 3,000 _ and all styles _ full
sail, computerized sail, riverboat, coastal cruisers, and yachtlike
vessels as well as megaships.
</P>
<P>
   And if you've cruised before, it pays to talk to a travel agent
about your likes and dislikes on previous cruises. You could find a
ship more to your liking, and you may find that in this competitive
market, a premium or luxury line you never considered is offering a
deal that's hard to refuse. Despite some negative reports,
including ships breaking down, crime, fires, environmental and
weather issues, and health concerns, the cruise experience is still
very positive. Ships are very mechanical and are subject to
problems, yet reports of crime and fires are minimal (Carnival, for
example, now has uniformed security personnel on its sailings),
environmental issues are being corrected, cruises go out of their
way to avoid bad weather, and health concerns are limited.
</P>
<P>
   The major health concern is still seasickness. The vast majority
of passengers will not experience it except in unusually rough
seas. All modern ships have stabilizers to ensure a smoother ride,
but even the largest of vessels are subject to the oceans' motion.
Medication is available on cruise ships but if you have a concern
it's best to see your doctor before sailing.
</P>
<P>
   And if you should have further health concerns, check with the
cruise line as to what facilities are available, and be sure to
bring information on your health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   All cruise ships are given periodic health inspections. For a
report on how a ship rated during its last inspection, call write
or visit
</P>
<P>
   So whether you've been a no-goer or a cruisegoer, it's time to
rethink a cruise vacation.

VENUS WILLIAMS A WINNER IN HER OLYMPIC DEBUT

 By CHRISTOPHER CAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ ``Citius, altus, fortus'' read the words
over the players' entrance at the New South Wales tennis center
here, and though Venus Williams was not higher, faster or stronger
than usual in the first Olympic tennis match of her career, she was
still too much for her first-round opponent, Henrieta Nagyova of
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won her 27th match in a row in less than an hour by the
score of 6-2, 6-2, though Nagyova hustled and did her utmost to
counter.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams' superior power and skills, the outcome was a
foregone conclusion, which might help explain why Venus' sister and
Olympic doubles partner, Serena, yawned late in the second set as
she watched from the stands seated next to Billie Jean King, the
American women's coach.
</P>
<P>
   While tennis remains a relatively minor Olympic sport, the
Williams sisters are a major Olympic attraction. After Friday
night's opening ceremony, they were surrounded by dozens of
autograph-seeking, photograph-seeking athletes. While the sisters
obliged, with a hastily assembled security detail keeping the
growing crowd in check, Marion Jones, the world's fastest woman who
hopes to win five gold medals in track and field here, was standing
nearby and generating little hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The level of interest from their peers is one reason the
Williamses are staying in a Sydney hotel instead of the Olympic
Village at Homebush Bay. But they are hardly the only tennis
players attracting stargazers.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Pognon, a 22-year-old from Benin, the tiny West
African nation, played Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten in the first round
Tuesday, and after he had lost 6-1, 6-1 in just 38 minutes, he
asked a ballboy to take a picture of him with Kuerten, the two-time
French Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a thrill,'' said Pognon, who received a wildcard entry
into the Olympics but has no ATP points to his name and is ranked
outside the top 300 in France, where he trains.
</P>
<P>
   But Pognon will always be an Olympian, and so will the top
Australian men's singles players _ Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt
and Mark Philippoussis _ who are three of the main reasons for
Australians' level of interest in this Olympic tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 171,000 tickets have been sold for the 10-day
event, and no more tickets are expected to be made available.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter played and won on center court earlier Tuesday, defeating
Vince Spadea of the United States, 6-4, 6-3, and generating the
sort of enthusiasm from fans that is usually associated with
winning tournaments, not winning first-round matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to Davis Cup, except you are not going to
get another shot at proving yourself,'' said Rafter. ``In Davis
Cup, you are going to get another match or you've got your mate to
fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateship, as the Australians call it, has not been the rule
among their players of late. The long-running saga involving
Philippoussis and commitment to Davis Cup reached the crisis stage
again in July, when he declined to play in the semifinals. Rafter
was critical of that decision and indicated that it was better for
the team to do without him on a permanent basis. Philippoussis, who
eventually indicated that he was injured, took offense and said he
had no intention of trying to resolve his differences with his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But both Rafter and Philippoussis, who defeated Thomas Johansson
in straight sets Tuesday, indicated that the tension between them
had dissipated in Sydney although they had not yet addressed the
rift directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are getting along very well,'' Rafter said. ``I really
hope that we will sit down and maybe talk about the differences,
because Mark is a good kid, and we all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rafter and Philippoussis were cruising, Todd Martin, the
thoughtful American who reached the semifinals at the U.S. Open
earlier this month, was losing 6-2, 6-0 to Rainer Schuttler of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to peak twice in the same month, and it will be
intriguing to see how Marat Safin, the reigning U.S. Open men's
singles champion, will fare after playing and winning in a minor
tournament in Tashkent the week after the Open. Safin arrived in
Sydney via Singapore at 5 a.m. Tuesday, and by lunchtime, he was
jokingly staggering toward a practice court at Homebush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm tired, but tennis is my job,'' he said. ``If I don't
play my best here, I will have to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, the U.S. Open women's champion, should be quite
a bit fresher, and if she handles the tournament as smoothly as she
handled her post-match interview Tuesday night, she may soon have a
medal around her neck. She was asked to respond to the lastest jab
from John McEnroe, the American Davis Cup captain, that she and her
sister were ``cold as ice'' and disrespectful and unfriendly to
other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know John McEnroe,'' she answered. ``I've never had a
conversation with him. He doesn't know me. So I find it difficult
to form an opinion on someone that I don't know, and I find it
difficult that he has formed an opinion on myself and my sister,
seeing he doesn't know us.''

<HEADLINE>
A SHORT TRIP ON A BIG SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ship was big but the cruise was short. How would this
combination work out, I wondered. Would my wife and I (and the more
than 2,600 other passengers) spend all four of our days aboard the
893-foot-long Carnival Destiny just trying to find our way around?
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is one of the world's largest cruise ships, the
Destiny is logically arranged, with a soaring atrium called the
Rotunda connecting nine of the 12 decks with its public areas.
Passengers can ride any of four glass-enclosed atrium elevators to
reach all the attractions that radiate from the Rotunda. (It's a
scenic ride, too, with the elevators riding past a four-deck-high
mural made of marble and onyx, depicting abstract cityscapes.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus, even a directionally impaired person such as myself was
able to see and do a lot in a short time. Good thing, too, because
there's a lot to do and see _ and, oh yes, eat _ on a ship that has
three two-level dining areas, 18 bars and lounges (including the
expansive and technically sophisticated Palladium Theater), four
swimming pools, a large health center, one of the largest casinos
afloat, and a children's center.
</P>
<P>
   The Destiny had been sailing the Caribbean in winter and
visiting the pleasant ports of Saint John and Halifax in the
Canadian Maritimes in spring and summer, usually from New York but
with two cruises scheduled from Boston's Black Falcon Pier in late
spring. That schedule has been taken over by the new and
structurally similar Carnival Victory, and the Destiny will now ply
the Caribbean year round. The Victory plans two Maritimes cruises
from Boston in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   (By luck we chose the correct sailing dates. The other Boston
cruise open to the public last spring was canceled because of
mechanical problems _ a cancellation that dismayed passengers and
Carnival alike. The cruise line gave those passengers a full refund
and half off a future cruise, but as Destiny Captain Angelo Los
noted, some had set aside that particular time and could not easily
rearrange plans. Yet mechanical problems do happen, and need time
to be fixed. Just ask the guy _ me _ whose car has spent a whole
lot of time in garages this year.)
</P>
<P>
   What a convenience it was to sail from Boston, which meant among
other things that we wouldn't have to set foot in an airport and
worry about connections and delays. After parking and checking in,
we were aboard, and ready to explore the 101,353-ton Destiny as it
glided past the Boston Harbor Islands and out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing we noticed was that this ship wasn't nearly as
razzle-dazzle in decor as other Carnival ships we have visited. No
one would dare call it dull, but it was missing the miles of neon
and other glittering _ some might say glitzy _ features found on
other ships of the line. Instead, the neon was confined to a few
lounges and other spots, and muted colors _ plums, mauves, and
rusts _ predominated, with the walls in the public areas having the
look of corrugated copper. Near stair landings and elevators are
large, vibrant, semi-abstract paintings of nature scenes _ part of
the ship's multimillion-dollar art collection. The man behind the
design is veteran Carnival architect Joe Farcus.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most important features for most passengers are where
you stay and what you eat, and we had no complaints about either
category.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin, again surprisingly subdued with its sunset hues,
wasn't the biggest of the 1,321 cabins and suites aboard (a number
that makes for some long, long corridors), but it was filled with
nooks and crannies for storage, as well as lots of closet space, a
large vanity, a tiled bathroom with a shower that worked
wonderfully (not always the case in my cruisegoing experience), and
a variety of amenities such as a built-in hair dryer. Carnival says
its standard ocean-view staterooms range from 220 to 260 square
feet, making them larger than on most mainstream or even upscale
ships. Of the 754 ocean-view rooms, more than half have clear-glass
balconies: a boon for viewing scenery in relative privacy.
</P>
<P>
   And, to my taste at least, the food was better than good. I
haven't eaten on every cruise ship but the meals aboard the
Destiny, especially the multicourse dinners, were as good as I've
had on any vessel. Typical main courses might be: linguini with
Italian sausage, assorted bell peppers, and fresh mushrooms;
pan-seared fillet of fresh fish with roasted garlic vinaigrette;
delcie of the ocean, newburg-style; broiled cornish game hen with
black-cherry salsa; rack of New Zealand spring lamb dijonnaise mint
au jus; and grilled, aged New York sirloin with three-peppercorn
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Eating opportunities are so abundant that you could literally
dine on something every waking hour. In addition to breakfast,
lunch, and dinner in the two-level Galaxy and Universe dining
rooms, the two-deck skylighted Sun &AMP; Sea Restaurant offers a
smorgasbord of international cuisines. There are breakfast and
luncheon buffets, as well as alternative evening dining; the Happy
Valley food station, which serves Asian dishes; the New York Deli
for corned beef and pastrami sandwiches; a 24-hour pizzeria; the
Grille, for hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches, and the like.
There are also room service and midnight buffets. As cruise
director John Heald, a very funny fellow, put it: ``You'll only
gain, three, four . . . 500 pounds!''
</P>
<P>
   (However, neither my wife, Linda, nor I gained any weight. We
suspect that was because we balanced the many eating opportunities
with a lot of exercise.)
</P>
<P>
   On a Carnival ship, entertainment is almost as abundant as
dining. And a lot of that entertainment takes place in the
Palladium Theater, with its high-tech, five-decks-deep stage
complex. Nightly shows included lavish, Las Vegas-style productions
such as ``Nightclub Express,'' which, with a talking couch as
narrator, took us to 10 famous cabarets such as the Copacabana and
the Cotton Club, and ``Les Formidables,'' which was set in Paris
and included everything from a fashion show to a surreal circus.
Another show starred a magician named Rand Woodbury, and I'm still
trying to figure out how he made an airplane materialize on stage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were adult comedy shows, appropriately held
after midnight, and a late-night salute to Broadway (the tunes of
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Bob Fosse were fine, but I suspect some
audience members would have appreciated a little Rodgers and
Hammerstein, too).
</P>
<P>
   On a cruise ship, the opening night show is usually a semi-dull
affair in which members of the cruise staff are introduced and ship
activities are outlined. But not this time: Cruise director Heald
got a lot of audience members involved in the goings-on with often
hilarious results. He also set up a couple of running gags, one of
which required a passenger to break out in a wild dance and shout a
catch phrase every time the name of his hometown of Fall River was
mentioned over the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   There were many more ways for passengers to be entertained,
including casino gambling and the ever-popular Bingo; dancing,
drinking, or karaoke in the lounges (some of them brightly lighted
and wildly decorated, and others not); shopping in the onboard
stores; getting spa treatments; participating in art auctions;
taking dance classes; touring the galley; and watching movies on
the stateroom TVs or on the big screen in the Palladium Lounge. The
big-screen movies, such as ``Titanic,'' were better than the
in-room movies, I thought, although for a price you can order
premium movies on your room screen.
</P>
<P>
   And there were games galore. My wife and I teamed up to win one
trivia contest, with the prize being a model of the Destiny,
described by one crew member as ``solid gold plastic.'' There was a
hilarious contest resembling a TV game show, a scavenger hunt, and
two competitions that we unfortunately missed seeing: The Men's
Knobby Knees Contest and the Dr. Ruth Sex, Love, and Romance Quiz.
Ah, well. The Destiny also has a pretty library that, while open 24
hours, was unfortunately staffed just a few hours a day _ always,
it seemed, at times we weren't able to visit.
</P>
<P>
   On this northern springtime cruise, only the most hardy went
swimming, but with four pools there are a lot of opportunities do
so _ something Caribbean-bound passengers especially must enjoy. On
the Lido Deck, a true playground, there are two pools (one under a
retractable dome), each accompanied by large whirlpools, as well as
a swim-up bar. One attention-getting feature is a wildly winding,
214-foot water slide that after a two-deck journey deposits riders
not in the pool on the Spa Deck but in a ``deceleration zone''
nearby. A children's wading pool, meanwhile, provides a separate
area for the little ones. Near any of the pools are food, music,
and room to just lounge in the sun, as well.
</P>
<P>
   So we found a lot to enjoy aboard the Destiny, and little not
to. (We weren't crazy about getting caught in a couple of long
lines, one to go ashore at a port and another at the breakfast
buffet. My ever-efficient wife says that if the omelet station were
moved to a separate area, the breakfast line would go faster.)
</P>
<P>
   Carnival collectively calls its vessels the Fun Ship, and fun is
just what we had.

<HEADLINE>
SHE'S 86 _ AND LOVES TO CRUISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   June L. Griffin of Lewiston, Maine, is a world traveler who, at
86, doesn't let age keep her down.
</P>
<P>
   A while back she proposed a story on a recent cruise. Agreeing
to take a look at it, I was disappointed that she never mentioned
anything about her age: no problems, no special concerns, nothing.
She just wrote about the good time, and her joy of travel.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, she said, was simple: ``At a time when so many
people in the United States are living to ages of 100 and more, the
80s do not seem so old, and seniors of all ages are now taking
trips that would have seemed too difficult only a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have led a charmed life because I have reached the age of 86
enjoying the freedom to travel the world, write about it, and carry
a sketchbook, as my two interests are covered this way. My parents
brought us up to be independent and we all traveled before planes
made it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin grew up in Connecticut, and after Bates College moved to
Lewiston, Maine, raising sons and having three grandsons ``who were
not surprised at my travels.'' She has traveled the world, only
missing India and Australia. Soon she is off to Prague and
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled with her husband, Lewis, until his death two years
ago and now continues alone. And, she adds, her brother, Richard
Lovelace of Orleans on Cape Cod, ``travels as much or more than I
do and my sons have the travel urge also.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year she took a 12-day Mediterranean cruise on the Costa
Riviera calling on Israel, Egypt, and other ports, and offers some
senior travel tips from ``one who is brave but prudent'': On a
cruise, ask for a cabin mate as this reduces the price and is also
safer; take early seating at dinner and at a small table because
this allows you to meet others and also retire early; enjoy the
ship and don't feel you must take every tour; at ports, go ashore
and find your own car and driver, set a price, and then see the
area at a slower pace than the planned tour from the ship; eat
carefully when ashore _ hot tea is the safest drink, avoid fresh
fruit and salads; dress for comfort; follow the advice of ship's
officers or hotel staff on safety ashore and areas to avoid; and do
research before the trip at your library or travel agent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
St. Croix deal &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Purchase tickets before Sept. 24 and enjoy St. Croix for as low
as $234 per person per ticket. The deal is good at St. Croix's
Finest, a collection of three oceanfront hotels with affordable
rates. The hotels _ Hotel Caravelle, Tamarind Reef Hotel, and
Hibiscus Beach Hotel _ offer special rates between now and Dec. 14,
depending on property. The air fares are valid through Feb. 1. Call

   Canal celebration &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., is celebrating the 175th
anniversary of the Erie Canal with a major exhibit. The canal, once
referred to as ``Clinton's ditch'' _ a reference not to the
president but to the then New York governor DeWitt Clinton _ was a
major accomplishment for its day, with 363 miles and 83 locks,
almost entirely hand built. A merchant of the time described it as
``somewhat calculated to bewilder the senses.'' Through Oct. 29 the
college's Schenectady Museum will feature 122 items, including 31
drawings between 150 and 175 years old never before shown. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free night &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buy a guidebook and receive a free night at one of more than
1,500 inns. Inside each copy of the 12th edition of ``Bed &AMP;
Breakfasts and Country Inns'' is a certificate valid at any of the
inns described in the book and valued at between $50 and $650
depending on inn. You must purchase the first night at regular
rates. The book is $21.95, but by mentioning the Globe the price is
$16.95 plus $2.25 for shipping (shipping for additional books is 75
cents each). For a copy, call 800-397-4667, fax 949-499-4022, or

   Foliage on the quick &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two major highways into Vermont _ Interstate 89 and I-91 _
offer quick, direct routes to the foliage scene. By taking an easy
detour off the interstates, you can find lots to do. Off I-91, take
Exit 1 in Brattleboro but head first to the Guilford Welcome Center
where you can find lots of things to do in the area. The Country
Store and Deli at Exit 2 offers gourmet lunches, or head downtown
to Brattleboro for its shops. North on Route 30 is the picturesque
village of Newfane where the 30th annual Heritage Festival happens
Oct. 7-8. Or take Exit 18 in Barnet to one of the most photographed
towns in Vermont, Peacham. Oct. 5 is the Fourth Annual Peacham
Ghost Walk, and Maple Grove Farms of Vermont is open all year for
tours and samples. Off I-89, take Exit 1 into Quechee, home of the
Simon Pearce glass blowing and Quechee Gorge. Oct. 7-8 there's a
craft show, or continue to Woodstock where the Billings Farm &AMP;
Museum offers ``All About Apples'' Sept. 27, Pumpkin Day Sept. 30
and a Harvest Celebration, Oct. 8. Woodstock offers wonderful shops
and art galleries. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tennessee Homecoming &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Appalachia's Tennessee Fall Homecoming has been
called the most extensive and authentic gathering of old-time
musicians, pioneer-type craftspeople and folk artists in the
country. It features hundreds of people engaged in frontier,
mountain, and rural activities, along with more than 250
traditional, folk, early country, and bluegrass musicians. The
event has been cited as one of the top happenings in the country
and will be held Oct. 12-15 at the museum in Norris. For

</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a place where morality and huckleberries
flourished as they do here,'' wrote Mark Twain about Hartford in
1868. Twain made his home in Hartford from 1871 to 1891, his most
productive years. Now there is a free brochure, ``Mark Twain's
Hartford,'' listing 17 sites associated with the author. While the
first place to visit is his home, now a National Historic Landmark,
the guide ``offers opportunities for outdoor recreation, shopping,
and dining, for a day or a weekend,'' said David Bush of the Mark
Twain House. For a copy, call 860-247-0998, ext. 40, e-mail

SOME SPLASHY EXPRESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The English language would be a lot less colorful without
sayings that stem from the sea. Here, from American Hawaii Cruises,
are how some familiar expressions may have originated. Let us say
at the outset, though, that we realize there are alternate
explanations for some of these.
</P>
<P>
   --A scuttle was a hole cut into the side of a ship for light and
air. A butt was a wooden cask for provisions, including water. So
that the crew wouldn't drink a whole cask each day, captains would
scuttle a butt _ put a hole halfway up _ and pour in the day's
water ration. Thus, the place to get a drink was known as the
scuttled butt, and ``scuttlebutt'' came to mean rumors shared while
awaiting a drink.
</P>
<P>
   --One explanation for ``minding your P's and Q's'' is that
sailors were warned to watch their ``pea'' jackets and tar-moussed
pigtails (also called queues) so that their jackets would not
become tarred.
</P>
<P>
   --A typical ``square rigger'' sailing ship has three masts with
three yards (or sails) on each. When all square sails are flying
for maximum power, then _ voila! _ you have the ``whole nine
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   --The cat-o'-nine tails, used to punish sailors, was kept in a
cloth bag. Thus when someone said, ``the cat is out of the bag,''
some sailor was about to get his comeuppance.

Travel Trivia: What is the term for the objects tossed into the
sea? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Never board a cruise ship that has two of every species
lined up on the gangplank ahead of you'' _ from the cartoon

 &QL; 
Lifeboat drill joke: (Viking Serenade) ``Anyone jumping into the
water will be charged for a shore excursion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music, music, music: The first-ever gospel cruise aboard the
Norwegian Majesty, sailing from Boston to Bermuda, will feature Lee
Mitchell and Company during the May 6-13 sailing. From May 27-June
4, the annual oldies-but-goodies doo-wopp cruise will be held,
starring Harvey Robbins' Royalty of Rock 'n' Roll All-Stars. And
the July 8-15 cruise will include both Irish music and oldies, with
Celtic Clan and the Royalty of Rock 'n' Roll All Stars. Music
cruises include concerts, block parties in Bermuda, and private
parties, too. In addition, a free ``day of beauty'' at the Ashley
Paige Spa in Chelmsford will be given for every cabin booked. For
more information, call 978-256-6472.

   But not all on the same ship at the same time: More than 40
million people have taken a cruise in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Last week's trivia answer said Minnesota and Manitoba are
the state and province that share a border and begin with the same
letter. Some readers contend, however, that Ohio and Ontario is
also a correct answer. As Glenn S. Orenstein of Needham, Mass. puts
it, ``My atlas clearly shows that the international border running
down the middle of Lake Erie also forms the common border of Ohio
and of Ontario. Nothing in the Travel Trivia said anything about a
land border.'' Similar comments came from Massachusetts readers
Martin Gillieson, James L. Woodward, Don Bartlett, Buckeye Jim
Langell, Mike Fertitta, and Gordon Hartig, who also notes that
``Manitoba and Minnesota begin and end with the same letters. The
same thing is true with Ontario and Ohio.''

 &HT;    Armstrong looking forward to competing in Sydney
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Lance Armstrong is the two-time defending champion of
the
</P>
<P>
   grueling Tour de France, professional cycling's premier event.
The
</P>
<P>
   Olympic competition here is a ride in the park by comparison.
Yet, the
</P>
<P>
   Olympics also have meaning for Armstrong, who did not medal in
two
</P>
<P>
   previous Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back the third time is special to me, basically
because of
</P>
<P>
   what happened in Atlanta, because of the illness in Atlanta that
I
</P>
<P>
   didn't know about,'' Armstrong said. ``In Atlanta there was a
lot of
</P>
<P>
   pressure to perform. I was expected to be successful, but it
just wasn't
</P>
<P>
   going to happen. It wasn't meant to be. Now I can come back with
a new
</P>
<P>
   career.''
</P>
<P>
   And a new life. Not long after the 1996 Olympics, Armstrong
began
</P>
<P>
   coughing up blood. Lots of it. He was diagnosed with testicular
cancer,
</P>
<P>
   which had spread throughout his body, and was given only a 50-50
chance
</P>
<P>
   of surviving. He not only recovered, he resumed his career and
rode
</P>
<P>
   better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his arrival here Armstrong announced himself fit
for the
</P>
<P>
   time trial and road race to be contested next week. At least as
fit as
</P>
<P>
   could be expected. Three weeks ago the Austin, Texas, resident
suffered a
</P>
<P>
   horrifying crash on a training run near his second home in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very unlucky because we were on the back roads behind
Nice
</P>
<P>
   where there are no people,'' said Armstrong, who was riding with
Frankie
</P>
<P>
   Andreu and Tyler Hamilton. ``The roads were pretty small. We
were making
</P>
<P>
   a left hand turn. As soon as we got about halfway through the
corner,
</P>
<P>
   which was a blind corner, there was a car coming the other way.
There
</P>
<P>
   really was nothing we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the speeding car and Armstrong collided, he was thrown from
his
</P>
<P>
   bike, which crumpled instantly. Hamilton feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so loud,'' Hamilton said, recalling the collision. He
was
</P>
<P>
   relieved when Armstrong was able to talk and to rub his neck.
``We waited
</P>
<P>
   an hour and a half for my wife to come pick me up and she was
the next
</P>
<P>
   car to come by. It's just bad luck. Wrong place at the wrong
time. Could
</P>
<P>
   have been a lot worse, actually,'' Armstrong said. ``Crashes are
a part of
</P>
<P>
   what we do in training and in racing. It seems like every year I
have
</P>
<P>
   two big crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hamilton marveled, ``If you saw his bike you wouldn't
believe the
</P>
<P>
   shape he's in now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong suffered a broken vertebrae and explained, ``They
don't
</P>
<P>
   operate on it, they just let it heal. It's not a risky fracture.
I'm not
</P>
<P>
   at risk by riding with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's about 90 percent and that the injury shouldn't
affect him
</P>
<P>
   in the time trial, his specialty. He's also entered in the road
race
</P>
<P>
   with teammates Hamilton, George Hincapie, Fred Rodriguez and
Antonio
</P>
<P>
   Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road circuit is harder than people think,'' Armstrong
said. ``The
</P>
<P>
   climb up from the beach is longer than most people expect and
probably
</P>
<P>
   steeper than most people expect. I think after 240 kilometers it
will be
</P>
<P>
   a hard race.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that others on the team could win the one-day
event, and
</P>
<P>
   said, ``I'm at their disposal as well. If they need me to work,
then I
</P>
<P>
   will.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the main competition would be the ``usual suspects,''
the top
</P>
<P>
   riders, but didn't put Italian rival Marco Pantani in that
category for
</P>
<P>
   the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offense to Marco, but I don't think he can win,'' Armstrong
said. He
</P>
<P>
   said his main focus this year was the Tour, but the Tour is over
while
</P>
<P>
   the Olympics are still going on.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It's always been special to me and I remember when I
made the
</P>
<P>
   Olympic team in '92. It was a career high. It was something I
thought I
</P>
<P>
   would never been able to achieve when I was a young kid
swimming. That
</P>
<P>
   was my sport when I was growing up. I always looked at the
Olympic
</P>
<P>
   swimmers and thought how cool that would be to grow up and be an
Olympic
</P>
<P>
   swimmer. I don't think I had the talent to do that, but
fortunately I
</P>
<P>
   found my sport and now I'm able to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows, however, that there can be a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics are a huge event,'' Armstrong said. ``The folks
at home, I
</P>
<P>
   could win six Tours and if I lose the Olympics, they're going to
say,
</P>
<P>
   hey what's wrong with this guy? I thought he was supposed to be
a good
</P>
<P>
   cyclist. But that's the nature of the beast.''

 &HT;    Hall looking for American swim team to hit its stride
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY_ After breezing through a men's 100-meter freestyle
</P>
<P>
   preliminary Gary Hall Jr. joked, ``It's a lot easier when you
pace
</P>
<P>
   yourself. Somebody should have told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was referring to the race that still resonates here, the
men's
</P>
<P>
   4x100 meter freestyle relay. There, he hit the wall before he
touched
</P>
<P>
   it. Americans aren't used to seeing Hall reeled in from behind
the way
</P>
<P>
   Australia's boy wonder Ian Thorpe did in that race. Not only the
relay
</P>
<P>
   squad, but the entire U.S. team was stunned and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia had the momentum, but we came back the second
night,'' Hall
</P>
<P>
   said. ``We're right where we want to be, right where we need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, that's true. But the U.S. is still waiting for Neil
Walker to
</P>
<P>
   find his fifth gear. Walker made big waves in the swim world
earlier
</P>
<P>
   this year when he won seven medals, broke five world records and
10
</P>
<P>
   American records at the Short Course World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is counting on Walker, a former student at the
University of Texas, in and out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   After noting what a good training camp Walker had, men's coach
Mark
</P>
<P>
   Schubert added that what had really changed about Walker was the
</P>
<P>
   leadership he now displays on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, however, has yet to pop a really big swim in a pool and
</P>
<P>
   talent-laden competition where some swimmers are nailing
lifetime bests
</P>
<P>
   even in preliminaries. In the big relay, the U.S. went with Hall
as
</P>
<P>
   anchor and Walker swam the second leg, even though the beat Hall
in the
</P>
<P>
   100 meters in the U.S. swim trials. Walker's leg was okay, but
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   needed something spectacular there to beat the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   In the backstroke Walker finished sixth behind Lenny Krayzelburg
of the
</P>
<P>
   U.S, in a time that was half a second off his lifetime best of
54.58,
</P>
<P>
   which would have given him a bronze. Walker slipped pushing off
on that
</P>
<P>
   race and then said he took it out too hard trying to make up for
that.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Walker swam a 49.73-second 100 meter freestyle
that
</P>
<P>
   advanced him to the semifinals, but with the ninth best time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with the swim. I thought it could have been a
little
</P>
<P>
   faster, but I'm swimming a lot,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall swam a 49.32, good enough for the fifth best time and
cautioned,
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping for a medal...the 100 is going to be a tough
race. I
</P>
<P>
   have my sites set on the 50.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Walker and Hall, the 100 field includes Pieter
van den
</P>
<P>
   Hoogenband, who became a swimming superstar when he torpedoed
Thorpe in
</P>
<P>
   the 200 meters. Then, there's scary looking Australian Michael
Klim,
</P>
<P>
   head shaved, who just set the world record of 48.18 seconds at
this
</P>
<P>
   distance while burying the U.S. and the rest of the field on the
opening
</P>
<P>
   leg of the freestyle relay. There's also Russian Alexander
Popov, the
</P>
<P>
   man at this distance, and the defending gold medalist from the
Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Games.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything harder than winning the 100 it's Austin's
match-up
</P>
<P>
   with the Aussies in the 4x200 meter freestyle relay. The
Aussies, with
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe as anchor, are looking to break the world record. The
American
</P>
<P>
   squad, loaded with UT swimmers, has been described even by a
swimmer on
</P>
<P>
   that team as ``Josh and three other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Davis, who finished a heartbreaking fourth in the 200
meters,
</P>
<P>
   heads a talent pool of six that includes current UT swimmers
Scott
</P>
<P>
   Goldblatt, Nate Dusing and Jamie Rauch as well as Chad Carvin
and Klete
</P>
<P>
   Keller. Carvin and Keller are the U.S. 400 meter swimmers who
were also
</P>
<P>
   third and fourth respectively at the U.S. trials in the 200
behind Davis
</P>
<P>
   and Goldblatt. In the prelims, however, Rauch had the best time,
with
</P>
<P>
   Keller second.
</P>
<P>
   In other preliminary action the U.S.'s Misty Hyman had the best
</P>
<P>
   qualifying time in the women's 200 meter butterfly with gold
medal
</P>
<P>
   favorite Susie O'Neill close behind. In the men's 200 meter
breaststroke
</P>
<P>
   America's Tom Wilkens didn't advance to the semifinals and the
other
</P>
<P>
   entrant, Kyle Salyards, barely did. Italy once again surprised
as Davide
</P>
<P>
   Rummolo, swimming in lane seven in his heat, crushed the entire
field by
</P>
<P>
   more than a second with a time that was a staggering two and
one-half
</P>
<P>
   seconds better than his qualifying time.

AMHERST: WHAT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE TOWN IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Use the phrase ``New England College town''
anywhere in the country and the image that comes to mind will
probably look a lot like Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the magic formula is for an ideal college town, Amherst
appears to have most of the ingredients. A tree-shaded town common
is matched by equally leafy academic quadrangles. Buildings are
covered with ivy and encrusted with tradition. Streets are filled
with eager students and, for that matter, eager people of all ages.
In fact, the town has become increasingly popular with retirees
opting to be mentally challenged in the Brain Belt rather than
tanned in the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that many parents who bring their children
here at the start of the school year take a look around, like what
they see, and decide to linger a while. The combination of intense
intellectual, cultural, and social activity in a beautiful upper
Connecticut Valley setting also attracts visitors with no personal
or parental connection to local colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst, with a population of 35,000, is home to three of the
compatible but distinctly different institutions of what's called
the Five College Area: Amherst College, the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, and Hampshire College. The three have a
total enrollment of some 28,000 students: UMass has about 24,000,
Amherst 2,500, and Hampshire 1,500. The statistical line between
town and gown is blurry, however, since some students who live off
campus are also counted as residents.
</P>
<P>
   The other two area colleges, both all-female, are Mount Holyoke
in South Hadley and Smith in Northampton, the area's other focal
point. Larger, artier, and more of a commercial center than
Amherst, Northampton is linked to it by both highway and a 10
mile-long scenic bicycle trail that crosses the Connecticut River
on a former railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Students at any of the five colleges can take courses without
charge at any other one. A shuttle bus system, open to students and
non-students alike, connects all five campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College (413-542-2000, www.amherst.edu) is at the heart
of the town, its campus as much a part of the downtown as Harvard
Yard is of Harvard Square. In fact, the town's long common (laid
out in 1750) seems almost an extension of the college quadrangle.
The college's excellent art museum is currently closed for
renovation, but another notable campus museum, the Pratt Museum of
Natural History, is open daily and well worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   If you liked the movie ``Jurassic Park,'' chances are you'll
love the Pratt. Herds of dinosaurs once roamed the Connecticut
Valley (their fossilized tracks can still be seen in places), and
the museum, which has been collecting specimens since 1830, conveys
something of what this must have been like. Among the impressive
remains on display at the Pratt are a mastodon tooth, the jaw of a
giant shark, and the complete skeleton of a mammoth that has awed
generations of schoolchildren. The geology section, which explains
how glaciers created the Connecticut Valley, is also quite
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Two of America's greatest poets, Robert Frost and Emily
Dickinson, lived in Amherst and their influence can still be felt.
Frost was a lecturer and fellow at Amherst College off and on for
46 years, and the college named a library or him. In addition to
its permanent exhibits on Frost, the library also has rotating
exhibits on Dickinson. The town's Jones Library (413-256-4090,
www.joneslibrary.org) at 43 Amity St. has an exhibit and a large
collection of manuscripts and other material relating to the two
poets in its special collections department.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson was born here in 1830 and died here in 1886. She lived
most of her life in the family home at 280 Main St. The Dickinson
Homestead (413-542-8161/www.amherst.edu/edhouse) is now a national
historic landmark owned by the trustees of Amherst College. It is
open to visitors from 1-4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday through
October, with guided tours offered on the hour, and on Wednesdays
only until Dec. 10, when it closes for the winter. An exception is
made on Saturday, December 9, for an open house to celebrate
Dickinson's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the house looks much as it did in Dickinson's life, it
holds no original furnishings. However, there are many photographs,
letters, manuscripts, and even one of the original white dresses
that were the reclusive poet's trademark. Her former bedroom _
where she is believed to have written most of her poems _ has been
furnished as it might have been in her day.
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire College, which opened in 1970 to provide an
alternative to traditional liberal arts education, is located in
the rural outskirts of town, a few miles south of Amherst College
and downtown. Tucked into one corner of the campus and surrounded
by an apple orchard is the area's newest cultural resource, the
National Yiddish Book Center (413-256-4900,
www.yiddishbookcenter.org.)
</P>
<P>
   The center, a complex of wooden buildings designed to suggest a
shtetl (a Jewish village in Eastern Europe) around the turn of the
20th century, opened in 1997. A repository for rescued Yiddish
language books _ once being thrown into trash bins and dumpsters at
an alarming rate as native Yiddish speakers died _ the center now
houses 120,000 books at the Amherst facility and has more than a
million other volumes in storage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The center's exhibition rooms trace the history of Yiddish
culture, with displays on printing (including the only surviving
Yiddish linotype machine), movies, theater, and radio. A gift shop
has both translations of Yiddish books and works by contemporary
Jewish writers. There are also changing art exhibits and frequent
lectures and special programs.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling 1,400-acre Amherst campus of the University of
Massachusetts (413-545-0111, www.umass.edu) is a few miles north of
the center of town on Route 116. The flagship of the state
university system, it is pretty much a self-contained academic
community. However, many facilities such as the Arts Center (which
contains concert and recital halls, a theater, art studios, and
galleries) and the Mullin Center (used for basketball, hockey, and
larger concerts) serve the entire area. A visitor center is stocked
with maps and brochures, and guided tours of the campus are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst's downtown business district isn't large, essentially a
few blocks on Main and South and North Pleasant, but has all the
things that make college towns easy to live in and hard to leave.
Notices on walls and bulletin boards advertise concerts, plays,
screenings, and other entertainment. In addition to the
to-be-expected bookshops (there are five in town and about two
dozen in the area), Amherst offers music stores, clothing outlets,
cafes, art galleries, and a variety of ethnic and New Age
restaurants, most geared to modest budgets and/or adventurous
palates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for directions out of town, the clerk in one South
Pleasant Street store was unhelpful but apologetic. ``I've only
been here a year,'' he explained, ``and I haven't gone anywhere
yet.''

CRUISING THROUGH EUROPEAN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE M/S RIVER HARMONY IN EUROPE _ I awoke in my cabin one
morning to the sound of splashing water. I drew back the curtain
and there was the Danube River rushing by my picture window, so
close I could have reached out and touched it. It wasn't blue, but
a green-gray.
</P>
<P>
   Some ducks swimming by stared back at me. I looked up at the
cliffs that loomed from the riverbank and saw a turreted fairy-tale
castle. Could this be a dream?
</P>
<P>
   Zither music playing ``The Third Man'' and ``Lili Marleen''
swirled in my head. The scene was so beautiful I started humming
``The Blue Danube.'' But, alas, I cannot carry a tune in a bucket.
It sounded that way.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was not a dream. Happily so.
</P>
<P>
   The River Harmony was docked on the Danube in Vienna when I
first set bleary, jet-lagged eyes on the ship that would take 133
passengers from around the United States, including myself, along
what is described as the ``Great Rivers of Europe'' for two weeks
in late May.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, half expecting a Mississippi-style sidewheeler,
I thought the River Harmony was a permanently-docked hotel. I was
staggered by its size and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   White-hulled with blue trim and 361 feet long, River Harmony has
four decks; polished wood; comfortable cabins with beds that fold
into settees during the day, equipped with heat, air conditioning,
telephone and television; a dining room; lounge; library; elevator;
fitness center; and all the amenities (like laundry service) of a
first-class hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of nine river cruise ships owned and operated by
Boston-based Grand Circle Travel plying Europe's waterways. From
spring through fall, these ships take travelers on beautiful
journeys along the Danube, the Main, and the Rhine rivers.
</P>
<P>
   River Harmony brought us to some wondrous places _ villages,
towns and cities steeped in history and legend _ past a landscape
lush with vineyards, fields of asparagus, wheat, wildflowers, and
the yellow rapeseed used in canola oil.
</P>
<P>
   From the ship's decks, we inhaled sweet, pure Bavarian air and
saw magical sights _ castles, seemingly suspended in air, ruins of
old fortifications where historic battles were fought, the site of
the Remagen Bridge, where the Allies first crossed the Rhine on
March 7, 1945. Ten days later, the bridge collapsed and its
remaining towers are now a Peace Museum.
</P>
<P>
   We passed monuments of legends, like the Lorelei Rock on the
Rhine where sailors were said to have been lured to watery graves
by Lorelei's singing. We waved at passing barges hauling coal and
lumber and the people who worked and lived aboard them, their
laundry hanging on deck to dry and their car and bike parked there
for land use.
</P>
<P>
   Our journey started in Vienna, continued to cities and small
towns in the Bavarian and Franconian regions of Germany, and ended
two weeks later in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   It stretched 927.8 miles along the Danube, the Rhine-Main-Danube
Canal, and the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we passed through 66 locks, an awesome experience
for us all to watch the huge gates open and close and our ship rise
and descend like an elevator as it passed from level to level along
the canal's changing elevation.
</P>
<P>
   Like Al and Beryl Booth of East Falmouth, we could only marvel
at the engineering feat that built the locks. ``This trip has
everything,'' Beryl said, ``nature, geography, agriculture, and
man's ingenuity against the elements.''
</P>
<P>
   We were blessed by the presence of three knowledgeable, witty,
and caring German tour guides working for Grand Circle Travel _
Heiner &UR;  &LR; Schmidt, &UR;  &LR; the senior program director; Klaus Bauer; and
Mike Gutknecht, all with a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
   They made every mile come alive for us with their retelling of
history and legend, not only on our land tours, but in the nightly
``port talks'' aboard ship about the next day.
</P>
<P>
   They and our captain often went beyond the call of duty. When
two couples arrived a day late because of airline problems in the
States and our ship had to depart on schedule, one guide stayed
behind to wait for them at the Vienna airport.
</P>
<P>
   The guides made it possible for several of us to get an
unscheduled look at the Opera House just before our scheduled
departure from Vienna by sending Klaus along with us on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   When a passenger needed a doctor, our captain got on his bicycle
and rode into town to get her prescription filled.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, River Harmony was our ``home.'' Once unpacked,
that was it. There were no changing hotels every night, no getting
baggage to the lobby by 5 a.m., no tiring bus rides. After a few
days, everyone agreed with veteran travelers Alden Jackson of
Westminster, Md., and Peggy Saliunas of New Cumberland, Pa. ``If
you want to see many places,'' they said, ``and hate the idea of
packing and unpacking, forgetting things and meeting tight
schedules, river travel is for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was also pleased that River Harmony, like other Grand
Circle river ships, accommodated no more than about 140 passengers,
not the thousands big ocean cruises carry. There were no casinos,
no shopping malls, no Las Vegas acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never take another ocean cruise,'' said Gene Start of
Livonia, Mich., and his wife, Barbara, agreed. ``On cruise ships,
once you hit a port, everyone rushes to the exits like cattle and
you have to wait. Then, you have to take a cab or launch into town.
Here, we just walk off the gangplank and we're in these charming
little towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Peg Myers of Tyler, Texas, had traveled around Germany
before, but said this trip was the best. ``I'm totally relaxed,''
Bill said. ``I want to be catered to and that's just what I'm
experiencing. Grand Circle is really on to something. This is
really going to hurt tour bus travel.'' Peg agreed. ``There are so
many things on this trip higher than our expectations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We appreciated the fact that dress was casual, even though our
three daily gourmet-caliber meals were served in the ship's elegant
dining room. The only time I saw men in ties was at the captain's
farewell dinner. Women didn't need a fancy wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern,'' said Jerry Robb of Gaithersburg, Md., ``is
which pair of jeans I should wear.'' Her husband, O'Brien Atkinson,
said that while this was their first river cruise, ``It won't be
our last.'' Mealtime was a high point. Sigi Wilke of Germany, the
head chef, with 15 years' experience on passenger ships, and his
four assistants made every meal aboard River Harmony a gourmet
treat. Sigi told me his staff served 500 meals, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   We ate freshly caught seafood, choice meats, homemade breads,
and, for dessert, creme brulee, baked Alaska, and ice cream. Wine
at dinner, with unlimited refills, was complimentary. ``It's going
to be hard to go back to cereal after this,'' said Sirpa McConkie
of Bountiful, Utah, voicing all our feelings.
</P>
<P>
   River Harmony was both a floating hotel and a floating
university, ``a cruise through history'' as one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, a printed background sheet of where we would visit
the next day was left in our cabins just as a candy mint was left
on the pillow of our turned-down bed.
</P>
<P>
   Our captain, Dingeman van Ijzerlooij, 46, and second captain,
John Creemers, both from the Netherlands, navigated River Harmony
through the locks with perfect seamanship.
</P>
<P>
   Our captain had other talents. He took part in the hijinks of
crew entertainment night and he kept a portable sewing machine on
the bridge where he made vests and other apparel for the crew and
waitstaff.
</P>
<P>
   He told me he started sewing as a boy when he traveled on barges
his parents operated. ``My father was the captain and my mother,
the mate,'' he said. ``I took it up again when I began working on
passenger ships. I lost a lot of weight and had to take in in my
trousers.'' He even sews for his wife and child.
</P>
<P>
   He was working on red-white-and-blue vests for the crew to wear
on July 4 as our trip ended. The young crew of 34 came from around
the world, from South Africa to Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Vienna on a Saturday, we sailed past the vineyards of
the Wachau Valley to our first port of call at Melk, Austria, where
we visited the ornate 900-year-old Benedictine Abbey and joined
Austrian families and other tourists for a Sunday stroll in the
abbey's gardens.
</P>
<P>
   From there, we were taken on a 45-minute drive along the Danube
to the Austrian wine-growing village of Grein and, as we rode,
Heiner, a former headmaster and teacher of German, history and
English at a school in England, told us the local legend of the
Nibelungs, the evil German family with a hoard of magic gold. Grein
was our last stop in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, we visited towns where the maypole was still up from
the May 1 celebration; cities like Cologne with its soaring
cathedral, Heidelberg with its university, Nuremberg where the war
crime trials were held; towns where we drank ``smoked'' beer in the
town square.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled wine at the wineries where it was made, ate
gingerbread, or lebkuchen, in a town famous for it, strolled
through outdoor public markets where white asparagus, huge
pretzels, sausages, and assorted other produce was sold; listened
to oompah music in beer gardens; and visited famous museums and
castles.

LACK OF FATHER AFFECTS SELF-ESTEEM OF BLACK YOUTHS

<P>
   Living in a fatherless family damages a black boy's self-esteem,
says a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the black community, there's a slogan, 'Black mothers raise
their daughters and love their sons,''' says one of the study's
authors, Carolyn B. Murray, an associate professor at the
University of California, Riverside. ``It's the father who holds
that boy accountable. He has that boy toe the line; he holds the
rules and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But when fathers aren't present in black families, regardless of
such things as family income and education, young boys' self-esteem
drops, the study says. That doesn't appear to happen with young
girls in these families, it says.
</P>
<P>
   What this means for the boys, experts say, can range from their
having problems in school to participating in gangs as part of
their search for male role models.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``real crisis,'' Murray says. Just 25 percent of black
children were raised in homes in which only the mother was present
in 1960, she says, but that number had climbed to 54 percent by
1993. In addition, she says, 78 percent of all black families were
headed by married couples in 1950, down to 34 percent by 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The children's scores on the study's tests reflect these
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring general self-esteem, for instance, boys from families
headed by married couples scored higher than boys from families
headed solely by a mother, the researchers say. Girls scored
similarly, but with much less difference between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   Scores on specific self-esteem issues paint an even darker
picture, Murray says, citing the question of how a boy sees his
body, or how macho he feels. Boys coming from families with a
father scored higher _ meaning they felt stronger, more competitive
_ than did boys from families without fathers, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on a study of 116 African-American
15-year-olds from Southern California, appear in the September
issue of the Journal of Family Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers this poses for young black boys can be serious,
Murray says, though she cautions that it's important not to
generalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at risk for joining gangs because they're looking for
a male influence, for direction, for a male model,'' she says.
``And they're also at risk for not doing as well at school.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a father seems to lead to lower self-esteem
because fathers expect more from their sons than mothers do, Murray
says. Where a mother might expect a daughter to do homework, get
dinner ready and clean the house after school, she says, the mother
might expect little from a son.
</P>
<P>
   And expectations that are met yield higher self-esteem, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers hold girls accountable; fathers hold boys
accountable,'' Murray says. ``Two parents are better than one.''
</P>
<P>
   George Garrow, executive director of the National Organization
of Concerned Black Men, says boys growing up in fatherless families
seem to do well until around the third grade, when they begin to
need focus. Lacking a father's influence, he says, they begin to
seek male role models elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they get their role model experience from other young
boys, who are equally clueless,'' Garrow says. If the father role
is never filled, he says, the boys may join gangs or find unhealthy
mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man is going to play out what he thinks this image
is, to be a man,'' Garrow says.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says, it's not just the self-esteem that's
damaged by the absence of a father. ``It impacts the psychological,
social and emotional development of young boys,'' Garrow says.
</P>
<P>
   The California study shows family income playing a small part in
boys' self-esteem, as does how the family is organized. Boys
probably feel more responsible for a family's income and how power
is divided in the family, Murray speculates. How well a family
actually functions, however, had a much greater effect on girls
than boys, she says, probably because girls take responsibility for
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage counseling and jobs programs that would help black men
remain at home could help the situation portrayed in the study,
Murray says.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ At 6 feet 7 inches, with a thin waist and
cantilevered chest, Tom Malchow takes a 42 extra long in the new
high-tech swimming bodysuits. He trains ferociously, even pulling a
10-gallon bucket through the water to increase drag, just as track
sprinters trail parachutes during workouts.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the world record in the 200-meter butterfly, and no one
appeared capable of beating him in the Olympic final on a night of
sustained brilliance and swift redemption. But Malchow felt oddly
nervous after his warmup, his stomach churning like the water that
he roils with his rapacious windmilling stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go out too fast, his coach Jon Urbancek told Malchow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can catch you coming home,'' the coach reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming a wonderfully controlled race, Malchow restrained the
urge to chase the leaders early and took over the 200 butterfly in
the final 50 meters, winning a gold medal in 1 minute 55.35
seconds, an Olympic record and the third fastest time ever. It was
the sixth victory for the United States in swimming at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Malchow was the youngest American
swimmer at age 19. A native of St. Paul, Minn., he won a silver
medal in the 200 butterfly and was then known as ``Puppy Chow.''
Now he is the big dog, having posted eight of the 12 fastest times
in the event, including the world record of 1:55.18.
</P>
<P>
   ``For four years, I've wanted that moment,'' an ecstatic Malchow
said. ``The world record was great, but this is unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning swim Tuesday night occurred in the semifinals
of 100-meter freestyle, when Pieter van den Hoogenband of the
Netherlands shattered the world record in 47.84. In a race where
records are usually lowered by hundredths of a seconds, he shaved
more than three-tenths of a second from the previous standard of
48.18. Ten swimming world records have now been set at these
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch star seemed as astonished as he had been on Monday
after defeating Ian Thorpe, Australia's boy wonder, in the
200-meter freestyle, matching his own world record of 1:45.35. He
hardly slept after the victory and said he felt tired having to
swim again Tuesday in the 100-freestyle. The final is Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this at all,'' van den Hoogenband said. ``I
wasn't going full speed. I can go at least a tenth of a second
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Because swimming has been tarnished through the years by drug
cheats, van den Hoogenband's time is certain to raise some
suspicions. However, Gary Hall, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in
the 100 freestyle, said he had no doubts that the Dutch swimmer was
clean. Van den Hoogenband has a history of impressive speed, having
finished fourth in the 100 freestyle at the Atlanta Games and
having won six gold medals at the 1999 European championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no questions whether he's clean or not,'' Hall said
after qualifying for Wednesday's final in sixth place. ``He is
clean, in my opinion. He's proven it in the past. It's not like he
came out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After being upset in the 200 freestyle, Thorpe recovered
assertively Tuesday night, swimming the leadoff leg of Australia's
800-meter relay team that broke its own world record in 7:07.05.
Thorpe provided the Australians a three-second lead with his leg
and won his third gold medal of the Olympics. The Americans
finished a distant second in 7:12.64. Thorpe is expected to seek a
fourth gold on Australia's 400-meter individual medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to go out there and get the best time for this
relay team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia took its second gold medal Tuesday night and fourth of
the competition when Susie O'Neill, the defending Olympic champion
in the 200-meter butterfly, won the 200 freestyle in 1:58.24. Yana
Klochkova, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, became a double winner by
taking the 200-meter individual medley in 2:10.68. She previously
set a world record in the 400 IM last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze medal in the 200 IM went to Cristina Teuscher of New
Rochelle, N.Y., in 2:12.57. After her senior year of high school,
Teuscher won a gold medal on the American 800-meter freestyle relay
at the Atlanta Games. However, she grew unnerved by pressure during
her individual performances, finishing sixth in the 200 freestyle
and eighth in the 400 freestyle. In Sydney, she appeared far more
relaxed and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows I've definitely matured a lot,'' Teuscher said.
</P>
<P>
   She could have attended any of the major collegiate swimming
powers, such as Stanford or the University of Southern California,
but she remained close to her parents and attended Columbia
University. She recently graduated with a degree in psychology.
Tuesday night's performance confirmed that her decision had been
the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't ever a question in my mind,'' Teuscher said. She
added, ``You can't complain when you get a medal in the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Malchow attended the University of Michigan but did not win any
collegiate titles even though he was an Olympic silver medalist by
age 19. Tall and thin, he was ``all arms and legs,'' according to
Urbancek, his college and club coach. Weight training and workouts
with a medicine ball helped strengthen Malchow's torso, and he now
with a smoothly undulating stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hugs the water like a fish,'' Urbancek said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Malchow wore a sleeveless version of a bodysuit
that covered him from neck to ankles. In June, he became the first
American to set a world record in the new suit by Speedo, known as
the Fastskin suit, which mimics sharkskin in that it contains tiny
V-shaped ridges to help water pass more efficiently over a
swimmer's body. By compressing the muscles, the suit is also said
to reduce the buildup of lactic acid, which causes fatigue. Malchow
said he rides higher in the water, encountering less resistance and
holding his form as exhaustion sets into his body like an infection
in the final, churning meters of the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The suit provides also provides a psychological edge, he said,
adding that he feels a bit like Clark Kent changing in a phone
booth into Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me confidence,'' he said. ``The mental edge is
important. I feel like my body is sliding through the water. I feel
like I imagine a shark does.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the new suit has helped him, so has a change in the
rules that do not allow a swimmer to remain under water for more
than 15 meters at the start and off the turns. Denis Pankratov of
Russia remained under water for 30 to 35 meters with his dolphin
kick in winning the 100 and 200 butterfly at the Atlanta Games.
Tuesday night, Pankratov set a searing early pace but faded to
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule change helped Tom a lot,'' Urbancek said. ``He was
not very good under water.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As do many swimmers, Malchow first climbed into the water as a
way to relieve childhood bouts of asthma, which seemed mollified by
breathing in the warm, humid air of an indoor pool. Because he was
growing so fast as a 10-year-old, his knee became extremely sore,
and his right leg was placed in a cast for about a month to help
strengthen the hinge joint.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Malchow watched the Los Angeles Games on television and
read that Michael Gross, the German swimmer known as the Albatross
for his avian wingspan, had been awarded a Porsche for his
gold-medal winning performances in the 200 freestyle and the 100
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow's father told him he would give him a Corvette if he
ever won an Olympic gold medal of his own. Not only did Tom grow up
to be the same height as Malchow, he also became an Olympic
champion in the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got to pay up,'' Tim Malchow said of his son. ``I
dodged a bullet in `96. But it's a pretty good trade.''
</P>
<P>
   After 50 meters Tuesday night, Malchow sat in fifth place, which
may have seemed disappointing, but a restrained start had been
planned. He had gone out too quickly at the Olympic trials in July
and had struggled home. In the Olympics, Malchow bided his time,
moving to third place, then second with 50 meters remaining, before
drawing away down the homestretch, finishing nearly a half second
ahead of Denys Sylantyev of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strength is the back half,'' Malchow said. ``If I was
within half a body length, no one was going to catch me coming
home.''

`NO WORRIES' FOR AN ANXIOUS NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Doesn't anyone here worry? Ever?
</P>
<P>
   Don't have exact change for the bus? No worries.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know how to get to the Olympic Stadium? No worries.
</P>
<P>
   Running late for a Dream Team game? No worries.
</P>
<P>
   It's the inevitable rejoinder to any expression of anxiety, an
all-purpose palliative for the stressed-out visitor. No phrase
better captures the laid-back veneer of Australian life. One hears
it so regularly in Sydney that it ends up being devoid of meaning _
a Down Under version of ``have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just as well because the no-worries Australian is as
threadbare a cliche as the guy who swills Foster's, wrestles
crocodiles and wears a leather hat with bobbing corks to swat away
the flies.
</P>
<P>
   Australians worry all the time, and this high anxiety helps
explain why these Olympic Games are shaping up as among the
smoothest in memory. Far from relaxing, tens of thousands of
Australians are sweating every detail of what they describe as the
greatest peacetime logistical exercise in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australians are some of the most self-critical people in the
world,'' said Daniel Mulcahy, a local businessman. ``They're
incredibly insecure. And everybody knows that we're in the world
spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, the Games are an opportunity to demonstrate that
this geographically isolated country is a full member of the global
economy. For Sydney, they are a chance to showcase a city with
ambitions to become a Pacific Rim financial center on the order of
Tokyo or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been tested on something this big before,'' said
Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney organizing committee.
``The closest thing to it in complexity is a military operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is apt because, for a freewheeling city, Sydney
is putting on a remarkably locked-down Olympics. Security is
airtight, with a series of checkpoints around the Olympic Park. The
police have closed down more than 90 roads throughout the city to
reduce the number of cars.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage terrorist attacks, more than 2,000 hidden cameras
survey Olympic sites and popular tourist areas like Darling Harbor
in central Sydney. Nearly 5,000 police officers patrol the park at
Homebush Bay, augmented by 4,000 soldiers who can be deployed in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The security net has spared nobody, including the singer Olivia
Newton-John, who performed at the opening ceremony. Newton-John had
to wait at the stadium gate while her car was searched by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's massive security has not come without sacrifices. In
some far-flung towns _ places with names like Tullibigeal and
Quandialla _ the lone police officer has been transferred to Sydney
for duty at the Games. Sydney's police commissioner, Peter Ryan,
has promised to compensate these towns by assigning extra police
officers after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Parliament laid the legal groundwork for the
heightened security by passing the Olympic Arrangements Act. The
act curtails a wide range of activities _ from street
demonstrations and ticket scalping to parking in ``clearways'' and
flying in closed airspace _ for the duration of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament also granted Australia's defense forces unprecedented
powers to help in law enforcement, including the right to enter
buildings and to stop and search vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say these acts would alarm civil-liberties advocates in
the United States. But there was barely a peep of protest here.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone protest when Bob Carr, the premier of New South
Wales, threatened to jail demonstrators who had disrupted an
economic conference in Melbourne if they carried their placards and
megaphones to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, we were at the end of the earth and on the
dark side of the moon,'' said Thomas Keneally, the author and
critic, ``so when there is a chance to shine, we tend to seize it
with both hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to put on a trouble-free Olympics is so intense
that individualistic Australians are willing to accept a dash of
authoritarianism. Freedom and authority have always coexisted in
Australia. This is, after all, a country where one can be fined for
failing to vote in elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of Australia were laid-back convicts and
authoritarian jailors, and we're seeing a bit of both today,'' said
Keneally, who is best known for his Holocaust novel, ``Schindler's
List.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to show a good face to the world extends even to
Australia's disenfranchised. Last week, a group of dissident
students milled in Victoria Park, debating whether to join an
anti-Olympics rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to tell the world what a terrible country Australia
is,'' a young man with earrings in his nose and eyebrows said to a
reporter standing nearby. His friend whispered: ``Actually, this is
a pretty good country. We just choose to live outside the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the strict rules and exhaustive planning have not
eliminated all the bugs. In the first week of the Games, Sydney has
been plagued by problems with its bus service. The city hired
hundreds of extra drivers to operate buses that carry passengers to
sports sites and tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these drivers come from country towns and are unfamiliar
with Sydney's crazy-quilt streets. Not surprisingly, the drivers
are getting lost _ sometimes on the way to Olympic events. Making
matters worse, they are being put up in lodgings so spartan that
some quit after a few days.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cockburn, the organizing committee spokesman, said the city
government pressed soldiers into service as drivers. He also said
that navigators, known as tour leaders, now ride with the
out-of-town drivers to show them the way.
</P>
<P>
   While officials have scrambled to fix the buses, they note with
satisfaction that the problems here are minuscule compared with the
chaos of the transportation system in the first week of the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the IBM computers that supply scores and other
statistics. While Atlanta was embarrassed by errant scores and
wayward statistics, the only lapse in Sydney, Cockburn said, was on
the first day of the archery competition, when a computer was
baffled by a tie score.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sydney's triumphs have been unsung. During the four-hour
opening ceremony, an estimated 200,000 cellular calls were made by
the 110,000 spectators inside Olympic Stadium. About 125,000 of
those were carried on the mobile-phone network of Telstra, the
state-controlled phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Telstra said more than 97 percent of the calls were completed
without a delay or a cutoff in service. The company invested more
than $50 million to upgrade its network for the Olympics,
installing what it says is the world's densest cellular network in
a single building.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the opening ceremony, Telstra's executives
displayed a characteristic mix of Australian bravado and nerves.
Brian Pilbeam, the general manager of special events and Olympics,
said he would be relieved, but not surprised, if the cellular
network worked well.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the stubborn desire of Sydneysiders to convince
the world that the Olympics are a walk in the park?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very irreverent country,'' said Malcolm Turnbull,
the head of the so-far-unsuccessful movement to turn Australia into
a republic. ``The other side of that coin is something we call the
`tall poppy' syndrome. We tend to be suspicious of people who come
across as too clever or successful.''

8 FOR 8 AS U.S. BOXERS CONTINUE UNBEATEN IN OPENING-ROUND MATCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Indonesia)   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ What do you do to stand out when you're the
eighth American Olympic boxer to climb in the ring and the previous
seven boxers from your team have not only won, but won
convincingly?
</P>
<P>
   If you're light middleweight Jermain Taylor you knock out your
opponent in the first round with one straight right hand to the
chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it eight for eight,'' said Taylor after his
striking victory over Dimitriy Usagin of Bulgaria. ``Everybody
knows we got a streak going.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he had a $5 bet with middleweight teammate Jeff Lacy
over who could knock out the most opponents. Lacy won his
first-round fight Monday after just two rounds, though officially
his fight was stopped because he had a commanding 15-point lead on
the judges' scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor hit Usagin with a right hand that sent the Bulgarian
toppling face first in the middle of the ring, a rare sight in
amateur boxing where punches are blunted by headgear and referees
protect fighters with regular stoppages if the action grows too
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Taylor said he had a message for Lacy. ``That's how you
knock somebody out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usagin got up and stood on wobbling legs, but the referee had
already halted the fight. So officially, Taylor won't receive a
knockout either, it's a referee's stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're still even on the bet then,'' said Taylor,
another one of the American's less heralded fighters who has
impressively dominated his preliminary fight.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mustin, the smiling U.S. coach said, ``That's as close to a
knockout as you can get in amateur boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Mustin was told of the Taylor-Lacy bet, he looked less
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about that,'' he said. ``I've talked to Lacy
about how you can't go for knockouts, just throw your punches and
if they come they come. Now I'll have to tell Jermain the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jose Navarro, an American flyweight, weathered two
close rounds with Hermensen Ballo of Indonesia before he pulled
away to win a 16-10 decision. Navarro came out cautiously, as most
of the Americans have, but was much more active in the third round
when he outpointed Ballo, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I wasn't throwing enough punches,'' Navarro said. ``I
might have been waiting to get more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy, a 22-year-old from Little Rock, Ark., also said he was
working off the rust on his boxing style in his 117 seconds in the
ring Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was rust,'' said Lacy, who was leading 4-1 on the
judges cards when Usagin went down. ``I'll be better in my
second-round fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustin, meanwhile, left the boxing venue with his boxers
undefeated after four sessions in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup,'' he said walking from the ring, ``another good day.''

PSYCHOPATH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO READ YOUR FEAR

<P>
   The kid who beat you up for your lunch money and the criminal
who keeps landing back in jail both might be driven by an emotional
disorder that prevents them from reading your emotions of fear or
sadness, claims new research.
</P>
<P>
   This inability to recognize the face of fear might predict
psychopathic behavior, says lead researcher James Blair, senior
lecturer at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad and fear faces are social punishers,'' Blair says. ``The
normal person will associate any action which produces crying or
hurts another person as aversive. But the person with psychopathic
tendencies can't make that association. They can't be socialized.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers speculate that psychopathic behaviors stem from
lesions in the amygdala, a small, nut-shaped portion of the brain,
located underneath the temporal lobe. Damage to this region, which
deals mainly with emotional learning, may contribute to criminal
tendencies, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But, Blair says someone who's unable to associate another
person's fear and reactions with his or her own unacceptable
behavior will not necessarily become a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only those people who have a good reason to commit a crime _
who are poor, for example _ will commit it,'' he says. ``If you
gave them $10 million, they won't mug you, but they will still be
an unpleasant person to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers based their findings on how a group of young
boys and another group of imprisoned men perceived various
emotions. They asked each group to identify whether a face on a
computer screen was experiencing sadness, fear, anger, happiness,
disgust or surprise. The first face held a neutral expression and
morphed into 20 gradations along the range of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 boys aged 9 to 17 attended special schools. All were
given a standardized behavior test to determine their psychopathic
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 men in the study were aged 22 to 50 years and were being
held in high-security prisons in the London area. They, too, were
tested for psychopathic tendencies. Neither group was tested for
brain lesions, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Both the men and the boys had difficulty identifying fear in the
computerized faces; the boys also had problems recognizing sadness,
the study says. Results were presented at a recent conference of
the British Psychological Society in Bristol, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion is consistent with psychoanalytic thinking,''
says Dr. Leon Hoffman, child psychoanalyst and co-director of the
Parent-Child Center of the New York Psychoanalytic Society. ``In
order to develop empathy for another person, you have to accept the
idea that you and I are two different people, and that should
happen between the ages of 3 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair says he hopes the study will help people look at
psychopathic behavior as an emotional disorder, and not as a
biological basis of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether it's due to genetic or early
environmental stresses. It's like depression, which is horrific for
both the person and the victims of that person,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, he says, ``The best we can hope for is the
identification'' of these psychopathic tendencies. In the long
term, further studies may help with treatment, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are likely to have, in the not-too-distant future,
pharmaceutical agents which will boost the system, (and which,
along with cognitive therapy,) will help predict who will or won't
offend,'' Blair says.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hoffman cautions that, ``from a critical perspective,
children need a lot of intensive work, and anything less than
intensive treatment is often worse.''
</P>
<P>
   If a child needs therapy, Hoffman says ``working with parents to
develop a greater amount of socialization and empathy and getting
the child to recognize the other person as a significant person''
is a difficult task.

CHALLENGED EARLY, U.S. MEN SUBDUE ITALY, 93-61, IN BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Bill Gates paid the U.S. men's basketball
team a visit in their locker room Tuesday night, moments after
another nettlesome competitor tried to toy with their global
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, CEO of Microsoft and among the world's richest men, did
not commiserate with the American multimillionaires over high tax
brackets. But with all these uppity foreign opponents grabbing at
their jerseys and making them come across as bullies when the
superior Americans respond, the kinship is natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't even ask for autographs anymore,'' Gary
Payton lamented after Italy begrudgingly went down, 93-61.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of maintaining World domination is clearly
beginning to wear on the U.S. men, who won the game but failed to
win over the crowd of 8,368 at the Dome in Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Vince Carter threw down a tremendous, alley-oop dunk in the
first half that had the building in a state of disbelief. And with
22 points off the fast break, they entertained everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But the masses jeered in the second half when Carter and the
feisty Italian guard Allesandro Abbio grabbed and held each other
until Carter planted a forearm in his throat and knocked him down.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed at Italy's defiance, coach Rudy Tomjanovich of the United
States quickly sicced a full-court press on the Italians with less
than 9 minutes left. The score at the time: 78-46.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA apparently feels it does not merely have to win; it
must win so convincingly that not a single soul comes away with the
notion that America was ever in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good international players,'' Tomjanovich began
matter-of-factly, ``but the other countries don't have 12 of them
on the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an ornery resilience creeping into international play,
though. You can see it with each game. Whether they have been
watching Heat-Knicks playoff contests on tape is unclear, but
somewhere Italy and the other nations are beginning to learn the
art of the well-placed elbow in the small of the back.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, when Italy's best player, Gregor Fucka,
caught Alonzo Mourning with a open hand to the face, the Italians
showed none of the great respect afforded other international teams
comprised of NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, Carter and Kevin Garnett took the physical challenge to
heart, going at their opponents hard. It was not uncommon to see
the 7-foot Garnett bodying up his man near halfcourt, trying any
tactic to take away the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star afterward bristled at one
reporter's suggestion that the Americans should begin sending
college players again to make it fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like fighting,'' Garnett said. ``I get my five, you get
your five from the neighborhood. I'm going to try and find the
grimiest, dirtiest cats I can.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether it plays or not back home, that is how the
gold-medal pursuit is apparently going to go. With three
preliminary games left, the U.S. men moved to 2-0 in Group A.
Carter had 13 points, Mourning added 12 points and six blocked
shots and Jason Kidd contributed 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Carter rose for an alley-oop pass from
Garnett on the left side of the rim. The ball was out of his grasp,
so he waited for it to come off the backboard before slamming it
through for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Even Abbio was impressed, despite the forearm in the throat. ``A
wonderful personality,'' he said through a translator. ``He is a
special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof that the only incredible news the Americans can make is to
somehow lose, the crowd cheered wildly for Italy as they held on
for the most of the first half. The Italians came within 35-33 with
less than 3 minutes remaining when Allan Houston, making his
Olympic debut after jamming his right wrist and missing the first
game, connected on two 3-pointers before the half ended.

&HT;     BANKS ROLL OUT WIRELESS SERVICES, BUT CUSTOMERS ARE FEW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Wells Fargo, employees are testing a service
that will allow the bank's customers to review their account
information, transfer balances and receive stock information on
their cellular phones or electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., several thousand clients have begun
using their Palm Pilots and cell phones to get business news, trade
stocks and receive alerts when securities prices hit a
predetermined point.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Fidelity Investments, the first brokerage
company to enter the wireless arena. It is giving away Sprint PCS
phones and five free trades so clients will try its Powerstreet
wireless brokerage service.
</P>
<P>
   Late this month, Bank of America plans to roll out a service
that will allow customers to pay bills, transfer balances and do
full-scale banking transactions from wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing availability of such services, the market
remains small.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the numbers, we wouldn't argue the fact that it
hasn't hit the masses quite yet,'' said Richard Franco, a vice
president of marketing for w-Trade Technologies, a developer of
wireless software for businesses. ``But what we're seeing is that
consumers are looking at it as a way to differentiate industry
leaders from laggards. If I'm choosing a brokerage, I'm going to be
more apt to choose one that is on the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for those who have grasped the alphabet soup of the
technological economy, there is yet another entry in the field:
m-commerce. M for mobile.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to be a leader in this new arena, financial services
companies are using their wireless capabilities as much as a
marketing tool as an effort to satisfy a consumer desire that has,
at this early stage, barely caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, they are betting big that clients and customers
will eventually take to using portable personal technology to
manage their money.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups offer a wide variety of estimates as to how many
people will begin using this technology, some of them fairly rosy.
The Yankee Group estimates 1.26 billion _ about a quarter of the
world's population _ by 2005. Jupiter Communications estimates more
than 100 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates come even though Schwab, with its more than 7
million customers, has only several thousand using its wireless
service this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 4 million people in Europe and 5 million in Asia,
where the technology is considerably more sophisticated, have
adopted such systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for banks and brokerages, the potential is enormous, and
not just in greater commission revenue from more trades. If the
technology infrastructure develops to a point where people can pay
for bus rides, movie tickets and groceries from their personal
technology, these companies will have a chance to insert themselves
directly into the stream of commerce to a degree that they have
never been able to achieve before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our belief that the trading and investing via wireless
devices is just the beginning of what people will eventually do,''
said Bob Sofman, a senior vice president for Schwab's global
wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which the potential of wireless financial services
has touched off competition within the industry cannot be
overstated. On-line brokerages like ETrade and Ameritrade have
viewed it as a cudgel to be used against established brokerages, to
appear more cutting edge than the stodgy old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers, in turn, have viewed it as a way of appearing as hip
as the new on-line competitors. Most of the early users have been
so-called early adopters, those who were the first to begin their
banking and trading over the Internet, as well as so-called active
traders, who routinely buy and sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies will have to overcome the technological
glitches that have gone with the development of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is speed, which at the moment is widely regarded as
no faster than the equivalent of a 14,400-baud modem, about where
the Internet was six to seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of image quality, which can be hard to
read and navigate on the small screens of cell phones and
electronic organizers. Much like a voice call on a cellular
telephone, users say there are spots where there is no service, or
times when networks are too busy to handle a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the matter of security. It is widely acknowledged
that data transferring within the system become unencrypted for a
fraction of a second, raising the potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the availability of wireless service is mostly a
marketing tool at this point, said Edward Kountz, an analyst at
TowerGroup, the only damage could be that the fevered pitch will
lower expectations down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point the hype does outweigh the actual
results,'' he said. ``That's troublesome to me only in that it runs
the risk of getting people's hopes up, and the actual reality will
be less impressive.''

&HT;     SPIRIT RESTORED FOR US SPRITES

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Their spirits were better, routines sharper, scores
much improved, and, in the end, their pride restored.
</P>
<P>
   None of that translated into the magic of a medal for the United
States women's gymnastics team, but they left the SuperDome Tuesday
night with smiles on their faces, a measure of self-satisfaction
salvaged in their fourth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased,'' said head coach Kelli Hill, whose squad fell
flatter that a floor mat in Sunday night's frightful qualifying
round, when they came within a fraction of a point of missing the
finals. ``A medal would have been icing on the cake, but we weren't
upset with the way it finished.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, the Yanks went from Atlanta gold to Aussie fold.
Sensing the disaster at hand, they brought Bela Karolyi into the
process months ago as the master taskmaster/reclamation director.
They clicked their heels, whipped themselves into shape, took their
best shot.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately they landed 1.075 points behind the Chinese for
the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Romania, once the domain and gymnastics dominion of Karolyi,
captured the gold (154.608) for the first time since 1984. Russia
went silver, finishing .205 behind the Romanians. The best
countries in the topsy-turvy tumbling business remain the nations
that keep their young women together in national camps, limit
virtually all outside distractions, and march them out as prized
militias of the mat for international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centralized preparation,'' said Karolyi, noting the perennial
strength of the Russian squad in particular. ``They are eating,
sleeping, everything gymnastics. They do everything together all
year long.''
</P>
<P>
   The US didn't fall off the medal stand, however, simply because
of its laissez-faire form of developing talent and allowing
teenagers to run through malls with pockets fat with allowances and
waistlines bloated by burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the Yanks had the talent and trained well enough four
years ago to win their first team gold medal. They fell from grace
since '96, in large part, because there weren't enough talented
kids to move into slots left vacant by the graduating members of
the Magnificent Seven. The loss of energetic Morgan White, hindered
by stress fractures, got them off on the wrong foot here. And now
with the sport's profile diminished due to lack of success, it
won't be any easier to capture the imagination of 8- and
10-year-olds who aspire to Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks hit 20 routines without a catastrophe, but their
scores sagged badly on both the vault and the balance beam, where
they failed to crack the key 38-point barrier. They collected
37.685 on the vault, almost .400 behind the Chinese, and then
37.699 on the beam, a punishing 1.4 points behind China. The beam
ended up being the plank they walked directly off the medal stand.
Kerplunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a medal to walk away feeling good about
ourselves,'' said Dominique Dawes, one of the returning golden
girls from Atlanta. ``The only different feeling is, with a gold
medal you have that little bit of extra weight around your neck _
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   With gold, of course, comes massive recognition, fame, and a
good deal of financial fortune, as Dawes and her Magnificent Seven
sisters found out after Atlanta. No gold equals no Wheaties box, no
mad dashes from the Today Show to Letterman to leather-cushioned
chairs at the sides of private investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   No gold, no glory. That Olympic equation will never change.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of panning something from the fast-drying river here,
Karolyi and his coaching crew manipulated the order of performance
for the finals and asked only Amy Chow and Elise Ray to compete in
all four events. In short, they spread out the responsibilty,
adding one routine each for Jamie Dantzscher and Tasha
Schwikert-Warren and deleting one each for Kristin Maloney and
Dawes.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi also worked on their psyches and spirit. Flummoxed by
their lack of emotion in the qualifiers, he insisted that they pull
for each other on the sidelines and keep their focus on the
rotation at hand. The fact that they had to be reminded to do those
things should be a signal to USA Gymnastics that its coaches, at
the very least, need a refresher course in Motivation 101.
</P>
<P>
   There was a notable change in how the athletes acted in the
final, and it no doubt translated into points. They came out waving
small American flags and constantly hooted encouragement one
another's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better this time,'' said Karolyi, who again watched from the
press box, his bear hugs kept off limits. ``The attitude I expected
was there from the start _ they started to get confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But they never got the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it in '96,'' said Hill, who is also the personal coach
for Ray and Dawes. ``We are building back up _ we'll do it again.''

&HT;     GOLD FOR MAN FROM MINNESOTA

   SYDNEY _ There was more ``Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oy-oy-oying,''
and there were more raucous celebrations to the sounds of Men At
Work, but at least the Australian swimmers only walked off with
half the available gold at the Sydney International Aquatic Center
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Susie O'Neill bagged gold in the women's 200-meter
freestyle and the Australian men demolished the field in
predictable world record time to win the 4x200 freestyle relay. But
Ukraine's Yana Klochkova (women's 200 individual medley) and
America's Tom Malchow (men's 200 butterfly) made sure the
Australian fans would go home with at least a slight sense of
humility by winning their events.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow is a 24-year-old product of St. Paul, Minn., and the
University of Michigan who has overcome a childhood bout with
Osgood-Schlatter disease, asthma, and what he describes as his own
innate klutziness on land (fortunately) to become the first native
Minnesotan ever to win an individual Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone mentioned that to me tonight after I won,'' he said.
``It feels pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6-inch Malchow set a new Olympic record of 1:55.35 to
won his gold in usual Malchow fashion, which is to say that he
finished the race far better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely a back-half swimmer,'' he explained. ``I
learned patience in the water when I realized being a first-half
swimmer didn't work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Justin Norris was the early pacesetter, but he faded
to third and a bronze when passed by Ukranian Denys Sylant'yev, who
pointed out that, like most of the world's swimmers, he has to
ignore the US-Australia rivalry and concentrate on his own goals.
</P>
<P>
   For pre-race favorite Malchow, a 1996 silver medalist in this
event, it's been a long and often fretful four years, and it nearly
ended badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely very anxious and nervous today,'' he
admitted. ``I sat around all day with one thing on my mind. The
bottom line is that it was just pure pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he can relax and take up his other major pursuit _ ripping
up the road in a Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Klochkova is clearly Queen of the Medleys, now having added the
200 individual crown to the 400 IM gold she won Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have dreamt winning two medals,'' she said
through an interpreter. ``I was counting on one medal, not two.''
</P>
<P>
   The US claimed another medal in this one when Cristina Teuscher
of Columbia University took the bronze. That's right, Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I chose to stay close to home (New Rochelle, N.Y.)
and go to a non-swimming oriented school,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   There was a mountain of national pressure on O'Neill, who
responded to her challenge with an easy victory over Slovakia's
Martina Moravcova and defending champion Claudia Poll of Costa
Rica. She may have some answering to do, however. She set neither a
world nor Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   The 4x200 freestyle relay team had the honor of sending the
crowd of 17,500 home in a festive mood. You've got to like your
chances when the leadoff man is the Thorpedo himself, and young Ian
Thorpe set the proper forces in motion with an opening leg of
1:46.03. Michael Klim widened the margin, Todd Pearson did his
part, and William Kirby brought it home. The winning, and record,
time was 7:07.05, which eclipses Australia's 13-month-old record of
7:08.79.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little daunted when I was told I'd be swimming the
anchor,'' admitted Kirby. As for the time, he said, ``I thought
we'd need a world record in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. The US, a 13-time winner in this event, managed a
silver in the time of 7:12.64 when Klete Keller barely out-touched
the imposing Pieter van den Hoogenband by .06 of a second. But that
won't be the last you'll hear of the man from the Netherlands, who
qualified for Wednesday's 100 freestyle finals by establishing a
new world record of 47.84 in one semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even fathom how fast that is,'' marveled American
qualifier Neil Walker.

&HT;     FASTEST PITCH OF ALL

<P>
   BLACKTOWN _ It all started when she was a little girl in Long
Beach, Calif. Her mom and dad played on a weekend co-ed softball
team, and Lisa Fernandez served as batgirl and third-base coach
when she was only 7.
</P>
<P>
   One day a man said there was a league for her. She went to the
ballpark and he asked her to try pitching. On the mound for the
first time, she started dropping those underhand lobs over the
plate. No, the man said. This is fast pitch.
</P>
<P>
   So she learned fast pitch, that vicious underhand whip that
enables some to sling the ball homeward at big-league speeds just
43 feet from the plate. Her mom would sit on a bucket and catch
little Lisa. Every year, Lisa got a little faster and Mom would add
some equipment . . . shin guards, chest protector, facemask . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally she said, `forget it. Get someone else,' '' remembers
Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 29-year-old Fernandez is the best softball player in the
world. A gold-medal winner in 1996, she pitches against archrival
Australia Thursday. The American women saw their 112-game winning
streak snapped by Japan, 2-1, in 11 innings Tuesday. The team with
the gaudy stats needs its ace more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave no stone unturned when it comes to preparing for this
game,'' Fernandez says. ``The adrenaline will be flowing and it
will be a great game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's 2000 pitching line shreds the achievements of Pedro
Martinez, Sandy Koufax, and Walter Johnson. It's more like
something Old Hoss Radbourn (60-12 with 73 complete games in 73
starts) put together for the Providence Grays in 1884. In the US
team's last 66 games, all victories, Fernandez is 11-0 with an ERA
of 0.00, 172 strikeouts, and only two walks in 74 innings. This
includes five consecutive perfect games and a streak of 122
consecutivebatters retired (100 were strikeouts). One game was all
strikeouts. Twenty one batters. Twenty one whiffs. Now that is a
perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   She gave up only eight hits, all singles, in her 11 starts.
Overall, she has not given up an earned run in four years _ since
Australia's Joanne Brown ripped a walk-off homer to beat her in the
bottom of the 10th inning at Atlanta. Fernandez pitched 9 2/3
perfect innings before absorbing the stunning defeat. America went
on to win the gold, but Fernandez has not forgotten the homer. She
carries it around the way Dennis Eckersley forever lugs the Kirk
Gibson World Series bomb of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an 0-2 pitch, a riseball,'' Fernandez says. ``It was
the same pitch I threw her just before and she made an adjustment.
Nothing will ever get rid of that for me. It doesn't matter if we
beat them 18 times, we still lost that game to them in '96 and I
gave up the home run to do it and I don't think anything will take
away that pain. It kept me awake a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the '96 Olympics, Fernandez got a postcard
with a photo of the disappointing moment. The card was inscribed,
``See you in Japan,'' _ the site of the next US-Australia
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some calls, but I never confirmed who sent it,''
Fernandez says, brown eyes blazing. ``That's a sense of motivation
for me. It was difficult to have that sent to me. It was a stab, a
personal attack. The next time we faced them we beat them and I
pitched a one-hitter. I think I showed up for that game.''
</P>
<P>
   She is more than a pitcher. She plays third base and bats third
when she's not pitching and led the team with a .462 batting
average during the warm-up tour. US coach Ralph Raymond knows who
to call when things get rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom always said, `you hit, you play.' I never wanted to sit
on the bench. There are many aspects to being called the best
player in the world. When I'm not at the plate, I'm at third base.
When I'm not at third base, I'm on the mound. If Ralph says, `we
need this,' I can perform. It's going to be very tough to beat this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Japan broke the wall of invincibility Tuesday. And
Australia has some experience beating the mighty US.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is not accustomed to losing.
</P>
<P>
   Her dad, Antonio, was born in Cuba and was jailed for his
politcal beliefs. He came to America on a boat in 1959, leaving his
mother and brother behind. He never went back, not even when the US
softball team went to Cuba for the Pan Am Games. Her mom, Emilia,
grew up in New York and encouraged Lisa to play games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already knew all the rules by the time I was 4,'' says
Fernandez. ``I knew when to tag up and all that. My mom was a great
role model. She bought me those Superballs and I'd fire them
against the walls and work on my reflexes catching them as they
came back.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes her pitches move so fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mechanics and explosiveness off the mound,'' she says.
``You use your legs.
</P>
<P>
   She is engaged to be married and serves as assistant softball
coach at UCLA where she led the Bruins to a pair of NCAA
championships.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 2000 she is still the best softball player in
the world, the Bambino of the women's game. There are younger women
getting ready to claim the title of ``world's best'' but Fernandez
says, ``I'm not ready to pass the torch.''

   SYDNEY _ You have to know how bad it was in Tianjin a year ago
to understand that fourth place at the Olympics was an achievement
this time. The US women were a bunch of scared bunnies at the last
world gymnastics championships, limping in sixth. They had no
spark, no fight, no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in China and you saw what we looked like there and
you saw what we looked like here . . ., '' federation president Bob
Colarossi was saying, after the Americans had marched out of the
SuperDome with their heads up Tuesday night. ``We were fourth here
and we were totally in the game. We moved the needle on the dial a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   If you only watch the Olympics, slipping from first to fourth is
an embarrassing pratfall. But if you follow US gymnastics from year
to year, sixth to fourth is progress. There was a world of
difference between the seasoned team that took the floor in Atlanta
four years ago and the one that was thrown together for these
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Magnificent Seven (Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes,
Kerri Strug) had won medals in Barcelona and were in the prime of
their careers, and Dominique Moceanu was the best 14-year-old in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a strong generation builded up through the years
with intensity and hard work,'' team coordinator Bela Karolyi said.
``That generation quit after the Olympics. This generation does not
have the backbone, the strong work ethic, that feeling of, `Yes, we
want to repeat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This generation _ the Rays, the Maloneys, the Dantzschers _
never knew anything but sixth place. They had never won a medal,
didn't know what it took to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to Switzerland (for the 1997 worlds), we're sixth,''
Colarossi said. ``We go to China, we're sixth. We were barely
hanging on.''
</P>
<P>
   So Colarossi phoned Karolyi, who had prodded and hugged Nadia
Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton to gold medals, and lured him out of
retirement with a Mission Improbable. Shape up a team in nine
months that won't have prime-time America covering its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was that Karolyi couldn't coach any individual gymnasts
and couldn't be an Olympic coach. Otherwise, the other coaches
never would have signed on, never would have let their gymnasts go
to Karolyi's boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much history there from Games past, too much
professional jealousy, too much paranoia. ``I hired him to coach
the coaches, not the kids,'' Colarossi said. ``It was a leadership
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the gymnasts trained in their home gyms in Maryland and Ohio
and California and elsewhere, then got together monthly like
National Guardsmen for training and team-building at Karolyi's
ranch near Houston. It was the weekend warrior approach to Olympus
and it very nearly worked.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there simply wasn't enough of what was needed _ not
enough talent, not enough healthy bodies, not enough time, not
enough Karolyi. If Miller and Moceanu had made their comebacks
earlier, they probably wouldn't have gone lame this summer. If
Karolyi had been brought on board before Tianjin, the team probably
would have performed better there and had something to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six more months could have made a big difference,'' Karolyi
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if Karolyi had been prowling the floor here in a warmup
suit, glaring and hugging and intimidating and inspiring, the team
certainly wouldn't have been as limp and listless as it looked in
Sunday's qualifying round, when it barely made the six-team cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have said: `Now or never guys, this is the time,' ''
Karolyi said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd sight to see the man sitting in the press box in a
sports jacket, fidgeting while kids in star-spangled leotards
performed on the other side of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sweating blood,'' Karolyi declared.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the Magnificent Seven out there. Not even close.
Dawes and Chow are collegians now and hadn't competed in a global
meet since Atlanta. Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney were coming off
surgery. Jamie Dantzscher is on-tonight-off-tomorrow. Tasha
Schwikert-Warren was an alternate who stepped in when Morgan White
broke her foot.
</P>
<P>
   That was the team that the US put up against the Romanians and
the Chinese and the Russians, who train all year in one place under
one coach. This team had no showcase star like Mary Lou Retton or
Kim Zmeskal or Miller. It had no table-setter (once White was hurt)
to hit a solid opening routine.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Americans moved up two places on the global ladder
and were in medal contention until the next-to-last rotation, when
Ray and Chow wobbled on beam. ``We were wishing and we were
wondering,'' said Ray. But there was no medal this time.
</P>
<P>
   There rarely is for the Americans when they're not on their home
floor. After winning silver in Los Angeles in 1984, they were
fourth in Seoul. But at least they showed they belonged in prime
time. At least they had their rivals checking their scores. That
didn't happen in Tianjin.

 &HT;    Victory propels U.S. soccer team to quarterfinals
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia - About the only unconvincing part of
Landon Donovan's schtick in his Olympic soccer debut Tuesday night
was the new blond dye job.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did before starring for the U.S. in last year's
Under-17 world championships, the California phenom went from a jet
black scalp to a golden-boy look earlier this week, and dared the
Kuwait defense to chase him down, conspicuous as he was.
</P>
<P>
   After coming on in the first half with the sole purpose of
running the Middle Eastern amateurs ragged, Donovan capped a 3-1
victory with an 89th minute breakaway goal that earned the U.S. the
top spot in Group C.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who have advanced out of the group stage for the
first time since it was introduced in 1960, will play in the
quarterfinals in Adelaide on Saturday, most likely against either
Brazil or Japan, which meet tonight in their final pool match.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then a starting call might go to Donovan,
whom U.S. coach Clive Charles controversially left out of the first
two matches. Some believe the 18-year-old attacking midfielder, who
signed with German Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen last year right
out of high school in Redlands, Calif., eventually may be the best
American player ever.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a spot on a team with an experienced roster, most of
it in Major League Soccer, has been an unexpected obstacle for
Donovan. Some U.S. fans, via Internet bulletin boards, and media
have badgered Charles all week about his decision to leave him on
the bench until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed. I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't,''
said Donovan, soon to start his second season with Leverkusen's
reserve team. ``My whole life I've been used to playing and now I'm
coming to this team and I'm not one of the star players.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was a little immature about it, but I just decided
I had to quit being a baby and work hard and wait for my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After Conor Casey, who plays for Charles at the University of
Portland, proved to be too slow-footed for the pace, the 5 foot 8
inch, 148-pound Donovan got the call in the 30th minute and paid
instant dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't need a big target player, we needed small and quick
tonight,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Although goals in either half by Dan Califf and Chris Albright
weren't directly attributable to Donovan, the pressure the U.S.
exerted when he came on was relentless. With a minute remaining in
the game, Donovan jumped on a loose ball, dribbled 30 yards before
dishing off to Josh Wolff on a break, then slammed home the return
service. Because the U.S. and Cameroon ended up even with five
points, that extra goal gave the Americans the leg up on goal
difference by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all expected to get out of our group,'' Donovan said.
``U.S. soccer isn't at a point any more where we're just glad to
get a point. We're here to compete against anyone and think we can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's actively involved in the knockout stage or will
watch from the sideline is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pick someone else's team for me, I have to pick my
team for me,'' Charles said. ``It just depends on who we're
playing.''

 &HT;    Sydney visitors having fun dressing up, showing off

<P>
   SYDNEY - The official ``look'' of these Games may not be a total
splash. But it's safe to say the beach is back.
</P>
<P>
   As you've probably noticed on TV and in print, this city is
awash in a sea of purple-blue and turquoise that's very visible.
The Sydney 2000 design team has put its wavy stamp on everything
from sports venues and staff uniforms to the paper coffee cups and
quilt comforters used in the athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
   From Bondi Beach to Darling Harbor to Homebush Bay, Sydney style
is nautical and nice.
</P>
<P>
   Every Olympic city has an official design vocabulary that speaks
to the moment. Barcelona had Javier Mariscal's Cobi mascot, the
Mediterranean sun and the primary reds, yellows and blues of
Picasso, Miro and Dali. Atlanta had quilts and leaves to remind us
of Greek laurels and Southern shade trees. Sydney has substituted
the arbor for a harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think that Sydney is taking an irreverent look at
the Olympic rings,'' says Jonathan Nolan, image manager for the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would happen if a volleyball-playing Poseidon
spiked a ball into an ocean of paint pots and unleashed a seismic
wave of color. Vivid blues and greens. Hot pink. Chartreuse. Orange
sherbet. Kool-Aid red and blue. The iconic Olympic rings _ red,
yellow, blue, green and black _ have been bleached by the sun,
softened by the surf and hung out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney style is relaxed and carefree, a blend of Miami and Los
Angeles, Arquitectonica and Frank Gehry and the exuberant art of
David Hockney, Raoul Duffy and Sydney's own Ken Done. It's bronze
bodies, boogie-boarding and ``clubbies,'' as the lifeguard look-out
stations are called.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinct Sydney style that involves revealing as
much flesh as possible but in a not too trashy way,'' says Sydney
Morning Herald fashion critic Maggie Alderson. ``Generally, it's
about having a great body and showing as much of it as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly a lot of that going around.
</P>
<P>
   But the fashion cognoscenti here say that the official Games
look is hardly indicative of the sophisticated caliber of
Australian art and design. Alderson bemoans the fact that trendy,
sport-loving Aussie designer Marc Newson was left out of the
process and wishes that Ric Birch had been in charge of style
matters. Birch's Opening Ceremony has been declared a triumph of
style _ a witty and urbane look at a complex, self-doubting
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-strong Sydney Olympic work force is wearing a uniform
inspired by the ripple pattern of the Pacific. It's an extremely
casual look _ khaki pants and a golf shirt splashed front and back
with what Nolan calls the ``fluid energy graphic.'' Instead of the
leafy motif that decorated the Atlanta volunteers' shirt, it's a
wavy gravy of blue, green, lime, purple and pink.
</P>
<P>
   In moderation, the motif looks good. The next time you see a
medal ceremony on television, check out the blue ribbons around the
athletes' necks.
</P>
<P>
   But the staff uniform? Let's just say it won't win any fashion
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the volunteer uniforms are absolutely repulsive, and
so does everyone else,'' Alderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the most interesting style statements here are the
fans' outfits. Everybody's wearing a flag, a hat, garish makeup or
painted hair. If you know those fashion spreads in the Sunday New
York Times, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting outside the Acquatic Center the other day were a
suburban couple and son done up in green and yellow, the
Irish-inflected colors that seem to winning out here over the red,
white and blue of the royal-looking Australian flag. It's the same
color scheme you'll see in the Australian team's uniforms and on
the boxing-kangaroo design shirts for sell at the official
merchandise store.
</P>
<P>
   On George Street downtown, an American athlete's mother had
``Soccer Mom No. 9'' appliqueed on her denim tote-bag. Go, U.S.A.
Then there were the shirtless British guys draped in the Union
Jack, pointed plastic police helmets and bow ties. Rule Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Barcelona's Games were played out against a backdrop of
Art Nouveau apartment buildings, Gaudi's massive La Sagrada Familia
and the city's refurbished harbor, here it's the opera house sails,
the nautical architecture and naughty outfits that are grabbing all
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   No one dresses fancy here, but people are having fun dressing
up. Sydney style is very much in the swim.

 &HT;    Sydney pulling off one of the smoothest Olympic Games
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    and Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - How could Atlanta get it so wrong and Sydney get it so
right?
</P>
<P>
   As Australia pulls off an Olympic feat that ranks among the
smoothest in modern memory, that's the question everyone here is
asking.
</P>
<P>
   From the beauty of the city to the convenient location of
venues, just about everything about these Games is being praised.
Much of the chaos and commercialism of Atlanta is missing. Even the
weather has been picture-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has visiting fans and media simply gushing over the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make it official. Sydney is now the Olympics' permanent
home,'' writes Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly on
cnnsi.com. ``This is the single most beautiful city in the world.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``And the way it works! Great, gleaming silver trains come every
two minutes to whisk you to great, gleaming new train stations,
where great, gleaming Sydney volunteers practically pick you up and
fireman's carry you to great, gleaming stadiums, each one cooler
than the last.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to give Atlanta an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the day has come for Atlanta to stop second-guessing
itself and reach closure by looking at Sydney's tremendous
political and financial advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic organizers knew who was responsible for the Games
from the very beginning: the state government of New South Wales.
Here the government built the venues, dealt with transportation and
infrastructure issues, and had the authority to add more money or
employees, as needed.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Atlanta had competing private and public entities
that often had different agendas and sometimes worked at
cross-purposes.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, New South Wales was responsible for putting up the
lion's share of the money to stage the Games _ an estimated $1.5
billion. In Atlanta, organizers were consumed every day with
raising the bulk of the money from private sources. Many government
leaders were opposed to spending a dime on Olympics chief Billy
Payne's $1.7 billion Games, despite the economic windfall they
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Such has not been the case in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, when the city's Olympic committee found itself
$140 million in the red, the state government bailed it out. And
when bus delays and driver shortages threatened to slow Sydney's
lift-off last week, the government quickly added some 300 buses and
military drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Billy didn't have. Billy couldn't do that,'' said
Ed Hula, an Atlanta-based Olympic journalist considered an
authority on the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need strong government involvement to put on a successful
Games,'' said Sydney 2000 spokesman Brett Gale.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's various governments provided relatively little in
the way of money and sometimes showed poor judgment. For example,
Mayor Bill Campbell's street vending contracts almost turned the
city into an out-of-control carnival, which provoked the scorn of
Olympic officials and foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Atlanta had what the Greeks call hubris, excessive pride
that often leads to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Games organizers continuously boasted that 1996 would be the
best Olympics ever. However, there were transportation delays,
computer glitches and, worst of all, a bombing in Centennial Park
that killed two.
</P>
<P>
   But Sydney has been more cautious about raising expectations.
Even as the international press heaped praise upon the city this
week, Games officials warned that they aren't off the hook yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get too carried away too soon,'' Paul Willoughby,
spokesman for Sydney 2000's transportation agency, said. ``This is
only Day Four, and we have not begun to experience remotely what it
will be like from Friday on. It's simply too early to say we've
done it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic this weekend at Olympic Park is expected to
reach 300,000, or twice what it's been so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a bigger country and a bit more confident in its
judgment than a place like this,'' said Matthew Moore, a Sydney
Morning Herald editor who has covered the Olympics for four years.
``This is a little country on the edge of the earth. It takes the
Olympics very seriously. No government in this country could afford
being ridiculed on the international stage. ... If (Juan Antonio)
Samaranch had ever come to this town and said what he said in
Athens, it would have been a big enough issue to threaten the
government,'' said Moore, referring to the IOC president's recent
stinging rebuke of Greece's 2004 organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's preparation, and its Games demeanor, have been
exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so blown away by the advanced state of their physical
preparation here, which has allowed them to have the foundation to
deal with other crises,'' Hula said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of its events are being played at Olympic Park, which
is expansive and accessible. The government of New South Wales
built the park and the $70 million rail station that anchors it.
Sports fans can catch several events in a day, and non-sports fans
can venture to other neighborhoods of this far-flung city for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney also had the luxury of having more preparation time than
Atlanta _ a full seven years vs. slightly less than six years. And
because Atlanta and Sydney share the same language, which has not
happened among Summer Olympic cities since 1908, organizers here
were able to send a large delegation to Atlanta and hire departing
Olympic employees. With its difficult language, Greece will not
have an easy transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has also enjoyed a strong economy, which helped fuel
government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had seven years of economic growth,'' Moore said. ``We
have missed the Asian recession, which means for the New South
Wales government that the revenue stream has been uninterrupted. If
we had had an economic downturn, as predicted, it would have been
so much harder spending $120 million on a Super Dome.'' What, then,
is the lesson to be learned from these comparisons?
</P>
<P>
   If the United States ever stages another Summer Olympics, there
will almost certainly have to be a public-private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than six or seven years to start up a $2 billion
corporation especially one as politically sensitive and
organizationally complex as the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Moore: ``Having a government run things makes it very, very
easy.''

   SYDNEY - Stopped at the gate to the Olympic Village because his
accreditation didn't pass the scanner, Ian Thorpe proved his
identity by showing security guards the next best thing: his two
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a worker had created false identity passes in the
names of Thorpe and other Australians including runner Cathy
Freeman, swimmer Susie O'Neill and tennis players Pat Rafter and
Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   The star athletes found the bar codes on their passes wouldn't
scan because other passes had been created with the same bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympic Committee made a point of stressing that no
one had gained unauthorized access with the passes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time Al Gore ran for president, he
earnestly explained the science of global warming and its potential
for worldwide catastrophe. Air pollution was more than a nuisance,
Gore said. It threatened the survival of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The message was novel and stark. But it failed to move voters in
the campaign of 1988, and Gore learned a hard lesson: People care
about the environment, but they care more about family, health and
job. Gore's candidacy folded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, Gore is the Democrats' nominee, and the
environment again is his signature issue. He has a second chance to
energize voters on a set of questions that has both fascinated and
horrified him since his college days at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   This time, talk of environmental apocalypse is gone. With the
presidency likely to be decided in a few battleground states, Gore
is fending off his Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
with a centrist appeal to voters' self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in traffic? Withering in triple-digit heat? Wondering how
your child developed asthma? Each is an environmental issue in the
Gore campaign of 2000. ``The traditional spelling out of
environmental matters per se is becoming less relevant,'' says Jim
Florio, a former New Jersey governor who advises Gore. ``The
reality is that environmental considerations flow through every
facet of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush hopes to make inroads by drawing attention to the shift
in strategy. Gore's message in 1988 struck some voters as extreme,
and Republicans aim to raise doubts about Gore's judgment by
resurrecting the rhetoric of campaigns past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has the opportunity to occupy the center,'' says Ed
Gillespie, a Republican consultant. ``A centrist approach, a
common-sense approach to conservation and environmental protection
will resonate strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Potentially more troublesome for Gore is the candidacy of
consumer activist Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, who is
challenging Gore's commitment to the environment and threatening to
spoil his chances.
</P>
<P>
   It's still true that environment is the No. 1 issue for only a
narrow slice of the electorate. But if Nader can siphon those
voters from Gore's base, he could push such toss-up states as
Oregon and Wisconsin into Bush's column and alter the outcome of
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is entitled to votes,'' Nader says. ``They have to earn
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one point on which Gore and Bush agree: A healthy
environment doesn't have to come at the cost of a healthy economy.
But from there, the major party candidates follow decidedly
different philosophical paths.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to persuade voters that the U.S. economy's dependence
on fossil fuels is a long-term threat to prosperity, as well as the
environment, and that curbing demand will deliver bonuses of
cleaner air, better health and more livable cities.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional Democratic fashion, Gore hopes to nudge the
economy in a new direction through government incentives. The
centerpiece of Gore's environmental campaign is a $125 billion,
10-year plan that includes tax breaks for consumers who buy more
efficient homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been criticized as a collection of ideas recycled
from the energy-crisis days of the 1970s. But Florio says voters
today are more receptive to the message because they are better
educated about the growing threat of greenhouse gas emissions and
the link to social and health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is ripe for the leadership that Al Gore can provide
by going out and explaining things to people,'' says Florio, who
served with Gore in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, says he is more inclined to let
consumer demand drive gains in energy efficiency and development of
new technologies. His proposals on the environment have come
piecemeal and deal mostly with land conservation.
</P>
<P>
   They also are far less costly. Bush's most expensive proposal is
to spend $4.9 billion over five years working down the backlog of
maintenance and protection projects of the National Park Service.
Bush also would boost the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund
to $900 million and create incentives for development of abandoned
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would apply Republican values to environmental protection
by giving state and local governments greater authority. Those that
set targets for reducing pollution and saving endangered species
could win waivers from federal bureaucratic requirements.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same approach that let states such as Wisconsin and
other states pioneer welfare reform, says Chris DeMuth, president
of the American Enterprise Institute and Bush's top environmental
adviser. ``We want to encourage a lot of experimentation,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Environment hasn't been a strong suit for a Republican president
since Nixon, who signed landmark laws such as the Clean Water Act
and supervised creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But some party members say they are upset that Bush has done
little more than take isolated potshots at Gore on local issues.
Bush has failed to offer a comprehensive policy for the nation,
they say, and his record as governor leaves him open to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has severe pollution problems,'' says Jim Scarantino,
executive director of Republicans for Environmental Protection.
``His campaign should be putting out specific rebuttals or propose
that on a national level he'll do a lot better than he did in
Texas. So far we've seen none.''
</P>
<P>
   Global warming, in particular, is a problem that demands strong
leadership from the president, Scarantino says. But Bush has done
little more than acknowledge that the phenomenon is real.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes that a link between human activity and global
warming has yet to be proved, DeMuth says. More research is needed
before considering treaties such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which
Bush believes would be costly and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict the Bush administration approach to global warming
would be accelerated research,'' DeMuth says. ``I think we have the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, global warming is nothing less than a call to arms,
and his view was shaped long before his first run for office. In
his 1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore traces his interest
to the mid-1960s and a science class he took as an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's professor, Roger Revelle, told students about his study
of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. His results showed that
levels surged higher each year, a result of civilization's
increasing reliance on the combustion of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Some carbon dioxide was good, Revelle explained. It helped trap
the sun's energy and made the earth habitable. But if the level
continued its steady increase, he warned, the planet would warm
beyond historic levels, disrupting the balance that made life
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Revelle's lecture haunted young Gore. And it led to a political
epiphany: Pollution, Gore realized, would elude local solutions, no
matter how well intentioned. It was a global threat as treacherous
as nuclear war, and mankind ultimately would have to respond on the
same scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act boldly, decisively, comprehensively and quickly,''
Gore wrote in his book. ``Those who continue to argue that the
appropriate response is merely additional research are simply
seeking to camouflage timidity or protect their vested interest in
the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gore's book offered hope for a resolution to the
``global environmental crisis'' through science, faith and
international cooperation. But along the way, Gore pondered the
specter of an environmental apocalypse that threatens human
existence. He used dramatic comparisons such as nuclear
annihilation to illustrate the threat that humanity faces.
</P>
<P>
   That dark vision gives Bush an opportunity to sway undecided
voters, Republican strategists say. The unseen threat that Gore
describes and the ideas that he champions _ doing away with the
internal combustion engine, for one _ strike some voters as
radical.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do view Gore positively, I believe, as an
environmental-friendly candidate,'' says Chris Ingram, a Republican
pollster who has tested environmental issues. ``But the more people
know about Gore's proposals on the environment, the less likely
they are to support them. He's a little extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has pursued this line of attack. In a recent
meeting with reporters in Austin, Bush cast doubt on Gore's hope
that gasoline-fired engines will someday be replaced by
emission-free power sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of abolishing the internal combustion engine, I don't
know what he means by that,'' Bush told the group in August. ``I
don't think anybody knows what he means by that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush must be careful not to take the low road, backers say.
Rather than deride Gore as ``Ozone Man,'' as his father did in
1988, Bush will hone in on regional issues, offering specific,
``common-sense'' solutions to distinguish himself from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, for example, where salmon are an endangered
species, Bush says he would pursue technological improvements to
federal dams to help fish swim past. In Bush's view, it is a more
responsible approach than removing the electricity-producing dams,
an option the Clinton administration has studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think talking about the positives and having a common-sense
approach is going to work for Republicans,'' says Ingram, senior
vice president of Luntz Research Co., which conducts voter surveys
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gore also faces a challenge for the votes of core
environmentalists. Many hailed publication of his book and his
election as vice president as signs of their political ascendancy.
But since then, they have been frustrated by what they regard as
the Clinton administration's record of compromise or inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the iconoclastic consumer advocate, hopes to feed on
their emotion. He has championed many of the causes Gore praised in
his book, and he is trying to position himself as the only credible
choice for environmental voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Nader says, is incapable of the bold leadership he calls
for in his book because like Clinton before him, he relies on a
party system that is beholden to corporate contributions. ``I think
he's a political coward,'' Nader adds.
</P>
<P>
   Nader draws his deepest support in West Coast states that Gore
must win, particularly Oregon and Washington. He also is popular in
Midwest states such as Wisconsin that have strong progressive
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To understand the frustration many environmentalists feel toward
the Clinton administration, consider the story of one Gore devotee,
Marcia Hanscom of Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hanscom says Gore's book changed the course of her life. After
reading it, she decided to work full time for environmental causes.
She got to meet Gore at a local fund-raiser last year, and she was
re-invigorated by his talk about wetland restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Hanscom saw Gore again in August when he came to Los Angeles for
the Democratic National Convention. But having seen no progress on
wetlands, she greeted him this time from a distance _ across the
street on the other side of a protest line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't see Gore coming out strong on the environment and
doing something more proactive, even before he is elected,''
Hanscom says, ``I may change my vote to Ralph Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made amends with most major environmental groups. Now,
they actively support him, and they hope that Nader's presence will
raise awareness of environmental issues among the general
electorate that translates into a Gore victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that Nader is out there raising environmental
issues, that's great,'' says Dan Weiss, political director of the
Sierra Club. ``Whatever the differences between Nader and Gore on
environmental issues, they pale in comparison between Gore and
Bush.''

&HT;     THE MAN BEHIND THE VAUNTED NEW YORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker magazine, scoffed at the
notion that, according to one writer's literary calculus, he is the
most powerful man on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and I stop bullets with my teeth,'' joked the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author of ``Lenin's Tomb'' and a follow-up book on
the former Soviet Union, as well as a highly praised portrait of
Muhammad Ali, ``King of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   If not the most powerful literary man on Earth, Remnick may be
the hardest-working man of letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only 30 hours in a day,'' Remnick allowed, ``if
you're lucky enough to change time zones.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it's not plenty daunting that, at 41, he's steering the
famously secretive ship of cartoons, ego and literary genius _ just
the fifth editor since 1925 and heir to the throne once occupied by
the likes of the visionary Harold Ross, the oddly brilliant William
Shawn and the celebrity-fixated Tina Brown _ Remnick also manages
to write smart magazine profiles in between serious books,
sandwiched around occasional teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention he changes diapers, too?
</P>
<P>
   Remnick has a 1-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 10 and 7.
They live in Manhattan and dad is one-half of a power couple. Mom
is Esther B. Fein, a reporter for The New York Times, who is
currently on maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick is content with, by his reckoning, being a pretty boring
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is work and spend time with my family. I don't go out
if I can help it, unless it's to a movie with my wife. If there's
any spare time in that equation, I try to do a little writing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no hobbies. I don't play golf. I'm not a great stamp
collector. I write and I edit and hope that I'm not the worst
father in the world,'' Remnick said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as coaching his boys in soccer or Little League goes, ``I
wouldn't torture my kids by being their coach,'' he said. ``Plus, I
have enough coaching to do at the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, who seems to wear a perpetual smirk in photographs,
leavens a quicksilver intellect with self-deprecating humor in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted New Yorker is an institution as mysterious as the
Vatican and certainly the most deconstructed magazine in American
history. It is the subject of its own genre of books and
score-settling memoirs from ex-staffers _ including a fistful
recently released to coincide with this year's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   It's been two years since Remnick was named to succeed Brown,
who left to launch Talk magazine amid a hail of unusually
vituperative criticism _ ``shrieking British harpy'' in a Salon.com
piece being one of the kinder pejoratives.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts of the many media pundits who seem to make a
career out of tracking Remnick's every editorial hiccup as
assiduously as Kremlinologists, his watch has been marked by a
steady and assured, albeit traditional, leadership that chooses
substance over style in the magazine's content. The subtext is that
The New Yorker under Remnick can at times be boring; he's more
about issues than personality.
</P>
<P>
   This line of questioning got his attention and he shushed the
lackeys in his New York City office. ``It's up to you to judge for
yourself after reading the magazine,'' Remnick said. ``The last
thing I'd want to tell you is that I've figured it out as if it was
a puzzle. I do feel more comfortable doing this job on a day-to-day
basis after two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He never applied to be editor and had no experience on the other
side of the writing equation. It was just the latest example of
what Remnick describes as the convergence of dumb luck and uncanny
timing that carried a dentist's son from Hillsdale, N.J., to
Princeton University to Washington Post intern to sportswriter on
that paper in 1982 to the Post's Moscow bureau in the pivotal late
1980s to The New Yorker (recruited by Brown) as a staff writer in
1992 _ where his mentors (John Updike, Joan Didion, John McPhee and
others) are now among the stable of talent he calls upon.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Remnick's assignment so challenging, in addition to
healing the wounds of the Brown era, is the fact that he's all the
while wrestling with the chimera that is The New Yorker of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's past is smothered in nostalgia, from the iconic
cover of knickerbocker dandy Eustace Tilley with top hat and
monocle to the initialed halcyon days of A.J. Liebling and E.B.
White, the electric wit of James Thurber and Robert Benchley, the
enduring reportage of John Hersey and Joan Didion, the storytelling
of Joseph Mitchell and John Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers measure their tenure as subscribers in decades,
not years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reflections on the magazine's past are very real
and some of them are how we think of our childhoods. The snow was
always deeper, the sun brighter, the air fresher,'' Remnick said.
</P>
<P>
   During a Writers' Institute panel discussion last fall on
magazine writing, which included staff writers Lawrence Weschler
and Susan Orlean from The New Yorker, the authors bemoaned the
shorter attention spans of readers and the attendant shrinkage of
allowable length for their magazine pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, Remnick said, or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still publish pieces that are 15,000 words and sometimes
even 20,000 words,'' he said. ``We don't publish books. A lot of
the old New Yorker writers' discussion of lengths in the past had
to do with three, four or five-part series. Which were books
chopped up like a sliced salami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a lot of books and I want more than anything to see a
flourishing literary culture, but I don't think that publishing
books in the magazine is the greatest use of our time or space,''
Remnick said. ``Magazine space is expensive. We're not printed on
newsprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the recent vogue of allowing profanities to creep
into print in the magazine, and his own reputation for cussing
aplenty, Remnick didn't miss his opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) if I know,'' he said. ``Let's see you print
that.''

OLYMPIC NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Recent workouts have indicated that Michael
Johnson is fit enough to break his own world record in the 400
meters on Monday at the Sydney Games, the sprinter and his coach
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and cool temperatures, along with the physical drain of
running four rounds in four days could ultimately affect his speed.
But Johnson has run faster workouts than he did last August before
he set the world record of 43.18 seconds at the 1999 world track
and field championships in Seville, Spain, said his coach, Clyde
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Before Seville, Johnson ran a pair of 350-meter repeats, with
four minutes of rest, in 43.2 seconds and 42.80 seconds, Hart said.
Two days ago, Johnson did the repeats in 42.2 and 42.4, the coach
said. The sprinter has said that he believes he is capable of
running under 43 seconds, and desires to put his 400 record into
the same rarefied position as his remarkable time of 19.32 seconds
at 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have my 400 world record equal to my 200 world
record, so far out there that it's hard to understand,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has recovered from the hamstring cramp that forced him to
pull up in the 200 at the Olympic trials in July, Johnson said. His
main concern is being vigilant about a chronically sore left
Achilles' tendon. But the recent workouts gave him confidence that
his record could fall under the right conditions, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it had to help him feel like he's prepared to run
well,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his main concern was to win. And, barring injury,
that seems a certainty. He has lost only 3 of 81 quarter-mile races
in the past 11 years. No man has ever repeated as Olympic champion
in the quarter-mile. Marie-Jose Perec of France has won the women's
quarter-mile at the past two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's very important to the end of my
career,'' Johnson said of repeating. ``I've always been motivated
by making history.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 400 record is to fall here, Hart said, it would have to
come in the final 100 meters. He wants Johnson to run the first 200
in about 20.8 seconds and to come through 300 in about 31.5. The
goal is for Johnson to run the final 100 in 11.2 seconds, which
would put him well under 43 seconds.
</P>

<P>
   Armstrong to Race After Injury
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong said Tuesday that he was largely recovered from
a cracked neck vertebra he sustained when he was hit by a car three
weeks ago while cycling in Nice, France, and would race next week
in the &QC; 148.4-mile Olympic road race and 29-mile individual time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neck is still a slight problem,'' he said. ``It's a little
stiff, but it's 90 percent, which is enough.'' He added: ``It's not
a risky fracture. I'm not at risk by riding with it.'' He said the
injury would affect his preparation for the road race more than for
the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reassured by his victory last Saturday at the
Grand Prix of Nations. ``I did a 70-kilometer time trial at 50k per
hour,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone in cycling can do that.''
Still, he admitted, ``The scary part is trying to avoid another
neck injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is a third-time Olympian, but did not fare especially
well in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Games. Now, after winning the Tour
de France in 1999 and 2000 and overcoming testicular cancer, he is
expected to win _ cracked vertebra or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barcelona feels like a really long time ago,'' he said. ``I
didn't have a lot of experience in the Olympics or in cycling then.
In Atlanta, I was very sick, but I didn't know it. To come back
here is special. It feels better this time. I didn't feel at home
in Barcelona or Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   His status on the Olympic cycling team is such that during a
news conference Tuesday, no questions were asked of his four
teammates for 45 minutes. When one was asked, it was to inquire
about what it is like when the news media ask questions of no one
but Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was irked by questions about the International Olympic
Committee's testing to detect the banned performance-boosting drug
EPO. While pleased that negative test results will validate
cyclists' results, he said: ``Cycling has been criminalized and
singled out in this issue. It exists in all sports, not just in
cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm tired of having to defend the sport. I don't
think the problem is as widespread as it was believed to have been.
In the end, we will prove to be one of the cleanest sports because
of what we've done. Cycling has done more than any sport to combat
drugs. I truly believe that.''

 &HT;    Australian wines offer a world-class taste
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you worked up a powerful thirst watching all that physical
activity from the Summer Olympics in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a particularly appropriate Australian wine would quench
it.
</P>
<P>
   You won't have to look far. Australia has elbowed its way onto
the world wine scene (and on local wine shelves) with all the
brashness of Crocodile Dundee. The former British penal colony
already produces the United States' most-imported label:
Lindeman's. Shiraz _ Australian syrah _ has become such a popular
red wine that a handful of American wineries have started to label
their syrah-based wines ``shiraz.'' Even Great Britain imports more
wine from Australia than it does from France _sacre bleu!
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, Consumer Reports rated an Australian wine _
the 1998 Lindeman's Bin 45 Cabernet Sauvignon _ its top-rated
modestly priced red and designated it a ``Best Buy.'' The wine
trade already was gushing about the 1998 vintage in Australia, and
the CR rating will only add to the chorus. Fortunately, there still
are plenty of '98 reds _ shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot,
grenache and assorted blends _ on local shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is perfect: Just as the Olympics focuses world
attention on all things Aussie, the continent's wine industry is on
a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The grape growers from Down Under carved their niche with
relatively inexpensive wines made in a crowd-pleasing style, with
good depth and concentration, and lots of fruit and oak. Wine geeks
might complain the wines lack complexity and are a bit over the
top, but hey, it's Australia, mate. Grab a glass and fill 'er up.
</P>
<P>
   For a lip-smacking glass of white, seek out the Lindeman's Bin
65 Chardonnay ($8.79), the Jacob's Creek Chardonnay ($8) or the
Penfolds Semillon-Chardonnay ($8.79). Red-wine fanciers can stain
their teeth with any of the Lindeman's ``Bin'' series, the Bin 40
merlot, the Bin 50 Shiraz or the decorated Bin 45 Cabernet, all
$8.79. Or search out the Wyndham Estate Bin 555 Shiraz ($9.99) or
Deakin Estate Shiraz ($12-$13).
</P>
<P>
   Then grab a corkscrew and scurry back to the easy chair. There's
a gold medal to be won.

 &HT;    Physicians find themselves specializing in chocolate
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - The business card for Vaccari handmade chocolates
lists a phone number for Lori Sansone.
</P>
<P>
   What the card doesn't say is Dr. Lori Sansone.
</P>
<P>
   And it should read doctors, for both Lori and her husband Randy
Sansone are Dayton-area doctors as well as the artisans who make
the Vaccari chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Busy doctors making chocolates?
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it for the joy of it,'' she says. ``It's satisfying to
create something you enjoy and have others enjoy it, too. There's
more immediate gratification than in medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a Dayton native and a family practitioner at Sugarcreek
Family Medicine in Bellbrook. He is a psychiatrist who practices at
Sycamore Primary Care and also is a professor at Wright State
University Medical School, teaching psychiatry and internal
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   And while other doctors may fill their spare time playing a
stereotypical game of golf, this Centerville couple uses off-duty
nights and weekends to make and sell chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   It is an avocation that matches their differing temperaments.
She is precise by nature, ideal for the detailed work of making
chocolates. He is the creative one, she says, and the one who
launched the venture.
</P>
<P>
   One day, for no particular reason, he brought home a chocolate
temperer, a device he'd seen advertised in food magazines. It's a
necessary piece of equipment for heating chocolate to the precise
temperature where it will set with a perfectly shiny surface. It
was a small temperer, almost a toy, and they have since graduated
to a larger one designed for more serious production of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he says, he told his wife that ``this will enhance
our ability to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started making chocolates and eating chocolates and giving
them away,'' she says. They researched the subject, taking
inspiration from Ben &AMP; Jerry's, the Vermont ice cream makers who
started out in a garage after taking a correspondence course in
making ice cream. The doctors read about chocolates and talked to
professionals who make them.
</P>
<P>
   They experimented, blending various chocolates. They had the
most trouble developing their own milk chocolate blend, since
neither of them likes milk chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I made five different batches and we blind-tasted
them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable happened. They started to sell their chocolates,
first doing corporate work, selling the chocolates to drug
representatives, who in turn give them to doctors. In February they
broke into retail sales, first at Cindy's Wine Shop in Bellbrook
and then at Arrow Wine in Oakwood, under the name Vaccari
Chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   They appropriated the name from Randy Sansone's Italian
grandmother, but he admits that she never made chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can remember about her was she was always in the kitchen
cooking,'' he says, explaining the literary license.
</P>
<P>
   At Arrow Wine, food buyer Dee Reith says the individually packed
$1.50 nibblers such as dark chocolate with cashews and
chocolate-covered homemade biscotti have been good sellers. Those
are designed as personal rewards, an alternative to the mindset
that chocolates are for gifts for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting the hang of retail,'' Lori Sansone says.
``They didn't teach us that in med school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sansones' goal is to expand the corporate work, while
limiting retail sales to specialty stores. They have found the
corporate work, using decorative molds to customize the chocolates
for party trays, is more creative. Recently they delivered
chocolate steamships to a travel company going to a trade show.
They offer seasonal chocolates shaped like footballs and helmets.
And they've developed a heart-shaped chocolate with marzipan for
Valentine's Day or wedding favors.
</P>
<P>
   But a major asset of corporate work is that the product, made to
order in leased space in Bellbrook, is at its freshest. And
freshness is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the visibility of the retail market, '' Randy Sansone
says, ``but I worry about the chocolates sitting too long. We want
to make it fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife adds that she's stopped making one of their
specialties, a caramel crunch, for retail sale, because it has a
limited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The line includes Belgian white and milk chocolates as well as
dark chocolate in Vaccari custom mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European taste is more bittersweet than our taste in dark
chocolate,'' she said, explaining the use of sweeter American
chocolate for the dark chocolate blend.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaccari chocolates are not only different in their blend but
in the ratio of filling to chocolate shell.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Sansone, who says she now makes 85 percent of the
chocolates, meticulously paints each mold with the melted
chocolate, building up a thicker shell than is traditional because
the doctors want to emphasize the chocolate, not the filling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of magic. You pour the molds and they come out
perfectly,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But it is detailed and time-consuming work, and on her worst day
she spent seven hours making and packaging 150 individual candies.
Her highest production to date is 300 candies in one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some weeks we're doing it every night and weekends,'' he says.
Some mornings they get up and pack chocolates before they go to
their ``day jobs.'' Together, they make the delivery rounds to
retail stores on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   They expect the two-person venture to grow, but they're not sure
how.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, they say, it's something they'll retire to.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Recent workouts have indicated that Michael
Johnson is fit enough to break his own world record in the 400
meters on Monday at the Sydney Games, the sprinter and his coach
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and cool temperatures, along with the physical drain of
running four rounds in four days could ultimately affect his speed.
But Johnson has run faster workouts than he did last August before
he set the world record of 43.18 seconds at the 1999 world track
and field championships in Seville, Spain, said his coach, Clyde
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Before Seville, Johnson ran a pair of 350-meter repeats, with
four minutes of rest, in 43.2 seconds and 42.80 seconds, Hart said.
Two days ago, Johnson did the repeats in 42.2 and 42.4, the coach
said. The sprinter has said that he believes he is capable of
running under 43 seconds, and desires to put his 400 record into
the same rarefied position as his remarkable time of 19.32 seconds
at 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have my 400 world record equal to my 200 world
record, so far out there that it's hard to understand,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has recovered from the hamstring cramp that forced him to
pull up in the 200 at the Olympic trials in July, Johnson said. His
main concern is being vigilant about a chronically sore left
Achilles' tendon. But the recent workouts gave him confidence that
his record could fall under the right conditions, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it had to help him feel like he's prepared to run
well,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his main concern was to win. And, barring injury,
that seems a certainty. He has lost only 3 of 81 quarter-mile races
in the past 11 years. No man has ever repeated as Olympic champion
in the quarter-mile. Marie-Jose Perec of France has won the women's
quarter-mile at the past two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's very important to the end of my
career,'' Johnson said of repeating. ``I've always been motivated
by making history.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 400 record is to fall here, Hart said, it would have to
come in the final 100 meters. He wants Johnson to run the first 200
in about 20.8 seconds and to come through 300 in about 31.5. The
goal is for Johnson to run the final 100 in 11.2 seconds, which
would put him well under 43 seconds.

   Armstrong to Race After Injury
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong said Tuesday that he was largely recovered from
a cracked neck vertebra he sustained when he was hit by a car three
weeks ago while cycling in Nice, France, and would race next week
in the &QC; 148.4-mile Olympic road race and 29-mile individual time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neck is still a slight problem,'' he said. ``It's a little
stiff, but it's 90 percent, which is enough.'' He added: ``It's not
a risky fracture. I'm not at risk by riding with it.'' He said the
injury would affect his preparation for the road race more than for
the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reassured by his victory last Saturday at the
Grand Prix of Nations. ``I did a 70-kilometer time trial at 50k per
hour,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone in cycling can do that.''
Still, he admitted, ``The scary part is trying to avoid another
neck injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is a third-time Olympian, but did not fare especially
well in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Games. Now, after winning the Tour
de France in 1999 and 2000 and overcoming testicular cancer, he is
expected to win _ cracked vertebra or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barcelona feels like a really long time ago,'' he said. ``I
didn't have a lot of experience in the Olympics or in cycling then.
In Atlanta, I was very sick, but I didn't know it. To come back
here is special. It feels better this time. I didn't feel at home
in Barcelona or Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   His status on the Olympic cycling team is such that during a
news conference Tuesday, no questions were asked of his four
teammates for 45 minutes. When one was asked, it was to inquire
about what it is like when the news media ask questions of no one
but Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was irked by questions about the International Olympic
Committee's testing to detect the banned performance-boosting drug
EPO. While pleased that negative test results will validate
cyclists' results, he said: ``Cycling has been criminalized and
singled out in this issue. It exists in all sports, not just in
cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm tired of having to defend the sport. I don't
think the problem is as widespread as it was believed to have been.
In the end, we will prove to be one of the cleanest sports because
of what we've done. Cycling has done more than any sport to combat
drugs. I truly believe that.''

   IVORY-KING-SALMON (Undated) _ Five years ago, white king salmon
was a curiosity. But it was usually consigned to the cannery
because the demand was for the bright red flesh of wild king
salmon. White king salmon is unmistakable. Its flesh is as white as
bones. No matter that it had incomparable flavor and superb
texture. It wasn't red, or even pink. The former misfit fish is now
$20 a pound and known as ivory king salmon. And instead of being
destined for the cannery, it is bound for restaurants on the level
of Le Bernardin, Picholine and Alain Ducasse. By Amanda Hesser.

&HT;     INS SAYS GAMING SHIP'S CREW CAN'T STEP ONTO U.S. SOIL

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ U.S. immigration officers are refusing
to let more than 130 foreign-born crew members of a new gambling
ship come ashore, saying the Bahamian-registered vessel must do
more than make daily excursions off the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is going to be a cruise ship, it needs to go
somewhere,'' said Denton Lankford, a spokesman for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service headquarters in San Antonio. ``This one
doesn't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The 420-foot Texas Treasure, which made its first cruise Friday
evening, lists Port Aransas, Texas, as its only stop. Lankford said
that if the ship would visit a foreign port at least once every 29
days, its crew members would be eligible for visas to come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Friedman, general manager of Viva Gaming and Resorts Inc.,
a Las Vegas company that owns the ship, said the situation is being
resolved and that immigration issues won't affect gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are operating as normal,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company were working with the INS to find a
solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 133 foreign-born crew members from more than 20
countries cannot leave the ship, Lankford said.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-and-white cruise ship makes twice-daily excursions into
the Gulf of Mexico and is leasing property from the Port of Corpus
Christi to dock the ship at Harbor Island, within the city limits
of Port Aransas.
</P>
<P>
   It must travel at least 9.2 miles from the port to escape the
reach of Texas gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   The ship can carry up to 1,200 passengers, and it features a
full casino, lounge acts and a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Treasure took on a Las Vegas feel during its maiden
voyage Friday, as cigarette smoke filled the air, gamblers shouted
for luck and cocktail waitresses weaved through the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with promises to bring an economic boost to the tourism
industry, Viva Gaming had pledged to hire employees from Texas'
Gulf Coast communities.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said he did not have an exact breakdown of how many
Texas residents were hired for the ship's crew and for its in-port
facilities. But the proportion of local hires is high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally the one in charge of the hiring, and I've hired
a considerable number of local people for all positions,'' he said.

CUBAN PLANE MISSING NEAR FLORIDA; U.S. COAST GUARD REPORTS 9
SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated with a final version by
Rick Bragg.) 
 By DANIEL J. WAKIN and JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Cuban plane that was reportedly hijacked with up to 18 people
aboard was reported missing Tuesday over international waters off
the Florida Keys. The U.S. Coast Guard received word that nine
survivors and one body may have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said it was investigating a report from a
merchant vessel that said it had picked up nine people and one
body. Luis Diaz, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in Miami, said a
C-130 plane would fly over the vessel to verify whether the people
came from the plane, which he called a ``good possibility,'' and to
scout for wreckage. He noted that Cubans seeking to arrive on
Florida's shores often brave the passage on a raft.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people picked up by the merchant ship were injured,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard sent three helicopters, two airplanes and three
110-foot-long cutters to the area where the Russian-built Antonov
AN-2 was believed to have gone down, about 60 miles southwest of
Marquesa Key at the end of the Florida Keys island chain.
</P>
<P>
   Two F-15 jet fighters from the Florida National Guard also
scrambled when the Cuban plane had appeared to be approaching U.S.
airspace, but detected no sign of the Cuban aircraft, the White
House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters at a daily briefing
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   An AWACS surveillance plane on a training mission over the
United States was diverted to the area, said a Pentagon spokesman,
Rear Adm. Craig Quigley. He said two F-16s from the Minnesota
National Guard that were stationed in the area were sent to relieve
the F-15s.
</P>
<P>
   The AWACS detected a distress beacon, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that information remained sketchy. ``The
working assumption is that it indeed went down in the water,''
Quigley said. He said the people aboard could number 14, 16 or 18,
but that the exact number was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Antonov had taken off from Pinar del Rio, Cuba, and was
headed northwest when air traffic controllers in Havana told their
counterparts in Miami that the plane had been hijacked, said a
recording left on a public information number of the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Miami air traffic controllers had made no voice or radar contact
with the Cuban plane, the FAA said. Havana controllers reported
that the plane had been hijacked, but the circumstances of the
hijacking were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard said `go' to everyone,'' said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Robert Suddarth. ``We don't know if it crashed or if
it was a controlled ditch or if it can land in the water. We are
heading out hoping for the best but prepared for the worst.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officer said the Coast Guard's planes included a C-130
transport and a Falcon Jet that was first on the scene at 12:30
p.m. EDT. The cutter Monhegan, which was in Cuba Tuesday morning on
a mission to repatriate would-be emigrants, was sent to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Seas were rough, swelling to about 4 to 6 feet with winds about
15 to 20 miles an hour. Waters in the area are generally warm at
this time of year, which increases chances for survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters news agency quoted an official at Cuba's Institute
of Civil Aeronautics as saying that the plane was engaged in
``agricultural work'' in Pinar del Rio at the time of the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Antonov craft is a single-engine utility biplane capable of
carrying up to 20 passengers. The AN-2, nicknamed the ``Anushka''
by Russian pilots, was designed in 1947 as a long-range bush plane
and saw early service in Siberia, where it often flew to forest
ranger stations. It has been widely used by countries allied with
the former Soviet Union.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Cathy Freeman was wonderfully poetic Tuesday
afternoon as she described the feeling of the final tension-filled
seconds before a big race, the feelings shooting through her mind
and body as they became one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty seconds before a race, there's absolute focus,'' she
said. ``The key thing is to achieve relaxation, but at the same
time you've got to have this absolute total control. You've got to
find the balance between being totally ready to go and being really
at peace with yourself as well.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Freeman's first news conference since she lighted the
Olympic caldron last Friday and became the face of Australia. For
the next week, an international audience will home in on Freeman,
and she used Tuesday's gathering to describe how she zones the
world out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually your heart's beating really fast,'' she said of her
previous Olympic races in 1992 and '96. ``It feels like your
heart's going to jump out of your chest. And it feels like
everything around you isn't going on because you're so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, Freeman said, the crowd becomes ``this big,
living jelly-like thing that's full of color and noise that's sort
of going around you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're not really quite sure of what's going on around
you,'' she added. ``All I see is the starting blocks and the lane
in front of me; all I hear is being told what do _ `Get your gear
off' _ and the starter's command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only something you experience before an Olympic race.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was a well-guarded secret, Freeman, 27, said she was
asked last April to ignite the caldron. When John Coates, president
of the Australian Olympic committee, extended the invitation,
Freeman said, she nearly fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and numbed,'' she said. ``My mind was totally
blown away. `How can I say nay?''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman went so far as to tell Coates that she would understand
if the committee changed its mind and selected someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many who were appropriate, so many gold-medal
winners,'' she said. ``I was very honored, very proud. It gave me
an extra little bit of incentive to train even harder, if that was
possible, than what I already was. Gave me that extra focus, if
that was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased. There were pages of letters in the
local newspapers asking why Freeman was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in a deeper sense of history that she
represents. At the Atlanta Games in 1996, Freeman won silver in the
400 meters, the first Aborigine to win an Olympic medal in an
individual event.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Freeman if her lighting the caldron was a call for
Aboriginal reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to comment on any political issues such as
reconciliation,'' she said. ``I know that a lot of people got a
kick out of me lighting the flame. I got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she will compete before a home crowd, as the most highly
visible Aborigine, Freeman feels added pressure to represent her
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the flame,'' she said, ``I was really embarrassed
because, more than anything, my main focus was being concerned
about what other people would think about Cathy Freeman being the
one who is lighting the torch and all of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all of that went out of my head when I got the flame, and
I just felt the absolute energy and emotion coming from all of the
people in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important question is: How will Freeman respond to
being the hometown heroine? The swimmer Ian Thorpe has done a
marvelous job of setting the tone for the Australian Olympic team.
Freeman will assume center stage on Friday, when she begins
qualifying for the 400, in which she is a favorite. She will also
run on the 400-meter relay team and perhaps in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   The international news media contingent is swarming; everyone
has to do the Cathy Freeman story, and everyone must do the
Aboriginal story. The scale and magnitude at these Olympics is so
much larger than at any other event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, the attention is really overwhelming,''
Freeman said. ``I'm such a shy thing, it's hard. But it's part of
what this life I have is. I love running, I love competing. It's
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really, really determined to have a good time. I
don't want this to be stressful. I'll just go out there with a lot
of pride in my heart. I just want to go out there and do the best I
can, and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone made the comparison between Freeman and Marion Jones of
the United States. There's an ocean of difference between them.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' pressure is self-imposed: She wants to win an
unprecedented five gold medals in track and field in the same
Olympics. For Freeman the pressure to succeed is coming from a
number of places.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not counting on Jones or anyone else to be
the face it shows to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia this month, Cathy Freeman is it. Tuesday someone
asked Freeman, ``Who are you running for?''
</P>
<P>
   The question always come up. The answer is always the same:
Herself, her people, her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to typify any young Aboriginal person in Australia
today, where we're living in a country of unity and enjoying the
opportunities that are available for everybody,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm about. I want to be free to be who I am in my
own home.''

WHEN LEMON IS ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love the taste of lemon, and sometimes finish grilled or
broiled poultry with just the fresh juice. But when I wanted to
take advantage of the complex flavor of lemon, rind and all, I came
up with this crisp-skinned Rock Cornish hen.
</P>
<P>
   It's topped with lemon slices that brown nicely under the
broiler and become sweet and tender enough to eat, rind and all.
And it's drizzled with just enough balsamic vinegar to make you
wonder where the extra flavor is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is simple. Butterfly the hen, then cover the flesh
side with very, very thin slices of lemon and cook until browned.
Then, turn it over and brown the skin side before covering it with
more lemon slices and browning them. A mandoline is best for
slicing the lemons; it will deliver 15 or even 20 slices from each
lemon.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe can also be made with a three-pound chicken; figure
at least 10 minutes additional cooking time. The birds should brown
slowly but steadily. If they seem to be incinerating, or not much
is happening at all (you should hear cooking noises within just a
couple of minutes), adjust the distance between the rack and the
heat source.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an electric oven, chances are the heating element
will cycle off when the oven becomes hot; you can counter this by
leaving the oven door a little bit ajar while you're cooking, and
moving the bird as far back in the oven as possible.
</P>
<P>
   BROILED ROCK CORNISH HENS WITH LEMON AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 Rock Cornish hens
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the broiler, and adjust the rack to about 4 inches
from the heat source. Use a sharp, sturdy knife to split the hens
through their backbones; it will cut through without too much
effort. Rub the skin side with olive oil. Flatten the hens in a
broiling or roasting pan, skin side down, and liberally sprinkle
the exposed surfaces with salt and pepper. Slice one lemon as
thinly as you can (a mandoline is best for this) and lay the slices
on the birds.
</P>
<P>
   2. Broil for about 10 minutes, or until the lemon is browned and
the birds appear cooked on top; rotate the pan if necessary. Turn
the birds over, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and return to the
heat. Cook another 10 minutes, or until the skin is nicely browned.
Meanwhile, slice the remaining lemon as thinly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lay the lemon slices on the skin, and broil 5 minutes. The
lemons should be slightly browned and the birds cooked through; if
not, cook a couple of minutes more. Drizzle with the balsamic
vinegar, garnish with parsley and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

`QUARREL AND QUANDARY': A GUIDED TOUR THROUGH A WRITER'S MAZY
MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is politics a distraction from art, or is it how we pay
attention to the life that gives rise to art?'' This question,
posed by Cynthia Ozick in the foreword to her challenging new
collection of essays, ``Quarrel &AMP; Quandary,'' is as old as the
Saturday night bar debate, as a walk in the Lyceum with Aristotle,
as art and politics themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the best, most aroused of these 19 essays, Ozick makes
the question of art's relation to politics blaze anew. In ``Who
Owns Anne Frank?'' she implicitly asks if posterity had a right to
prettify the image of Anne Frank in the interest of offending fewer
feelings and creating a figure of sentimental appeal. No, she
answers in thunder, for in the act of transforming the original
``Diary of a Young Girl'' into a stage hit, the truth of the
Holocaust was usurped, and a tragic figure was cartooned.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Rights of History and the Rights of the Imagination''
Ozick asks if William Styron was free in his novel ``Sophie's
Choice'' to portray his Auschwitz victim as a Pole instead of a
Jew. Was it all right for Bernhard Schlink in ``The Reader'' to
present a former Nazi as an illiterate when in fact the Germany
that perpetrated the Holocaust was highly cultured? No, she answers
in sorrow. Where the imagination impinges on history, certain
truths must be respected. These novels are ``softly rhetorical''
works that deflect from ``the epitome,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Ozick seems somewhat perplexed by the firmness of her
conclusions in these and other pieces in ``Quarrel &AMP; Quandary.''
She had always thought of the essay as an occasion for ``loafing
and inviting one's soul,'' she writes in her foreword. Elsewhere,
in ``She: Portrait of the Essay as a Warm Body,'' she praises that
form ``as a thing of the imagination.'' She continues, ``A genuine
essay has no educational, polemical, or sociological use; it is the
movement of a free mind at play,'' ``a stroll through someone's
mazy mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter half of this volume she ambles without axes to
grind. In ``The Ladle'' she describes her late discovery of that
kitchen instrument, comparing it finally, in its capacity to dip,
to the human mind. In ``A Prophet of Modernism,'' she dips into the
mind of Gertrude Stein, concluding about Stein's phrase ``Rose is a
rose is a rose'' that ``this endearing, enduring, durable and
derisible chant of a copycat Cubist is almost all that is left of
Gertrude Stein'' but that she remains ``modernism's outermost
manifestation and prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Drugstore Eden,'' ``Lovesickness'' and ``How I Got Fired
From My Summer Job,'' she writes of her childhood and youth,
digging down to her roots in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx,
where her parents built their own drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while these essays are full of arresting turns of phrase,
they disappoint somehow, disappearing too often into what Ozick
herself calls the softness of metaphor. The book trails off until
you reach its final piece, ``The Synthetic Sublime,'' a strong
evocation of a New York City that ``disappears and then ...
disappears again; or say that every 75 years or so another city
bursts out, as if against nature _ new shapes, new pursuits, new
immigrants with their unfamiliar tongues and worried uneasy
bustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Ozick is best is in the more complex of her ruminations on
art's collision with politics. Is Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov, the
protagonist of ``Crime and Punishment,'' simply a forerunner of
Theodore Kaczynski, she asks in ``Dostoyevski's Unabomber,'' a
``philosophical criminal of exceptional intelligence and
humanitarian purpose who is driven to commit murder out of an
uncompromising idealism''? No, she concludes. While Dostoyevsky
intended to condemn such radical utopianism, his genius was too
complex to reduce his novel to a manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   Was Kafka's mind formed by the history and politics of the
Austro-Hungarian empire? she asks in ``The Impossibility of Being
Kafka,'' an acute meditation on the problems of translation. To be
sure he was, she decides, although his writing transcends such a
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Was Henry James right so insistently to separate ``the
deliberate and always sacral space of art from the vagaries,
contingencies, and frustrations of the artist's life''? she asks in
``The Selfishness of Art.'' Perhaps, but she seems slightly shocked
by the revelations in Lyndall Gordon's ``Private Life of Henry
James: Two Women and His Art'' of the degree of James' callousness
to the suffering of people he rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In essays like these Ozick seems surprised not only by her
conclusions but also by the process through which she arrives at
them. ``Two cheers, then _ when there is no choice _ for being
engage,'' she concedes in her foreword, citing E.M. Forster's
famous ``Two Cheers for Democracy,'' ``but three cheers and more
for that other bravery, the literary essay, and for memory's
mooning and maundering.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading ``Quarrel &AMP; Quandary'' you want to reverse Ozick's
terms. One cheer for her apolitical essays, for her memory's
``mooning and maundering,'' and three cheers for when art's
encroachment on politics serves to bring out the best in her. Even
when you disagree with her, she electrifies your mind.

EGGPLANT PUREE WITH MIXED HERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the sixth column of a series by Eberhard Mueller, the
executive chef and an owner of Lutece. They are being written with
Jack Bishop.  
 By EBERHARD MUELLER and JACK BISHOP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows how beautiful deep purple eggplant can look in
the market, but they are even more elegant in the field: Row upon
row of dark green plants with flawless, shiny purple ornaments
suspended beneath the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   They are completely alluring. And yet, so few people want the
bother of them. Unlike most other vegetables, which can pretty much
go directly from the produce bin (or the field) into the pot,
eggplant takes some thought and attention. It needs to be drained
or roasted, and the larger varieties that are most common at this
time of year can be bitter if they're not handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to figure out a way to create an eggplant dish that
really tasted like eggplant _ not like garlic or tahini or any of
the other flavors that are traditionally used with it _ and was
still simple enough for everyday cooking. Roasting is a good start:
It's an easy way to draw off excess liquid and some of the
bitterness. Once the eggplants cool, I open them up and remove the
seeds, which leaves just a few spoonfuls of meaty flesh. This might
seem wasteful, but it's worth it: The flavor and texture are
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   Next, to draw off even more moisture, I saute the eggplant in
olive oil until it is nearly dry. This extra step transforms the
roasted eggplant into a smooth, thick puree without using a food
processor. I keep the seasoning simple _ a little minced shallot or
fresh onions, some garlic and fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   I am careful to keep the garlic flavor mild, though, by
sprinkling the raw clove with coarse salt and then working the
mixture with the side of a chef's knife until the garlic breaks
down. With garlic paste, you never get chunks of garlic in the
puree.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe starts with an unbelievable amount of eggplant: 8 to
10 pounds for just eight servings. But once the skin, seeds and
water are gone, you're left with pure, concentrated eggplant
flavor, without a trace of bitterness. In fact, my eggplant
``puree'' actually tastes sweet. (It tastes even better if you can
give it a few hours' rest; with time, the herbs really perfume the
eggplant.) I serve the puree as a side dish for grilled fish, but
on a casual late-summer afternoon, it's hard to resist spreading it
over a slice of grilled bread.
</P>
<P>
   EGGPLANT PUREE WITH MIXED HERBS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2{ hours
</P>
<P>
   5 large eggplants (each 1{ to 2 pounds), green caps trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   Coarse sea salt
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots or fresh cipolline onions, minced
</P>
<P>
   { cup minced curly parsley
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup minced chives
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced garlic chives
</P>
<P>
   4 mint leaves, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prick eggplants all over with a
paring knife, and place on large rimmed baking sheet. Bake, turning
once, until eggplants are collapsed and completely soft, about 1{
hours. Let cool. Meanwhile, sprinkle garlic with sea salt, and use
flat blade of chef's knife to mash to a coarse paste. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Halve eggplants lengthwise, and remove bunches of seeds with
large spoon. Scoop flesh out into large bowl, discarding skins. Mix
eggplant with spoon to break up large chunks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place 4 tablespoons oil and shallots in large casserole. Turn
heat to medium and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in
garlic paste and eggplant, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
excess liquid evaporates and eggplant thickens, 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove from heat, and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons oil and
herbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, warm or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 side-dish or appetizer servings.

MAKING THE MOST OF PINOT'S GRAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pinot family of grapes is a large and hospitable one. And,
like many families, it's also a bit unstable. We all know _ and a
lot of us love _ pinot noir, the head of the clan. And a lot of us
like the offspring, pinot gris, who in Italy goes by the name pinot
grigio. Gris and grigio, in case you were wondering, both mean
gray.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me started. Pierre Galet, the French ampelographer
(from ampelos, Greek for grapevine), cites at least 100 kinds of
pinot _ including pinot Beurot, an ancient name for pinot gris;
pinotage, a South African grape invented back in the '20s by
crossing pinot noir and cinsault; and even pinot chardonnay, a name
that went out of fashion when it finally dawned on the experts that
chardonnay has nothing to do with the pinot family. And then there
are the cousins who cling to the old fashioned spelling, pineau,
that appears most frequently in the Loire Valley.
</P>
<P>
   No, I want to talk about pinot blanc. It may just be the grape,
and the wine, you've been looking for if you've ever wondered it
there is life after chardonnay. Like pinot gris, which is also a
white wine, pinot blanc is a mutation of pinot noir _ I told you
pinots were unstable _ that first appeared in Burgundy vineyards in
the last century. It looks like chardonnay, but produces a
different style of wine: Full-bodied but with little of the
floweriness and pungent bouquet common to the better-known white
grape. Even when aged in oak, pinot blanc gives an impression of
leanness and restraint not found in chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little pinot blanc in Burgundy any more; but there
is plenty of it in Alsace, where it is sometimes called klevner.
It's not as subtle and elegant as Alsatian riesling or as
aggressively flowery as Alsatian gewuerztraminer. Nor is it as
distinguished as the local pinot gris. Still, when matched with
simple, hearty foods, I think it makes a better and certainly more
reasonably priced companion than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot blanc is produced in impressive quantities in Central and
Eastern Europe, and is particularly popular in Austria where it is
known, unsurprisingly, as weissburgunder. Austrian wines are
enjoying a certain vogue these days, here in New York anyway, but
there doesn't seem to be much weissburgunder around. Perhaps the
importers are too busy unloading that old Viennese workhorse
gruener veltliner at $35 or more a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There is some terrific pinot blanc made in this country, but the
grape has had a difficult time of it on our shores. For years,
California growers mistakenly cultivated vines of the melon grape
thinking they were pinot blanc. It wasn't their fault: The
University of California at Davis, which grew the original
rootstock somehow misidentified the two plants. Melon, also known
as melon de Bourgogne, is mostly found in the Loire-Atlantique,
where it is made into muscadet.
</P>
<P>
   Our old friend Pierre Galet discovered the mistake in 1980, and
the university owned up to the error in 1984. Soon thereafter, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the winemakers,
``Look, you've got to stop calling this stuff pinot blanc.'' After
the mixup became known, a few California wineries opted to continue
to use the name melon at least until they could pull out or graft
over the imposters and plant certified pinot blanc. Apparently,
telling the difference between the two is not easy, and some
vintners say that melon is probably still growing and being used in
some pinot blanc.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who claim it really doesn't make that much
difference. Especially when both the melon and the true pinot blanc
are made the way good chardonnay is made _ with barrel
fermentation, oak aging, that sort of thing. These coddled pinot
blancs are much prized by connoisseurs, but the ordinary wine fan
might very well misidentify them as chardonnays.
</P>
<P>
   The best bargains are some of the Alsatian wines from producers
like Schlumberger, Albrecht, Hugel, Marc Kreydenweiss, Domaine
Ostertag, Trimbach and Domaine Weinbach. I particularly liked a
Schlumberger '98 at about $7.50. Yes, $7.50. Also a Marcel Deiss
Bergheim pinot blanc for about $15.
</P>
<P>
   Among the California producers, Chalone Vineyards, in Monterey
County, makes a pinot blanc that has always been a favorite of
mine. Chalone's Reserve pinot blanc exhibits the way Old World
tradition blends with the latest technology. The wine is made from
whole cluster grapes that are pressed, not crushed in the usual
manner, then aged in French oak. It's a chardonnay competitor for
the most elegant dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best American sources of good pinot blanc is the
legendary Bien Nacido Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley in Santa
Barbara County, north of Los Angeles. One of the finest Bien Nacido
pinot blancs comes from Jim Clendenin at Au Bon Climat; another is
made by Jedidiah Steele at Steele Wines in Lake County, and yet
another comes from Benziger Winery and Vineyards in Sonoma County.
California pinot blancs range in price from about $30 for the
Chalone down to about $20 for the Benziger.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon winemakers who have labored long to put their pinot gris
forward as a serious white wine, have also produced some delectable
pinot blancs, most in the $15 range. Erath Vineyards, Bethel
Heights and Amity Vineyards are a few in the Willamette Valley.
Given the so-so quality of much Oregon chardonnay, it's a pity that
more of its vintners don't turn to pinot blanc. But chardonnay is a
difficult habit to break.

 &HT;    Vouchers not the answer for 'failing' schools
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political momentum for school vouchers continues to grow, fed
most recently by a controversial study alleging that black students
who were given vouchers to attend private schools made a
``moderately large'' improvement in test scores over a control
group of students who remained behind in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a couple of odd things about that voucher study.
First, white and Hispanic students who participated in the research
project made no improvement; the rise in test scores was limited to
black students. Furthermore, one of the research firms that
participated in the study later complained that the data it had
collected had been misinterpreted. It turns out that the
significant improvement in test scores had been limited not just to
black kids, but to black kids in just one of three cities studied.
</P>
<P>
   It also turned out that there were important differences between
the children who received vouchers and those who served as the
control group in the study. Students who received vouchers were
less likely to be on welfare than those in the control group, and
their parents were in general better educated than parents of those
in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researcher, Paul Peterson of Harvard, nonetheless
stands by his conclusion that a voucher program produced
improvement in the performance of black students. And for purposes
of discussion, let's accept his conclusion as fact.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the research raises a critical question: If black
students benefited more than other students from a change in their
academic environment, was environment their problem in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   We're walking out onto politically thin ice here, and I'm not
promising a safe trip. But follow me here.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of American black students come from families that
for centuries were denied any access to education. After slavery
ended, in the Jim Crow South and elsewhere, they were allowed only
a second-rate education at best, and treated as though they were
suitable only for manual labor. Even those black Americans who
managed to overcome those obstacles and get a college degree were
allowed to reap only meager rewards. Because of their race, they
were barred from the top echelons of business, government and other
fields of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   We know from research and common sense that education, and the
thirst for education, are handed down from generation to generation
like heirlooms. We know that children of college-educated parents
are far more likely to go to college themselves, and that children
of high-school dropouts are also more likely to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that pattern can be attributed to the power of parental
expectation, both positive and negative. Part of it can also be
explained by a child's exposure _ or lack of exposure _ to books
and ideas, and to parents who can explain an Isosceles' triangle to
them.
</P>
<P>
   So if we know that the academic aspirations of black Americans
were crushed for generations, and if we know that those
aspirations, if realized, were seldom rewarded, we should expect
that legacy to leave its mark. Some of the black community has come
to distrust and downplay the importance of an education that they
were denied access to anyway, which is a very human and
understandable reaction.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it's easy to see the destructiveness of that
idea. But those of us lucky enough to know the value of an
education should also be a little humble about telling others to
simply shrug off a perspective born of generations. The exceptional
can perform that feat, but the exceptional by definition are small
in number.
</P>
<P>
   So, if we've managed to walk that thin ice together, where do we
stand?
</P>
<P>
   That account of history, while controversial in some quarters,
would help explain why black students would improve more than other
students when placed in an atmosphere in which achievement was
valued and expected. And if that explanation of their improvement
is valid, the challenge is to recreate that change in atmosphere
not just for a few, but for the many.
</P>
<P>
   Are vouchers the best means to meet that challenge? Perhaps.
Let's look again at the recent study.
</P>
<P>
   The students in the study were taken out of schools that by
standard definitions were failing. They were then placed in private
schools where the atmosphere of accomplishment was already
well-established. Unfortunately, a broad voucher program could not
re-create that experience.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer practical reasons, such as transportation, large
numbers of inner-city students who were granted vouchers would
probably opt for schools near their homes, where they would still
constitute the majority of the student body. Roughly the same
student body would now be served by a private school, rather than a
public institution.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a hard truth: It won't matter. Even if you took one
of the nation's highest-achieving private schools and transplanted
its educational guts _ its splendid teachers, its rigorous
curriculum _ into an inner-city urban high school, that school
would probably still be labeled a ``failure'' for its inability to
bring up test scores.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, vouchers are not the answer. They are not the
answer because the problem we describe as ``failing schools'' is
something more complicated, reaching far beyond the school grounds.
It is economic and cultural and social and even historical, and by
pretending it's something as simple as a failure of schools we
excuse ourselves from addressing and acknowledging the problem in
its true complexity.

TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For a while there, if you believed the rumors, the
headlines and the desperate cries of some bartenders, you might
have thought that the world's supply of tequila was about to dry
up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a temporary shortage of the blue agave, the gigantic lily
from which the liquor is made, forced a few small distilleries to
close their doors. And the perception of a crisis allowed big
producers, which appear to have enough agave to weather the tequila
tempest, to raise their prices 20 percent or more. One Manhattan
bartender even invented a substitute called the ``rum-a-rita.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there a tequila crisis of glass-shattering proportions?
Not really, inquiries from here to Margaritaville indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no crisis,'' said Jose Luis Sanchez, vice president
of the National Chamber of the Tequila Industry in Mexico. ``There
is no such thing as this alleged crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, however, that trouble has been brewing in and around
Tequila, the town in central Mexico that makes millions of gallons
of the drink that made it famous. Indisputably, large forces are at
work: the cycles of nature, the laws of supply and demand, the
thirst for margaritas. But for the increasing number of people in
the United States who sip premium tequila or swill agave-scented
slush, the glass may be half full, not half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Making tequila _ a drink as Mexican as Champagne is French _ has
been a rough-and-tumble business since the days of the
conquistadors. The Aztecs figured out how to make a brew called
pulque out of agave more than 1,000 years ago. The Spaniards
refined the process. But no one ever smoothed over the eternal
enmity between the farmers who grow agave and the businessmen who
distill tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growers and distillers of tequila are historical
enemies,'' said Robert Denton, an American tequila importer. Their
warring has led to the present state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, there was a glut of agave. The big producers
pressured farmers to sell below market prices, for less than 4
cents a pound, driving some out of business or into other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Agave takes at least eight years to mature. Today, there are
roughly half as many agave plants in the ground as there were a few
years ago. Fungus and freezes, as well as greed, have taken their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   And in those past eight years, tequila's popularity exploded in
the United States. Like single-malt whisky and specialty bourbon,
premium tequila, made from 100 percent blue agave, is handmade,
with subtle variations, a rich history and a complex taste. And
like those other spirits, it began to command staggering prices in
the 1990s: $100 _ or more _ for an artfully made bottle. Jose
Cuervo recently introduced 1800 Coleccion at $1,000 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by that trendiness, the booming stock market and the
eased trade rules of NAFTA, production and export of the top-end
premiums more than quadrupled from 1995 to 1999. The more popular
brands of tequila, which are as little as 51 percent agave and used
for mixing margaritas, also took off, with production and export
increasing roughly 40 percent. Industry statistics vary, and are
sometimes suspect. But figures from Mexico's Tequila Regulatory
Council, formed in 1994 to oversee production and quality, show a
48 percent increase in tequila drinking north of the Rio Grande
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With less agave growing and more tequila flowing, it doesn't
require a Ph.D. in economics to understand the consequences: prices
are up 20 percent or more for the popular brands, and demand
threatens to overtake supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a while in coming, and it couldn't have happened
without the stupidity of the tequila manufacturers and the
not-so-watchful gaze of the Mexican government,'' said Agustin
Barrio Gomez, who is trying to sell his small premium distillery,
Suave Patria, to avoid going broke. The Mexican government did not
intervene, as Washington might have, to provide price supports or
bailouts for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the temporary agave shortage, the major tequila
producers, who control more than half the global market, do not
seem to be running dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the big boys, there isn't really a crisis,'' said Alan
Dikty, an expert on spirits and an editor at Tastings.com, the Web
site of the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago, which conducts
consumer reviews (and sounds like a pleasant place to work). ``All
the large distillers either own their own fields or have contracts
lined up with growers. They're covered.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the smaller ones, who buy agave from independent
plantation owners, ``there is a crisis,'' he said. ``There is going
to be a winnowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mexico has 72 tequila distilleries, double the number
five years ago. But a dozen or more of the smaller new ones have
closed or seem likely to soon because they can't compete with
companies that have bigger reserves and more buying power. The
smaller distillers have to buy agave on the open market, where
prices shot above 60 cents a pound this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Answering their pleas, the government threatened the big
distillers this summer with an antitrust action. But the threat
came too late and in any case never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   If it had, it could well have become an international incident.
Foreigners have a big stake in the most famous names in tequila.
Allied Domecq, the British company that also controls Dunkin'
Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, owns Tequila Sauza, the second-largest
brand. Diageo, the British conglomerate that owns Burger King and
Guinness, controls 45 percent of Jose Cuervo, the largest-selling
tequila. American, Canadian and French companies like Brown-Forman,
Seagram and Remy Martin, are also in the global cantina.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government brokered a deal between the
distillers and the growers. They agreed to set the price of agave
at 45 cents a pound, to try to bring the supplies of agave back up,
and to try to bring the price of tequila back down.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was too late to save Barrio Gomez's distillery, and he
fears it might have come too late to maintain tequila's soaring
popularity abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' he said. ``Tequila was the fastest-growing
product in the spirits market.'' But the ``greed and poor
coordination'' of big tequila companies ``broke the market
momentum,'' he said. ``Once you kill the fad, it's hard to
regain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the thirst for tequila remains, though the price may stay
high _ for a while. In the town of Tequila, ``they're over-planting
now,'' Denton said, with a sigh born of two decades in the
business. ``So, six or eight years from now, there'll be a glut
again.''

DOUGHNUT SHOP FIRE LEAVES A GNAWING HOLE IN ROUND ROCK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents of Round Rock, near Austin, jumped through emotional
hoops last week as they wept for the loss of their world-famous
doughnut shop, then set off fireworks to celebrate the league
championship of their new professional baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Round Rock Express _ a double-A farm team of the
Houston Astros _ closed out its first-ever season with a victory
over the Wichita Wranglers to claim the Texas League Championship.
</P>
<P>
   At Dell Stadium, the Express' home field, scads of fireworks
were ignited and a single-game record crowd of 11,000-plus fans
temporarily set aside the pain of the fire Sept. 12 at the Lone
Star Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to Lone Star heard the message: ``Thank you for calling
Lone Star Bakery, home of the famous Round Rock doughnuts in Round
Rock, Texas. We are temporarily closed due to a major fire. ... We
appreciate your patronage, and we will be ready to serve you when
we reconstruct.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying how long it will take to ``reconstruct,'' but
the mayor of Round Rock has already presented the owners of the
bakery with a building permit _ waiving the $500 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The doughnuts from Lone Star are considered the second most
famous thing in Round Rock, maybe the third now that the Express
won the league championship. The other was outlaw Sam Bass.
</P>
<P>
   The orange-yellow creations, often lopsided and always large,
cost $3 a dozen and received the most votes in a best-doughnuts
survey by a nationally syndicated TV talk show. Texas Monthly has
honored the doughnuts and Lone Star Bakery several times; and
perhaps more importantly, the bakery was recently profiled in a
police officers' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said Wednesday that a deep fryer that turned out
6,000 doughnuts a day was the likely culprit in the Sept. 12 fire.
The bakery's interior walls were charred, the ceiling was sagging
with waterlogged insulation, and the display cases were filled with
blackened cookies and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, there was little evidence of the damage, and
customers were surprised to find the bakery _ established in 1926 _
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been calling here ever since it happened,'' said
Marilyn Murray at the Round Rock Chamber of Commerce. ``One guy
even wanted to know if they had set up a temporary location. He was
worried because he had placed a large order.''
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock doughnuts are a staple in office buildings all along
Interstate 35, from Temple to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can testify to how good they are,'' Murray said. ``I've been
here at the chamber for about 5 1/2 years, and we have them for our
board and business meetings. There has been many a morning that one
of us has gone by the bakery at 6:30 to pick up an order.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the doughnuts have been profiled in newspapers
throughout the country, and it is not uncommon for people passing
through Round Rock to call the chamber for directions to Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a son in the military and he always says those
doughnuts are the one thing he really misses,'' she said. ``I have
shipped them to him. I paid $45 for the doughnuts and about that
much for the shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she also once decorated the chamber Christmas tree
with coffee mugs from various Round Rock companies, and shellacked
Round Rock doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent so many years here, and our hearts are here,'' Dale
Cohrs, the bakery owner, told the Austin American Statesman after
the fire. ``We've seen all our customers and their babies grow up
here. It's just like home.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohrs, who bought the bakery 22 years ago, said he hoped to have
Lone Star back in business by January _ in time to celebrate its
75th anniversary.

AT THE SPRING SHOWS WITH MIGUEL ADROVER, PAMELA DENNIS, CAROLINA
HERRERA AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
NEW YORK _ In fashion, it's amazing what a difference a few months
and a wheelbarrow load of money can make.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February, the scene at the Miguel Adrover show was like
several hundred sardines trying to squeeze into a palm-sized tin.
This week, Adrover's spring 2001 women's wear collection played out
on a finely crafted elevated wood runway, laid out in a serpentine
pattern in the soaring lobby of a venerable old stone building at
Spring and Lafayette _ for those who don't know this city, a tony
downtown address.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of space for retail buyers and media, who
collectively held their breath to see if Adrover would display the
kind of creativity he drew raves for last season when his show
included torn, patched and fringed-edge garments, as well as the
use of deconstructed vintage handbags as leather trims.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of antics that make hard-core fashion freaks
do cartwheels, as they have this week over the Imitation of Christ
line, vintage clothing reworked by designers Tara Subkoff and Matt
Damhave and shown in a funeral home alongside a casket. But the
object of fashion is to move on, creatively and financially, the
latter certainly a goal for Adrover whose personal bank account was
running in the low double digits earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Poor as he was, Adrover drew praise last season for his fine
tailoring. Once again that quality came shining through, although
for spring it is in the context of 1940s &UR;  &LR; militaire and Boy Scout
looks, complete with campaign caps and neckerchiefs in olive drab
and khaki.
</P>
<P>
   Black skirts and navy and cream silk dresses, many with
intricately executed pleats or tiny contrast bindings at the hems,
fell to ladylike lengths below the knees. For more casual wear,
Adrover's homeboy looks with ribbed tank tops and hip-slung denim
culottes were accessorized on the runway with boom boxes.
</P>
<P>
   This was not alien fashion, as the immigrant-card invitations
might have led some to believe. Remove the war-officer neckties,
and Adrover's military looks are Ralph Lauren safari chic, a
comparison not missed when the designer sent out a T-shirt that
sported a gigantic polo pony.
</P>
<P>
   The largesse that made this season's expanded Adrover show
possible was the acquisition of a controlling interest in his
company and an infusion of capital by Pegasus, a financial
consortium hoping to cash in on the talents of young designers.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Pegasus stable is Pamela Dennis, who for the first
time could afford a big show at the tents in Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   Her silvery satin fish-tail dresses and skirts, accessorized by
a ton of Harry Winston diamonds, wowed the audience. Yet Dennis has
a lot to learn when it comes to runway presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Boney models yanked at strapless tops, clutched fistfuls of
overly long skirts and wobbled down the runway on impossibly high
stilettos. Worse was the lack of any color in the makeup on models
who should have looked voluptuous and pretty in these clothes
instead of ghastly pale.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis shone, however, in her transparent sequined black and
white Op Art gowns, one of which Geena Davis wore to the Emmy
Awards, and a closing group of white double-faced satin cocktail
clothes, accessorized with more of the icy diamonds and the
designer's new line of evening bags.
</P>
<P>
   Rich in color
</P>
<P>
   One designer who has stood the test of time by making women look
pretty is Carolina Herrera, a talent appreciated by an audience
that included the acting couple Antonio Banderas and Melanie
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Electrifying colors of coral, turquoise, periwinkle, fuchsia and
sunflower were played off rich neutrals of tobacco, chocolate, ecru
and black. Silk and silk charmeuse were the fabrics of choice for
generously sleeved blouses and chemises, while silk shantung was
used for button-leg trousers and culottes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery where Herrera's customers might wear the
ultrashort leather shorts, but graphically printed flippy skirts,
bright leather jackets, cute rompers and richly colored evening
gowns are happy clothes sure to be hits.
</P>
<P>
   Luca Luca designer Luca Orlandi, who springs from a moneyed
Milanese family, staged a big show with Howard Stern and Angie
Harmon in the audience and Op Art graphics and loud colors on the
runway. Beaded bikinis, red leathers, stylized tiger stripes and
leopard prints, and charcoal denims are for women not afraid to
strut their stuff, as well as Orlandi's.
</P>
<P>
   TSE New York, designed by Hussein Chalayan, played out in the
vastness of Roseland, where a black felt stage held a giant white
triangle, circle and square. Models wound their ways around the
geometrical forms in clothing that featured brightly colored
geometric prints, cutouts and appliques _ sometimes too many at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Cute and fluttery were Chalayan's crepe de Chine slim skirts
with many rows of semicircles sewn vertically so they resembled
petals blowing in the wind. These would have been as pretty as
Bluebird Circle Easter baskets had they not been paired with the
designer's overly bright graphic tops.
</P>
<P>
   Following a design theme Chalayan initiated last season,
superimposition prints featured graphic shapes piled on graphic
shapes, adding color to color. Against a white background, however,
these clothes look as if they might have been attacked by a
blizzard of Post-It Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Political play
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cole chose to stage his show of men's and women's wear
in Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Station, only a few steps from
one of his large retail shops. As time draws nearer to the
election, one question remains uppermost in the minds of most
Americans, comedian Jon Stewart said in an opening video clip.
``Who are you wearing?''
</P>
<P>
   The politically active Cole, who is married to the daughter of
former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, hopes to encourage voter
registration and turnout, and on the side, he turned out a nice
collection of blue and ecru suedes and leathers, wash-and-wear
techno khakis, denims and stretch poplins, and punched or laser-cut
leathers.
</P>
<P>
   Custo Barcelona is up to more of the same _ bright printed
T-shirts, skirts and pants. For spring, most garments include at
least three varied fabrics, some of which look rather cheesy and
feature sleazy cuts. Then there are the glitter-painted denims.
</P>
<P>
   Menswear was on the Custo Barcelona runway for spring and in its
simplicity _ the brightly printed T-shirts with crisp white pants _
looks more refreshing than the psychedelic granny garb for women.

SYRAH'S NORTHWEST PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Syrah is a coming grape in the United States, and Washington is
one of its hotbeds: more than 1,500 acres are planted with syrah
vines. That's almost triple the acreage of a year ago, though well
behind the more than 10,000 acres planted in California, where
acreage is also rapidly increasing. While syrah in California may
always be overshadowed by chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and the
other big boys, it has a chance to make a name for itself in
Washington, where the wine industry is not as established.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of syrah is exciting because it is a versatile
wine. It can be excellent in the northern Rhone Valley of France,
where wines from Hermitage and Cote Rotie set standards for power
and elegance. But in its less exalted forms, it can be a richly
satisfying everyday red. Winemakers all over the south of France
are turning to syrah to improve a host of fairly inexpensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   Americans accustomed to insipid merlots may find syrahs just as
easy to drink yet with more substance. While syrah rarely has the
tannic bite of cabernet sauvignon, it often has more depth than
merlot.
</P>
<P>
   The American style of syrah is as different from the Rhone style
as American pinot noirs are from Burgundies. Most Washington syrahs
I've tasted are sweet, fruity and forward, easier to enjoy young
than the French wines, which seem more spicy and woodsy than
fruity. Conversely, Washington syrahs are not as gushingly sweet
and fruity as Australian syrahs, which are called shiraz there.
</P>
<P>
   Washington syrahs are still in relative infancy, and much
remains to be learned about them. How will they age? Will
succeeding vintages change as vines mature? Currently, they are not
easy to find, but that should change in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the vintages available, the 1998s are softer and fruitier
than the 1997s, which are firmer and may have more potential. &QL;
</P>

   Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various
Manhattan wine shops.

<P>
   Q: How many people have died flying for the Thunderbirds and
Blue Angels flying teams?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.C., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been 44 fatalities: 24 with the Blue Angels and 20
with the Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels, a Navy team founded in 1946, suffered
fatalities most recently on Oct. 28, 1999. Kevin Colling and Kieron
O'Connor died in a plane crash near Valdosta, Ga., during a
training flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderbirds, an Air Force team founded in 1953, lost four
members in a Jan. 18, 1982, crash at Indian Springs, Texas: Norm
Lowry, Willie Mays, Mark Melancon and Pete Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were flying a loop in diamond formation when Lowry's
plane malfunctioned and he couldn't pull out of the manuever.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at almost 500 mph and following Lowry's lead, the
other three pilots stayed in formation and all four crashed less
than four seconds after the malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the phrase ``toe the line'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Foot races, according to the Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `line' or `mark' is simply the line drawn at the start of
the race,'' authors William and Mary Morris write. ``All
contestants must toe this line.''
</P>
<P>
   The expression means to follow the rules and fulfill your
obligations. It originated in the United States, and the first
known appearance is in the 1813 book ``The Diverting History of
John Bull and the Brother Jonathan,'' the Morris Dictionary states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Dick Van Dyke?
</P>
<P>
   _ P.H., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of Viacom Productions, 7700 Balboa
Blvd., Van Nuys, CA 91406.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke, 74, begins his eighth season on ``Diagnosis Murder''
Oct 5. His character, crime-solving doctor Mark Sloan, originated
on an episode of ``Jake and the Fatman'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The series is moving to a new time slot: 9 p.m. Thursdays. ``The
network, in its wisdom, has put us up against `ER,''' Van Dyke told
TV critics this summer. ``We're dead.''

FIGS ARE GOOD ENOUGH WITHOUT THE BLATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Balducci, who has sold produce for decades, has made me
feel so much better about figs this summer. For years I have
listened to seemingly knowledgeable food lovers become positively
ecstatic about fresh figs and the nuances that make one variety
better than another. Try as I may, I can barely tell the
difference. All I know is that the green ones have slightly thicker
skins.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I called Balducci, who is the produce buyer for the
Baldor Specialty Foods Co. in New York, a distributor of fruits and
vegetables, to ask if he could help me with my lack of
sophistication about the green and black figs now in season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could tell them apart either if I was
blindfolded,'' he said. ``There is a slight difference in the
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are people always raving about their differences?
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come from Italy and say the fruit was wonderful,
it's because it was just picked off the tree,'' he said. ``If you
picked them off the tree here it would be the same thing, but when
you get them they have gone through the distribution system;
they've been refrigerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Since our conversation, I have read extensively about figs, and
everyone seems to agree: The differences, at least among those
grown in the United States, are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Balducci added that the first figs of the year, the green
Calimyrna that come in June, look distinctively different from the
green Kadota on the market now. Both are green-gold, but the Kadota
are slightly more pear-shaped, like the black or purple Mission
figs in season now. Larger, more elongated Black Turkey figs are
also in season. One variety or another should be available into
November.
</P>
<P>
   Most figs sold in this country come from California, where they
were first planted by Spanish missionaries. For years Americans
outside California never saw a fig until it had been dried or
ground up and put in a Fig Newton. Today figs are popular enough
that street vendors in New York sell them along with bananas and
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   The best figs are plump and very soft; the small opening at the
bottom should be slightly open, but there should be no blemishes or
oozing. Figs can be refrigerated, but are best eaten at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Figs are very perishable: They spoil quite quickly. Unripe figs
can improve only so much, and if they are at all firm will have
none of the juicy sweetness for which they are prized. Select
carefully, and plan to use them within two days. Figs sold loose,
then, are generally worth the higher prices they fetch than those
in sealed pint boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Figs are popular in all Mediterranean countries, where they are
used in appealing savory combinations. Italians, of course, wrap
them in prosciutto, the salt and sweet, the juicy and dry providing
a great flavor medley. The combination also makes a spectacular
salad if bitter arugula is added.
</P>
<P>
   A buttery sheep's milk cheese from Portugal, queijo de Serra, is
wonderful eaten with figs and a touch of aged balsamic vinegar
poured over them. They also work well with tangy cheeses like
gorgonzola or blue, as well as creamier types like mascarpone.
</P>
<P>
   I like figs eaten out of hand, but sweets made with figs leave
me cold. Figs can be roasted, or even battered and deep-fried, but
less is more with this sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best treatments are the easiest. Slice them in half,
top each half with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with finely
grated orange peel. Or quarter them and serve them with heavy cream
spooned over.
</P>
<P>
   Or marinate quartered figs in a tiny bit of brandy for 30
minutes, mix sour cream with just enough orange liqueur to flavor
it and spoon the mixture over the figs.
</P>
<P>
   As inviting as those combinations are, last week I had the most
indulgently elegant dish of fresh figs ever. The figs were halved
and topped with a dollop of foie gras mousse. They were even better
than with prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   SALAD OF FIGS, ARUGULA AND PROSCIUTTO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2{ tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 large or 3 small bunches arugula, thoroughly washed and dried,
tough stems removed
</P>
<P>
   6 ripe fresh figs, washed and quartered
</P>
<P>
   8 slices prosciutto, cut into 1-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the vinegar, oil and mustard together. Toss the arugula
with the dressing, and arrange on 4 salad plates. Arrange figs on
arugula, and scatter prosciutto over.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED FIGS WITH BLUE CHEESE AND HAM
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   8 ripe black Mission figs
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons soft sharp blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   4 very thin slices cured country ham like Smithfield, cut in
half
</P>
<P>
   Pan spray.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Wash figs. Cut them partway through vertically into 4
quarters, leaving the bottoms intact.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mix cheese with pine nuts, and stuff into figs. Arrange in a
baking pan coated with pan spray, and roast just long enough for
the cheese to begin to melt, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place 2 halves of a ham slice on each of 4 salad plates; put
a fig on top of each half, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings as first course.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Any variety of strong, salty blue cheese will work,
especially Great Hill blue from Massachusetts or Humboldt Fog,
Morbier style.

defender of Yugoslavia's sovereignty against a hostile, hegemonic
West led by Washington, Milosevic and his government argue that
opposition leaders are merely the paid, traitorous tools of enemies
who are continuing their war against him by other means. The
elections are on Sunday, but there has hardly been a day since the
bombing war against Yugoslavia began in March 1999 that state
television news has not railed against ``NATO aggressors.'' By

   BUSH (Chicago) _ The question came by way of an e-mail message.
Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of confessional television, relayed it,
and Gov. George W. Bush took it head on: What's the public's
largest misconception of him? ``I'm running on my Daddy's name,''
he answered instantly. `Really?'' she prodded. ``That, you know, if
my name was George Jones I'd be a country and western singer,''
said Bush, the son of a president. ``I've lived with this all my
life. Of course, I love my dad a lot. he's a fabulous man and I'm
proud to be his son.'' For an hour Tuesday, Bush took his turn in
Oprah's chair, just a week after Al Gore did, trying to woo her 7
million daily viewers, most of them women. He gave her a kiss,
which Gore did not. He resisted some of her efforts to force him
into introspection. Joked at others. He talked of God, of stopping
drinking. And his eyes welled up with emotion as he spoke of his
wife and the birth of his twins. By Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   The Danube flows east from the Black Forest through Germany and
Austria and into Hungary where, abruptly, it turns and heads due
south to Budapest, as if the river itself couldn't resist the
city's lure.
</P>
<P>
   Called the ``Duna'' in Hungarian, the Danube curves sinuously
through town, slicing it in half _ Buda on the right bank, Pest on
the left. In fact the two formerly independent towns, along with
the smaller Obuda, were united only in 1873, just a few years after
the creation of the Austro-Hungarian double monarchy. Soon,
Budapest became a royal capital to match Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that 19th-century charm has been restored since the fall
of Communism ended the long, dark 20th-century chapter of Hungary's
history. Since the spring of 1990 when the first free elections
were held, Budapest has, once again, welcomed visitors to its
elegant doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically the city's two sides are surprisingly different.
Buda rises on a series of wooded hills, crowned by the ramparts of
Castle Hill and the spires of St. Matthias church; Pest sprawls out
on a flat plain behind its Danube promenade. But both are graced by
delightful squares, majolica gables, patterned tile roofs and
townhouses painted bright yellow, salmon pink or pea green.
</P>
<P>
   There are splendid Hungarian Art Nouveau buildings on both sides
of the river, too _ although some are in disrepair _ and grand old
coffee houses where you can sit and read the newspapers in a
setting more turn-of-the-last-century than of this one.
</P>
<P>
   There's music everywhere in this land of Franz Liszt and Franz
Lehar _ not to mention the jazz, pop, rock and techno that are part
of the city's active night life. And there are the thermal baths
for which Budapest is famous, their opulent halls and steaming
pools a heritage of both the Romans and the Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans' Aquincum (``Abundant Waters''), the capital of their
province of Pannonia, was on the site of Obuda. In the 5th century,
the Romans were driven out by the Huns. Succeeding centuries
brought waves of barbarians followed by the Magyars, the Ottomans
and finally, the Hapsburgs. From 1686 until 1916, Hungary's destiny
was, for better or worse, firmly linked with Austria's.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last Hapsburg Emperor, Franz-Josef I, and his Empress
Elizabeth, known as Sissi, who turned 13th-century Buda Castle into
the grandiose neo-Baroque edifice that overlooks the Danube today.
Behind gates guarded by the ``turul,'' the mythic Magyar bird of
prey, the castle now houses three museums: the Hungarian National
Gallery, with Hungarian art from the Middle Ages to the 20th
century, the Budapest History Museum (which incorporates the lovely
14th-century royal chapel) and the Ludwig Contemporary Art Museum,
whose collection includes work by Frank Stella, Claus Oldenburg,
Joseph Beuys and Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   With its boldly painted pillars and walls, the 700-year-old St.
Matthias Church _ which was transformed into a mosque during the
Ottoman reign _ was the site of coronations and royal weddings.
Franz-Josef and Sissi were crowned there in 1867 with Franz Lizst
himself conducting his ``Coronation Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Just downhill, the Fishermen's Bastion is an extraordinary
19th-century folly _ neo-Romanesque stone ramparts punctuated by
seven turrets with conical caps, one for each of the Magyar tribes.
Built for the city's Millenary celebrations in 1896, it provides
wonderful views across the river to Pest.
</P>
<P>
   Belvaros, the historical inner-city district of Pest, is a busy
commercial and financial center. It's also the home of the
Hungarian Parliament, the Orszaghaz, a neo-Gothic fantasy very like
London's, bristling with lacy gables and spires.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pedestrian district, Vorosmarty Square is
lined with cafe terraces, including the renowned Gerbeaud's Tea
Room whose beautiful interior boasts glass-topped counters stacked
with irresistible pastries and cakes. You may have to thread your
way around street musicians and sidewalk artists and caricaturists
here, but it's not to be missed. Just off the square, the top
shopping street, Vaci utca, is often so filled with tourists that
it's more fun to try a few others _ Petofi Sandor, Haris, Kigyo and
Szabadsajto streets. (Don't miss the Parizsi udvar, a 19th-century
glass-domed, covered passage just off Parizsi, or Paris, street.)
</P>
<P>
   Museums abound in Pest documenting Hungarian history, the
Hungarian rural world and decorative arts, especially Hungary's
brilliant Art Nouveau period. The colossal neo-Classical
Szevpuveszeti, the Museum of Fine Arts, houses superb collections
of 13th- to 18th-century painting and sculpture. Among its holdings
are works by Raphael, Veronese, Velasquez, Goya, Durer, Rubens and
Van Dyck. Have a look at the grandly ornamented interior of St.
Stephen's church and, a few blocks away in the Jewish quarter, the
Great Synagogue of Dohany Street, Europe's largest synagogue.
Theodor Herzl, whose dream of a Jewish state came to fruition many
years after his death in 1904, was born in a house nearby, now the
site of the Jewish Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Meander through Vasarcsarnok, the 1897 covered food and crafts
market with its graceful wrought iron gallery. Stop for a
much-needed rest in Pest's most famous coffee house, the gilded and
marbled Cafe New York. Then, for a breath of fresh air, take a late
stroll through Varosliget City Park, where the romantic Vajdahunyad
Castle is mirrored in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Also in City Park is one of the city's most popular thermal
baths, the enormous Szechenyi Gyogyfurdo, a domed neo-Baroque
palace with indoor and outdoor pools. Even more sumptuous are the
blue-and-gold mosaic-tiled baths of the luxurious Gellert Hotel,
but you don't have to be a guest to use them. There are also the
authentic Ottoman Rudas (for men only) and Kiraly baths, both built
in 1566 by Pasha Mustapha Sokoli.
</P>
<P>
   As they were for the ancient Romans, the baths are a central
part of life in Budapest where locals socialize and relax. Some
things don't change. Why should they?

THINK YOU'VE GRILLED IT ALL? TRY GRILLING SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 700 words of recipes appear at end of story.)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you spent any time at the grill this summer, you probably
charred a vegetable or two and anointed it with olive oil or a
drizzle of balsamic vinegar or lemon. A platter of grilled
vegetables is a handsome sight, and more than once it has made me
look like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond that simple success there is a frontier to be
crossed, a dish so improbable that only a true barbecue buff could
have conceived it. I'm talking about grilled soup.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it is possible to simmer a pot of soup over the fire,
and maybe a cowboy or two has done it. But I have something more
audacious in mind: flame-charring the ingredients for the soup on
the grill.
</P>
<P>
   As in the case of many of my favorite dishes, I stumbled on
grilled soups by accident, this time while trying to smoke some
tomatoes for gazpacho. Normally, I would use a water smoker. On
this day my smoker was occupied by a turkey. So I fired up a grill,
tossed some oak chunks on the coals, and charred the tomatoes,
peppers and onions over the fire.
</P>
<P>
   They made a stunning gazpacho. Instead of a blunt, heavy smoke
flavor, it was rich with the taste of flame-charred vegetables. The
high heat of the grill caramelized the vegetables, producing a
natural sweetness and light smokiness. Unlike smoking, grilling
vegetables chars them on the outside, allowing you to add color,
texture and character to a soup in the form of tiny pieces of
seared skin. (You don't want to get carried away here: there's a
difference between seared and burned.)
</P>
<P>
   If grilling could so utterly transform gazpacho, I wondered what
it could do for corn chowder. I grilled some corn my favorite way _
without the husk _ and then cut the kernels off the cobs. The soup
had the sweetness of a traditional chowder and the smoky flavor of
grilled corn on the cob.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was grilling peppers to make bisque, and fish to make
chowder. I even tried grilling all the vegetables for a minestrone,
a painstaking process I won't be repeating anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But in every other case, the effort was worth it. The simple
process of grilling the ingredients does something wonderful to
soup, especially when using wood smoke. With a charcoal grill, you
can grill over wood. Hardware stores sell bags of oak or hickory
chunks, which can be lighted in a chimney starter and used as you
would charcoal. For an even easier wood fire, there are
instant-lighting Cookout Bags, paraffin-coated wood chunks packaged
in flammable paper bags made by W.W. Woods and sold at grill shops
or on the Internet at www.woodinc.com. You simply light the corners
of the bag for a wood fire that's ready for cooking in about 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You can also build a conventional charcoal fire and toss soaked
wood chunks or chips on the coals. If your gas grill has a smoker
box, place the wood chips in it; if not, wrap them in foil, pierce
the top of the package with a pencil, and place it directly over
one of the burners, under the grate. When using gas, preheat the
grill until you see smoke, then place the vegetables on the grate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel limited by the end of grilling season. You can char
vegetables under the broiler or sear them in a grill pan all year
long.

SENATE VOTE ENDS 20 YEARS OF RESTRAINTS ON TRADE WITH CHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major triumph for the Clinton administration
and U.S. business, the Senate on Tuesday voted away restraints on
trade with China that stood for more than 20 years as
anti-communist policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-15 vote, which crossed party lines, will give Beijing
permanent normal trading privileges after months of delay and
partisan maneuvering that supporters once feared could fatally
entangle the legislation in election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the House's approval in May, Tuesday's vote will
end the annual congressional review of China's trade status, a
Capitol Hill ritual for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading
but that critics argued was necessary to force China to improve its
record on human rights and religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is expected to be signed soon by President Clinton,
who set out early this year to win passage of what he considers one
of his crowning foreign policy goals despite uncertain odds in the
House and the political vagaries of a fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With less than four months remaining in Clinton's presidency,
several of his Cabinet officers joined with corporate chieftains
last week in one last, furious lobbying push to ensure victory by
defeating a contentious amendment on Chinese arms-trafficking that
supporters argued could scuttle the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure ensures that the United States will
benefit fully from a market-opening accord that Washington and
Beijing negotiated last November. It will slash Chinese tariffs on
a wide range of farm and industrial products and remove barriers to
U.S. service providers, like banks and telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement granting China permanent normal trading relations
is a necessary step for U.S. companies to benefit fully from a deal
Washington and Beijing reached last year that paves the way for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the 135-member
trade group that sets the rules for global commerce. China would
have been able to join the trade organization regardless of how the
Senate voted. But without Congress' blessing, China could have
withheld some trade benefits from the United States that it extends
to other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of just a few months, Congress has generated one of
the most productive years for trade legislation in nearly a quarter
century. Besides the China bill, lawmakers earlier this year
approved bills to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration's last major trade victories were
passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which created the World Trade
Organization, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993,
which established duty-free commerce among the United States,
Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce lobbying that pitted corporate America against
organized labor in the run-up to the House's 237-197 approval of
the China trade measure in May never materialized in the sister
chamber, because all sides knew the question in the pro-trade
Senate was never whether the measure would pass, but by how much.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For that reason, supporters and opponents adopted different
strategies for dealing with the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has taken a low-key approach, aiming to avoid
creating a political issue for the bill's foes to exploit. When
Clinton's point man on the bill, Commerce Secretary William Daley,
left the Cabinet to head Gore's re-election campaign, some
supporters fretted that momentum was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, balked at
scheduling a vote before the July 4 recess and then before the
five-week summer break, arguing that the Senate had more pressing
business in wrapping up many of the 13 must-pass spending bills
that keep the government running.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into September, our chances for passage drop
precipitously,'' Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader, said in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, critics seemed to have a point. Just as the
vote in the House created unusual political alliances between
liberal labor groups and conservative religious organizations, the
Senate battle produced odd political couplings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., perhaps the Senate's
most liberal member, teamed up with Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and one of
the chamber's staunchest conservatives, to back amendments on human
rights, religious freedom and labor standards in China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its long-simmering tensions with Taiwan, Beijing heeded
private warnings from administration officials to avoid any
diplomatic or military provocations that could fuel opposition to
the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, the trade bill never became a political
football, in large part because pro-trade Republicans were loath to
antagonize their corporate benefactors, especially in a hotly
contested election year, and labor leaders never believed they
could win enough Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
bluntly warned of retribution against senators who imperiled the
trade bill by supporting an amendment sponsored by Sens. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this vote get tangled up in the politics of nuclear
proliferation and other amendments to the extent that it might not
be passed, I think that would have a very serious political
implication for those who were a party to that action,'' Donohue
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the House, where the trade bill survived intense
opposition from a coalition of labor and religious groups, final
passage in the Senate was never in doubt, only the course to get
there. Supporters of the legislation pressed for an amendment-free
bill because they said there was not enough time this fall, before
the elections in November, to reconcile an amended Senate bill with
the version the House passed in May.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, amendments to improve human rights, religious
freedom and labor standards in China fell by lopsided votes, not
because senators opposed them on merit but because of their
potential harm to the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment sponsored by Thompson and Torricelli to
penalize Chinese companies that trafficked in nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles struck a strong chord
with lawmakers who have grown increasingly alarmed by intelligence
reports of Chinese arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the president was required to conduct an
annual review of China's proliferation activities. If Chinese
companies were trafficking in the prohibited weaponry, Clinton
could have cut off sensitive technology exports and U.S. government
loans or credits to violators. The president could waive sanctions
if it was in the country's national security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the United States bought $82 billion worth of
Chinese-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of
what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second-largest,
was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement would open China's vast commercial
market to U.S. businesses. In turn, backers argued, greater trade
would help open the way for democratic values to take hold in
China.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents criticized the measure as one that would undercut
America's moral authority in the world, and reward a government
that sold sophisticated weaponry to America's enemies, threatened
its neighbors and persecuted its own people for their religious
beliefs.

CONVENTION CELEBRATES CULT MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past decade, a fun-filled maverick magazine called Cult
Movies has chronicled the growing popularity of quirky,
off-the-wall film classics.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of its 10th anniversary, the magazine is sponsoring
``Cult Movies Convention 2000'' on the weekend of Oct. 20-22 in
Hollywood. Expected guests range from science-fiction luminaries
Ray Bradbury and Forrest J. Ackerman to pop-culture icons Rob
Zombie and Vampira.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the magazine is to write about any films that are
not mainstream _ classic, foreign, underground films, horror
genre,'' said Michael Copner, the magazine's editor and publisher.
``We actually started as a one-shot on Bela Lugosi and grew to
include any and all kinds of films except for the new mainstream
films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely not just an autograph show, although there
will be many celebrities available to meet and sign autographs,''
said Coco Olson, the magazine's creative consultant. ``We will have
what I believe is an outstanding and unusual film program where we
will be running films and then have Q-and-A's with the stars and or
directors/writers involved with the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Other guests include B-movie stars John Agar (``The Brain from
Planet Arous''), Turhan Bey (``The Mummy's Hand''), Mark Forest
(``Goliath and the Dragon''), Robert Quarry (``Count Yorga,
Vampire'') and William Marshall (``Blacula''), directors Curtis
Harrington (``Games''), Joe Dante (``Gremlins'') and Jack Hill
(``Spider Baby''), actresses Karen Black (``Trilogy of Terror''),
Joanna Cassidy (``Blade Runner'') and Yvette Vickers (``Attack of
the 50-Foot Woman'') and the women in Ed Wood's life, Dolores
Fuller and Kathy Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are friends of the magazine who really don't do shows,
but have agreed to come to our convention because it is different
than other shows,'' Copner said. ``We are fortunate enough to be in
Hollywood, where many of the great cult-movies actors, actresses
and writers still live and work. It will be a reunion for many.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights will include a screening of Fritz Lang's silent
classic ``Metropolis,'' a 118th birthday tribute to ``Dracula''
star Lugosi, a star-studded awards show and much more.
</P>
<P>
   For details, check the magazine's Web site at
www.cult-movies.com or call the convention hotline at (310)
324-3106.

`THE GODS OF TIMES SQUARE': ECCENTRIC RELIGION IN MIDTOWN
MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Times Square of legend takes a last loopy bow in Richard
Sandler's engaging documentary ``The Gods of Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   In its foreground a study of urban theology as it examines the
relationship of man and God in Midtown Manhattan, Sandler's film
has as its background the earth movers and cranes that transformed
the seedy Times Square of yesteryear into the Disneyfied magnet for
tourists and families of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``The Gods of Times Square'' is a
good-humored, tolerant celebration of New York City's diversity and
eccentricity and of its incubation of sidewalk philosophers, like
the homeless man who discusses Einstein and atoms while the camera
seeks out a flashing sign that illustrates the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   In this Times Square, street musicians play drums, violins,
saxophones and clarinets; men dance; beggars shake cups; people
sleep on sidewalks and in subway passageways; and enormous
billboards of half-clad underwear models loom over the teeming
sidewalks like the grotesque symbolic eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's
sign in ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for religion in Times Square, Sandler examines the
angry black Jews who rail against the white man and call for the
lynching of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   He encounters, among many others, the Jews for Jesus; James, the
mystical, bearded old black man in his Panama hat and clerical
collar who gives enigmatic answers to questions about religion; the
Lubavitchers, waiting for the Messiah and driving the big van they
call their Mitzvah Tank; and Jim, the 32-year-old man who
eventually lays claim to being the second coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Before revealing this identity, Jim, speaking in 1993, makes a
few predictions for Jesus in the coming year. ``Starting 1994, he's
going to do rock, music, marry Madonna, going to be the biggest
rock star that ever existed, get into international affairs,'' Jim
says. Jesus' album is going to go triple platinum. ``I've heard his
demo,'' Jim declares. And, he adds, ``He's not against smoking, by
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Muslim raps about Allah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is it,'' says a woman. ``All these other phony baloney
gods, they're worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   An 82-year-old man talks about knowing Jesus. ``I just know
God,'' he says. ``That's my hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon the construction cranes loom against the sky, and the
family that owned the little hot dog stand nestled among the old
movie theaters west of Seventh Avenue on the north side of 42nd
Street gathers for a tearful farewell to the old Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mickey Mouse. Enter Dopey.

ON PARENTING AND ROLLERBLADES

<TEXT>
<P>
   I try to be a good parent.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest son assures me that I'm the best mom he's ever had.
Of course, I'm the only mom he's ever had, but I don't let that
steal my joy.
</P>
<P>
   However, being a good parent, to me, does not mean that I will
buy everything his little heart desires in order to assure his
unfailing devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, major presents for him are related to some
special occasion, like his birthday or Christmas or a straight-A
report card. (We haven't bought any straight-A gifts in a while but
I'm sure we would if the occasion arose.)
</P>
<P>
   So the other day when he requested a new pair of rollerblades
right in the middle of the week, for no particular reason, I said,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you have rollerblades,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're 2 years old,'' he said, ``I can't wear them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's a good reason,'' I agreed. ``Put them in my car
so I can sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you buy me new rollerblades with the money?'' ``No. I'm
going to use the money to help pay our electric bill.''
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, he gave me his special, puppy dog,
if-you-really-loved-me look and a great, big hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Mommy'' he added for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   He skulked away with his special,
if-only-there-was-a-picture-of-you-on-my-dartboard expression.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he called me at work and said, ``Mom, isn't it
your payday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on how many checks arrive in the mail today,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Son, it's my payday but you still can't have any skates.
If you make straight A's on your six-weeks report card, you can get
skates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want skates; I want rollerblades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want a straight-A report card. Life is cruel, Son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want these things so badly?'' I finally thought to
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing roller hockey with the guys and it's not
really roller hockey if you're not rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   I sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how have you been playing without rollerblades?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just run along beside the other boys. They all have
rollerblades. I used to take my shoes off because I could slide
better in my socks, but Joel's mom was worried that someone might
run over my toes and break them.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh geez. Now we've got other mothers involved in my financial
problems. Visions of my son's little tread-marked feet and
fractured toes danced in my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, are you there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm still on the line. Does your brother want skates,
too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he says roller-blading sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we weren't going to use that word anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I'm talking about a baby with a bottle? But OK. Joel's
mom says her nephew might have some old rollerblades that I can
wear. She's gonna check.''
</P>
<P>
   I surrender.''Son, we'll go to the toy store when I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Mom, that's great! I can't wait to tell the guys that I'm
getting new skates. Come straight home from work. The toy store
might be closing early.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Son.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see his face but I already know how he looks when
he's really happy. And yes, I also know that I'm a suck-er.

PHOTO EXHIBIT IN DALLAS TRAVELS TO SACRED SITES OF MEXICO AND
BEYOND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By SANDY GUERRA-CLINE 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ This year at the State Fair of Texas, count on the
usual crush of people, vendors and carnival rides. But inside Fair
Park's elegant Hall of State, look for the cathedral, a spiritual
oasis you can enter in body and mind.
</P>
<P>
   Using photographs as big as murals, an exhibit, ``Sacred Space:
Man and the Divine in Mexico, Central America and the Southwestern
United States,'' brings to this year's fair another world that's a
far cry from the Midway's bustle. It's a world filled with sacred
sites, natural and man-made, ancient and modern. First, you wind
past photographs of looming Mayan temples and tiny Spanish missions
dwarfed by mountain peaks, then your pilgrimage ends inside a
European-style cathedral built of photographs and scaffolding;
you'll look up into golden images of its vaulted ceilings, examine
in detail gilt angels, carvings and altar offerings. It's as if
you're actually there.
</P>
<P>
   The images belong to Dallas photographer Carolyn Brown, who
spent the past 10 years traveling to big cities and remote villages
in Mexico, Central America and the American Southwest. The
exhibit's 200 photographs _ all of them digitally enlarged, and
some of them spliced together to form images more than 27 feet wide
_ were selected from 3,000 photographs taken by Brown with
Hasselblad and Fuji Panoramic cameras mounted on a tripod.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the '90s, Brown and Elisabet Bordt, the director of
the project who served as Brown's translator and facilitator, made
trips to points south once or twice a year, sometimes flying down
and renting cars, sometimes in Brown's little Subaru station wagon
``so I could take all the gear I wanted,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Their trips took them into the crowded streets of some of the
world's largest capital cities and down ``little roads where we
were the only car in the whole place. Lots of donkeys, though,''
Brown says. She was careful to photograph some interiors using only
natural light; Bordt smoothed the way with uneasy clergy and
village elders, leaving donations for candles used and asking for
directions to the next site.
</P>
<P>
   At times, she got confusing ones. ``But sometimes the wrong
place produced beautiful photography,'' Bordt says. ``Not
everything was planned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Brown, who began her career photographing
ancient Egyptian architecture, captured startling images of holy
places: a makeshift shrine in a Guatemalan cave; village churches
decorated with vivid cut-paper decorations for saints' feast days;
collages of candles and marigolds; a view of Santa Theresa, a
Spanish church built atop the largest pyramid in the world. (In
Brown's photograph, the church looks like an exquisite miniature
backed by the giant sweep of a smoldering volcano, Popocatepetl, in
the central Mexican state of Puebla. In the voice of experience
Brown says, ``Puebla has some of the most interesting churches in
all of Mexico.'')
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibit's largest images captures the interior of the
Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City, scaffolding rising up its
sides. It inspired Dallas architect Gary M. Cunningham to design
the exhibit's unique installation using Mexican-made aluminum
scaffolding. The entire exhibit is free-standing, protecting the
Hall of State's beautiful murals and providing a powerful visual
echo between hall and exhibit. It also delivers an amusing
juxtaposition of beautiful images and low-tech nuts and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can take a free audio tour of ``Sacred Space'' that
includes ancient music resurrected and recorded by the San Antonio
Vocal Arts Ensemble. The tour will be offered in English and
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit's curator, Richard R. Brettell, knows the exhibit
will offer a dramatic contrast to the State Fair of Texas when the
fair opens Sept. 29. ``Sacred Space,'' with its thoughtful
examination of the spiritual practices in Latin America, is a far
cry from Big Tex, clowns and turkey legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibit takes something very mystical and unknown, and
makes it seem much more accessible,'' Brettell says. ``In the minds
of so many Texans, Mexico is beaches, just beaches. So hopefully,
it will make them get on planes and go ...''
</P>
<P>
   Near the exhibit's exit, Brown's photograph of the Church of San
Pablo in Cholula, Puebla, will remind the visitor that he or she is
about to re-enter the outside whirl. In it, a traveling fair _ its
tiny Ferris wheel no match for the State Fair's 20-story Texas Star
_ has been erected on the church grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacred Space: Man and the Divine in Mexico, Central America
and the Southwestern United States'' is presented by the Institute
for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University in
collaboration with the Dallas Historical Society, which operates
the Hall of State; the Dallas Museum of Natural History and the
Mexican Institute for International Cooperation.

   UPS-FEDEX _ ATLANTA _ UPS and FedEx have become increasingly
similar in recent years - but their approach to technology provides
a clear point of departure. UPS uses its technology to funnel more
packages through its existing transportation network. But FedEx is
expanding its reach by forming alliances with other carriers and
using technology to bind disparate transportation networks
together. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 24.

   FEDEX-MAILBOX _ ATLANTA _ The most valuable things that FedEx
hopes to gain from its proposed partnership with the U.S. Postal

   FORTUNE-FORUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ There could be two protest
groups at the upcoming Fortune 500 Forum: One for people who have a
bone to pick with ``global corporatism'' and another for the local
business people who aren't invited to the Forum. The Fortune Forum,
organized by the prestigious magazine, is sure to bring out green
envy in some Austinites during the three-day visit of the
Fortunates beginning Oct. 7. Would- be party crashers be advised
that participants are limited to executives of companies with
assets or annual gross sales in excess of $500 million. There are a
few exceptions to the rule, however. In addition to the 150 CEOs,
the mayor, local sponsors of the event and 100 other academic,
business and political leaders also are invited. The private event
is another sign that it's not your same ol' Austin. (smith, Austin

   OLY-ADVANCE _ Is this the ultimate confrontation between new
media and old? Olympic fans can go to a host of official, sports
and other sites to get real time results (not video) of Olympic
events. Why wait 15 hours to find out who grabbed the gold when it
is a key stroke away? Nielsen/Net Ratings reports a surge in
Olympic hits; is one of those hits on conventional coverage? NBC
sold more than $900 million in advertising by telling customers
primetime ratings would average 16.1 percent. After three days, the
numbers are at 14.5 percent and dropping. Ad buyers, industry
analysts and others react to the Down Under (Projection) Games,
what they mean today and what could happen in coming games. (Staff,

   OLY-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY _ Five days into the Games, everyone just
can't stop gushing about Sydney_ about much better this Olympics is
than the one in Atlanta. From transportation and atmosphere to
venues and weather, the Sydney Games seem to beat the Atlanta Games
hands down. We take a look at how Sydney managed to avoid the chaos
and crass commercialism of Atlanta and run what has been a
successful _ but costly _ Olympics. (Unger/Brock, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-STYLE _ SYDNEY _ What is the style of the Sydney Games? The
look. The flavor. The color. The scene. What are the hot selling

Atlanta. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 25. WITH PHOTOS.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-HUMMER _ SYDNEY _ The Aussie-American swimming rivalry has
to be the best rivalry in the Olympics. Thrilling races,
trash-talking swimmers, jam-packed arena of fans going nuts with
every race. Ian Thorpe gave the Aussies the upper hand with two
gold medals on the first day; the Amercan came back with two huge
wins the second day. The battle continues back-and-forth every
night at the Sydney International Aquatic Center. (Hummer, Atlanta

<P>
   OLY-SWIM-HALL _ SYDNEY_ After breezing through a men's 100 meter
freestyle preliminary Gary Hall Jr. joked, ``It's a lot easier when
you pace yourself. Somebody should have told me that.'' Hall was
referring to the race that still resonates here, the men's 4x100
meter freestyle relay. There, he hit the wall before he touched it.
Americans aren't used to seeing Hall reeled in from behind the way
Australia's boy wonder Ian Thorpe did in that race. Not only the
relay squad, but the entire U.S. team was stunned and shaken.
(Maher, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED.

(Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BELA _ SYDNEY _ Not even Bela Karolyi can guarantee a medal,
it seems, but USA Gymnastics was right to give it a shot by signing
him on late in the Olympic spin cycle as national team coordinator.
Without him there is no focal point on a determined squad of
American girls who nonetheless had fourth place written all over
them in Tuesday night's team final. Without him there is no fuss,
no reason to look behind the scores and find the passion. Bela
didn't even get to stand on the floor of the Sydney Superdome, an
area reserved for coaches only, and still he burned as much energy
as any of the athletes who performed there. (George, Palm Beach

<P>
   OLY-ARMSTRONG _ SYDNEY _ Lance Armstrong is the two-time
defending champion of the grueling Tour de France, professional
cycling's premier event. The Olympic competition here is a ride in
the park by comparison. Yet, the Olympics also have meaning for
Armstrong, who did not medal in two previous Games. (Maher, Austin

   SYDNEY STYLE _ The official ``look'' of these Games may not be a
total splash. But it's safe to say the beach is back. This city is
awash in a sea of purple-blue and turquoise that's very visible.
The Sydney 2000 design team has put its wavy stamp on everything
from sports venues and staff uniforms to the paper coffee cups and
quilt comforters used in the athletes' village. (Brock, Atlanta

   ANALYSIS _ How could Atlanta get it so wrong and Sydney get it
so right? As Australia pulls off an Olympic feat that ranks among
the smoothest in modern memory, that's the question everyone here
is asking. From the beauty of the city to the convenient location
of venues, just about everything about these Games is being
praised. Much of the chaos and commercialism of Atlanta is missing.

   TV RATINGS _ The prime-time ratings for NBC's coverage of Sydney
Games are staggering out of the starting blocks with a three-day
average of 14.5, down 32 percent from the 1996 Games in Atlanta and
10 percent from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, site of the last
offshore Summer Olympics. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

who did not medal in two previous Games. (Maher, Austin

EATING AUSTRALIAN FROM THE COMFORT OF HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between carrying on about Ian Thorpe, the young swimmer with
feet almost as big as a kangaroo's, and marveling at Sydney's
magnificent harbor and opera house, the writers and broadcasters
covering the Olympic Games have somehow found time to rave about
the food and wine they have discovered in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   About that, at least, they do not exaggerate. Only a generation
or two ago, a can of Foster's and a few shrimp on the barbie
defined the epicurean horizons of most people down under, but no
more. Sydney has become one of the world's great restaurant towns,
Australian cuisine is a topic of global interest instead of an
oxymoron and Australian wine has long since outgrown the Monty
Python troupe's taunts about Perth pink and Nuits-St.-Wagga-Wagga.
</P>
<P>
   But to most Americans, it's all hearsay, as remote as dinner on
Mars. Even in the jet age, Australia is many hours and thousands of
dollars away, which makes a clutch of new and nearly new Australian
cookbooks all the more welcome as guidebooks for the armchair
gastronomic traveler. Their publication reflects the world's
growing fascination with the culinary scene on the smallest
continent, and a couple of them, one in particular, are just as
useful at a stove as in an armchair.
</P>
<P>
   What, you may well ask, is Australian cuisine? Tough question.
Some cuisines can be defined by the starches on which they rely _
rice in China, for example, pasta in southern Italy and potatoes in
northern Europe. Or the cooking fat they use _ olive oil in the
Mediterranean, lard in central Europe and butter in northern
France. But Australians, like Americans, use a little of this and a
little of that.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, of course, is that modern Australian cooking, like
modern American cooking, is New World cooking, evolved not from
generations of peasant tradition but from the application of Old
World techniques to local ingredients by gifted chefs. It reflects
``cosmopolitan influences from everywhere,'' in the words of
Australia's top purveyor of fancy groceries, Simon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Until the relatively recent (and by no means universally
successful) vogue for fusion cooking in the United States, French
and Italian and Chinese and Japanese and Lebanese and Afghan food
have kept mostly to themselves in this country, often modified to
meet local tastes but seldom mixed. In Australia, synthesis is the
norm. Chefs shamelessly plunder ideas and ingredients from the
whole wide world.
</P>
<P>
   As Alan Saunders writes in ``Australian Food'' (Ten Speed Press,
1999), the taste of Australia is ``the flavor of change, adaptation
and, in the very best sense of the word, compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Janni Kyritsis, the chef at MG Garage in Sydney, who is one
of the luminaries featured in Saunders' book. Greek-born, he cooks
red mullet coated with gremolata bread crumbs. Greek enough. But he
adds a Sicilian dimension by stuffing the fish with a mixture
including currants and pine nuts. Or Stefano Manfredi, who runs Bel
Mondo, in my view Australia's best Italian restaurant. He serves
pasta, to be sure, but he is as likely to serve it with un-Italian
things like abalone and shiitakes as with tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The unsung hero of the Australian gastronomic explosion is Gough
Whitlam, the former prime minister, who in the 1970s began
encouraging immigration by Asians. Today, if Australia is not quite
an Asian country, Asia influences what Australia eats to a degree
unknown elsewhere in the Western world _ in superb Asian
establishments like Gilbert Lau's Flower Drum in Melbourne,
possibly the best Cantonese restaurant anywhere, but in Western
restaurants, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cheong Liew, who cooks at the Grange, the dining room of the
Adelaide Hilton, was born of a Chinese family in Malaysia, which
perhaps gave him a head start in melding different culinary
traditions. So did his apprenticeship. He worked in Greek, Indian,
Southeast Asian, French and Chinese kitchens, and his own
restaurant was the first one anywhere, to the best of my knowledge,
to perfect a fusion style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can cook a dish the traditional way,'' Liew has said, ``but
I like to put in an element from somewhere else in the globe to
remind people of their own culture. There is a cultural freedom in
Australia that accepts this.''
</P>
<P>
   Multicultural cooking works only if it tastes good, and it
tastes good only if a discriminating sensibility is at work.
Believe me, Liew's dishes, like his red snapper, red-roasted in
Chinese fashion, with a green Southeast Asian jus of coriander,
spring onions and chilies, served with a French-inspired leek
fondue, never cross the very narrow line that divides fusion from
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Tetsuya Wakuda, the Japanese-born chef whom many have tried to
lure to the United States, produces food Faberge _ fillets of a
perchlike fish known as barramundi, for example, served with
peaches, endive, truffle oil and wakame seaweed. (Think Charlie
Trotter crossed with Nobu Matsuhisa.) You will find the recipe in
Saunders' book, lacking, alas, any suggestions as to what North
American fish might work in case your neighborhood supermarket has
run out of barramundi. Wakuda's forthcoming book, I am told, will
be available here soon.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the chefs who have shaped modern Australian cooking
are immigrants. Christine Manfield ranges the world for inspiration
for her book, ``Spice'' (Viking, 1999), and for her restaurant,
Paramount, in the prosperous Sydney suburb of Potts Point. But she
is Australian born and bred, and she proves it with a vertical
fantasy consisting (reading from south to north) of a disk of nori
omelet, a potato pancake sparked with wasabi, strips of
quick-seared kangaroo, horseradish cream and a liberal dusting of
chives. (Yes, they sometimes eat kangaroo; no, it's not a staple.
Rather more like buffalo here _ lean, healthy, tasty, favored by
the cognoscenti rather than hoi polloi.)
</P>
<P>
   Like California, Australia benefits from its climate. It is
blessed with tropical and temperate fruits in profusion. It grows
vegetables of all kinds, Asian as well as European in origin. Its
relatively unpolluted seas, with a wide range of temperatures, are
equally bountiful; more than 200 kinds of fish and 90 kinds of
mollusks and crustaceans are commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are exotic looking, like Coffin Bay scallops, with
purple shells and magenta roe. Some sound more exotic than they
are. When an Australian recipe calls for ``bugs,'' don't reach for
the ants; what's wanted instead are flattish crustaceans, found
only off Australia, called either Balmain bugs (Ibacus peronii) or
Moreton Bay bugs (Thenus orientalis). Both resemble the European
squat lobster.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The abundance of prime ingredients encourages many cooks to opt
for simplicity. One of the best at this game is a young New
Zealander, Philip Johnson, who for the last five years has run a
bistro called Ecco in Brisbane, in sub-tropical Queensland. His
cookbook, also ``Ecco'' (Random House Australia, 1999), is filled
with straightforward but tempting dishes like slow-cooked duck with
red cabbage, bacon and hazelnuts, and fillet of beef with parsnips,
baby leeks and tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you like to try grilled quail with wet polenta and
asparagus sometime soon? Dishes like that _ ``lovingly crafted,
basic but perfectly cooked food,'' in the magazine's words _ won
Johnson the 1997 Restaurant of the Year award given by The
Australian Gourmet Traveller, one of the country's top food
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But you needn't be a celebrated chef to play in this league. The
other night, with only a scant hour and a half to make dinner for
myself; my wife, Betsey; and four guests, my eye fell upon ``New
Food Fast'' (Whitecap Books, 1999) by Donna Hay, an overachieving
30-year-old food writer with two best-sellers already to her
credit. It offers sections headed ``10 Minutes (or So),'' ``20
Minutes'' and ``30 Minutes'' _ and I found the timings accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Something light, Betsey said. Mussels poached in a quick broth
flavored with ginger and lemon grass, to which I added a chopped
hot pepper and a bit of garlic, got us underway. Then came scallops
of swordfish sauteed with sage leaves and a shower of grated lemon
rind, with a side of very slowly roasted tomatoes with basil,
served lukewarm, and kadota figs in vanilla and white port sauce.
</P>
<P>
   My jury approved, and it gave the blue ribbon to the swordfish.
Cutting the fish steaks in half horizontally and cooking them in
olive oil for a minute on each side produced something much moister
and subtler in flavor than grilling the slabs whole over coals.
</P>
<P>
   Had I been feeling more ambitious, I admit, I would have tried
something dreamed up by Neil Perry, my favorite Australian chef _
maybe his passion-fruit custard tart or, if I had been feeling
truly foolhardy, his king prawn cake and scallops with spicy prawn
sauce, a little number with a mere 48 ingredients, many of them
Asian (galangal, turmeric, kaffir lime, palm sugar, coconut cream,
coriander roots, lemon grass). A slight, ebullient, ponytailed man,
he is every bit as fastidious about his raw materials as he is
about technique.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I would have jumped on a plane for Sydney and headed
for one of Perry's restaurants, either Rockpool, which is formal,
or Wockpool, which is more casual and more overtly Asian. Maybe I'd
have ordered his aged rump steak, cut two inches thick, rare
inside, a crisp smoky crust on the outside, a chunk of anchovy
butter on top, plus a bottle or two of Penfolds Grange shiraz to
wash it all down. With food and drink like that, who needs a ticket
for the Olympics? &QL;

SOLVING THE PUZZLES OF CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Howard Holley is general manager pf Xerox China Ltd.; this was
written with Craig S. Smith) 
 By HOWARD HOLLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember looking at my wife asleep on the plane on my way to
Shanghai, China, two years ago and thinking, ``This woman must
really love me to give up her job, her friends and her lifestyle to
move to China with me!''
</P>
<P>
   But this has turned out to be the best life experience that we
have had. And unless we are truly blessed, it will be the best we
will ever have.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, there's a huge gap between what you expect and what
is.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Shanghai consistently exceeds expectations. When
you first see the city and its impressive skyline, many people
expect it to be like Western cities, but that isn't true. Instead,
it's a city of dichotomies _ the extremes of China all rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   As a general manager, I find the biggest gap has been between
what I can actually accomplish here versus what I was used to
accomplishing in the States with the same or fewer resources. We
wanted to expand to a new building, and it took forever to get a
license to allow us to move. I thought I could hire additional
staff in four weeks, and it actually took eight to 12 weeks. If
you're looking for a software engineer or a technical person,
that's not difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   But, for example, someone who can be a consultant to a customer?
</P>
<P>
   Service is still a new concept in China. Like ordering a
Tanqueray Gibson on the rocks and getting it. If I order it in 100
different places in Shanghai, I'd probably get it about three
times. If I order it in Hong Kong, they ask me if I want it up or
on the rocks, and I'm like ``All right!''
</P>
<P>
   Americans often ask me what it's like living in China as an
African-American. The type of comments I hear are that Chairman Mao
had a ``strong affection'' for the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Well, once somebody used the term ``gueilo'' when referring to
me. That's a Cantonese word for foreigner that literally means
``ghost,'' and I looked at him and said, ``Are you sure that
applies?''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact here in China is if you're not Chinese, you're a
foreigner, a gueilo, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the curiosity factor. In Beijing, for example,
there are a lot of tourists from other parts of China. Their heads
will turn, they'll stare, and their kids will ask me if I know
Michael Jordan. (Of course, I say yes!) Once, some people person
came up to me with their camera pushed forward. I thought they
wanted me to take a picture of them. Instead, they wanted to have a
picture taken with me. (Maybe I am Michael!)
</P>
<P>
   I have been told that I am the only African-American general
manager in China. That may be true, but what's different here is
while I'm still a member of a minority, it's a different minority
group. I'm not so much an African-American, but a foreigner. Unique
to being an ex-pat, there's a closeness among people from different
countries and cultures who are ex-pats here. There are fewer
barriers between groups: everybody's basically a gueilo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what will I remember the most? I'd have to say first,
it's the warmth of the people, my work associates' openness, and
the ex-pat friends we have made whom we will likely never see
again.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's the pace of change. In the major cities _ Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou _ it is incomprehensible. I find it exhilarating
to live somewhere that is growing and changing this fast and has so
much opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to tell you there is massive competition between
cities. If you're up in Beijing, they ask you if you like Beijing
best; in Shanghai or Guangzhou they ask the same question. That's
such a great attitude, but they always pressure me about which city
I like best.
</P>
<P>
   I say, ``I can't tell you what city I like best but I have got
to tell you, I really like China.''
</P>
<P>
   And they respond, ``That's a really good answer.''

MY JOB THE ENGLISH SPOKESMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Bryce Belcher is the official town interpreter for Cesky Krumlov
in the Czech Republic; this was written with Bobbi P. Markowitz)

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm the official interpreter, translator and all-around
spokesman to the English-speaking world for the medieval Czech town
of Cesky Krumlov.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like an odd job for an American who came to Prague
as a college student in the summer of 1990 and supported himself by
playing the guitar on the Charles Bridge. The country had just
ousted the communists, and I played music that had been forbidden
until then _ the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, and
Peter, Paul and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   I came back two years later and met my future wife, Lenka, a
Czech native, on the same bridge where I used to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Prague had been discovered by tourists and had
become too crowded for us, so we moved to Cesky Krumlov. At first,
I taught English, but I wanted to be more independent. So I started
making myself known among the locals as an American who speaks
Czech and has a business license, a computer and permanent
residence in this country. Everyone more or less jumped on me to
represent the town to welcome visitors. Within the span of a year,
I became the official interpreter for the town and its famous
12th-century castle and chateau, once home to the kings of Bohemia.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, when Jennone Walker was the American
ambassador to the Czech Republic, she often came to town
unannounced, just to poke around. Once, she called Pavel Slavko,
the castle director, and asked if she could come down that Saturday
morning to tour it with a friend. Slavko asked me to show up at 10
a.m. and act as interpreter. But at 9:15 a.m. on the appointed day,
I received a frantic call from him: Get over here now! It turned
out that the friend was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, I'm racing up the castle drive when I see
four large black cars passing me in the opposite direction. Oh God,
I think, she's here already. I sprint to the director's office,
where I find her chatting with Slavko _ in fluent Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody fetches a large plastic cola bottle from the fridge. It
is filled with cold water, or so we think. But when we take our
first sips, we realize it is actually Slivovitz, a kind of fiery
plum brandy. One by one, the glasses are set back down on the
table, still full. Another container and more glasses arrive. This
time it really is water.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the visitors to the castle, it's a completely new
environment, and they are careful about where they step and what
they touch. Occasionally, we take nobility on tour, and they take
liberties, like moving ropes, stepping onto blocked-off areas,
pawing furniture: ``Oh, is this real? We have something like this
in our castle,'' they might say.
</P>
<P>
   Once Britain's Prince Charles came to visit the castle, and we
took him through the interiors of the 19th-century Schwarzenberg
suites. He was listening to the interpretation, not really reacting
or looking too impressed except at a small chapel, a 6-by-6-foot
chamber. He stepped forward to take a closer look but didn't notice
the glass panel separating the room.
</P>
<P>
   After bashing his nose on the glass, he promptly proceeded to
bleed. It may have been blue blood, but it was definitely red by
the time it hit the floor. We all whipped out our handkerchiefs,
then remembered protocol (I can't offer this thing to him, he's a
prince!) and quickly stuffed them back in our pockets. After
finding a clean handkerchief, the bleeding finally stopped and the
visit of the rooms continued. But on this very glass, folks ...

<P>
   SOFTBALL _ The United States may have lost to Japan, ending a
112-game winning streak, but is still in the running for the gold
medal. Dot Richardson, who made two errors Monday night, will try
to help begin another winning streak Wednesday against China.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL _ The American women face Russia, a fierce rival that
Sheryl Swoopes calls ``very physical and very dirty.'' Both teams
are undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING _ There's talent in every lane of the men's 100-meter
freestyle, but can anyone catch Pieter van den Hoogenband, who
smashed the world record in Tuesday's semifinals? He says he wasn't
even going all-out. The challengers include the previous
record-holder, Michael Klim of Australia; Gary Hall Jr. of Phoenix;
and Aleksandr Popov, the Russian Rocket, who won in '92 and '96.
Wednesday's U.S. vs. Australia event is the women's 800 meter
freestyle relay, in which Jenny Thompson will go for a seventh
career gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   CYCLING _ Four years ago in Atlanta, Marty Nothstein of
Trexlertown, Pa., came agonizingly close to a gold medal, losing in
a photo finish to Jens Fieldler of Germany. On Wednesday, the two
will have a rematch in the men's sprint semifinal. The final will
be later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   VOLLEYBALL _ The U.S. women are off to terrific start, having
beaten China and Kenya. A victory Wednesday against Croatia would
further improve their medal hopes.

 &HT;    PASSAGE OF CHINA TRADE BILL IS KEY TO CLINTON'S GLOBAL TRADE
POLICY
 &HT;    850&AMP;add. With CHINA-VOTE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In pressing legislators to approve sweeping changes
in the terms of U.S.-China trade, President Clinton tacked into the
winds of several key Democratic constituencies for the first time
since he convinced a reluctant Congress to pass the NAFTA accord
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bookends of his global trade policy, both the North American
Free Trade Agreement and the China trade bill the Senate passed
Tuesday in an 83-15 vote, rest on two contentions near the core of
Clinton's foreign and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the enormous economic heft of the United
States can be used to help promote political, economic and social
reforms in some of the most harshly repressive states in the world
_ China among them _ more effectively as a carrot than as a stick.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that in an age of unprecedented globalization, the
United States has little choice but to wed its own economy to those
of some of the world's poorest but most rapidly developing
countries _ even those that, like Mexico, are very different from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no alternative,'' Clinton told a group of religious
leaders at a White House prayer breakfast last week. ``It's not
like we're all going to go back to huts and quit talking to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Those beliefs have set Clinton at odds with a range of groups,
from organized labor and human rights advocates to
environmentalists and even opponents of weapons proliferation, that
are traditional mainstays of the Democratic party. They argue that
while globalization may be inevitable, the terms of U.S.
integration with the rest of the world can be tailored to support
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   These groups have expressed concern over the loss of American
jobs to low-cost competitors overseas, for example. And they have
sought to use access to the American market, the world's largest,
as a lever for imposing change on U.S. trading partners,
particularly large ones like Mexico and China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach, embodied in both NAFTA and the bill to grant
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China, has been to
decouple those sorts of issues from U.S. trade relations, which the
president has sought to make as open as possible with a broad
variety of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Those policies have undergirded a more than doubling of U.S.
trade on Clinton's watch, turning America's global commerce into a
$2.4 trillion juggernaut. That two-way trade accounts for tens of
millions of American jobs, hundreds of billions in annual profits
and has been a central pillar of the country's record-breaking
economic expansion, now in its tenth year.
</P>
<P>
   The gains have come, as was widely predicted, at a high price
for millions of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   In industries ranging from textiles to typewriters, some
American workers and unions have watched in grim desperation as
corporations downsized or closed factories that had once provided
lifetime jobs with solid pensions. This occurred even as the
companies built new plants abroad employing low-cost foreign labor
to produce these products for shipment to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that even as U.S. exports are on track to top $1
trillion this year for the first time ever, surging 123 percent
since Clinton took office, imports are rising even faster.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department projects Americans will purchase nearly
$1.4 trillion worth of imported automobiles, clothing, computers
and other goods this year. That's a 141-percent increase over the
1993 level of $581 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That lopsided arrangement means that the U.S. trade deficit _
the difference between what this country sells abroad and what it
imports _ is headed for a record $355 billion this year. That is
boosted in no small part by a $75 billion trade deficit with China,
second only to the $80-billion trade gap the United States will
have this year with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The total U.S. trade gap is triple the $115.6 billion deficit in
1993, the year Clinton took office and won congressional approval
for NAFTA, which wedded the economies of the United States, Mexico
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since NAFTA, they've eliminated 30,700 working families in my
little state of South Carolina, and over 500,000 across the
country,'' Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., thundered during Senate
debate Tuesday over the China trade bill. ``When are we going to
sober up and get a competitive trade policy?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that both NAFTA and the China trade bill are
steps in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   The president contends that by forcing China and Mexico _ two
countries that are poor but are also growing rapidly and building a
large middle class _ to open their markets to U.S. exports, these
trade agreements and others like them are widening the global
market for American farm and factory products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we open markets abroad to U.S. goods, we open
opportunities at home,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House
just after the Senate vote Tuesday. ``China will open its markets
to American products, from wheat to cars to consulting services.
And we will be far more able to sell goods in China without moving
our factories there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the economic debate over globalization remains open, so does
the question of whether U.S. engagement with sordid regimes helps
or hurts the causes of freedom and reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of China, human rights monitors insist that
Beijing's repression has worsened, not slackened, in the decade
since Chinese troops cut down hundreds on unarmed democracy
advocates near Tiananmen Square in June of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the case, the Chinese government just last week
jailed two Catholic priests _ Zeng Jingmu, 81, and Ye Gong Feng,
82, who was tortured _ in Beijing's continuing campaign of
intolerance against religious groups not authorized by the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of the (China trade) vote is particularly
unfortunate, just as human rights conditions are worsening,'' Mike
Jendrzejezyk (CQ), Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said
Tuesday in a statement. ``Beijing is closing down all channels of
political dissent _ including on the Internet - even while it's
opening up its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressing for improvements, though, is not to cut off
trade with China, he testified last spring before the House
Committee on International Relations, but instead to twin growing
trade with separate policies aimed at promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broader trade with China can be consistent with advancing
human rights,'' Jendrzejezyk testified, ``but only if it is
combined with effective, sustained pressure on China to respect
basic civil and political rights.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conceptually, Sunday in New York resembles a giant
playpen for the infantile ego. It is the one day, especially during
Fashion Week, when all the arty kids come out in their homemade
clothes, and there are not too many old people around to give them
grief. Everyone is creative. Everyone is feeling _ how can one put
it after seeing the Imitation of Christ show amid the rose-colored
solemnity of the Peter Jarema Funeral Home on East Seventh Street?
_ a oneness with Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-aloof Sevigny, sitting front and center, was wearing a
pair of crisp black jeans with high heels and a gray sweatshirt
with the sleeves pushed up to her elbows, and she had on one of
those yachting caps that you'd imagine Aristotle Onassis wearing as
he chased Maria Callas around on the sunny decks.
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny is an actress, but she is also a kind of muse, and the
fact that she is creative director of Imitation of Christ, a line
begun less than a year ago by Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, using
old frocks resurrected from the bins of Goodwill, should cause a
chuckle in fashion's upper regions, where being a creative director
usually means doing more than deciding which old Scaasi to cut up.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, think about it _ think what it means in an era of
celebrity rule and big-brand uniformity to have a garment that is
not only one of a kind (because Goodwill isn't exactly Bergdorf's),
but also approved and possibly even worn by Sevigny herself. Where
else can a person achieve such ... oneness?
</P>
<P>
   So the women's spring 2001 collections have begun with the kids
playing in the corner and the adults, the establishment designers,
doing their best not to take any of this too seriously. And doing
their best to last. That is why people used to get into the fashion
business _ to make money, yes, but also to last, to endure season
after season. If they are lucky, like Diane Von Furstenberg, whose
show on Sunday night combined a knowing sophistication with the
frivolously sexy, they even get a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   Von Furstenberg is not a great designer. Her clothes are simple,
and this season she sent out a lot of clingy tops with side ruching
and dresses in gingham or abstract prints, sometimes with matching
panties. But she is good at doing what great designers do, which is
to exploit a look so that, year by year, it becomes her own.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Pamela Dennis takes seriously the
business of making evening clothes, though her show Monday in the
tents at Bryant Park was so heavy on icy satin and rhinestones that
it was easy to overlook her nonchalant gray cardigan over a slim
low-slung skirt of matte silver sequins with a fraying hem.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, in the adjacent tent, before a crowd that
included the usual social suspects as well as Melanie Griffith and
her husband, Antonio Banderas, Carolina Herrera made everything
look easy. The business of making pretty clothes and filthy lucre
in the commercial atmosphere of Seventh Avenue is no burden for
her. This season, she showed lanky print blouses and spare knits
with culottes and, really, they worked. A chiffon wraparound blouse
in pale blue and brown stripes played over culottes in brown
tattersall checks. Black hot pants appeared with a tight,
off-the-shoulder top in suede, and there were shirt dresses, too,
in chevron charmeuse stripes or in just plain black. Herrera is
fundamentally that most grown-up of designers.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what makes one question the sincerity of designers
like Subkoff and Damhave of Imitation of Christ. It's true that
their things were gorgeous and enchanting, and they are even right
to be a little appalled at the way the fashion business spits out
more and more clothes. But where will their recycled clothes take
them in the end? On the one hand, they want to give people clothes
imbued with individuality and that circumvent the normal production
process. And yet if they haven't worked out the real, practical
concerns of running a fashion house, such as sizing, that
individuality will shackle them. What they'll end up with is a
one-of-a-kind business.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems as if young designers, especially in New
York, work themselves into a cul-de-sac of creativity, and then
can't find their way out. Susan Cianciolo is one designer who has
struggled to put her point of view across, and she has her
followers _ like Dakota Goldhor, a film student at Bard College,
who was helping out at Cianciolo's presentation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I, like, worshiped Susan when I was 15 or 16, and I'd
see her clothes in avant-garde magazines,'' said Goldhor, now 20,
as she demonstrated one of Cianciolo's do-it-yourself fashion kits
for shoes and skirts and so forth. As a pianist played Chopin
hotly, Goldhor explained that the point of the kits, which included
thread and buttons, was to ``encourage people to take charge of
their own appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   A novel idea, even a charming one, but Cianciolo's raw talent
somehow needs to find a wider avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Roi, one of the new designers who presented her collection
in the Moet &AMP; Chandon group show on Sunday, seems to have both
talent and ambition _ and a good eye for what's happening on the
street. Moving away from last season's ladylike pantsuits, she
embraced a kind of cutie-pie look, with flaring minis and chiffon-y
tops that showed the influence of Jeremy Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had not seen Miguel Adrover's first two collections
would probably think that the many blazers, golf shirts and pressed
trousers he showed on Sunday night were an homage to Talbot's.
``That was the most deliciously perverse fashion show I've ever
seen,'' Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Adrover's collection was indeed perversely all-American. He
seemed to have strayed into Ralph Lauren country, with a detour
through a Memorial Day parade. And yet Adrover is on to something.
Like the young designers of United Bamboo, he is simply presenting
a different take on American life. Here is the classic button-down
shirt, but now made smaller and with a Western yoke. Here is the
sailor suit, the Boy Scout uniform, but seen through the eyes of
someone who has never worn either. Adrover didn't abandon the brash
creativity he displayed when he was poor and had no financing. He
found tailoring, and a line, a look, that he could endlessly
exploit. That is grown-up business.

   (UNDATED) As it turns out, Al Gore's mother-in-law doesn't take
the same drug as her dog. She doesn't pay the same amount, doesn't
have arthritis, isn't really Gore's mother-in-law, and in fact is
an Aleutian man in perfect health, except for those corns. Gore's
recent story was a fib based on data swiped from a congressional
report. Doesn't matter _ Gore's point about the dangers faced by
fictional people was entirely valid. Studies show that folks in
political anecdotes die sooner and have less education, higher
bills and poorer wages than normal, non-fictional people.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Gore, the plight of the fictional would be
completely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One can draw a few conclusions from this incident.
</P>
<P>
   1. There's no member of his family Gore won't exploit for a
vote. His sister's death, his son's accident, his mother-in-law's
arthritis, his second cousin's neck boils, his uncle's turtle's
shell-rot _ they're not really people he's talking about. They're
just meat puppets dancing in Al's Anecdote Theater, fodder for
falsehoods. If fish could vote, Gore would be out on the stump
weeping over the day he flushed little Goldie down the loo _ only
to discover she wasn't dead at all!
</P>
<P>
   ``Too long have the finest fish-pets in the nation gone to an
early grave because Big Toilets doesn't want to install a simple
mesh filter!'' he'd proclaim. Then some enterprising reporter who
hadn't gotten the BUSH MUST DIE memo from the assignment desk digs
into Gore's history. Finds out that he never had a fish, he had a
snake, and it was not flushed down the toilet, but escaped and
slithered down a sink, and this was at the hotel where Gore lived
as a child, although he'd left for college a year before the
incident, and when informed of the event, he dropped his bong and
laughed uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'd discover that Gore not only has stock in Big Toilets,
his family has been in the porcelain business for 50 years. There's
film of him addressing porcelain workers. (``Ah ground it! Ah
shaped it! Ah polished it with mah hands!'') But the story wouldn't
have much traction, since it does underline a true point: There
aren't any fish-safety functions on toilets.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, Bush hasn't come up with a fish-safety plan at all.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gore fails to understand the difference between
mothers-in-law and dogs. The dog does not have a lifetime to save
money for drugs. Even when a dog comes into a tidy inheritance, it
lacks the financial acumen necessary for financial planning. Dogs
do not understand compound interest, and are likely to bury the
money in the back yard and forget the location. People will do this
too _ it's called ``buying savings bonds'' _ but people can ask
their children for assistance with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   3. The story was part of Gore's ongoing message: You, the
American People, are Stupid. You'll believe anything. Here's a
recent bit of bluster excoriating the ``powerful'' interests: ``The
absurdly high prices for prescription drugs, the rising price of
gasoline, the demands by HMOs to overrule the medical decisions
that are made by doctors _ these are unfair efforts by powerful
interests to take advantage of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   To repeat: Gas is a commodity; prices will fluctuate. Prices
will be higher when government forbids drilling, mandates costly
additives and taxes the product at every step of production. HMOs
overruling doctors is, of course, the greatest crime of the 20th
AND 21st centuries, and all the guilty execs should be dragged into
the courtyard and shot. Nothing else will satisfy America, it
seems. But does anyone think that government will pay the bills
without a peep? Anyone really think no bureaucRATS will ever
overrule a hospital procedure?
</P>
<P>
   Powerful interests? Let's try a little experiment. Drive less.
Buy generic drugs instead of brand names. Don't pay your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Which powerful interest will put a lien on your house first?
</P>
<P>
   Silly, irrelevant question. We now return to the real issue of
the campaign: Bush Refuses Apology to Rodent-American Community.
They're fictional too, but really peeved.

   When Madonna first hit the charts in 1984, the dance and Top 40
lists were more likely to overlap. In the past decade, the dance
underground has grown away from the mainstream, but Madonna bridges
that gap, most recently with the commercially and critically
successful ``Ray of Light'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray of Light'' was nothing new when compared with dance music
innovators, but it brought the underground to the kids. Radio and
MTV played it, and the masses bought it. It has sold more than 4
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement proves she's still got a lot of pop life left.
``Music,'' Madonna's eighth album of new material, makes that even
clearer, while upping the experimental ante. If anyone else had
released the oddball title cut as a single _ with its gurgling
synthesizers, heavily processed vocals and minimalist bass pulse _
radio would have deemed it too strange for Top 40 playlists.
Madonna chalked up another No. 1 hit with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music'' is an extension of the work she began on ``Ray of
Light,'' and it may be her most adventurous album yet. While
club-centric sounds are on an innovative upswing, so is she. With
French producer Mirwais twiddling the knobs on six out of 10
tracks, ``Music'' is sprinkled with the blips, bleeps and treated
vocals of the disco- and funk-laden music of recent French vintage
(especially on ``Impressive Instant'' and the title cut).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray of Light'' producer William Orbit co-produces three tracks
here, including the poppiest tune, the bouncy ``Amazing.'' (That a
42-year-old mother of two can sing the line ``It's amazing what a
boy can do'' like a teenager experiencing the first blush of puppy
love, without looking ridiculous, may be the most amazing thing of
all. Even teen twinkie Mandy Moore would have trouble pulling that
off.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Music'' is light on the ballads _ just as well, since they're
not one of the ambitious diva's strong suits _ and most of the
down-tempo tunes keep up the dance-floor feel; they're just brief
detours to the club's chill-out room. A simple, sweet melody
elevates ``Nobody's Perfect'' to the ranks of her better slow
tunes, but, like Madonna herself, it's still firmly rooted to the
dance floor. And that's the most valuable bauble in her bag of
tricks these days.

 &HT;    A productive kitchen garden best sown with a plan
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept.21
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The yardman took one look at my back yard and
declared, ``You'll never have Shangri-La back here.''
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago, just after I had moved into my Atlanta
bungalow. His prediction wasn't hard to swallow. After all, the
kudzu had crept down the steep hill, up the side of the house and
in between the screen and my bedroom window. I was convinced I'd
wake up in the middle of the night and find a vine curled around my
neck.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, I paid that yardman $125-$200 a visit to come
and spray weedkiller and blow the leaves around, content with a
mere demilitarized zone around the house. After fielding umpteen
questions from friends about why I was paying so much and getting
so little, I told the yardman not to come back.
</P>
<P>
   But never having done yardwork myself, I still wanted
professional help. So I invited a garden designer I found on the
Internet to stop by. I was thrilled she was willing to give a free
consultation. She came, she looked, she took some yard drawings a
friend had made for me, and she left. I never heard from her again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, it happened. I bit into a potato and had an
epiphany. This wasn't one of those stale old tubers sold at the
supermarkets; this small potato had been dug up only one day before
by organic gardeners in North Georgia, and I had used it in a soup.
The flavor was phenomenal, the very definition of fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I could see Shangri-La, and it was a kitchen garden on
the sunny hillside behind my house _ fertile and green, bulging
with butterhead lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, chioggia beets and
gold potatoes. And herbs, too: big bushes of rosemary and hearty
stems of sage. It was a food writer's vision of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Heady with my conversion, I began to read gardening books. I'd
peel through ``The Southern Living Garden Book'' like a kid with a
Christmas catalog. I read enough to know that I needed help, good
help this time.
</P>
<P>
   So I began a search for a garden designer and research to nail
down costs. The latter proved most frustrating. The information
superhighway was dreadfully lacking in specifics. Finally, I
decided the cost would be whatever I could afford.
</P>
<P>
   I began crafting a list of designers by researching the
newspaper archives. I took word-of-mouth recommendations (which
proved most valuable), and I questioned exhibitors at the
Southeastern Flower Show. Some were too corporate; some didn't know
where my neighborhood was; some had a fine eye for flowers, but
what would they do with my decaying retaining wall?
</P>
<P>
   I honed my requirements. I wanted a small design firm that would
give me personal attention. I needed more than a plan. I needed
help implementing the plan, and then I needed to learn how to plan
future vegetable gardens myself. I also wanted a folk art flair
with color and originality.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a few phone interviews, I invited Brooks Garcia
of Fine Gardens, an Atlanta garden design firm, for an on-site
consultation. His fee for the first visit, at 1 1/2 hours, is $200.
He came ready with a sketch pad, open ears, a fresh eye and an
eagerness to work on a kitchen garden.
</P>
<P>
   No, the retaining wall didn't have to be replaced, he said. Yes,
the sun was ideal for a kitchen garden. Yes, we could work within
your budget ($5,000 for the first year and a ``we'll see'' after
that.)
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the biggest challenge _ the steep hill _ was also
one of the best opportunities. ``The garden can present itself with
terraces on the hillside, very Tuscan, very European,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the level space between my back porch and the retaining wall
was ideal for an herb garden. ``You want the herbs right outside
the kitchen,'' Garcia said. ``If they are a half-acre away, you
aren't going to leave the pasta boiling and go out there and get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. Some drainage work had to be done.
``There is nothing more disheartening than not to address those
issues, then have to tear a garden up,'' Garcia said. A French
drain was installed. Steps were built up the retaining wall, and
two terraced garden beds were created with stone borders. The wall
was washed with an ocean-blue paint.
</P>
<P>
   The herb beds and pathway were lined with an expanded shale that
looks like small silver gravel. It aids in drainage and will
prevent the herbs from falling victim to fungus. Bits of glass, a
horseshoe and a spoon unearthed during construction now are
embedded in steppingstones I made for the pathway.
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask if forging ahead in a drought was a good idea.
Garcia explained that herbs can thrive in harsh conditions. So far,
we've replaced only two artemisia plants.
</P>
<P>
   Fall vegetables are going in this month: lettuces, beets, leeks
and maybe even some brussels sprouts. I'm already dreaming of
enjoying a true Thanksgiving with bounty from my own garden.
</P>
<P>
   Shangri-La grows closer every day.

<P>
   Selecting a professional
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of titles out there, from yardman to garden
planner, and few indicate a level of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape architects, I learned, must pass a rigorous state
certification exam. They not only specialize in garden design but
are experts in ``hardscaping'' _ surface materials, retaining
walls, fountains, patios. All other titles _ garden designer,
landscape designer, landscape contractor, yard planner _ are used
loosely and can indicate a variety of training and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys in a pickup truck and (with) a shovel can call
themselves a landscaper, even if all they know how to do is put
plants in the ground green side up,'' said Atlanta garden designer
Brooks Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in hiring a professional is to be clear on the
kind of help you are seeking _ one specific area of the yard, a
specific garden _ then know how much you are willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Ask lots of questions before scheduling an on-site consultation,
which usually involves a fee. Here are a few key questions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How long has the firm been in business? Is it licensed and
insured?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What kind of education and experience does the person have,
and does it match your needs? (You don't need an expert in drainage
and irrigation systems if you simply want help designing borders.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for a list of references or even a portfolio to see if the
kinds of jobs the firm has done fit your needs for size, quality
and style. Be sure it can work within your budget. If you want a
design, but plan to implement it yourself, communicate that
upfront.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Before signing any agreements, ask for details and plans in
writing.

 &HT;    10 monthly to-dos when plotting and planting for winter or
spring
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 21
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, they suffered heat stroke. Then they got cut off at Uncle
Sam's watering hole. Finally, in one last gasp, they simply bade a
sad farewell.
</P>
<P>
   If those tender plants you so gingerly set out in beds last
spring are now tumbleweed slammed against the Herbie Curbie, chin
up.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, days are still plenty warm, water is still rationed and
those six-packs of begonias look more like six-packs of Bud. But
you and your yard are about to be granted a second lease on
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marks the official opening of fall _ the best gardening
season of all _ so get organized.
</P>
<P>
   True, spring holds lots of promise for gardeners, avid and
amateur alike. But autumn gives many plants their best shot at
success because they'll have all winter to rest up before they're
forced to battle the summer stresses of heat, drought, insects and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cooler temperatures make the soil soft and pliable _ yet still
warm enough to encourage root growth. Less heat also means plants
lose less moisture through their leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shorter days offer fewer hours of the stressful sun that bakes
plants in midsummer. Less sunlight also means slower plant growth,
enabling energy to be spent on establishing roots, instead of
foliage, and making the plant strong.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garden centers offer better prices _ and often better plant
selection _ in fall than in spring, when demand is greatest.
Salespeople may also have more time now.
</P>
<P>
   All are good reasons to use the next few months for dividing and
moving perennials, planting fall and winter annuals, setting out
spring-flowering bulbs and putting in new trees and shrubs. That's
not to mention all the projects you put off all summer, such as
cleaning out the toolshed, servicing the lawn equipment, rebuilding
that rose arbor.
</P>
<P>
   While the summer's still fresh in your mind, make a few notes on
which plants worked and which fizzled in different areas of your
yard. That way, next spring you'll know what to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Got fall fever? Overwhelmed by the possibilities?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be. Let our 10-point fall checklists, compiled with help
from metro garden centers and Home &AMP; Garden columnist Walter
Reeves, help you get organized.
</P>
<P>
   S E P T E M B E R
</P>
<P>
   1Spiff up beds, containers. Some summer annuals should still be
going strong, while others have petered out. Yank out those
has-beens and replace them with ones that will bloom until frost _
petunias, marigolds, zinnias, lantana and snapdragons.
</P>
<P>
   2Clean up perennials. Neaten tired plants by cutting off dead
branches and brown foliage.
</P>
<P>
   3Plant your veggies. Set out cool-season vegetable seedlings,
such as broccoli, collards and cabbage plants. Remember: Vegetable
foliage gives beds great color, especially Swiss chard, Red Giant
mustard, arugula and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   4Ignite fall color. Plant chrysanthemums, dianthus, asters,
Autumn Joy sedum, Mexican sage, goldenrod and ornamental grasses
for perennial color.
</P>
<P>
   5Create winter, spring color. Pansies and violas need to be
planted this month so that their roots can be established while
soil is still warm. Add a slow-release fertilizer to the holes to
give them a good start. Group them in drifts to make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   6Timing is everything. Plant new perennials and divide and
transplant existing ones. As a rule, perennials planted in fall
perform better than those planted in spring because fall plants
have more time to establish roots before summer.
</P>
<P>
   7Roll out the carpet. Plant a new fescue lawn with 6 pounds of
seed per 1,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   8Fight those weeds. Apply a broadleaf weedkiller (Weed Shot,
Wipe-Out, Weed-B-Gone) to violets in your lawn. Late in the month,
apply a pre-emergent winter weed preventer for chickweed and annual
bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   9Feed the lawn. Apply a first round of fertilizer to established
fescue grass late in the month, repeating in November, February and
April.
</P>
<P>
   10Take notes. Write down areas that challenged your plantings
this summer _ too sunny, too shady _ so you won't repeat your
mistakes in spring.
</P>
<P>
   O C T O B E R
</P>
<P>
   1New lawns. Begin planting fescue seed early in the month.
</P>
<P>
   2Make your beds. Clean out borders and amend the soil with a
fresh 2-inch layer of compost or other organic matter.
</P>
<P>
   3Tuck away summer bulbs. Dig up tender summer bulbs, such as
caladiums, dahlias and elephant's-ear, dry them for a week and
store them in peat moss for winter.
</P>
<P>
   4Plant for spring. Set out spring-flowering bulbs, such as
daffodils and crocuses, in sunny, well-drained soil late in the
month. But wait until November for tulips.
</P>
<P>
   5Green up for winter. Overseed Bermuda and centipede grasses
(but not zoysia) with rye as daytime temperatures reach only the
low 70s.
</P>
<P>
   6Treat fescue right. Aerate, fertilize, lime and reseed fescue
grass. Apply crab grass pre-emergents (but not on newly seeded or
sodded lawns).
</P>
<P>
   7Create a transition. Begin moving houseplants indoors, giving
them the most light possible.
</P>
<P>
   8Naked arbors? Try covering them with Sweet Autumn clematis,
with its fragrant white flowers; Boston ivy, which turns red in
fall; and Clematis armandii and Confederate jasmine, for year-round
green.
</P>
<P>
   9Food for the table. Continue to plant cool-season vegetables.
Even if you don't like them, consider their foliage, which gives
borders great color and texture. Try Swiss chard, Red Giant
mustard, arugula and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   10Cheaper by the dozen. Continue adding perennials and dividing
and transplanting existing ones. Garden centers offer better
selections _ and often better prices _ in fall than in spring.
</P>
<P>
   N O V E M B E R
</P>
<P>
   1Tulip time. Plant tulip bulbs while the soil is still warm. Set
bulbs 5 inches deep, tip end up, and sprinkle bone meal in the hole
before covering. Plant in one-color masses, not lines.
</P>
<P>
   2Sweet success. Bring the scent of outdoors inside by forcing
bulbs, such as amaryllis and paperwhites, in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   3Hug a tree. Plant shrubs and trees. Selection is best now.
Experiment with the not-so-tried-and-true, but make sure they're
suitable for this climate.
</P>
<P>
   4Rake and blow. Keep leaves off newly planted fescue lawns. Make
a composting bin for them, using a 4-by-10-foot section of fence
wire.
</P>
<P>
   5Mulching trees. Keep beds around trees covered, but pull mulch
at least 6 inches away from the base of tree trunks to prevent the
spread of disease and insects from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   6Put away toys. Drain irrigation systems, wrap faucets with
insulation and store garden hoses to protect them in winter.
</P>
<P>
   7Indoor jobs. Place houseplants close to a sunny window _ but
not too close, because of drafts. Give them a half-turn once a week
so they don't lean toward the light.
</P>
<P>
   8Pack up sprays. Move containers of liquid insect sprays and
weedkillers indoors and store in a safe place to prevent chemicals
from losing their potency in freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
   9A draining experience. Drain the gas and oil from your lawn
mower before storing it for winter.
</P>
<P>
   10Take stock. Examine garden areas that are bare and improve
them by adding evergreens or other plants that provide seasonal
interest, such as those with berries or exfoliating bark.

&HT;     OPEN LETTER TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND AL GORE ON CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT A. KAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dear Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore:
</P>
<P>
   Soon one of you will step into the highest office in our nation.
You'll have a lot on your plate, and in view of the Senate's
passage Tuesday of the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) bill
with China, it will include even closer ties to Beijing. Here are a
few ideas from someone with calluses earned in the U.S.-China
field:
</P>
<P>
   _You have to lead on China. If you don't, others will fill the
void. They are the elected politicians of more limited
constituencies for whom China often presents opportunity more than
it does responsibility. They are the press, and overall they
present Americans with only one or two minutes worth of content on
China a day. They are business and labor, both of which have
legitimate interests in our ties with China but neither of which
has the breadth of interest that only the president can represent.
They are religious and civic organizations, and their concerns can
inform but should not alone define the American agenda with China.
</P>
<P>
   _Your leadership must be continuous, not sporadic. China must
not be an afterthought. You must include China in your dialogue
with the American people and with Congress not just when there's a
crisis but when there isn't. You and your administration must spend
precious time staying current on China and U.S.-China engagements.
You must see China in person and come to know its challenges. You
and your team must maintain a continuing dialogue with your Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not let yourself be jerked off track with China. That nation
has been an emotional hot button in American politics for a century
or more, going back to the Oriental Exclusion Acts of the late 19th
century and continuing through the PNTR debate of this week. Bet on
it: Someone will demand that you stand up for ``American values.''
You will be told that any attempt to run a balanced and
multi-faceted relationship with China is ``appeasement'' and
``kowtowing to Beijing.'' These cliches just won't die. But the
solution is to lead, not to recede. Failing to define the field,
remaining unengaged or uninterested until someone drops the next
stink bomb, would be the greatest mistake you could make.
</P>
<P>
   _You should encourage China's responsible participation in the
World Trade Organization and work steadily to ensure that it abides
by its commitments to other multilateral bodies.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't be distracted by the daily news. Advancing our interests
with China is a long and challenging process. The news of the day
is, almost by definition, not conducive to effective stewardship of
our relationship with China. Keep your eye on the trends, the
patterns, and the best analysis you can secure from your own team
and from American analysts. China news may sell papers, but it
should not normally frame the making of U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   _Lastly, find out about Yin and Yang. Its symbol shows the
interlocking of opposites. The history of the Yin-Yang symbol is
long, and the meaning somewhat metaphysical. But the bottom line
will help you: dark and light, good and evil, all opposite
characteristics are inseparable from each other. They wax and wane,
giving way to each other in a perpetual cycle. The balance between
Yang _ sunny, bright, hot, active _ and Yin _ lunar, cool, more
recessive _ is the key to stability and success. You can't have one
without the other.
</P>
<P>
   As you lead the nation on China, keep Yin and Yang in mind. It's
never going to be all brightness or all darkness. Your challenge is
to help your nation live with the balance of the two, while
preserving and enhancing America's strength, prosperity and
security. It won't be easy.
</P>

 &HT;    MORE AMERICANS RETURNED CENSUS FORMS
 &HT;    Attn: Texas papers.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans reversed a 30-year trend by returning
their census forms in greater numbers this year, particularly in
tougher-to-count minority communities, the Census Bureau said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About two of every three U.S. households _ 67 percent _ answered
their census questionnaires by mail or Internet, exceeding the
response rate for 1990 of 65 percent, and bucking a declining trend
since 1970, when the response rate was 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The response rate in Texas rose three percentage points to 64
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Austin saw a significant jump of five points, to 67
percent this year. Likewise, Travis County rose five points, to 67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive efforts to reach inner-city minorities, immigrants and
other groups traditionally undercounted by the census seemed to
have worked, as 13 of the nation's 15 most populous cities equaled
or exceeded their 1990 response rate, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   California, the nation's largest state with the greatest number
of minorities, boosted its census participation from 65 to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Census 2000 has achieved a milestone before we even have the
first population count,'' said Robert Shapiro, undersecretary of
the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau. ``The
first number from the census is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the response rate was an important
indicator of public cooperation in providing an accurate census.
Census workers spent the summer following up the mass mailing to
120 million households, trying to reach those who did not send back
the questionnaire and conducting selective quality-control surveys
to double-check answers for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will report the first population figures from
the 2000 count by the end of this year. The census is used to
apportion congressional seats among the states, redraw legislative
boundaries within states and equitably distribute billions of
dollars in federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Large cities have complained that an undercount of minorities in
the 1990 census left them short on federal dollars for welfare and
education intended for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   The response rates released by the Census Bureau in a news
conference Tuesday suggest that Hispanics, African Americans and
other groups which are traditionally difficult to reach responded
more readily to the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt attributed the higher
response to a vast grassroots campaign by cities, counties,
religious groups and community organizations and the bureau's
first-ever national advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most Southern states increased their response rate by a
percentage point or two. However, over all the region continued to
lag behind the rest of the nation, following a historic trend.
Southern states tend to have more immigrants and newcomers moving
from other states, meaning their populations are harder to count.
</P>
<P>
   A higher response rate results reduces the number of households
census workers must visit in order to complete the count. Because
about 3 million census questionnaires were returned after the
late-April deadline, those households likely received a visit from
census-takers even though they had mailed back their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the $6.8 billion census operation was ``in the
black,'' in part because the greater-than-anticipated response by
mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Census anticipated a response rate of 61 percent. Each
percentage point represents 1.2 million households, or roughly $40
million in cost to the Census Bureau.

   MOBILE, Ala. _ The federal government and domestic oil producers
have quietly allied themselves in a push to exploit new oil fields
discovered in the deepest waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that oil lies so deep underwater and so far from
shore that the old-fashioned oil rig and pipeline way of doing
business just won't work. So the industry wants to do away with
pipelines altogether, anchoring a supertanker-sized ship over a
deep-water well and using it as a combination drilling rig and
storage facility that could hold up to 2 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pipeline, a smaller supertanker would visit every
three days, suck the crude from the storage rig and shuttle it to a
refinery on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The oil would be expensive to find and extract, but each new
floating rig would have the potential to generate about $2 billion
worth of oil per year, according to one government estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the deep-water oil will be crucial to any American
attempt to get out from under the thumb of the OPEC cartel, and
there has been little public opposition to the proposal, even from
environmental groups usually antagonistic to offshore drilling.
</P>
<P>
   But ferrying oil from these deep-water well systems may pose new
environmental risks not usually associated with the conventional
wells and pipelines already in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The system could raise the likelihood of a major oil spill. The
tankers leaving the rigs every three days would each be carrying
more than twice as much oil as was spilled in 1989 during the Exxon
Valdez disaster in Alaska. Some of the large storage rigs used in
these systems hold 96 million gallons, more than eight times the
oil lost from the Valdez, one of the worst such spills recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, public documents outlining the new oil-extraction
process provide few details on the danger of a collision between a
700-foot-long tanker and a 1,000-foot-long storage rig. Nor do the
documents fully answer whether the new rigs could withstand the
most severe hurricanes the Gulf can dish out.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production experts say that safety and technological
improvements in recent years have significantly decreased the
number of spills per mile traveled by the supertankers, and
lessened the possibility of a catastrophe like the one involving
the Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree no one would bother drilling in such
out-of-the-way fields if prices weren't so high _ $35.10 a barrel
this week, compared to $10 a barrel in early 1999 _ and if federal
regulators weren't holding out carrots worth billions of dollars in
savings to oil companies that start digging deep.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``royalty holiday'' means the government will give
up the 12.5 percent of all revenues it usually claims from
producing oil wells. According to government projections, that
would amount to about $228 million a year for each floating tanker,
roughly the cost of one of the new ships.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson with the Minerals Management Service, a division
of the U.S. Department of the Interior, indicated that the
government will almost certainly be open to the use of the system
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy predicts that domestic oil production
in both the Alaskan fields and the near-shore fields in the Gulf
will decrease by 20 percent in the next 10 years. The government
hopes deep-water oil will fill the gap. About the only thing
standing in the way is the Environmental Impact Statement, an
official government survey of the potential damage to the
environment from the proposed system.
</P>
<P>
   Minerals Management has published its first draft of this impact
statement and is holding a series of hearings to accept public
input on it.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental assessment offers the system a basically clean
bill of health, concluding it poses few new risks. The agency aims
to finalize the document by the Christmas holidays, with the
understanding that any future floating rigs will have to get
individual approval.
</P>
<P>
   The impact statement makes clear that, in many ways, these rigs
pose no more environmental risk than conventional rigs already
operating in the Gulf. But there is at least one major exception,
and that's what oil experts call ``lightering'' _ essentially the
handoff of oil from one boat to another. That's how the companies
plan to get around the lack of pipelines in the deep water.
</P>
<P>
   The floating storage facilities considered in the impact
statement can pump 500,000 barrels of oil every three days,
requiring smaller tankers to visit at least that often. In the
scenario discussed in the study, each new facility will require at
least 110 handoffs of oil while at sea per year. Tankers would
return to sites nearer port and off-load the oil they've just
picked up, adding another 110 handoffs.
</P>
<P>
   These operations are already common in the Gulf. Minerals
Management reports that every day there are at least three
supertankers too large to enter Gulf ports. These tankers must be
unloaded at sea using lightering techniques. Today, most of these
transfers occur near shore and they are suspended in rough weather.
Higher seas 100 and 200 miles off the coast, where the new system
would be used, presumably could make the transfers more hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coast Guard statistics, there were 15 oil spills
during 4,391 of these handoffs between 1986 and 1990. Most of those
spills were small, involving less than 1,000 gallons of oil, the
documents say. Still, that works out to 3.4 accidents per 1,000
transfers. Using these statistics, the Gulf would experience 3.4
more oil spills per year for every five of the floating systems in
use.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coast Guard statistics don't include all the spills that
have occurred during handoff operations, and they overlook one of
the Gulf's largest. In a 1990 accident, an oil tanker caught fire
off the Texas coast during a handoff operation and spilled 3.9
million gallons of oil. An official report concluded the accident _
caused when a pump being used in the oil transfer exploded _ was
``not directly related'' to the handoff procedure.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 similar rig systems have been in use for 20 years off
the coast of Indonesia and in the North Sea. Collisions between the
floating rigs and shuttle tankers have occurred in those places,
the government report acknowledges. But the report provides little
detail and minimizes these risks, simply stating that ``there have
been service vessel collisions with shuttle tankers during hookup
operations, but no spill incidents as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   While the document does attempt to estimate the probability of
disaster under the best of conditions, it offers only scant
information on what could happen when hurricanes or severe storms
create the worst conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used to shut down the pumping mechanisms in the
wells in case of a severe storm has a good record. These devices
can shut down the wells before the storm hits, ensuring that no
matter what happens on the surface, no oil will leak into the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to protecting an oil-laden tanker anchored to
the ocean bottom and tossed by towering waves and hurricane-force
winds, guarantees may be hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that an anchored supertanker loaded with
500,000 barrels of oil could ride out a 100-year storm. According
to the Alabama Oil and Gas Board's oil rig certification
regulations, a 100-year storm would have 130- to 150-mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there have been stronger storms in the Gulf, at
least twice in the past 50 years. In 1968, Hurricane Camille had
winds estimated at about 200 mph. In 1989, Hurricane Gilbert
twirled around the Gulf with winds approaching 225 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The government's impact statement deals with hurricanes in such
a cursory manner that two Minerals Management public relations
officers familiar with the document were unaware that the storms
were discussed at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The one section of the document dealing specifically with storm
risk did not address whether the tanker needed to be emptied to
survive the storm, whether the rigs would keep pumping oil, whether
crew members would stay on board or what would happen if waves or a
collision ripped a ship from the oil-pumping umbilical cord tying
it to the well and the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' said Barney Congdon, with the
Minerals Management Service, when asked what would happen to the
rig and well in a hurricane. ``Perhaps someone could bring it up in
one of the public meetings. Perhaps it was addressed and deemed not
to have environmental consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   One Minerals Management Service official suggested that
hurricane dangers may be more fully addressed in a risk-assessment
report being prepared by Texas A&AMP;M University. However, service
official Deborah Cranswick said the public will not have access to
the report. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Congdon of the Minerals Management Service said that overall,
the proposed rigs already seem to meet the criteria the government
considers when weighing approval for new drilling technologies _
that is, they pose no greater risks than existing systems. Congdon
said that the risks of the floating rigs and tankers appear to be
no worse than the problems posed by 33,000 miles of pipelines now
servicing the thousands of stationary rigs already in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, it is likely the new floating rigs will clear the
rest of the regulatory hurdles and begin harvesting oil from
beneath deep Gulf waters in the near future.

A SALMON ONCE WHITE TURNS INTO IVORY _ AND FOR DINERS, GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, white king salmon was a curiosity, if not a
nuisance. When fishermen in the Pacific Northwest pulled it up, it
went in the pile headed for the cannery or the smokehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for wild king salmon from waters from Seattle to
Alaska, after all, is for a large meaty fish with bright red flesh.
</P>
<P>
   White king salmon is unmistakable. Its flesh is as white as
bone. That it has extraordinary flavor didn't matter. It wasn't
red, or even pink.
</P>
<P>
   It could have remained unknown, except that in five years,
something else occurred: novelty became a big commodity in cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The former misfit fish is now $20 a pound and known as ivory
king salmon. And instead of being destined for the cannery, it is
bound for restaurants on the level of Le Bernardin, Picholine and
Alain Ducasse.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair, however, to say that novelty was the only
reason for its success. This is much more than salmon without
pigment. It is different from the red in taste, in the texture of
its flesh and in many other subtle qualities. It has a softer flesh
and is buttery and silky, less meaty and somehow less salmony. It
tastes at once sweet, like a freshwater fish, and deeply of the
sea. It is clearly salmon, but with flavors reminiscent of perch
and Chilean sea bass. Compared with farmed salmon and even red king
salmon, which tend to be oily and fishy tasting, white king
salmon's delicacy is incomparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fine, very delicate,'' said chef Alain Ducasse. Even
he had not seen or tasted it until he cooked it recently in New
York, but he now prefers it to the red. (He steams the salmon
gently and serves it with a reduction of shallots, vinegar,
tarragon, wine, pepper and olive oil.)
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Boulud has been serving it for just a year; Nobu bought
some for the first time just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan Feast, a purveyor in New York, was one of the first
companies to sell the fish in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought it in three years ago,'' said Dan Kim, a
salesman, ``it was really hard to convince people to try it. Then
they tasted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is difficult to bring in enough. When Aquagrill in SoHo
served it as a special last week, all 78 portions were gone by 10
p.m. ``I could sell 50,000 pounds right now if I could get them,''
said Robert Fusca, the owner of Ultimate Seafoods, a supplier in
Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of king salmon is white, and there is no
way to know until a fish is gutted whether it has white or red
flesh. And whites have seasons that come and go with the
predictability of wind. Preservation efforts limit the king salmon
catch, so the fisheries are opened only in certain weeks,
determined month to month.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you will never see white king salmon on a set menu.
It is served as a special. And it turns up only sporadically in
fish markets like Wild Edibles.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 6 percent to 8 percent of a king salmon catch is
white salmon, said Kurt Sigfusson, a sales manager at Seafood
Producers Co-op, a purveyor in Bellingham, Wash., and Sitka,
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at the moment seem to exceed what people know about this
fish, judging by what I was told by fishermen, chefs and
distributors. One New York fish purveyor said that the season was
over and that he was calling all his chefs to tell them to stop
ordering it. Another told me it is a year-round fish. One said the
fish was white because, unlike other salmon, it didn't eat shrimp;
another asserted that it was a unique species. Still another said
it came exclusively from a small area of ocean off southeast
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were so elusive and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Withler, a research scientist with the Canadian Department
of Fisheries and Oceans in Nanaimo, British Columbia, has studied
the fish. Of the five species of salmon in the Pacific _ silver,
chum, pink, sockeye and king _ king is the only type with a white
variety. Although her study produced no conclusions, it indicated
that the white color was inherited and was simply a mutation. Two
red king salmon, for instance, can produce a white.
</P>
<P>
   Withler found that white salmon, if fed shrimp, just don't
absorb the color from the beta carotene in shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect but we don't know,'' she said, ``that they have
some kind of enzyme deficiency that prevents them from taking up
the carotenoid.''
</P>
<P>
   She also found that there are more white king salmon as one
travels north in the Pacific Ocean and farther inland in the river
system. It is available year round, but is more common in summer
than in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many fish, the white king salmon that makes it to New
York is almost always of exceptional quality. It is often sent
overnight direct from the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with fish being sent long distances,'' said Jeremy
Marshall, the chef at Aquagrill, ``especially good fish like this,
they don't mess around.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shipper sending it from Alaska, it's not worth having the
fish rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Such quality has prompted chefs to put a lot of thought into how
they treat the fish. To them, it is not like any other salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must cook it more gently,'' Ducasse said. His method is so
gentle that it is like baking a potato in the sun: he cooks it for
1 minute in a pan, and then slowly steams it.
</P>
<P>
   Christer Larsson, the chef at Christer's in Midtown, rubs a hot
plate with olive oil and cooks the fish with the heat of the plate
for just a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Carmellini, the chef at Cafe Boulud, and Eric Ripert, the
chef at Le Bernardin, both slow-roast it on a plate in a 200-degree
oven for about 10 minutes. When cooked this way the oils in the
fish warm up, the flesh softens and seems to melt in the mouth.
Carmellini intensifies the effect by spreading a spoonful of osetra
caviar on top and laying it in a shallow puddle of cucumber sauce
thickened with creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   Slow roasting in a low oven guarantees that the fish won't
overcook from one minute to the next; you can monitor it carefully.
It also allows you to enjoy the fish in a pure way. It does not
color, so there are no caramelized edges, and it is rare in the
center, so it is much like sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Ribbon Sushi, in fact, serves white king salmon as sushi
and sashimi, both with a mustard and basil bearnaise. Eaten this
way, the difference between the white and red is even more
striking. White is sweeter and more moist than red king salmon and
has flavors like perch.
</P>
<P>
   Another easy way to cook the fish is to poach it with just
enough fish broth and butter to cover the bottom of a shallow pan.
As it simmers you can spoon the pan juices over the fish, or gently
turn it. The fish cooks in just a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fish is oily, it needs some kind of acidity. Using
Carmellini's idea of a cucumber juice sauce, I made a watercress
sauce, first wilting the greens in butter, then pureeing them with
oil and rice vinegar and straining the pulp, so I got a leaf-green
sauce. Just before serving I thickened it with creme fraiche,
which, with the rice vinegar, gave an edge to the fish.
</P>
<P>
   White king salmon also sautes beautifully, and surprisingly can
handle hearty flavors, as red salmon can. Marshall serves it with
oxtail risotto and squash puree. Regular salmon often releases much
of its oil when sauteed and becomes dry, but white king salmon
becomes richer and juicier. I seasoned fillets generously with sea
salt and coarse black pepper, heated butter and oil in a nonstick
saute pan until it was almost smoking, then placed the fish skin
side down and let them cook until the skin was brown as a hazelnut
and covered with bubbles from the heat. With the fish, I made a
kind of succotash with corn, green beans and snap peas _ sweet and
unobtrusive accompaniments _ and served a lemon wedge on the side
to counter the richness.
</P>
<P>
   Carmellini sautes white salmon without skin and serves it with a
stew of lentils and bacon and a tart red wine sauce. It is rare to
find a fish that can handle both bacon and cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer not to chase down your fish purveyor day after day
trying to get white king, you can always taste it smoked from
Petrossian. The white salmon there is mellow and tender, like a
salmon and butter pate. I cut the crusts off black bread, toasted
it and spread a horseradish cream on it and laid a little salmon on
top. It made dark, delicious little sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Petrossian also sells what it calls Jamaican white salmon. Avoid
this. It is as subtle as beef jerky.
</P>
<P>
   A fish as fine and rare as white king salmon is best
unencumbered by strong flavors. Its taste of sea and krill and the
Pacific should be as unmistakable as its color.
</P>
<P>
   SAUTEED WHITE KING SALMON WITH SUCCOTASH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 ears corn, husked
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces green beans, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces sugar snap peas
</P>
<P>
   4 5-ounce fillets white king salmon with skin
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives
</P>
<P>
   4 lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn, turn off heat
and let sit 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut kernels from cobs into
medium saucepan, scraping off as much juice as possible. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add green beans
and cook until tender and slightly crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove
with slotted spoon and cool. Bring water back to a boil and add
snap peas. Cook until tender but slightly crisp, about 3 minutes.
Drain and cool. Halve green beans, and slice snap peas diagonally
into {-inch pieces. Add to corn.
</P>
<P>
   3. Generously season salmon fillets on both sides with salt and
pepper. In a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat, melt 2
tablespoons butter with the oil. When bubbles subside, add fillets
skin side down. Cook until very brown and crisp, about 4 minutes.
Turn once and brown other side 3 minutes; fish should be slightly
rare in center.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add remaining butter to corn mixture, place pan over medium
heat amd stir until thoroughly warmed. Add salt to taste, and stir
in chives.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, make a bed of corn on each of 4 plates, and place a
fillet on top, skin side up. Garnish with a lemon wedge.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW-COOKED WHITE KING SALMON WITH WATERCRESS BROTH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 pound watercress, trimmed and washed
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   8 3-ounce pieces white king salmon, skin removed
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt, preferably fleur de sel.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees. In a large saute pan over medium
heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add watercress and salt to taste.
Toss until watercress has wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a
blender, and puree a few seconds. With blender at low speed,
gradually add rice vinegar and canola oil, scraping down sides of
container as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   2. Strain mixture into small saucepan, pressing out as much
liquid as possible with back of spoon. Place over medium-low heat,
and whisk in creme fraiche. Adjust seasonings, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rub 2 remaining tablespoons butter on both sides of salmon
pieces. Season lightly with salt. Place in shallow roasting pan
about an inch apart. Bake, turning every few minutes, 8 minutes to

</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, place 2 pieces of fish in each of 4 shallow bowls.
Sprinkle with sea salt. Whisk watercress broth once more, and spoon
around fish.

PROTECT YOUR VALUABLES, EVEN IN THE PARADISE OF HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii -- Hawaii is a place of unsurpassed beauty,
simplicity and peace, such that tourists caught up in its tropical
caress can easily be lulled into a false sense of security. The
islands are not, however, exempt from the same human evil that
infects urban areas on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple from Studio City learned this in excruciating
fashion this past spring. Total cost of the lesson: $8,000, and a
vacation that was utterly ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Fox and Walter Lang, making their first trip to Hawaii,
opted for a one-week stay in Maui. On their first full day on the
island, they arose well before dawn to undertake a popular tourist
activity -- biking down the Haleakala volcano. They parked their
convertible rental car in a shopping center lot at the bike tour
company's office in the Paia-Haiku area, on the northeastern side
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But before boarding the vans for the ride to the top of the
mountain, they made a fateful mistake: They locked valuables in the
trunk of their car, notably a wallet and a condo key.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to their car in the late morning, they discovered
it had been broken into and vandalized. But the nightmare was only
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves, who apparently hit the car right after the vans
left, drove to the couple's condominium in Kihei and ransacked it,
taking everything _ laptop computer, Palm Pilots, camera, gifts,
clothes, shoes, toiletries, makeup, luggage. From the condo itself,
the VCR, microwave oven and even the phone were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throughout the morning, while Fox and Lang were blissfully
pedaling down the mountain -- and before they could notify banks
and credit-card companies of the break-in -- the thieves went on a
shopping spree, writing checks, using credit cards. They even
bought a full set of tires for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lang were devastated. They had to have money wired and
an emergency Visa account set up (having to wait two days for the
new card to reach them). They had to buy clothes and toothpaste and
combs. ``It was so emotionally violating,'' said Fox, who noted
that even as they went about other tourist activities, she found
herself looking to see if people they encountered were wearing her
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We went there because we were overworked and needed
a break and needed a little romance and a break from all the
stress. It wasn't that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jon Morioka, a spokesman for the Maui Police Dept.,
acknowledged that vehicle break-ins are a common crime against
tourists on the island, but he declined to provide figures on the
matter -- other than to say incidences have declined in recent
years with the deployment of citizens' patrols of problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Morioka noted that prevention is one of the most important steps
an island visitor can take -- ``not locking valuables in the
vehicle, making sure you take only what you need for your
excursion; not taking your whole household with you, locking the
rest in the hotel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Hawaii-bound travelers might not be able to prevent the
kind of calamity that Fox and Lang encountered, but steps can be
taken to substantially reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   In Maui's remote beach areas, signs are posted about not leaving
valuables in your car. As Morioka noted, heed them. ``You see those
signs,'' said Fox, ``but on your first time in Hawaii, something
inside you gets caught up in the magnificence of it all. We were in
a dream-like state.''
</P>
<P>
   The implicit challenge is in protecting your valuables without
denying yourself many of the natural pleasures of the islands.
Hiking in the rain forest and snorkeling in the warm, pristine
waters tend to be unforgettable experiences, but both often require
you to park at a deserted turnout.
</P>
<P>
   And tourist vehicles are easily identified in the islands.
They're late-model, sparkling-clean (with no signs of rust or mud),
and generally white or red.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   -- First of all, scale down your store of valuables before you
leave the mainland. If possible, take just one credit card apiece,
an ATM card, and maybe one gasoline card, if possible, and leave
the rest at home. Don't bring along a lot of expensive jewelry
(restaurants in Hawaii are unfailingly casual). You shouldn't need
your checkbook (maybe just a spare check or two). Leave the
expensive electronic devices at home, if you can live without them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bring along a vast reserve of cash. Even if you don't
want to bother with travelers' checks, you can reload on cash
frequently at numerous ATM machines around the islands.
</P>
<P>
   -- Invest in a couple of nylon fanny packs and some
freezer-strength zip plastic bags. Consider one fanny pack your
``dry'' pack and the other your ``wet'' pack. Then, on any day
trip, take along only essential items. (If you're staying in a
hotel with a room safe -- many have them -- lock all remaining
valuables in it.)
</P>
<P>
   If you embark on a day trip that will involve hiking to
waterfalls and also snorkeling at a beach -- the drive to Hana, for
example -- leave your lodgings with only select valuables: driver's
license, room key, car key, a couple of credit cards, some cash.
</P>
<P>
   For a hike or a bike trip, place these items in the dry fanny
pack and leave nothing in the car more valuable than a beach towel,
your picnic lunch and an ice chest. Later, for a swim, transfer
your valuables -- including your eyeglasses or sunglasses, if
applicable -- to the plastic zip bags. Place them in the wet pack,
strap it around your waist (be sure to zip it closed securely) and
head into the water, leaving nothing important in the car, on the
beach or in a snorkel-tour boat.
</P>
<P>
   You may get funny looks from other swimmers and the fish, but
your mind will be at rest. Afterward, the nylon wet pack should dry
quickly if laid out in the sun or in the trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: You might want to put wedding rings or other
valuable rings in a zip plastic bag when you swim. Greg Thomas of
the Paragon snorkel outfitter said rings can slip off when fingers
get cool and shrink up in the water, and once a ring settles into
the exotica of the coral bed, you'll be hard-pressed to find it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Obviously, this system won't work for a large, bulky,
expensive camera. The solution: Leave it behind in your lodgings if
you know you're going to be swimming or snorkeling. You can always
save the good camera for an evening luau or a simple sightseeing
drive, where you can make sure it's always with you.
</P>
<P>
   For the beach trips, consider picking up a disposable camera _
or, better yet, an underwater disposable camera (they work for
shots on land, too).
</P>
<P>
   -- Another idea is to bring a spare key chain from home and
transfer your condo key to it. That way, if it's misplaced or
stolen, the person in possession of it won't have the name of your
condo complex and your unit number.
</P>
<P>
   None of these precautions will guarantee a safe trip. Rooms can
still be broken into. Tourists can still be robbed at gunpoint _ it
has happened on the hiking trail to Sacred Falls, on Oahu's
windward shore. But they can substantially reduce the severity of
losses in a car burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would certainly have prevented Fox and Lang from
having such a disastrous vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their travails, however, the two were encouraged
after encountering some Good Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   The people at the Old Lahaina Luau heard of their ordeal _ and
learned that they had no immediate means of paying for the feast
they had reserved. Fox: ``They said, `Why don't you just come and
be our guests.' '' Meanwhile, the proprietor at Maui Jim's broke
into tears at their story, Fox said, and began giving them
sunglasses, shirts, T-shirts and a dinner certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while experiencing the dark side of paradise, Fox and Lang
also encountered its aloha.

&HT;     PATAKI URGES N.Y. SENATE CANDIDATES TO BAN SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Gov. George E. Pataki said Tuesday that
Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio should
impose their own ban on soft money contributions in their hotly
contested race.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a second-term Republican governor, was echoing comments
made by Lazio, the Republican nominee for the Senate seat, during
his debate with Clinton in Buffalo last week. At one point in the
face-off, Lazio thrust a document at Clinton and asked her to sign
it as evidence that she would join him in rejecting soft money
contributions from unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic nominee, rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should drop soft money,'' Pataki told reporters
on Capitol Hill after meeting with lawmakers from the state. ``I
think Congressman Lazio is 100 percent right. Let the candidates
run their own campaigns using their own campaign funds that they've
raised and let's get soft money out of the Senate race.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money consists of the unlimited and largely unregulated
contributions to political parties and their affiliates. Soft money
spending by the political parties is supposed to be independent of
any particular candidate but that isn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, federal law limits hard money contributions _ those
made directly to specific candidates. The law also forbids
corporations and labor unions from making direct contributions to
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 1, Lazio had $10.2 million in hard money
contributions while Clinton had $7.1 million, according to Federal
Election Commission reports. There is no reliable accounting of
soft money contributions or soft money spending in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that when the news media report that Clinton says
she is in favor of banning soft money, the media should also note
that she ``won't take that action herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one who refuses to take the pledge saying there's no
soft money,'' he said. ``The press should hold her accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made his remarks after meeting with New York lawmakers to
rally support for the state's priorities as Congress considers
federal spending bills before adjourning next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very positive meeting,'' he said, adding that the
meeting covered many issues including how to shore up
transportation funding for New York and how to deal with the
outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the West Nile virus is not just a New York problem,''
Pataki said. ``Mosquitoes don't respect state boundaries and to the
extent that we have been the epicenter of this cursewe think that
we are entitled to some federal support.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state has spent more than $30 million combating the
virus and that local governments have shelled out about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people have been infected with the virus and eight
have died from it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We' received virtually no federal assistance,'' Pataki said.
``We have helped define the issue for the rest of the country and
helped protect the rest of the country and we shouldn't be required
to bear that entire burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also cited an annual report by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan that shows this year New Yorkers are sending $15 billion
more to Washington in taxes then they get back in federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that's fair,'' Pataki said.

MAUI'S ILLAGE OF HANA IS A BREATHTAKING STOP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANA, Hawaii -- Around 5 p.m. Or maybe 6. That's when you begin
to notice a subtle shift in the town's personality.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the last rental cars pull out of Hana, the
unpretentious little village on the southeastern edge of the
Hawaiian island of Maui. You see the drivers glance impatiently at
their watches, then pick up speed a little as they head for the
first of 56 bridges, the first of 617 curves on the infamous Hana
Highway that will be their route out.
</P>
<P>
   It's then that Hana ceases to be a midday tourist refueling stop
and regains its truer identity.
</P>
<P>
   A softball game begins on an emerald-green field across from the
school, the very young or very old hopping onto the hoods of parked
cars to watch the action and heckle the participants. A grill leaps
to flaming life down on the beach of Hana Bay, as the day's catch
is readied for dinner. Siblings squeal with excitement as they ride
their bikes toward Hasegawa General Store in hopes of getting there
before it closes at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   As the night descends, there will be no streetlights to defile
it. And at some point, all sound is destined to be muffled by a
sudden cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Hana -- this is the Hawaii -- that few visitors
experience. Reams have been written about a drive on the Hana
Highway, that 51-mile scenic wonder that perches precariously along
the lush, nearly vertical eastern slope of Maui's Haleakala
volcano. But almost all of it is presented in the context of a day
trip, and that's how it is treated by the majority of visitors
staying in the resort enclaves of Kaanapali or Wailea.
</P>
<P>
   They hop into their rental cars at mid-morning and begin bending
around the 10-mph curves and over the quaint, one-lane bridges,
marveling at each waterfall, each neon-orange burst of African
tulip blossom, each sweeping vista of the cobalt-blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make the briefest of stops in Hana (perhaps wondering
what all the fuss is about) before venturing a bit farther on to
the so-called Seven Sacred Pools (which are not considered sacred
by Hawaiians and number about two dozen). As late afternoon closes
in, they beat a hurried retreat, perhaps sensing that a drive that
had been a charming delight in the morning will be three hours of
white-knuckle torture on the return.
</P>
<P>
   Those who linger in Hana thus have it to themselves. In those
evening hours, and again in the early morning before the leading
edge of the day's tourist caravan rolls in, they're treated to a
profound sense of Hawaii of old. And it is heavenly. Clearly, an
overnight stay is the optimal way to experience its charms.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation fosters the little town's simplicity. You can't get
here readily, so there is no popping in for dinner. The Hana
Highway is one route in. The other is even more daunting: the
Piilani Highway, an unimproved, all-but-deserted road around the
island's southern edge. Rental-car companies use red ink in their
drive-guide brochures to inform customers that their contracts will
be void if they venture onto this track.
</P>
<P>
   Hana has a long history of being removed from the rest of island
life, and it shows. Until the 1920s, access to it was only by boat,
mule or foot. In 1927, convict laborers, using only picks and
shovels, began hacking away at a narrow path that had been the only
route through the rainforest since ancient times. The road wasn't
even paved until the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   So Hana was allowed to exist on its own terms. It was a sugar
cane plantation until the late 1940s, when soaring costs -- not the
least of which was transporting the harvested cane off the island
-- made the operation unfeasible. Then tourism took a toehold, as
San Francisco entrepreneur Paul Fagan opened the six-room Kauiki
Inn, the forerunner to what is now the 66-acre, 66-room Hotel
Hana-Maui.
</P>
<P>
   This enterprise and others (notably cattle ranching) enabled a
high proportion of the indigenous population to remain in the area
after the cane business fizzled out. Maybe that's why the sense of
family, of stability seems to be so strong here.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the island, you're with tourists like
yourself,'' said Dave Brazda, manager of the Hotel Hana-Maui.
``You're going to luaus that are more in the Tahitian tradition,
while our (entertainment) is Hawaiian. We have second and third
generations working here, people whose parents and grandparents
worked here. We have one employee getting ready to retire who's
been here 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for the show, don't expect any fire-twirling act,
the frenetic pounding of drums (that's Tahitian, too), or
cheesecake dancers. On a Sunday evening in February, a small choir
of older Hawaiians ascended a stage in the hotel's dining room and
sang songs in their native language, accompanied only by guitars
and ukuleles. This wasn't a polished act -- many, in fact, seemed
to be wrestling mightily with pitch -- but it was absolutely
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hana itself. Over the past 30 years of Hawaii's development
boom, a trend has emerged. A hotel-builder will find a suitable
oceanfront site, then come in and scrape it clean. What follows is
what you might describe as an art director's concept of paradise:
lagoon, waterfalls, tropical trees, sandy beach. Little of it is
authentic (even the sand is trucked in at some of the Big Island's
newer resorts).
</P>
<P>
   Hana has the real deal. You want a rock-lined cove? Hana Bay is
the answer. A picturesque beach? It's hard to beat Hamoa Beach,
where the sand has a salt-and-pepper look and consistency, the
byproduct of lava decomposition. Lagoon? Oheo Gulch is nearby.
Tropical vegetation? Geez, just look around. Haleakala's rainfall
works out to an average of about an inch a day, and most of it
falls here on the eastern slope -- which is why the Hana Highway
winds through a carpet of so many hues of green.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Hana-Maui is pleasantly low-rise. Its most popular
accommodations are the Sea Ranch Cottages, built in the 1980s in
the understated design of plantation workers' quarters. Step out
onto your porch here and your view toward the sea is likely to be
punctuated by a grazing horse.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel underwent an ownership change last year and is still
working to bring in an operational partner willing to sink some
money into the place. It's needed. It hasn't undergone any capital
improvements in more than 10 years, and ``when you're in Hawaii,
sitting by the ocean, maintenance has to be done,'' Brazda said.
``The saltwater will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hotel Hana-Maui is in need of a sprucing up, you wouldn't
know it from its room rates. Brochure rates for the Sea Ranch
Cottages range between $500 and $695, while garden suites start at
$475.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened off by these steep tariffs, we opted instead for the
Hana Kai-Maui Resort, which offers 18 beach-motel-like units on
Hana Bay. The rooms, priced between $125 and $195 nightly, are
divided between two buildings, one of which faces the bay ... the
other of which faces the back of the first building. So you might
want to specify bay-front when you make your reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the rear building, the accommodations were found to be
pleasant -- primarily because they were in Hana. The room had a
broad wooden balcony with comfortable lounge furniture, a heavy
wood sliding door and screen, a ceiling fan, louvered windows on
the inland side of the unit (allowing the onshore breezes to
ventilate the place vigorously), and a full kitchen. It did not
include such amenities as beach towels, a hair dryer or an iron.
</P>
<P>
   The real appeal of the place was revealed at night. Sleeping
conditions were ideal -- so dark and so quiet, the only sounds
being the breakers rolling into Hana Bay and the tradewinds
ruffling the palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hana attribute is its friendliness -- a refreshing break
from a longstanding Hawaiian norm. In many areas where tourists
congregate, the aloha spirit is something of a fraud, as mainland
visitors are met with surliness or, worse, are ignored altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hana has yet to be infected with this. We
encountered locals who waved from passing cars, cheerfully offered
assistance at Hasegawa's General Store and, with the exception of
those serving breakfast at the Hana Ranch Restaurant, were
unfailingly congenial. We even felt welcome at the softball game.
</P>
<P>
   After three days here it was difficult to leave, but an
adventure beckoned. The great majority of visitors to Hana return
the way they came, tackling anew the corkscrews of the Hana
Highway. The idea of heading west on the Piilani Highway -- perhaps
because the rental-car company so strenuously discouraged it --
seemed infinitely more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive is strongly recommended for its 26 miles of
dirt road, primarily because the frequency of Haleakala's stormy
fury can create some suddenly sloppy passages. But many travelers
tackle the risks of this route in compact rentals. While never
having to shift into four-wheel, we encountered three women in a
Chevy Cavalier and one fellow in a Mustang with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Hana, a popular stop with travelers is Oheo Gulch,
where a mountain stream cascades over elaborate rock formations,
forming a series of swimming holes large and small -- commonly but
inaccurately referred to as the aforementioned Seven Sacred Pools.
It is the destination and turn-around point for many of the Hana
Highway day-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of Haleakala National Park, and you can't miss
the crowded parking lot. Most people follow trails to the big pools
below the road, and by afternoon these swimming and rock-leaping
spots look like tourist ant hills. The pools above the road are
usually deserted, perhaps because there are no signs marking the
path to them.
</P>
<P>
   To reach them, follow a trail that parallels the road just west
of the gulch bridge (on the ocean side of the road). When you
encounter a road sign that reads ``Parking, 0.2 miles,'' cross the
road and pick up a trail that descends to the upper pools. The
mountain runoff can be bracing, but afterward you can regain warmth
by lying across one of the sun-washed boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Driving west from Oheo Gulch, you'll probably be on your own
soon after passing the idyllic bluff that is home to the Palapala
Hoomau Congregational Church, where famed aviator Charles Lindbergh
chose to be buried after living out his final years in Hana.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the road works its way along windswept coastal bluffs,
the ride can be equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. On some
tight turns, the salt spray was blowing through the driver-side
window. Grassy hillsides swept down to gray-pebble beaches that
were utterly deserted. The ocean was absurdly blue, perhaps because
the channel between here and the Big Island is more than a mile
deep in places.
</P>
<P>
   It was reassuring to see no tourist development, no signs of
life, not even any power poles at one point -- and to enjoy these
wide-open vistas for miles and miles. There are a few scattered
signs of habitation: the weathered Kaupo Store and farther on, a
barn-like missionary church built in 1886.
</P>
<P>
   We encountered a woman driving alone from the other direction
with a map spread on the passenger seat. ``How much farther to
civilization?'' she asked in a querulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   As desolate as this land might appear, it was once home to a
thriving civilization, attested to by hundreds of archaeological
sites. These southern reaches of Maui were covered with sandalwood
forest, but the trees were felled in the 1800s because newly
arrived traders placed an extreme value on the wood, and the land
soon became arid, suitable only for cattle grazing.
</P>
<P>
   As the road began to climb toward the western end of the island,
the views became ever more spectacular, with black-lava peninsulas
jutting out into a white-capped ocean. A stop at one turn in the
road provided, with only a slight turn of the head, a view of four
other protrusions in the Hawaiian archipelago: the Big Island (the
summit of Mauna Kea poking through a cloud bank), Kahoolawe, Lanai,
and the tiny sliver that is Molokini.
</P>
<P>
   Someday this road may be fully paved, closing the loop with the
Hana Highway, which is scheduled for extensive upgrades. Until
then, this corner of Hawaii will remain blissfully untouched.
</P>
<P>
   And Hana will remain Hana.
</P>
<P>
   ------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Hana is 51 miles from Kahului (where Maui's
airport is located) along highways 36 and 360. Southern California
freeway drivers see the mileage distance and assume they can get
there in an hour. But over the highway's final 34 miles, it becomes
a narrow road that clings to the edge of a verdant cliff and picks
its way across 56 one-lane bridges. It is a spectacularly beautiful
drive that should not be rushed. Stop frequently to enjoy the many
waterfalls and vistas. If you allow three hours, you'll appreciate
the drive infinitely more. Allow at least that much time to drive
from Hana to the Ulupalakua Ranch around the southern end of the
island on the Piilani Highway (Route 31). The distance is 36 miles
along a track that, for much of the way, is either dirt or battered
asphalt. Most rental-car companies consider your contract void on
this road. Before embarking, check with the rangers at the
Haleakala National Park/Oheo Gulch visitors center for an update on
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Brochure rates for rooms at the Hotel Hana-Maui start
at $475 for garden suites, $500 for a Sea Ranch Cottage. Packages
are offered. Information and reservations: (800) 321-4262 or (808)
248-8211; www.hotelhanamaui.com. If that's too steep for your
budget, you'll probably find the Hana Kai Maui Resort (an awfully
fancy name for a motel) to be perfectly adequate. Doubles from
$125. Information and reservations: (800) 346-2772 or (808)
248-8426; www.hanakaimaui.com. Hana also has a number of
bed-and-breakfast options, which can be found through an
exploration of guidebooks or Web searches. One excellent resource
is ``Hidden Maui,'' (Ulysses Press; $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The fine-dining options are fairly limited in Hana. As
in one. The restaurant at the Hotel Hana-Maui, imaginatively
referred to as the Main Dining Room, blends Pacific Islander, Asian
and American cuisine in a delightfully laid-back setting. If the
local fishermen have pulled in some papio, you might luck into an
entree of this delicate white fish, served grilled with garlic
butter sauce, stir-fried vegetables and mashed potatoes that have
been spread out on a griddle and flash-grilled. However, the best
thing about the restaurant is an hour of Hawaiian music presented
by local families, at 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   PICNIC FARE: If you're just making a day trip to Hana (as most
Maui visitors do), pause briefly in the town of Paia before
tackling the highway. Later, you'll be glad you did, because the
lunch fare in Hana is sorely lacking. At the Hana Ranch
Restaurant's snack window, they prepare deli sandwiches early in
the morning -- using bread no more interesting than hamburger buns
(the only choice). You don't want to think about what tuna salad on
a hamburger bun looks like five hours after assembly. For this,
they'll gladly charge you $6. Hasegawa General Store sells only
fixings, no pre-made sandwiches. Instead, stop in Paia (four miles
from the airport) at a place called Picnics -- just off the highway
at 30 Baldwin Ave. It prepares exceptional sandwiches and box
lunches targeted specifically for Hana Highway travelers.
</P>

Piilani Highway, contact the Maui Visitors Bureau at (800)

 Pit bull helps teens at psychiatric hospital  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAMELA H. SACKS   
 c. 2000 Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBORO, Mass. _ It's hard to imagine a less salubrious scenario than a pit
bull on a locked psychiatric ward for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's exactly the picture once a week at the University of
Massachusetts Adolescent Psychiatric Unit on the grounds of Westboro State
Hospital, where Keno, a 5-year-old pit bull, and his owner, Sharon May Etre,
spend an hour with some of the patients.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Etre and her tan-and-white muscle-bound hound invariably get an
enthusiastic welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ""Wow, a pit. I got a pit at home,'' is often the response, says Etre, who
lives in Northbridge with her husband and two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Keno hardly lives up to the reputation his breed has gained as a vicious
attack dog. Rather, he is a trained and licensed therapy dog with a soothing
effect.
</P>
<P>
   As they enter the unit, Etre and Keno first encounter an isolation room in
which patients in restraints are lying on the floor. A staff member sits in
the middle of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ""If the kids know him, they call him,'' Etre, 45, says. ""He runs up and
kisses them.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo then heads to a special therapy room with two couches. Etre brings
Keno's food, a brush for grooming and toys. She heads to one couch, and Keno
hops up on the other. An occupational therapist is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 teen-agers are on the ward at any one time. Only those who have
been well behaved are allowed to commune with Keno. The patients take their
turn and often are allowed just five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ""They seem like sad kids,'' Etre reflects. ""Some have the stare. Some
shake. Some are very slow and stiff. Others are screaming, and hyper, and
bouncing off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Keno often sits on a patient's lap. He can have a nearly magical effect,
eliciting a verbal reaction from a teen-ager who has not uttered a word in a
week. Many of the teens hug and kiss him.
</P>
<P>
   One girl wanted to teach Keno to give her his paw.
</P>
<P>
   ""She was a persistent little girl,'' Etre says. ""She was cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, dog, mistress, patient and therapist go for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the patients are victims of abuse, Etre says, and have committed
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ""They're not allowed to touch me, and we can't talk about where we live,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   As with the teens he helps, Keno's early life was fraught with trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Etre works as veterinary technician at the Tufts School of Veterinary
Medicine in neighboring Grafton. She first encountered Keno after he had
been abandoned at the school's small animal clinic. Veterinarians had just
repaired his shattered hip socket. The homeless 4-month-old puppy sat in a
cage wagging his tail, the cost of his surgery covered by a special fund for
indigent animals.
</P>
<P>
   Etre, who also teaches in the veterinary technology program at her alma
mater, Becker College in Leicester, had just lost her golden retriever,
Taffy. She decided to take the gentle pit bull home with her.
</P>
<P>
   ""He was very sweet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The term ""pit bull'' is slang for an American Staffordshire Terrier, or a
canine with some of that breed in its blood lines.
</P>
<P>
   Keno soon tested his mistress. But with the guidance of an animal
behaviorist, Etre taught him to be less territorial, to meet strangers, and
to allow her to take food out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, she saw a notice at Tufts about an opportunity for dogs to
qualify as licensed therapy canines. She knew the work would be perfect for
her pup. Etre prepared him by exposing him to strangers and taking him to
all sorts of public places.
</P>
<P>
   Harue Midtmoen, who, as a volunteer, runs the animal-assisted therapy
program in conjunction with the Tufts Center for Animals and Public Policy,
recalls that she was skeptical about whether a pit bull could make it as a
therapy dog.
</P>
<P>
   The test was tough.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluator challenged Keno by walking directly up to him and making eye
contact, an encounter a dog tends to interpret as a threat. She put her
fingers in his ears, picked up his feet, and pulled his tail. She threw a
bedpan and a walker at him. She walked him around other dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ""There was no aggression. He retrieved the bedpan,'' says Etre, amused at
the recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ""The way he behaved, the way she trained him, he did a beautiful job, and
he passed with no problem at all, '' Midtmoen recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Midtmoen then inquired about Keno's home circumstances and learned he had
been raised with two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ""Well, we have a very special place for you _ a locked psychiatric ward,''
Etre recalls being told.
</P>
<P>
   Midtmoen says the match was pretty close to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ""Among the teen-agers, the pit bull is the greatest thing,'' she says.
""They think he's so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Etre was a little frightened when she and Keno walked into Westboro State
Hospital for the first time back in March 1999. Now, she feels sorry if they
miss a session because she knows the patients are eagerly awaiting their
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ""They need more therapy dogs there,'' she says. ""It's sad.''

 &HT;    SENATE-PASSED PIPELINE BILL CALLED `ENTIRELY INADEQUATE'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The parents of three youths killed last year in a
gasoline pipeline explosion asked House members Tuesday to reject a
pipeline safety bill passed by the Senate this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would do little to improve pipeline safety, said
the parents of Stephen Tsiorvas, Wade King and Liam Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The three youths died when a gasoline pipeline operated by
Olympic Pipe Line Co. ruptured and exploded in Bellingham, Wash.,
on June 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter circulated among members of the House, the parents
called for enactment of a stronger bill and complained that members
of Congress are easily swayed on pipeline safety matters by
industry lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the months since our children died, we have tried to make
their deaths have meaning by learning the obscure details of
pipeline safety regulation so that we might ensure that additional
pipeline tragedies are prevented,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our great disappointment, with a few notable exceptions,
Senate and House members are readily swayed by industry's arguments
against a stronger pipeline law, which do not hold up under
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by two House Democrats, who said a bill
approved Sept. 7 by the Senate was ``entirely inadequate'' to deal
with the pipeline safety problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellingham explosion and a natural gas pipeline explosion
that killed 12 people last month near Carlsbad, N.M., ``called
attention to a problem that will only grow worse if we do not
strengthen federal pipeline laws,'' Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
and James Oberstar, D-Minn., said in a ``Dear Colleague'' to other
House members.
</P>
<P>
   Both letters were circulated by pipeline safety proponents in an
effort to head off a House vote on the Senate bill under a
parliamentary maneuver that would prohibit consideration of
amendments.

HANDLING STARS WHO RESPOND TO AFFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christopher Guest will tell you that his new movie is
not about dogs. His mock documentary ``Best in Show,'' which opens
on Sept. 29, is set at a Westminster-like national dog competition
in Philadelphia, and its characters do include Winky the Norwich
terrier, Agnes the Shih Tzu and Beatrice the Weimaraner. But, Guest
says, the story is about the owners, not the animals, and he could
have found the same humor making a film about hospital workers or
art dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Guest himself is a man of many faces. He was Nigel Tufnel, the
longhaired, washed-up lead guitarist, in Rob Reiner's ``This Is
Spinal Tap'' (1984) and Corky St. Clair, the frisky Middle American
amateur theater director, in his own ``Waiting for Guffman''
(1997). In ``Best in Show,'' he's the down-home Harlan Pepper, a
bloodhound owner from Pine Nut, N.C., with visions of dog show
glory.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the hunter green and polished wood bar of the Mark
Hotel in Manhattan, he's a polite 52-year-old with short gray hair
and a voice that is, at least in an interview with a New York
reporter, American.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, also the Fifth Baron Haden-Guest of Saling in
the County of Essex, and London newspapers refer to his
second-generation-Hollywood wife of 16 years, Jamie Lee Curtis, as
Lady Hayden-Guest. Guest was actually born in New York, but his
father, a diplomat, whisked him away six months later, and a
lifetime of moving back and forth has left him with ``a slightly
schizophrenic feeling when I'm in London.'': Well, he is sitting in
New York, drinking English Breakfast tea. White.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie is distinctly North American, as is most of the
cast. That includes the usual suspects like Catherine O'Hara and
Eugene Levy as Cookie and Gerry Fleck, Winky's proud owners, who
compose and sing little ditties about their pet. (Levy wrote the
lyrics, one of which rhymes merrier, derriere and terrier.) Michael
McKean plays Stefan Vanderhoof, half of a gay New York couple who
own Agnes and her lookalike sister. And Parker Posey is Meg Swan,
half of a tightly wound yuppie couple who take Beatrice (who is
every bit as elegant as William Wegman's canine models) to their
psychotherapist because she saw them having sex. Fred Willard, whom
Guest met in 1969 when they appeared together in ``Little Murders''
at Circle in the Square, plays a dog show announcer whose
commentary constantly horrifies his British co-announcer, played by
Jim Piddock. That's what the show's organizers get for teaming two
guys named Buck and Trevor.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who wrote the film's script with Guest, says these
characters aren't really exaggerated. ``Everybody in our movie we
met on the dog show trail,'' he says. That includes, he swears, the
Anna Nicole Smith type (Jennifer Coolidge), married to a painfully
frail man named Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw), who appears to be 110
years old or so; and the Anne Heche lookalike (Jane Lynch) who is
the handler for Rhapsody in White, the Cabots' standard poodle.
When the two women's warm relationship is accidentally revealed
during the broadcast of the Mayflower Dog Show, Willard as the
announcer cries out, ``Rhapsody has two mommies!''
</P>
<P>
   Rhapsody, Winky, Agnes, Beatrice, Hubert the bloodhound and the
other 150 or so dog characters who appear in the film are all
played by dog-show champions, not actor dogs.
</P>
<P>
   So the animals didn't need rehearsals for the show sequence, but
the human actors did. ``The dogs all did very well,'' says Earlene
Luke, the retired Washington state handler who condensed her usual
eight-week course to five hours for Guest's unofficial canine
repertory company. ``They're good listeners and good mimics. But
there is a lot to it; it's not something that you just learn
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that a few professional owner-handlers appeared
in the show scenes as well (look for the people with the pointer,
the Siberian husky and the Shetland sheepdog).
</P>
<P>
   These animals deserve praise. After all, many of them spend a
good deal of their time traveling in crates in the luggage holds of
airplanes, being groomed within an inch of their lives and missing
out on some natural doggie pleasures. Levy remembers the first time
he met one of the show dogs being considered for the film. ``I took
him over to a parking lot, and he started hopping like a
grasshopper and rolling over and over,'' says Levy, whose family
dog back in Toronto is a 7-year-old Labrador-beagle mix named Lucy.
``The owner came over and said, `First time on grass.''' The dog
was 11 months old and lived in California.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Guest might have been equally horrified. He, Curtis and their
two children (ages 13 and 4{) have two 8-year-old dogs, Henry, a
Labrador-golden retriever mix, and Lucy (popular name), who is half
Akita and ``then the rest of it is a mystery.'' Both live outdoor
lives at home in California and travel only by car, when the family
is packing up for the two-day drive to their place in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive them personally, in the back of our truck, and my wife
flies with the children and meets me there,'' says Guest. ``We've
found a motel midway that allows dogs, and they're fantastic
travelers.'' And when they arrive, he adds, ``it's true heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a river on our property, and they get to run in these
fields and chase birds and jump in the river.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time, Guest contends, does he speak for his dog in funny
little voices (as his character Harlan does for Hubert, in a sort
of sweet Mortimer Snerd voice, pretending to brag, ``Hey, judge,
I'm the best one here'') or put clothes on them (``These are huge
dogs; it would be embarrassing''). Nor does he refer to Henry and
Lucy as ``the kids.'' (Which is how this film idea got started. Six
years ago he overheard dog owners at a California park doing just
that.) But like most pet owners, he does seem to turn a little soft
when talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   He does an impressive imitation of Lucy's ``amazing wolf howl,''
which she makes every time they drive up to the house. He explains
what very different creatures the two animals are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry is a retriever, so his entire life is chasing a tennis
ball,'' says Guest. ``And Lucy will watch with disdain at this
futile hobby, basically. And it is amazing. Obviously it's tempting
always to anthropomorphize, but Lucy will look at Henry as if `How
can you be so stupid? Why would you waste your energy.' She sits
there with her paws crossed, to make him feel even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogs in ``Best in Show'' definitely come off better than the
humans do. You don't see dogs becoming hysterical and verbally
abusive over the loss of a bumblebee-shaped toy. Or packing eight
kimonos for a 48-hour stay in Philadelphia. Or singing ``Barbara
Allen'' over the telephone to their owners. But as silly as these
human behaviors may be, Guest says he is not ridiculing the
characters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't make movies that make fun of anything,'' he says. ``I
think if you like the people, that's the important thing. Because
if you don't like these people, if they were just to be a
one-dimensional parody, then you have no investment emotionally in
the end when you're waiting to hear who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have played Nigel of Spinal Tap, he says, if he
didn't really love music. Although ``Red, White and Blaine,'' the
sesquicentennial tribute to Blaine, Mo., in ``Waiting for
Guffman,'' is a truly terrible show, it still has a little of
theater's magic, the power to transport.
</P>
<P>
   So Guest certainly doesn't think dog owners or dog-show-circuit
egulars are any more mentally off-balance than the rest of us. He's
quite sure, for instance, that his passion for retiring to a
special place in the house, putting on magnifying glasses and tying
fishing flies _ ``would be incredibly strange to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you sit at this table and take deer hair and muskrat
fur and wind it onto a hook?'' he says. ``What could you be
thinking?'' But that doesn't mean that some examples of
contemporary urban pet-owner behavior won't cause him to raise an
eyebrow. Someone mentions a high-strung dachshund named Patti who
is on either Zoloft or Tofranil for chronic separation anxiety and
the $300-a-session dog psychologist who prescribed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Guest, ``that's another movie.''

   PHOENIX _ The Scottsdale patrolman patted down Gary Tredway,
slapped the handcuffs on him and put him in the back of the
cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway tensed his body. Memories of demonstrating against the
Vietnam War rushed to his mind. So did thoughts of a jail cell. The
businessman with the six-figure salary became agitated.
</P>
<P>
   He talked fast and loudly, sweating badly, as he tried to get
out of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' he said. ``It went through my mind
that this was the end of me. All they had to do was take my picture
and get my fingerprints, and I was finished.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the officer realized he had made a mistake,
that Tredway was the victim of a misunderstanding involving one of
his former tenants. The officer removed the handcuffs and drove
away. Tredway's secret was safe.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way Tredway lived for 28 years. He watched cops,
avoided cameras and stayed out of trouble. If he didn't, his secret
would come out: He was Howard L. Mechanic, a former Vietnam
protester running from a federal prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This past February, his secret finally surfaced. But it didn't
come from a police officer's questions; it came out when a reporter
interviewed him for _ of all things _ his run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she would keep my secret safe,'' he said of a
reporter for the Scottsdale (Ariz.) Tribune. ``I had a good track
record. Every other person who knew me kept the secret. I thought
she would, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, a federal jury convicted Mechanic, a 22-year-old
college student from Shaker Heights, Ohio, of throwing a cherry
bomb at St. Louis firefighters during a protest the day after the
Kent State University shootings. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was charged, convicted and sentenced to five years in
prison for impeding law enforcement officials during a campus
uprising. He became the first person convicted under the Civil
Disobedience Act of 1968. After an appeals court upheld the
conviction, he was told to report to prison.
</P>
<P>
   He ran instead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Mechanic changed his name, got married, had a
family, got divorced, became a successful businessman and worked as
one of Phoenix's biggest civic activists.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his run is over, and the man who worked to avoid the eyes
of federal agents now wants the world to see how the government
made an example of him.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Mechanic, 52, pleaded guilty to fleeing to avoid a
prison sentence. A judge ordered him to serve four months, a
sentence that will run concurrently with the five-year term he was
supposed to start serving in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked President Clinton to commute his sentence, a
request his new attorney, Thomas Hoidal, believes will be decided
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters also are encouraged that a friend and former
student radical admitted recently that he, not Mechanic, threw the
cherry bomb into the crowd of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of mistakes that I'm not proud of, but I
shouldn't be crucified for what I did. This sentence is overkill,''
Mechanic said from the Florence Correctional Center outside
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with honors in 1966 from high school in Ohio,
he went to Washington University in St. Louis. He demonstrated
against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention
in Chicago with his twin brother, Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 1970, hundreds of students in St. Louis demonstrated
against the slayings at Kent State. The protests took place near
the campus Air Force ROTC building, which was set on fire. Mechanic
said he stood by and watched. A fellow student, Donald Bird, told
authorities that Mechanic had a cherry bomb on him at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was convicted of state charges of violating a court
order against demonstrating on the campus and was sentenced to six
months in jail. Sentenced with him was a friend from Cleveland
named Lawrence Kogan.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in jail played a role in his later decision to
run. A guard told Mechanic, ``If I had the chance, I would put a
bullet through your head.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting out of jail, Mechanic was tried on the federal
charges. Bird, who died in 1983, told jurors that anyone could have
heaved the powerful firecracker. Mechanic denied touching it, but
the jury didn't believe him.
</P>
<P>
   While his case was on appeal, Mechanic sold his possessions,
earning about $4,000. He already had a plan for the money.
</P>
<P>
   He got on the bus in St. Louis and got off in Tempe, Ariz. He
has been in the area ever since. He obtained a new identity and a
new driver's license. He worked odd jobs, including some at natural
foods stores. He and a friend later started a business recycling
cars.
</P>
<P>
   He married Ingrid Gold in 1981 and divorced her four years
later. They had a son, Ari, who kept his mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Mechanic stayed away from most political rallies,
fearing he would be recognized. He felt uneasy, talking politics
for hours with friends and watching them go off to rallies while he
stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to go near cameras and walked the other way when he
saw a police officer. He once even went into a post office,
wondering whether he would see his image on a wanted poster. He
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold and her son were among about 20 people who knew Mechanic's
secret. He talked with other family members from pay phones, but
they still wondered about his safety and what he was doing. He also
kept in touch with his identical twin, Harvey, who was arrested
``three to five times'' in the mistaken belief that he was his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pain, but it was relatively minor compared to what he
was going through,'' said Harvey Mechanic, now a lawyer in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Mechanic eventually moved to Scottsdale. He kept his
natural foods business and opened a hotel/apartment complex called
the Abode.
</P>
<P>
   The business was profitable, and he shared his wealth. He
contributed to Greenpeace, Food First and the Gentle Strength Co-op
of Phoenix. Before he was arrested, h was working only two hours a
day at his business; much of his time went to his causes.
</P>
<P>
   He fought for stricter campaign finance laws and took on major
corporations that wanted to use tax money to build sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   And he looked for love. In 1994, he put a notice in the Phoenix
alternative paper, the New Times, seeking a vegetarian who loved
politics, worked as an activist and didn't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that, and I knew I had to respond,'' said Janet
Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she watched in shock when the patrol officer
nearly hauled Mechanic off to jail for the misunderstanding. ``He
was unreasonably anxious under the circumstances,'' Grossman said.
``I wouldn't have reacted like that. But now I realize that he had
good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   When the scare wore off, Mechanic plunged back into his
activism. He said he gradually entered public life, believing that
it wasn't as risky as before. Friends persuaded him to run for
Scottsdale City Council.
</P>
<P>
   But he panicked when Penny Overton, a reporter for the
Scottsdale Tribune, interviewed him for a routine candidate
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she left, I freaked out,'' he said. ``There's a
difference between being an activist and a candidate for City
Council. No one looks into your background when you're an
activist.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Overton to ask how the story was going. When she told
him she would look into his background a bit, he panicked again. He
called and asked her to come over again.
</P>
<P>
   He told her about his past. He pleaded with her to keep it a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a contract with our readers,'' said James Ripley, the
paper's editor. ``It's not our job to keep secrets. If we would
have hid that information, we would have lost all credibility with
our readers, and that's all we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic surrendered to federal marshals shortly after the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic's chances of getting out early might have increased
this month. Kogan, his longtime friend, admitted that he threw the
cherry bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lighted the thing, and I threw it,'' Kogan told the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Kogan was pardoned by President Reagan in the 1980s of charges
connected with the demonstration. Now a psychologist in St. Louis,
he refuses to talk further.
</P>
<P>
   Though the confession gave Mechanic hope, he has struggled to
get used to prison life. He focuses on writing a book and
reconnecting with his family, who still have so many questions
about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, Harvey, is a lawyer. My daughter (Marilyn) is a
retired teacher. But I always had to wonder about what my third
child was doing,'' said Ralph Mechanic, Howard's father. ``When we
would walk down the street, in the first years after he left, I
would see a beggar, and I would wonder, `Is that what my son has
become?'''
</P>
<P>
   When that reunion will happen remains in doubt. If Clinton
denies the request, Mechanic could obtain parole in 20 months. In
either case, Mechanic said he is looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take me some time, but I want to spend the rest of my
life working for community projects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never recommend that anyone take off like I did. But
the times were different back then, and everything seemed so right,
so I did it. I'm not going to be my own Monday-morning quarterback.
I truly believe the good that I've done far outweighs the bad.''

 Busy money market revs up iMoneyNet  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB KIEVRA   
 c. 2000 Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBORO, Mass. _  For Peter G. Crane, the ups and downs of the stock market
have the same result: more cash for his weekly analysis.
</P>
<P>
   From his fourth-floor office off Research Drive, Crane and a staff of 30 at
iMoneyNet Inc. keep tabs on money market mutual funds, which investors
poured cash into during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, looking for higher interest rates, have flocked to money market
mutual funds, turning them into parking places for cash or mega checking
accounts. Total assets in money market funds tripled during the 1990s,
rising from $502 billion to $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ""We see the money fund business as a great place to be in,'' said Crane,
vice president and managing editor at iMoneyNet.  ""Money market mutual
funds have been getting a bigger share of the consumer's wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   To serve a public eager for financial information, iMoneyNet this year
broadened the scope of its business and moved from Ashland to an office park
on Route 9 in Westboro.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created in April with the merger of IBC Financial Data and
the Bradshaw Financial Network. The new company remains a subsidiary of
Informa Financial Information Inc., also of Westboro, which is a subsidiary
of the London-based Informa Group plc.
</P>
<P>
   The combination brings together the mutual fund industry _ which was
monitored by IBC Financial _ and the Bradshaw Network _ which tracked banks,
thrifts, credit unions, mortgage companies, credit card issuers and other
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Faxes and modems carry information from hundreds of banks and mutual fund
companies into iMoneyNet's 10,500 square feet of space at 1 Research Drive.
From there, a staff of statisticians, researchers and production workers
verify and collate the information for publication and dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the data is used for the company's signature publication, Money Fund
Report, a weekly newsletter that provides yield, asset, average maturity,
and portfolio composition on virtually the entire universe of 1,484 money
market mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some information, formerly available through newspapers or magazines, is  on
the Internet. The company's Web site _ imoneynet.com _ highlights
top-yielding money funds, payouts on certificates of deposit, and the best
deals on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ""It's really a showcase of our data,'' said Crane.  ""We act as an
independent provider of news at a time when more and more people are looking
for such information.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors have long subscribed to the company's money fund
newsletter, but consumers are increasingly investment-savvy and are able and
willing to shift their assets with the click of a mouse, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   IMoneyNet helps consumers navigate the increasingly larger and complex
financial sectors, offering for free some research and data accumulated on
behalf of their corporate clients, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   IMoneyNet sees itself as a content provider _ a company that will post data
on its Web site or provide the information to others, Crane said. IMoneyNet
provides data to Intuit Inc. for Quicken.com.  It also provides information
to American Online and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   The company formed a partnership this year with Domania.com, a Boston-based
real estate services provider.
</P>
<P>
   ""It's easier for us to create alliances with companies that have
information that's useful to our customers,'' said John Stevens, a spokesman
for Domania. ""IMoneyNet has a great reputation for their data and was able
to provide us daily updates from 120 markets in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   IMoneyNet's Web site receives about 300,000 monthly hits, much of it from
people looking for updates on money market mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Money funds represent about 24 percent of the $7.08 trillion mutual fund
industry, compared to 11.2 percent for bond funds and 64.8 percent for stock
or hybrid funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999, 19 percent of households' short-term assets were held in
money funds, up from 11 percent in 1990.  During the last five years, the
percentage of households owning money funds (including through retirement
accounts) rose from 10 percent to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have a lot of people searching the Web each night for accurate
mutual fund information, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the economy purring, consumers are frequently abandoning their
normal banks to look on the Web for the best rates on loans, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   ""More and more people are looking for quality, credible information,''
Crane said. ""We're good at it and expect that we'll be successful in these
new ventures.''

IRREGULARS PROVIDE THE FUN AT LANDS' END 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Md., Miss., Calif.)   By PATRICIA R. OLSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting at a computer and taking phone orders for parkas, socks,
sheets and luggage eight hours a day might seem like a pretty
boring job. But ask the sales representatives at Lands' End how
they cope, and they are likely to tell you a funny story.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kitelinger tells this one. A customer called, but her
words were drowned out by her dog's barking. The woman apologized
and tried to shush her pet, but the barking only worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in exasperation, the customer made an unusual request.
``My daughter just left for college, and every time the phone rings
the dog thinks it's her,'' Kitelinger recalled her saying. ``She
calls and talks to him every day _ it's her dog. If I put the phone
to his ear, would you say a few words? He'll think you're my
daughter, and he'll stop barking.'' So Kitelinger talked to the
dog, and he stopped barking.
</P>
<P>
   When you get right down to it, most jobs can get pretty tedious.
A list of the most boring occupations would probably have to
include assembly-line worker, data processor, security guard,
parking-lot attendant, toll taker and cashier. At the higher end of
the income scale, lawyers, accountants and even investment bankers
have been known to complain about drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   So the 2,000 sales agents (3,000 in peak season) who work the
phones at Lands' End in Dodgeville, Wis., for pay that averages
about $24,000 a year are in good company. And like just about
anyone else who finds himself fighting the monotony of a workplace
routine, they are finding that it is the unpredictable, often
eccentric behavior of the people they interact with that adds a
little spice to their day.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a recent call handled by Ruth Lang. Lang, who raises
llamas in her spare time, works the night shift. At 11:30 one
Friday in July, a woman called to ask for a favor. She was being
married the next day, the woman said, and was spending the night
with her sister at a hotel that did not have a wake-up service.
``I'm petrified we're going to oversleep,'' she said. ``We've been
trying to think of who might be awake early, and I know Lands' End
is open 24 hours. Would you mind calling me in the morning and
making sure I'm up?'' Lang stuck a Post-it on her computer to
remind her. At 5 a.m., she called the woman and announced: ``This
is your Lands' End wake-up service.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls about impending weddings seem to gravitate to Lands' End.
Just last month, Sunny Bresett took an order from a distraught
bride-to-be. The woman was being married on Saturday, four days
away, and her husband had forgotten to order a suit. Bresett
arranged for a custom-hemmed suit, a belt, shoes and socks to be
delivered to the groom's hotel the day before the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, employees go so far beyond the call of duty that
their behavior seems to defy rational explanation. It could have
been boredom with her routine, it could have been Midwestern
hospitality or it could have been simple generosity that motivated
Di McCormick in customer service to act as she did. When a man in
Missouri called this summer to complain about the crease in the
sleeve of the pink mesh polo shirt he had ordered from Lands' End
and asked if she could please send him a shirt without such a
crease, she sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick picked 10 identical pink shirts, steamed them all with
an industrial steamer, washed them, steamed them again and sent the
man the best one. Now he's her steady customer. She did the same
with yellow and orange polo shirts for him this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of service may be hard to beat, but a couple of
winters ago, Ruth Shober, another employee who is also a llama
farmer, came close. Shober received a call from a woman who had
dropped a Lands' End canvas purse while crossing the street. The
purse was plastered with mud and road salt, the customer said, and
she wanted to know how she should clean it.
</P>
<P>
   Shober had learned from her husband, an engineer with the
Wisconsin Transportation Department, that rock salt is a calcium
compound. She suggested that the caller take a stiff brush and rub
the rock salt off. If there was any residual dirt, the woman should
wipe the purse with a damp cloth. That night, Shober found a piece
of burgundy canvas comparable to the purse fabric, walked to a busy
highway, dropped the canvas in the mud and rock salt and then
followed her own cleaning instructions. They worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't,'' Shober said, ``I was prepared to call the
customer back with a few more ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the calls that pour into Lands' End are
pretty run of the mill. On a recent Tuesday morning, Jean Slapak, a
14-year employee, helped Donna Passwaters from Severn, Md., buy
monogrammed, hooded bath cover-ups for her twin infant grandsons
and easily dispatched slipcovers to Cornelia Barrentine from Pass
Christian, Miss. She assisted another customer picking out just the
right color sheets, advising her that garnet is a ``blueish or ruby
red'' and suggesting, ``Wouldn't either the pale yellow or
cappuccino cases go well with the garnet, for a nice, soft
complementary color?'' She assured a caller from Los Angeles that
the vacation clothes she had ordered at the last minute would
arrive by Friday for a small extra charge. She helped Christine
Pinson of Yorba Linda, Calif., order school-uniform shirts
monogrammed with her daughters' school logo.
</P>
<P>
   No material here for the Lands' End ``calls of fame'' list. But
never mind. She will get another oddball request soon enough, she
assumes; she averages three or four a day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every sales representative has her favorite yarn. Jeanne
McGuire got an urgent plea on the company's fax hotline not long
ago from a man who had been on his way out the door to a formal
affair when he realized he did not know how to tie his bow tie.
McGuire faxed him directions and saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   And Eldora Alexander remembers helping a woman find just the
right size of children's Polartec pajamas for her Dalmation. The
woman planned to cut the feet out of the one-piece sleeper as well
as a hole for the dog's tail, but could not decide whether to order
it in small or large. Alexander had her measure the dog's girth and
then compared this figure with the child chest measurements for the
pajamas. The verdict: large.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A MODERN EMBELLISHMENT FOR BROOKLYN'S BEAUX-ARTS
JEWEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parabuilding, a new addition to an older
structure, continues to entrench itself as a vibrantly contemporary
architectural type. The Brooklyn Museum of Art has unveiled the
genre's most recent example: a monumental main entrance for the
museum's Eastern Parkway facade.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by James Stewart Polshek of the Polshek Partnership,
architects of the Rose Earth and Space Center at the American
Museum of Natural History, the project draws its visual impact from
the contrast between its assertively modern forms and the museum's
classical Beaux-Arts design. But the architectural value of this
parabuilding lies in the stunning rigor with which it reveals the
founding principles of the Beaux-Arts School.
</P>
<P>
   The $55 million project, which was presented on Tuesday before
the city Landmarks Preservation Commission, replaces the
long-vanished staircase originally designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White
for their 1897 building. The stairway was amputated when the
entrance lobby was demoted from the building's piano nobile, on the
third floor, to its decidedly ignoble basement. The surgery left
scars: a blank-faced entrance, with classical columns dangling
their feet in the air overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The new design grows out of the 1986 master plan developed by
the Polshek Partnership in collaboration with Arata Isozaki &AMP;
Associates of Tokyo. As much a work of landscape as of
architecture, the design is an asymmetrical composition that plays
against the classical symmetry of the museum's facade.
</P>
<P>
   The semicircular plan radiates outward from the center of the
existing stone facade. Its most conspicuous feature is a roof of
clear glass that sweeps across the facade in a series of ascending,
overlapping arcs. A finely tuned engineering system of metal struts
and cables holds the glass aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's main lobby, which is to be completely remodeled,
lies directly beneath the roof. It is entered from the right side,
as you face the building, through a row of bronze-and-glass doors.
The remainder of the project fans outward from the entrance lobby
in an arrangement of outdoor public spaces that extend the
semicircular shape toward Eastern Parkway. Proceeding around the
semicircle from left to right, these include a sloping lawn, an
amphitheater for outdoor performances, a fountain of towering,
vertical plumes, and expanse of grass steps, in effect a park in
the shape of a ziggurat.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are interrupted by a grand, ceremonial walkway that
leads from Eastern Parkway and the subway entrance to the museum's
front door. A passerelle, or aerial promenade, skirts the perimeter
of the glass roof, creating something of a UFO silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   This concept reverses the hierarchical associations of the
traditional Beaux-Arts stairway. Instead of symbolizing an ascent
into the privileged realm of high culture, the design transforms
the steps into people places. In addition to leading the eye toward
the museum's entrance, the design invites visitors to seat
themselves and gaze outward.
</P>
<P>
   This panorama deserves to be seen as a work of art in itself:
Eastern Parkway, designed by Olmsted and Vaux in 1870-74, was the
first parkway built in the United States. The adjacent Prospect
Park, which Olmsted and Vaux considered more successful than their
Central Park, is a landmark in the physical engineering of modern
democracy. Polshek's parabuilding reflects a fundamental change in
the relationship between the museum and the community. Rather than
a self-contained entity, secure behind its rows of classical
columns, the museum now exercises centrifugal force. But it
reinvigorates the democratic ethos of the 19th-century park
movement.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As many New Yorkers are aware, the Brooklyn Museum of Art
represents only a fraction of the building originally envisioned by
Charles McKim. In the grandiose spirit of the Gilded Age this was
intended to be the largest museum in the world. The dome that rises
over the museum's portico is one of a quartet that were designed to
surround the building's central space, an immense rotunda
surmounted by a hemisphere twice the height as the one actually
built.
</P>
<P>
   Polshek and Isozaki derived their inspiration for the
semicircular plan from a staircase designed by McKim for an eastern
entrance to the building. Like that earlier scheme, the Polshek
design echoes the dome motif. For the historically minded the
design also recalls the Salle des Prix, a room at the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts in Paris, the progenitor of the values for which McKim,
Mead &AMP; White are known. We must look to this room, and the ideas
issued from it, to appreciate the intelligence of the Polshek
design.
</P>
<P>
   The room, also known as the hemicycle, has been described by the
historian Joseph Rykwert as the school's ``spiritual center.'' It
was here that students were indoctrinated with ideas first
enunciated in the early 19th century by Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand.
</P>
<P>
   As Rykwert has written, Durand was a child of the Enlightenment
and the Revolution. He was a rationalist, that is to say, a man who
believed that architecture should be subject to laws as strict,
logical and absolute as those governing science. He proposed that
abstract geometric forms, like those used by Newton in his
scientific calculations, be adapted for architectural use. Of these
the circle and the sphere symbolized supreme perfection. That is
the idea represented in the semicircular form of the Salle de Prix,
in the dome of the Brooklyn Museum's rotunda and in the new Polshek
design.
</P>
<P>
   To the uneducated eye the Polshek design may at first appear to
violate the classical tradition evoked by McKim's Beaux-Arts
building. In fact, as Rykwert has persuasively argued, that
tradition was shattered by the Beaux-Arts itself.
</P>
<P>
   Durand's insistence on abstract geometric form introduced a
novel and wholly ahistorical approach to architectural design. When
he and his pupils employed the classical orders, their intention
was not to reinforce continuity with the past. Rather they believed
that the orders were suited to serve the transcendent ideal of
absolute reason. Neither the Greeks, nor Vitruvius, nor Alberti and
the great builders of the Renaissance would have understood this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Polshek has. He has grasped it more firmly than McKim, Mead &AMP;
White. The Brooklyn Museum is a steel-framed building. The
structure adheres to a far more rational logic than the stone
facades laid atop it. By exposing the structure of the
parabuilding, Polshek has revealed the rational system that enables
the museum to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it coaxes into full view the ideal of geometric
abstraction articulated in the Salle des Prix. By a happy bit of
symbolism, the museum's classical columns will appear to rise from
the abstract, transparent semicircle of the new roof, as if the
founding ideas of the Beaux-Arts have at least been accorded their
proper place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Something else will undoubtedly be coaxed into view by this
thoughtful, handsome design: the intolerance of knee-jerk
preservationists toward new works that exhibit a far more profound
grasp of the tradition they claim to represent. When the clamor
dies down, it will be seen that the Brooklyn Museum is a living
institution that has added a major new work to its collection.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime we should keep in mind Rykwert's observation on
the Beaux-Arts school and its impact on classical architecture:
``The Ecole des Beaux-Arts has stood for a century and a half as an
all-too-solid monument to the classical tradition. But some of us
think that if it were dismantled, the tomb might turn out to have
been empty all the time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's visit to the United States and Canada in August
was watched with acute interest. It was the first ever made by a
Mexican president-elect from an opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   And most remarkable, Fox succeeded in setting his own agenda,
rather than having to adhere to any American-imposed program.
</P>
<P>
   The first public act by Vicente Fox in the United States as
president-elect was to meet with some 30 leaders of the Mexican
community in New York. The symbolism of greeting his countrymen
first _ before dining with eight of America's most powerful bank
and industry executives _ did not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, before talks with the governor of Texas, Fox insisted
on first seeing 40 leaders of the Mexican community in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   His meetings with American dignitaries were also out of the
ordinary. Vice-president Al Gore welcomed Fox at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, skipping lunch to talk to Fox and resisting
countless requests from cabinet and official agencies clamoring to
make special petitions to Mexico, limited the number of
participants to three: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and Chief of Staff John
Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   And lastly, George W. Bush made an afternoon trip from Miami to
meet Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's innovative idea to include in his entourage three
representatives of Non Governmental Organizations, as well as to
address various groups of NGOs both in Toronto and in Washington,
drew praise _ and astonishment _ from Clinton as well as Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   As for the timing of the tour, for some it was an advantage, but
for others it was less so.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Gore and the Democrats in general, Fox's visit and his
positions were perhaps discomforting. And many observers were left
with the impression that the American vice-president profited less
from his meeting with Fox than his Republican challenger did.
</P>
<P>
   But it is simple to explain: the Democrats, traditionally more
open to migration and ethnic issues, more flexible regarding
measures to fight drug trafficking, and closer to the Latino vote _
particularly the Mexican-American _ are in a more sensitive
position.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, they must protect their right flank to avoid
Republican criticism that they are ``soft on Mexicans,'' and of
failing to protect the border. But on the other, Democrats could
not run the risk of avoiding Fox, who is perceived as a hero by a
significant sector of the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   A poll, whose results were delivered to Fox while he was in the
United States, showed that more than 56 percent of Americans knew
of Fox's July 2 electoral victory, and that the percentage
increased in the West, i.e. in California, where the Hispanic vote
could be decisive for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, he has nothing to worry about. His hard line policy
on the death sentence and on border issues is well-known and thus
is an established basis from which to exchange ideas freely with
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   So, therefore, the paradox is that although Gore and the
Democrats are more sympathetic to Fox's positions, Bush and the
Republicans can afford themselves the luxury of receiving them more
positively.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's advantage lay in the fact that in being president-elect he
need not make promises, nor negotiate or lobby for his proposals,
but merely present ideas and thesis. The U.S. Congress being in
recess and the American presidential campaign as yet not in its
final push, gave him more space both in the media and in the
itineraries of many officials.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Americans setting the conversation on those
perennial issues they perceive as marring the social fabric of
Mexico _ corruption, drug-trafficking, violence, electoral fraud,
insecurity and human rights violations, plus the usual litany of
accusations (many of which are certainly valid), it was the Mexican
president-elect, this time, who determined the course of debate
without confronting his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   In Al Gore's words, according to what one of his advisors told
Hispanic TV network Univision, ``We would rather contemplate huge
ideas than minutiae.''
</P>
<P>
   Migration was at the top of the list, including better treatment
at the border, legalization of those Mexicans already in the United
States, negotiation for greater quotas for legal aliens and
relaxing immigration controls till the 2025 limit.
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed were such things as funds to increase social
stability in Mexico by reducing the salary gap, and for
infrastructure to expand Mexican and North American
competitiveness; as well as an end to certification in connection
with the fight against drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it was an ambitious agenda, a daring one that was
exquisitely Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   But, above all, there was a clear message, well conveyed, and
consistent with campaign promises and with the country's interests.

&HT;     MONUMENTAL MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital suffers from monument mania.
The city, cluttered with memorials to the great and not-so-great,
is running out of room.
</P>
<P>
   To check this marble madness, Congress passed a law more than a
decade ago forbidding the authorization of any new memorial in the
capital until the individual to be honored had been buried for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good rule. History can only judge the worthiness of our
national leaders from the distance of time after partisan passions
have faded and the consequences of controversial deeds assessed.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians are not famous for being patient. And so it is
that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay and other conservatives are
pushing for a new memorial to President Ronald Reagan to be placed
on the National Mall between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill would require junking the 25-year waiting
period, since Reagan, 89 and ailing, is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee swiftly approved the proposal, ignoring
warnings that the precedent would prompt a dash to create all sorts
of prominently located stone tributes honoring other partisan
favorites. The mall is already scheduled to be the home of two new
memorials _ one honoring those who fought in World War II and the
other honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The bloodiest war of
the century ended more than 50 years ago, and King was slain in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial to King, which would be the first honoring an
African-American civil rights leader, has not been controversial.
But strangely, the design and location of the World War II
memorial, a long overdue tribute to the 16 million men and women
who fought in a historic struggle to preserve democracy against
global tyranny, has been loudly criticized. Yet memorials to those
who fought in the Korean conflict and the Vietnam War are already
in place, making the World War II omission obscenely outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   So why the rush to plop Reagan's image in the middle of the most
visited turf in the nation's capital, guarded by statues of Thomas
Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln? Who declared that Reagan ranks right
up there with the true titans of history?
</P>
<P>
   One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. James Hansen (R-Utah), contends
Reagan deserves the honor because he ``initiated policies that won
the Cold War, protected and restored freedom and democracy around
the globe and lowered taxes on American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Wasn't the Cold War in a swoon before Reagan came
to town? Isn't this the same Reagan who came to power declaring
that ``government is the problem,'' cruelly slashing domestic
programs that millions of Americans depended on?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this the same man whose legacy included several Cabinet
scandals _ the covert weapons sales to Iran and an illegal war in
Nicaragua run out of the White House basement, the trumped-up
Grenada invasion, the mismanaged occupation of Lebanon in which 241
Marines were killed, harsh social policies that penalized the poor
and a combination of excessive defense spending and tax cuts for
the rich that produced the biggest national budget deficits ever?
</P>
<P>
   At best, Reagan's place in history is something less than
secure. At worst, it is somewhere down among the ranks of mediocre
presidents. Three surveys of historians since he left office have
put him no better than 20th in distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Republican-controlled Congress renamed
Washington National Airport after the former president last year,
despite protests from Democrats that they use the airport too.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last downtown buildings to be completed along
legendary Pennsylvania Avenue was also named after Reagan, a
handsome stone structure formerly called the International Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign was launched after Reagan left the White House to add
his face to the profiles of four presidents carved on the side of
Mount Rushmore in remote South Dakota. Fortunately, that idea
flopped. Four stone heads are enough. The mountain is full.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should slow down this unseemly rush to mold Reagan's
reputation in bricks, mortar and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   If he is worthy, his image will stand the test of time on its
own. If he is not, the nation will avoid the embarrassment of
glorifying a controversial president who may have meaning for the
moment but will fade in importance over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the monument to George Washington did not begin
until 49 years after his death. The memorial to Thomas Jefferson
was not complete until 134 years after his death, and Franklin
Roosevelt's memorial was not opened until 52 years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   By then, we had a good idea why we wanted to honor those heroes.
And there was a solid bipartisan consensus that we were doing the
right thing. There is none behind the proposed Reagan memorial.

   El rio Danubio fluye en direccion este desde la Selva Negra a
traves de Alemania y Austria rumbo a Hungria donde, de manera
abrupta, tuerce y enfila en direccion sur hacia Budapest, como si
no pudiera resistir el atractivo de la ciudad.
</P>
<P>
   Llamado el ``Duna'' en hungaro, el Danubio atraviesa Budapest
dividiendola en dos, Buda en la margen derecha, y Pest en la ribera
izquierda. Por cierto, las dos poblaciones, en una epoca
independientes, junto con una mas pequena, Obuda, se unieron solo
en 1873, algunos anos despues de la creacion de la monarquia
austro-hungara. Poco despues, Budapest se convirtio en una capital
real equiparable a Viena.
</P>
<P>
   Gran parte del encanto del siglo diecinueve ha sido restaurado
desde que la caida del comunismo puso fin a un prolongado, sombrio
capitulo de la historia hungara.
</P>
<P>
   Desde la primavera de 1990, cuando se efectuaron las primeras
elecciones libres en mas de medio siglo, Budapest ha vuelto a dar
la bienvenida a los visitantes en su elegante umbral.
</P>
<P>
   Geograficamente, las dos mitades de la ciudad son muy
diferentes. Buda se alza en una serie de boscosas elevaciones,
coronadas por los contrafuertes de la Colina del Castillo y las
espiras de la iglesia de San Matias; Pest, a su vez, se extiende en
una planicie detras de un bello boulevard que flanquea el Danubio.
Pero ambas partes de la ciudad estan engalanadas con bellas plazas,
tejados de mayolica, techos de azulejos con elementos decorativos y
viviendas pintadas de amarillo, rosado o verde.
</P>
<P>
   Hay esplendidos edificios disenados en estilo ``Art Nouveau'' en
ambas margenes del rio, aunque algunos de ellos se hallan en mal
estado, ademas de cafeterias donde una persona puede sentarse y
leer el periodico en un ambiente que recuerda mas los finales del
siglo diecinueve que el comienzo del siglo veintiuno.
</P>
<P>
   Hay musica por todas partes en esta tierra de Franz Liszt y
Franz Lehar. Y eso sin mencionar jazz, pop, rock y tecno, que
forman parte de la activa vida nocturna de la ciudad. Tambien hay
banos termales, por los cuales Budapest es justamente famosa, con
opulentos salones y piscinas de agua caliente que son una herencia
de los romanos y de los turcos otomanos.
</P>
<P>
   La ciudad romana de Aquincum (``aguas abundante''), capital de
la provincia de Panonia, se hallaba en lo que fue posteriormente
Obuda. En el siglo quinto de nuestra era, los romanos fueron
expulsados de la region por los hunos. En el curso de los siglos,
olas de barbaros fueron seguidos por magiares, otomanos y
finalmente, los Habsburgos. Entre 1686 y 1916, el destino de
Hungria estuvo firmemente vinculado al de Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Fue el ultimo emperador Habsburgo, Francisco Jose I, y su
consorte, la emperatriz Isabel, conocida como Sissi, quienes
transformaron el castillo de Buda, erigido en el siglo 13, en un
grandioso edificio neo-barroco que en la actualidad domina el
Danubio. Detras de puertas custodiadas por el ``turul'', el mitico
ave de rapina magiar, el castillo alberga tres museos: la Galeria
Nacional de Hungria, con arte que abarca desde la Edad Media hasta
el siglo veinte, el Museo de Historia de Budapest (que cuenta con
una bella capilla real del siglo 14) y el Museo Ludwig de Arte
Contemporaneo, cuya coleccion incluye obras de Frank Stella, Claus
Oldenburg, Joseph Beuys y Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   Con sus muros y pilares pintados con fuertes colores, la iglesia
de San Matias, de 700 anos de antiguedad, transformada en una
mezquita durante el imperio otomano, fue sitio de coronaciones y
bodas reales.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Jose y Sissi fueron coronados alli en 1867. Franz
Lizst condujo la orquesta que ejecuto la melodia ``Misa de la
Coronacion''.
</P>
<P>
   Un poco mas abajo, el Bastion de los Pescadores es un
extravagante edificio del siglo diecinueve. Consta de contrafuertes
de piedra pespunteados por siete torres rematadas en cupulas
conicas, una por cada tribu magiar. Construido en 1896, cuando la
ciudad se aprestaba a celebrar el milenio de su fundacion, ofrece
maravillosas vistas de Pest, que se halla del otro lado del rio.
</P>
<P>
   Belvaros, el historico distrito de Pest, es un centro comercial
y financiero. Tambien alli se encuentra el parlamento hungaro, el
Orszaghaz, una fantasia neo-gotica muy similar al parlamento de
Londres.
</P>
<P>
   En el corazon del distrito para peatones, la plaza Vorosmarty
esta flanqueada por cafeterias situadas en terrazas. Entre ellas
figura el famoso salon de te Gerbeaud, en cuyo bello interior hay
mostradores con cubierta de vidrio repletos de irresistibles dulces
y tortas. Para llegar a esos cafes hay que recorrer calles repletas
de musicos, artistas y caricaturistas, pero es algo que merece la
pena visitar.
</P>
<P>
   Cerca de la plaza se halla la principal calle comercial, Vaci
utca, frecuentemente repleta de turistas, por lo que conviene
tambien ir a calles aledanas como Petofi Sandor, Haris, Kigyo y
Szabadsajto. (No se pierda Parizsi udvar, un pasaje cubierto con
cupulas de cristal que data del siglo diecinueve y se halla pegado
a la calle Parizsi, o Paris).
</P>
<P>
   Tambien en Pest abundan los museos documentando la historia de
Hungria, su mundo rural y sus artes decorativas, especialmente el
brillante periodo de Art Nouveau. El colosal Szevpuveszeti, el
Museo de Bellas Artes, posee soberbias colecciones de pinturas y
esculturas que van de los siglos 13 al 18. Entre sus piezan figuran
obras de Rafael, el Verones, Velazquez, Goya, Durero, Rubens y Van
Dyck. Tambien conviene visitar la iglesia de San Esteban, con su
ornamentado interior y, a algunas cuadras de distancia, en el
barrio judio, la Gran Sinagoga de la calle Dohany, la mas extensa
de Europa. Theodor Herzl, cuyos suenos de un estado judio se
concretaron muchos anos despues de su muerte, ocurrida en 1904,
nacio en una vivienda cercana, que es ahora el sitio del Museo
Judio.
</P>
<P>
   Otro sitio de interes es Vasarcsarnok, un mercado cubierto, con
una bella galeria de hierro forjado construido en 1897, donde se
vende comida y artesanias. Si el lector necesita tomarse unos
minutos de descanso, no hay lugar mejor que el cafe Nueva York, el
mas famoso de Pest, con sus paredes de marmol. Y luego, si quiere
tomar aire fresco, pasee a traves del parque Varosliget, donde el
romantico castillo Vajdahunyad se refleja en un lago.
</P>
<P>
   Tambien en ese parque hay uno de los banos termales mas
populares, el enorme Szechenyi Gyogyfurdo, un palacio neo-barroco
con piscinas cubiertas y al aire libre. Inclusive mas suntuosos son
los banos con mosaicos azules y dorados del lujoso hotel Gellert,
pero no hay que ser un huesped para usarlos. Tambien estan los
autenticos banos otomanos Rudas (solamente para hombres) y Kiraly,
construidos en el ano 1566 por el pacha Mustafa Sokoli.
</P>
<P>
   Tal como lo fueron para los antiguos romanos, los banos son una
parte central de la vida de Budapest. Alli los habitantes descansan
y realizan actividades sociales. Algunas cosas no cambian. ?Y por
que deberian hacerlo?

<P>
   OLY-ECOLUMN _ SYDNEY _ Olympics internet column. (Tierney,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   OLY-ADVANCE _ Is this the ultimate confrontation between new
media and old? Olympic fans can go to a host of official, sports
and other sites to get real time results (not video) of Olympic
events. Why wait 15 hours to find out who grabbed the gold when it
is a key stroke away? Nielsen/Net Ratings reports a surge in
Olympic hits; is one of those hits on conventional coverage? NBC
sold more than $900 million in advertising by telling customers
primetime ratings would average 16.1 percent. After three days, the
numbers are at 14.5 percent and dropping. Ad buyers, industry
analysts and others react to the Down Under (Projection) Games,
what they mean today and what could happen in coming games. (Staff,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY _ Five days into the Games, everyone just
can't stop gushing about Sydney_ about much better this Olympics is
than the one in Atlanta. From transportation and atmosphere to
venues and weather, the Sydney Games seem to beat the Atlanta Games
hands down. We take a look at how Sydney managed to avoid the chaos
and crass commercialism of Atlanta and run what has been a
successful _ but costly _ Olympics. (Unger/Brock, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-STYLE _ SYDNEY _ What is the style of the Sydney Games? The
look. The flavor. The color. The scene. What are the hot selling
items. Where are people hanging. And how does it compare to
Atlanta. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 25. WITH PHOTOS.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-HUMMER _ SYDNEY _ The Aussie-American swimming rivalry has
to be the best rivalry in the Olympics. Thrilling races,
trash-talking swimmers, jam-packed arena of fans going nuts with
every race. Ian Thorpe gave the Aussies the upper hand with two
gold medals on the first day; the Amercan came back with two huge
wins the second day. The battle continues back-and-forth every
night at the Sydney International Aquatic Center. (Hummer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

including Kristy Kowal going into semifinals. (Rosen, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18-20.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SWIM-HALL _ SYDNEY_ After breezing through a men's 100 meter
freestyle preliminary Gary Hall Jr. joked, ``It's a lot easier when
you pace yourself. Somebody should have told me that.'' Hall was
referring to the race that still resonates here, the men's 4x100
meter freestyle relay. There, he hit the wall before he touched it.
Americans aren't used to seeing Hall reeled in from behind the way
Australia's boy wonder Ian Thorpe did in that race. Not only the
relay squad, but the entire U.S. team was stunned and shaken.
(Maher, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED.

(Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BELA _ SYDNEY _ Not even Bela Karolyi can guarantee a medal,
it seems, but USA Gymnastics was right to give it a shot by signing
him on late in the Olympic spin cycle as national team coordinator.
Without him there is no focal point on a determined squad of
American girls who nonetheless had fourth place written all over
them in Tuesday night's team final. Without him there is no fuss,
no reason to look behind the scores and find the passion. Bela
didn't even get to stand on the floor of the Sydney Superdome, an
area reserved for coaches only, and still he burned as much energy
as any of the athletes who performed there. (George, Palm Beach

defending champion of the grueling Tour de France, professional
cycling's premier event. The Olympic competition here is a ride in

Armstrong, who did not medal in two previous Games. (Maher, Austin

   SYDNEY STYLE _ The official ``look'' of these Games may not be a
total splash. But it's safe to say the beach is back. This city is
awash in a sea of purple-blue and turquoise that's very visible.
The Sydney 2000 design team has put its wavy stamp on everything
from sports venues and staff uniforms to the paper coffee cups and
quilt comforters used in the athletes' village. (Brock, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes a 4-column color photo of
Australians dresses up to support their home team and a 2-column
color photo of an Olympic worker wearing a jacket with Olympic
logos.

</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS _ How could Atlanta get it so wrong and Sydney get it
so right? As Australia pulls off an Olympic feat that ranks among
the smoothest in modern memory, that's the question everyone here
is asking. From the beauty of the city to the convenient location
of venues, just about everything about these Games is being
praised. Much of the chaos and commercialism of Atlanta is missing.
(Wendell, Unger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a
2-column color photo of a fountain in Sydney's Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   TV RATINGS _ The prime-time ratings for NBC's coverage of Sydney
Games are staggering out of the starting blocks with a three-day
average of 14.5, down 32 percent from the 1996 Games in Atlanta and
10 percent from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, site of the last
offshore Summer Olympics. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   IDENTITY BRIGHT _ Stopped at the gate to the Olympic Village
because his accreditation didn't pass the scanner, Ian Thorpe
proved his identity by showing security guards the next best thing:
his two gold medals. (Staff, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CHINA-TRADE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will win Congress's
approval Tuesday afternoon for granting permanent normal trade
relations wto China, but the victory required him to buck several
key Democratic constituencies _ human rights advocates, organized
labor and environmentalists. Clinton's willingness to do so,
despite the political damage he suffered by taking the same path to
the NAFTA accord, springs from his conviction that the United
States has little choice but to wed its own economy with rapidly
developing countries around the world, even if they have
significant policy differences with us. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   ROADRAGE-WOMEN _ The pressures on working women, especially
those with families, are showing up on America's highways, a Johns
Hopkins University researcher reports. Today, more than ever, women
are admitting to road rage. In a study of 218 working women in the
Baltimore, Md., area, Barbara Curbow, an assistant professor of
social and behavoral sciences, found that more than half said they
drove aggressively and that 40 percent admitted yelling or
gesturing at other drivers. The most likely female road-ragers:
those who ``had the sense of being overloaded and not getting any
kind of emotional gratification,'' the study reported. At least one
veteran of I-75 thinks Curbow is in the right lane. ``I think women
today are succumbing to the same pressures men are _ time schedules
and children,'' said Cobb police Cmdr. George Hatfield. (Ledford,

   GUNS-GALAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The Georgia Supreme Court Tuesday
hears arguments on the city of Atlanta's lawsuit against the gun
industry. Shortly after the city filed suit against the industry,
the General Assembly passed legislation barring such litigation.
During pre-trial motions in Fulton State Court, Judge Gino Brogdin
dismissed one part of the lawsuit but kept the rest of the suit
alive. The gun industry, saying Brogdin had no right to keep the
lawsuit alive, filed a writ of mandamus (a court petition that
demands public officials to do their job) in Fulton Superior Court.
The writ sought a judge's ruling ordering Mayor Campbell to stop
the litigation and directing Brogdin to dismiss the case in its
entirety. But Judge Themla Wyatt Cummings Moore declined to do so.
The Supreme Court hears arguments on Moore's decision. If the case
goes ahead, the city gets pre-trial discovery, something the
industry does not want at all. (Rankin, Atlanta

   GIBSON _ A federal judge has expressed outrage that death row
inmate Exzavious Gibson did not have a lawyer during his appeal and
taken the extraordinary step to tell a state court judge to hold a
hearing on Gibson's appeal. During a recent hearing, U.S. District
Judge Dudley Bowen of Augusta took an unheard-of step: he
interrupted the proceedings to telephone a state court judge and
ask him to hold hearings on the appeal. The case raises anew
questions of bad lawyering in capital cases: Gibson's lawyer spent
just 32 hours defending his client, including six for travel, and
at the time of trial was working for the state as a special
assistant attorney general -- a clear conflict. Gibson's case has
an important legacy in that he was the only death row inmate in the
modern history of capital punishment to go through his appeal
without a lawyer. The Georgia Supreme Court last year,in a 4-3
ruling,said that was OK, making Georgia the only state in the
country that doesn't provide lawyers to capital defendants during
habeas corpus review. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

that participants are limited to executives of companies with
assets or annual gross sales in excess of $500 million. There are a

the mayor, local sponsors of the event and 100 other academic,
business and political leaders also are invited. The private event

 &HT;    GUN-CONTROL GROUP TARGETS FALL RACES
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading gun control group released a ``dangerous
dozen'' list of gun rights advocates Tuesday and said it planned a
$4 million ad campaign to defeat congressional candidates this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The group reserved a special category for the Republican
presidential ticket, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney,
as the ``most dangerous candidates for American families,
neighborhoods and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barnes, president of Handgun Control Inc., criticized
Bush for signing a bill to block municipalities from suing gun
makers and another that allowed Texans to carry concealed weapons
for the first time in 125 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he signed that bill,'' Barnes said, ``the police
organizations in Texas said they were opposed to it. The
educational organizations in Texas said they were opposed to it.
The health care organizations in Texas said they were opposed to
it. Who was for it? The gun lobby was for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Barnes also attacked Cheney's record as a
Wyoming congressman. While in the House, Cheney opposed a ban on
easy-to-smuggle plastic weapons and another on so-called
``cop-killer bullets,'' which can pierce bullet-resistent vests.
Cheney has said he would now consider the bans.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lisaius(cq), a Bush spokesman, said that ``Texans are safer
under Governor Bush than they have been previously.'' During Bush's
tenure, violent crime has decreased 20 percent, overall crime is
down 13 percent and juvenile crime is down 7 percent, the first
decline in more than a decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to suggest otherwise, they're just not telling you
the facts as they are,'' Lisaius said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the spokesman said Bush supports voluntary efforts
to equip all handguns with child safety locks, and would sign
legislation mandating trigger locks on all new handguns.
</P>

 &HT;    Protect yourself by making sure your doctor's `permission slip'
for treatment gets to your insurance company.
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you don't have your permission slip, you're not going on the
field trip.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically the premise behind managed care's policy that
patients need to get referrals and precertifications before they
can go see specialists or have procedures done.
</P>
<P>
   And like a permission slip, if these papers aren't signed and
delivered in time, a patient might have to delay appointments by
hours, days or weeks. Or even worse, if a patient goes ahead with
visits or procedures, there's a good chance he'll be stuck with the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   So why does it sometimes seem so hard to get that one little
piece of paper? As more patients belong to managed care plans,
doctors' offices and hospitals are swamped with these requests, and
they're not getting the stuff filled out correctly in time _ if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they don't have the motivation that the hospitals and
insurers have. Hospitals need those precertifications to get paid
and insurers get fined by the insurance commissioner's office if
they do not deliver reimbursement in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   But in an increasing number of cases, doctors' lack of
follow-through results in frustrated patients stuck waiting for
rescheduled appointments, on the phone tracking down their
referring physician or arguing with the insurer about an
unexpected, unresolved _ or simply unreimbursed _ bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a major issue for us and for patients,'' said
Mike Mason, director of operations at Emory Clinic. ``We have about
800,000 patient visits annually, and about two-thirds of them
require some kind of precertification before the procedure can
occur. ''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is hardly unique to Emory, which is feeling the
crunch so badly it is planning to hire 50 to 75 more clerks to call
the doctors and the insurers to get the required paperwork for the
hospital to get reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hospitals are groaning under the weight of these
referrals and precertifications so much that the Georgia Hospital
Association met last week with the state's HMO Association to
eliminate some of this paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to ultimately help the consumer,'' said Cathy
Dougherty, director of Gwinnett Hospital System's revenue
management who also participated in the meeting. ``It's taken a
long time to get to the table, but we're sensing there's more of a
desire for everyone to put a focus on this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett Hospital has also had to add precertification clerks to
handle the increase in paperwork, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even insurers are realizing that the backlog of problems is
significant enough to change their procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna-US Healthcare, for example, plans to eliminate the need
for precertification for many procedures, a trend other insurers
are following nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers already place the burden of referrals and
precertifications squarely on doctors and hospitals. Blue Cross &AMP;
Blue Shield, for example, writes that responsibility into its
contracts with medical providers. But consumer advocates say that
in most cases, the ultimate responsibility for getting the
paperwork still rests with the patient.
</P>
<P>
   And that means that patients have to become more assertive in
making sure the necessary paperwork is done long before they step
through the doors of a specialist or a hospital. You can protect
yourself by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calling the insurer at least two days before the procedure or
visit and checking to see if the necessary paperwork has been
received. If it hasn't, follow up with the hospital and/or doctor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asking the referring doctor to fax a copy of the referral or
precertification to you when they fax or send it to the hospital or
specialist. Although hospitals and doctors say they don't think
this is necessary, insurers believe this is a good way to make sure
you have the paperwork to get your bills reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Searching for primary care physicians who are well-wired.
Although many physicians now have electronic claim submission, you
want one who can also do electronic referrals. Often, reimbursement
gets snagged because paper referrals arrive long after the
electronic submission has been sent out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asking your insurer, who, ultimately, is responsible for
getting referrals and precertifications. If it's the doctors, then
pressure them to do their paperwork. If it's you, keep detailed
records of all medical transactions _ it's no different from any
other financial matter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calling the insurance commissioner's office, if you find you
can't resolve a precertification issue with an insurer, hospital or
doctor. They might be able to intercede on your behalf, or at the
very least give you pointers on how to appeal bills you don't
believe are fair. The consumer help line is open from 8 a.m. to 7
p.m. Monday through Friday at 404-656-2070.

<P>
   Sitting at a computer and taking phone orders for parkas, socks,
sheets and luggage eight hours a day might seem like a pretty
boring job. But ask the sales representatives at Lands' End how
they cope, and they are likely to tell you a funny story.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Kitelinger tells this one. A customer called, but her
words were drowned out by her dog's barking. The woman apologized
and tried to shush her pet, but the barking only worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in exasperation, the customer made an unusual request.
``My daughter just left for college, and every time the phone rings
the dog thinks it's her,'' Kitelinger recalled her saying. ``She
calls and talks to him every day _ it's her dog. If I put the phone
to his ear, would you say a few words? He'll think you're my
daughter, and he'll stop barking.'' So Kitelinger talked to the
dog, and he stopped barking.
</P>
<P>
   When you get right down to it, most jobs can get pretty tedious.
A list of the most boring occupations would probably have to
include assembly-line worker, data processor, security guard,
parking-lot attendant, toll taker and cashier. At the higher end of
the income scale, lawyers, accountants and even investment bankers
have been known to complain about drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   So the 2,000 sales agents (3,000 in peak season) who work the
phones at Lands' End in Dodgeville, Wis., for pay that averages
about $24,000 a year are in good company. And like just about
anyone else who finds himself fighting the monotony of a workplace
routine, they are finding that it is the unpredictable, often
eccentric behavior of the people they interact with that adds a
little spice to their day.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a recent call handled by Ruth Lang. Lang, who raises
llamas in her spare time, works the night shift. At 11:30 one
Friday in July, a woman called to ask for a favor. She was being
married the next day, the woman said, and was spending the night
with her sister at a hotel that did not have a wake-up service.
``I'm petrified we're going to oversleep,'' she said. ``We've been
trying to think of who might be awake early, and I know Lands' End
is open 24 hours. Would you mind calling me in the morning and
making sure I'm up?'' Lang stuck a Post-it on her computer to
remind her. At 5 a.m., she called the woman and announced: ``This
is your Lands' End wake-up service.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls about impending weddings seem to gravitate to Lands' End.
Just last month, Sunny Bresett took an order from a distraught
bride-to-be. The woman was being married on Saturday, four days
away, and her husband had forgotten to order a suit. Bresett
arranged for a custom-hemmed suit, a belt, shoes and socks to be
delivered to the groom's hotel the day before the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, employees go so far beyond the call of duty that
their behavior seems to defy rational explanation. It could have
been boredom with her routine, it could have been Midwestern
hospitality or it could have been simple generosity that motivated
Di McCormick in customer service to act as she did. When a man in
Missouri called this summer to complain about the crease in the
sleeve of the pink mesh polo shirt he had ordered from Lands' End
and asked if she could please send him a shirt without such a
crease, she sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick picked 10 identical pink shirts, steamed them all with
an industrial steamer, washed them, steamed them again and sent the
man the best one. Now he's her steady customer. She did the same
with yellow and orange polo shirts for him this summer.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of service may be hard to beat, but a couple of
winters ago, Ruth Shober, another employee who is also a llama
farmer, came close. Shober received a call from a woman who had
dropped a Lands' End canvas purse while crossing the street. The
purse was plastered with mud and road salt, the customer said, and
she wanted to know how she should clean it.
</P>
<P>
   Shober had learned from her husband, an engineer with the
Wisconsin Transportation Department, that rock salt is a calcium
compound. She suggested that the caller take a stiff brush and rub
the rock salt off. If there was any residual dirt, the woman should
wipe the purse with a damp cloth. That night, Shober found a piece
of burgundy canvas comparable to the purse fabric, walked to a busy
highway, dropped the canvas in the mud and rock salt and then
followed her own cleaning instructions. They worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't,'' Shober said, ``I was prepared to call the
customer back with a few more ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most of the calls that pour into Lands' End are
pretty run of the mill. On a recent Tuesday morning, Jean Slapak, a
14-year employee, helped Donna Passwaters from Severn, Md., buy
monogrammed, hooded bath cover-ups for her twin infant grandsons
and easily dispatched slipcovers to Cornelia Barrentine from Pass
Christian, Miss. She assisted another customer picking out just the
right color sheets, advising her that garnet is a ``blueish or ruby
red'' and suggesting, ``Wouldn't either the pale yellow or
cappuccino cases go well with the garnet, for a nice, soft
complementary color?'' She assured a caller from Los Angeles that
the vacation clothes she had ordered at the last minute would
arrive by Friday for a small extra charge. She helped Christine
Pinson of Yorba Linda, Calif., order school-uniform shirts
monogrammed with her daughters' school logo.
</P>
<P>
   No material here for the Lands' End ``calls of fame'' list. But
never mind. She will get another oddball request soon enough, she
assumes; she averages three or four a day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every sales representative has her favorite yarn. Jeanne
McGuire got an urgent plea on the company's fax hotline not long
ago from a man who had been on his way out the door to a formal
affair when he realized he did not know how to tie his bow tie.
McGuire faxed him directions and saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   And Eldora Alexander remembers helping a woman find just the
right size of children's Polartec pajamas for her Dalmation. The
woman planned to cut the feet out of the one-piece sleeper as well
as a hole for the dog's tail, but could not decide whether to order
it in small or large. Alexander had her measure the dog's girth and
then compared this figure with the child chest measurements for the
pajamas. The verdict: large.

 MARKET0920-COX &HT;    B to B reshaping how businesses buy and sell
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The capacity to comparison shop any product or service
instantaneously and to streamline the flow of those goods is one
advantage the Internet offers businesses _ and may be the one thing
that brings down the cost of doing business faster than anything
else the Web can do.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of buying and selling on the Internet among
businesses is streamlining the flow of goods and services, and
making buyers and sellers smarter.
</P>
<P>
   And a gaggle of Atlanta companies offering to create these
marketplaces is growing fast, business experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the buying and selling in the Internet marketplace
are the purchases by companies for their own housekeeping needs as
well as for the materials they use as a business lifeline _ to make
things or produce services.
</P>
<P>
   Often the exchange is through auctioning, or ``reverse
auctioning,'' where a company will post a request for, say, a
thousand computers and buy from the supplier who offers the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a growing area of business touching nearly
every company of size, and being driven partly by enterprises here
in Atlanta that enable online commerce _ such as hSupply.com,
Manheim Interactive, 1stAG, Idapta, ChannelLink and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Major companies like United Parcel Service, Southwire,
Georgia-Pacific and Cox Enterprises create their own online
channels of business, usually with the help of consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Cox owns Manheim Interactive, the wholesale auto auctioneer,
through its huge Manheim Auction subsidiary. Cox also owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating these online marketplaces is a trend in its infancy
but it is bound to grow fast,'' said Ravi Kalakota, an academic
expert on electronic business and founder of hSupply.com, a
youthful player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   HSupply allows the hospitality industry, such as hotels and
restaurants, to tap into suppliers of consumable items such as
soaps, towels and other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online business as a way to put producer or supplier together
with customers is just natural,'' Kalakota said.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is getting it launched, however, said Alan Taetle, an
investment specialist and partner at Noro-Moseley Partners of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the substantial launch problems, he said, is to get
entrepreneurs to establish a reliable backroom or work processing
capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another challenge is to get the starters to assess things like
the power of existing distribution systems that will be the
competition,'' Taetle said, ``and to measure the likelihood that
the market will respond to online buying and selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the transition from traditional sales to online
activity catches on fast, as in the early success of Manheim
Interactive. Manheim Auction has for years been the major operator
of used-car auctions. But the online version has leaped since 1997,
from wholesale volume of $58 million to $615 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Hal Logan, president and chief executive of Manheim
Interactive, announced at midyear the company has already surpassed
last year's sales and there's an untapped supply of product that
could continue to propel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've realized there is a whole universe of vehicles sold to
dealers that never touch an auction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still Manheim Interactive, though growing fast, is just a slice
of the overall Manheim Auction operation. For instance, cars sold
at Manheim auctions at various physical locations totaled some $38
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Southwire Co. of Carrollton is an example of a company finding
that the Internet is an ideal way to move a segment of its product
line. Southwire makes building wire and cable, utility cable
products, industrial power cable, telecommunications cable, copper
and aluminum rods, and cord products.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Wise, manager of marketing at Southwire, says the company
has found the Internet handy for selling much of its huge line of
electrical products to contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrical wholesale distributors buy from 40 percent to 50
percent of our product, some 700 items, and we have found online
selling to be very effective _ and fast growing,'' Wynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The online option offers the buyer many clear advantages, such
as the ability to complete transactions rapidly, get immediate
confirmation of the purchases and delivery, and the ability to deal
at any time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger items produced by Southwire, such as the heavy cable
used by utilities, are not now handled online but through
established contractual relationships, Southwire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioning is an important segment of online business, industry
people say, but it has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price is very important in consumer transactions, such as
purchases from Amazon.com, but it is not always that critical in
purchases or procurement by businesses,'' said Michael J.
Mannheimer, vice president for materials management at Cox
Enterprises in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other factors such as assured quality, timely delivery, and
consistency are often much more important to major companies,''
said Mannheimer, who is on a national panel of procurement officers
for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Mannheimer, who oversees much of the central purchasing for Cox
Enterprises and is online daily as part of his job, says Internet
business transactions are changing the nature of procurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just buying but what we call 'supply chain manage-
</P>
<P>
   ment,''' he said. ``And to some extent the old adversarial
relationship between supplier and buyer is giving way to
partnership, where we work together to build and maintain the flow
of supplies we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he said, the Internet is extending the range of
services, not just giving the right prices.
</P>
<P>
   Right around the corner, Mannheimer said, are software and
services that will let big companies permit each employee or
department head to more freely order what they need, within price
ranges and standards pre-set by managers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other procurement specialists, he said the greatest
blessing of online purchasing is the streamlining of the buying
process, the elimination of forms that get rapidly outdated or lost
and the automation of billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as online business grows rapidly,'' Mannheimer said, ``a
bonus is continuous lowering of the cost of individual
transactions, and that is a strong force to lower overhead cost to
businesses.''

 &HT;    Role of Internet not yet living up to billing
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Mark Moore plans to revolutionize the way wholesalers
buy and sell food.
</P>
<P>
   His Internet marketplace, GlobalFoodExchange.com, will reduce
companies' inventory, guarantee freshness and save both buyers and
sellers a bunch of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after Moore founded his company and six months
after he snagged $13 million in venture capital, the vast majority
of transactions in the $800 billion food industry still are done
the old-fashioned way _ with salespeople. GlobalFoodExchange is
doing just ``hundreds'' of transactions per month, Moore said.
Still, GlobalFoodExchange and its many competitors believe the
future of food is online.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in almost every industry, the visionaries believe that
streamlining buying, selling and other business functions by using
the Internet is the way to save millions of dollars. Those dollars,
the theory goes, drop right to the bottom line. That streamlining
cuts the cost of doing business and is the great promise of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fulfillment of that promise is taking longer to realize
than anyone thought it would a year ago, when so-called
business-to-business Internet companies were popping up in every
industry sector. They were collecting and spending venture capital
at a furious pace. The future looked great. The markets were kind.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now the markets have soured, the venture
capitalists have become more conservative and the big clients are
thinking longer and harder about where and how to spend their
Internet-aimed dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the promise of the Internet is still greasing the wheels of
a torrid economy, but the whole process is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``B-to-b is evolving ... the models are still being figured
out,'' said Martin Tilson, a lawyer at Kilpatrick Stockton who
works with a number of business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   There likely will be consolidations because some industries _
such as food _ have tons of players.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he has already seen GlobalFoodExchange's competition
drop from 20 companies to about six. He attributes the drop to ``a
combination of consolidation and erosion.'' Some companies have
merged, some have gone under and some have narrowed their focus so
that they no longer compete with GlobalFoodExchange, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, start-ups were launching the marketplaces.
Companies such as GlobalFoodExchange raised venture capital and set
about luring traditional companies to the sites as buyers and
sellers. But there is a new trend of ``old economy'' companies
banding together to form their own marketplaces and bypass the
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of such consortia in Atlanta. Some large
chemical companies including BASF, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and
Ticona/Celanese launched Omnexus, which is housed in Andersen
Consulting's incubator. In another example, Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
International Paper and Weyerhaeuser Co. are launching
forestexpress.com here.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows for sure which business model _ start-up or
consortium of older companies _ will work better. Although the
companies started by industry leaders have access to lots of supply
and capital right away, there are problems with longtime
competitors working together. Plus, big companies aren't used to
moving at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consortia don't realize how difficult this is, the
technical issues, the financing issues, the staffing issues,'' said
Mike Dowdle, who heads the venture program at iXL and works with a
number of young business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dowdle predicted that in some industries the start-ups and
consortia may join forces. ``We are going to see more partnering,
acquiring, merging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors, hot for business-to-business six months
ago, have cooled. Faring only slightly better with investors than
business-to-business marketplaces are application service
providers. An ASP hosts software on a server and then ``rents'' it
to companies that don't want to pay a big upfront fee to buy the
software and/or have to fool with maintaining the software.
Customers access the software through the Internet, typically
paying either a monthly fee or a fee for every transaction done
with the software.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is home to a handful of application service providers,
which provide everything from employee benefits information for
small businesses to desktop applications for attorneys. One local
company, ePanacea, which grouped together ASPs and sold the
services to companies, recently ran out of money. Unable to raise
more, it closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The b-to-b world has taken longer to pan out than investors
thought it would, in terms of people getting customers, in terms of
people generating revenue, in terms of people hitting milestones,''
said Ed McCrady, a banker at Robertson Stephens who raises capital
for technology companies. ``Now, investors are realizing this could
be a 10- to 15-year process, not a 10- to 15-month process, like
some people thought in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneurs, some of whom list the local venture
capital scene as the biggest drawback to starting a company here,
may be particularly frustrated by the lack of available funding.
</P>
<P>
   The city is not home to any huge venture capital funds.
Noro-Moseley Partners recently raised a $320 million fund, the
largest ever for the city but still nowhere near the billion-dollar
funds in Silicon Valley, New York and Boston. Because the funds
here are small, a local venture capitalist is more likely to invest
$2 million to $5 million instead of $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, local investors are more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who is raising his second round of financing, said local
investors are scared to take a chance on a company such as
GlobalFoodExchange that is still losing lots of money. His
investors will be from outside Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (local) venture capital community is waiting for
significant revenue to invest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen See, president of technology marketing firm Abovo
Marketing, has 20 clients. Most get their first rounds of capital
locally but look elsewhere for the second _ and larger _ round of
funding, she said. She said Atlanta is known on the West Coast for
its ``chicken money. Everyone is chicken to put in the big
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Though venture capital may be a weak spot, Atlanta has plenty of
bright spots for business-to-business companies. Perhaps Atlanta's
biggest selling point, ironically, is its ``old economy'' companies
_ ones like Georgia-Pacific, United Parcel Service, BellSouth and
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Atlanta is more conducive to
business-to-business than Silicon Valley, which is surrounded by
the software industry. It isn't in tune with corporate America,''
said Moore, who has been able to find plenty of food industry
experts to hire in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta executives are used to selling inside big companies and
have key contacts, Dowdle said. ``You've got to have experienced
people who know how to work the hallways of the big, big
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, like other so-called technology cities, has the
infrastructure to help business-to-business companies get off the
ground: attorneys who are used to dealing with start-ups; real
estate brokers who know how to work a lease for high-risk,
fast-growing company; a network of angel investors and venture
capitalists; and Internet consulting companies that help companies
figure out an Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other bright spots are a relatively low cost of living, a strong
fiber network and an airport that makes traveling around the world
relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released as part of its January investors'
conference, Atlanta-based investment bank Robinson-Humphrey Co. set
out broad claims for ``Netlanta,'' arguing that Atlanta has
mimicked Silicon Valley in five critical ways: universities,
research, industry leadership, venture capital and culture. While
metro Atlanta cannot match the magnitude of the Valley forces, it
has assembled the same equation in smaller doses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Omnexus and other companies that have recently
chosen to put headquarters in Atlanta, Tilson said, ``Atlanta is
being seen as a great place to start a business-to-business
company.''

 GLOSSARY0920-COX &HT;    B2B GLOSSARY: Understanding the language of business-to-business
operations
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASP: This stands for application service provider. An ASP hosts
software on a server and then ``rents'' it to companies that don't
want to pay a big upfront fee to buy the software and/or have to
maintain it. Customers access the software through the Internet,
typically paying either a monthly fee or a charge for every
transaction done with the software.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Atlanta-based EAttorney is an application
service provider for the legal industry. Small and medium-size law
firms can pay a monthly fee of $40 to $75 per person to access
software for attorneys' desktops.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION: A site where many buyers are bidding for one seller's
product or service.
</P>
<P>
   BURN RATE: This is the term for how fast a company is spending
its capital. Investors are increasingly concerned about ``burn
rate''; they don't want to invest in business-to-business companies
that plan to spend a whole lot of money to get their businesses
going but don't expect substantial revenue any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   CATALOG MARKETPLACES: A place where buyers can shop for things
with set prices. It allows comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   DISINTERMEDIATION: When the middleman gets cut out of the deal.
At a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers in real time on
the Internet, there theoretically is no need for salespeople to
haggle and schmooze in-person, on the phone and via fax.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN EXPERTISE: Industry smarts. Investors expect a company to
have executives who know a great deal about the industry that the
business-to-business company is going after.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: One of CarrierPoint's co-founders, John
Thomson, previously did consulting work with shippers attempting to
improve their warehousing and logistics operations. CarrierPoint is
a marketplace for the trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   EXIT STRATEGY: Investors want to know when they are going to
cash out, either through an initial public offering or a sale to a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Tradex, which has technology for marketplaces,
was sold to Ariba for $1.9 billion. Investors, including Atlantan
John Imlay, made a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE: Accrues to the first company to go after
a certain market. If a company can establish itself early as the
leader, it is harder for competitors to gain a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   FRAGMENTED MARKETPLACE: An industry in which it is difficult for
buyers and sellers to find each other. If a market is highly
fragmented, then an Internet marketplace that can help create
relationships is more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   PATH-TO-PROFITABILITY: How quickly the company is going to be
making money and how it is going to do it. The term P2P is popular
among B2B companies trying to convince investors that they will
make money.
</P>
<P>
   REVERSE AUCTION: When one buyer offers a particular price for a
product, attracting bids from many sellers.
</P>
<P>
   SCALABILITY: How quickly and efficiently a company can increase
its revenue. Using technology, a business-to-business company
should be able to add customers and therefore revenue without
adding a lot of employees, hardware, satellite offices and other
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   SPACE: The particular market in which your company is
participating. The word is overused and can mean a vertical market
(see next item) or a type of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: AtWork Technologies, an application service
provider to help companies with employee benefits, is in the
``benefits space'' and in the ``ASP space.''
</P>
<P>
   VERTICAL: The ability to go deep in the industry in which your
company is competing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Edaflow, an Atlanta-based marketplace for the
apparel industry, is going after the apparel vertical.

 &HT;    Australian commercials, eye-grabbing and off the wall
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Australia's TV commercials, not surprisingly, tend to be racier
and off-the-wall funnier than America's. An ad for Viva cola
featured a seductively dressed woman spitting out the drink and
drooling it down her chin. With seemingly hundreds of characters
and a plot, it looked like a cross between a Star Wars episode and
a Madonna video. The best commercial involves the parents of Aussie
Olympics rowers, a gymnast and a swimmer trying to perform their
kids' sports. Seeing the mother of gymnast Lisa Skinner attempting
to climb on a balance beam is a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE DARK: Two miners' lanterns that carried the Olympic flame
from Athens to Sydney's Olympic Stadium have disappeared, and
police fear they may have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The two lanterns contained backup flames for the Olympic torch
and had been closely guarded around the clock during the 100-day
torch tour of Australia. They were used to light the Olympic torch
on several occasions when the flame went out.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Dale, an organizing committee torch relay spokesman, said
the lanterns disappeared on the night of the opening ceremony
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER UN-HOOLIGANS: If only other soccer fans were like the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 supporters waited for the players to arrive for their
Olympic game against Slovakia at Canberra's Bruce Stadium. A bus
pulled up and the Slovak players trooped off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spitting, jeering and insulting their team's
opponents, the Japanese fans began to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any English or German fans but I've heard about
their reputation,'' said Yuji Tamade, a 22-year-old bank clerk from
Osaka. ``I don't know why they do the things they do. It's not in
our nature to behave like that at soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect our opponents and we applaud their fans. Surely,
that's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese team also behaved as it should, edging Slovakia 2-1
and moving to the brink of a place in the Olympic quarterfinal. It
faces Brazil in Brisbane on Wednesday, needing just a point to gain
the quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   A child's lost bag, packed with lunch and story books, prompted
a bomb scare at the park. Police were called in to investigate a
suspicious package, and cleared a pavilion area near the aquatic
center. The bag was searched, then turned over to lost and found.
</P>
<P>
   Despite newspaper classifieds touting tickets, organizers claim
illegal ticket-scalping syndicates have largely been kept away. A
major reason cited is Sydney's geographical distance from many of
the world's countries, making it difficult and financially
impractical for many of the larger ticket brokers to set up here.
</P>
<P>
   Taekwondo stars and best friends Kay Poe and Esther Kim appeared
at the Coca-Cola Olympic Pin Trading Center for the unveiling of
pins representing two new Olympic sports _ taekwondo and triathlon.
Poe is competing in Sydney partly because Kim bowed out of their
finals match at the Trials because Poe hurt her knee.
</P>
<P>
   National pride has led to a run on Australian flags around town.
One store, Paddy's Market, is selling out twice a day -- as fast as
workers can get the flags on the shelves. Flags from other
countries are selling well, too -- Chilean flags have also sold
out.

 &HT;    Not all-Aussies, all the time
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - The Australians are totally psyched about the swim
competition, and it's understandable when they tend to be leaving
the rest of the world in their wake. If it wasn't Susie O'Neill
swimming to gold in the 200-meter freestyle Tuesday and setting
herself up for another in the 200 butterfly, it was Ian
``Thorpedo'' Thorpe anchoring the Aussie 4 x 200 relay's
obliteration of the world record.
</P>
<P>
   But loud as the locals cheered, it wasn't all-Aussies,
all-the-time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow, a gangly University of Michigan product, convinced
himself the crowd roar was aimed in his direction when he held off
Aussie favorite Justin Norris to claim gold in the 200-meter
butterfly. It was a medal upgrade for Malchow who captured silver
in Atlanta, where he was the youngest swim team member.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow managed to make himself an athlete when others saw just
an awkward teen-ager. At 11, doctors put his legs in casts for more
than a month to compensate for a growth spurt. Surely, he could
handle fans cheering their lungs out for one of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to pretend they were all Americans out there,''
Malchow said of the crowd. ``It definitely helped me coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Malchow was part of another wave of records at the Sydney Games,
where at the halfway point a staggering 10 world and 21 Olympic
records have been rewritten. He and women's 200 individual medley
winner Yana Klochkova of the Ukraine swam to Olympic records, while
the Australian men knocked more than a second off the world relay
mark and Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands a day after
beating Thorpe in the 200 freestyle lowered the world mark in the
100 freestyle semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pieter The Great,'' as the Sydney Daily Telegraph proclaimed,
can double his gold and perhaps further shave his world record in
the 100 freestyle final against a field including Americans Gary
Hall Jr. and Neil Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this at all,'' van den Hoogenband said. ``I
wasn't going full speed. I can go one-tenth of a second faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting final Wednesday has Kyle Salyards, a
University of Georgia signee from Tempe, Ariz., looking to make a
name in the 200 breaststroke. Salyards won his semifinal heat and
advanced with the third-fastest time.
</P>
<P>
   But the American story of Tuesday's competition was the
performance by Malchow, who pumped his fist wildly after holding
off the Aussie challenge. Malchow is an oddity in that he never won
an NCAA title, yet he complemented his Atlanta silver with a Sydney
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``For four years, I've waited for this moment,'' said Malchow,
the world record-holder. ``The silver in `96 gave me a taste.
Atlanta was a learning experience. I've grown up and learned a lot
in four years, and I put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   As a swimmer, Malchow has been what his coach Jon Urbancek calls
a project. He's 6-foot-6 and, by his own admission, not overly
coordinated out of the pool. He's gradually built his strength up
lifting weights and improved his coordination by working out with a
medicine ball.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Urbancek says his project ``hugs the water
like a fish,'' meaning the kid who used to be all arms and legs has
mastered the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still is awkward in basketball,'' Urbancek quipped.
</P>
<P>
   But he listens well, and Tuesday he followed Urbancek's pre-race
instruction, displaying patience over the first half of the race
before taking the lead off the final turn. ``Coach said `Nobody can
beat you coming home,''' Malchow said. ``I have that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, he had enough that the Aussie cheers couldn't be

 &HT;    Honor WWII vets, but not on Mall
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with an ounce of curiosity and a passing familiarity with
the controversy over the World War II memorial proposed for the
National Mall in Washington ought to be troubled by two questions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why has it taken so long to erect a permanent tribute in our
nation's capital to commemorate the valor of U.S. veterans of that
epic struggle?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why are the principal advocates of that memorial so hellbent
on sticking it smack-dab in the middle of the Mall?
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out on the veterans of the Second World War;
they are dying off at roughly the rate of a thousand a day. Before
the last of them departs, they deserve a lasting expression of our
nation's gratitude just as we have honored veterans of the Korean
and Vietnam wars.
</P>
<P>
   That urgency, however, is not a compelling reason to plunge
ahead with the $100 million granite plaza to be plunked midway
between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Indeed,
the National Capitol Planning Commission, which meets Thursday to
discuss the project and would be the last regulatory body to sign
off on it, ought to stop the process dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mall is a national treasure with its two-mile sweep of turf,
trees and sunken pools between two of America's best-recognized
structures. To intrude upon that space, even to memorialize
American heroes of the world's fiercest war, is to separate the
Mall's aesthetic wholeness and interpose the 20th century between
symbols of the 18th (George Washington) and 19th (Abraham Lincoln).
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if the proposed plaza is such a grand addition
to the Mall. It would require the destruction of a longtime Mall
feature, the Rainbow Pool, a work by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the
architect who carried out his father's design for Atlanta's Druid
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the plaza itself is but a scaled-down version of an
original design that would have obstructed sight lines across the
Mall. Also, in deference to sight-line concerns, the plaza will be
sunken, which is likely to be a source of recurring seepage
problems since the water table at that location is only 7 feet
below the surface. Finally, the plaza has a subdued, abstract look
more in keeping with the equivocal outcomes of the Vietnam and
Korean wars than the unquestioned triumph of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve our capital's beauty and to erect a memorial truly
worthy of World War II servicemen and women, the Washington
powers-that-be need to find a different site and choose a more
inspiring design.
</P>

 &HT;    BUSH'S TURN ON `OPRAH,' WHERE THE WOMEN ARE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush stepped in Tuesday and gave Oprah Winfrey what Al
Gore didn't: a kiss. And he told the TV talk show diva that the
public's biggest misconception of him is that ``I'm running on my
daddy's name.'' Bush, eager to woo back women voters, took his turn
in Winfrey's easy chair a week and a day after rival Gore courted
her and the 22 million viewers _ most of them women. Asked what
things he knows for sure, Bush said: ``That there is a God. . . .
That I'm sitting here talking to you. That I love my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT OUT TO AVENGE FATHER'S LOSS, BUSH SAYS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said Tuesday he's not running for president to
avenge his father's defeat in 1992. Bush told talk show host Oprah
Winfrey that he couldn't get elected if were seeking revenge. He
said he's running for positive reasons and because he has a vision
for the country. He acknowledged that he and opponent Al Gore have
similar views on some issues, but said the difference is that Gore
``can't get it done.'' Asked to define himself, Bush said it's as a
dad, husband and patriot. He said he also wants to be defined by
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   A SOFTER TONE ON HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   A week after threatening Hollywood with sanctions for marketing
violence to kids, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman softened their tone by
telling leaders of the entertainment industry that, ``We will nudge
you, but we will never become censors.'' The assurance was
delivered by Lieberman to applause at a star-studded Beverly Hills
fund-raiser with Gore where they collected $4.2 million for the
Democratic Party. Gore said he was heartened by the industry's
response to the criticism. ``I know a lot of you will be standing
with us,'' he said. Midway through a three-day trip to California,
Gore was to help Democrats raise more money at a Silicon Valley
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH TECH IN THE `WIRED WEST'
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman toured one of the high-tech companies that are
cropping up on the ``Digital Coast'' around Los Angeles, promising
economic policies that will promote the industry's growth. ``This
part of the country was called the Wild West,'' he told employees
and supporters at Guidance Solutions Inc., which helps businesses
go online. ``It's truly now become the wired West.'' Lieberman said
Democrats, under President Clinton, had learned to create the
environment for growth to happen. He said government policies that
are fiscally responsible create confidence in the government and
help keep interest rates low so businesses and individuals can
borrow money easily. The government also should aggressively
promote scientific research that can later be converted into
commercial uses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH COMMUNITY SHOWING GENEROSITY
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community has always been a reliable source of cash
for the Democratic Party. But the prospect of having the first
Jewish vice president has proved a significant fund-raising boon to
the party, and the first Jewish vice presidential nominee has
turned out to be a fund-raising dynamo. In all, Joe Lieberman has
brought in nearly $6 million for the campaign at solo fund-raising
events. Although only a few events have targeted Jewish givers,
ethnic and religious pride has been a major theme at every
Lieberman campaign stop, pulling new supporters into the Democratic
fold and whipping the faithful to unprecedented heights of
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ONE POLL SHOWS GORE SLIGHTLY UP, ANOTHER HAS IT EVEN
</P>
<P>
   Two new presidential polls point to a highly competitive
contest. Al Gore has an edge of 5 percentage points over George W.
Bush in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll, while a Voter.Com
Battleground survey puts them in a dead heat. In the national
tracking polls, CNN-USA Today-Gallup put the contest at 48-43
percent in Bush's favor, with a 4 percentage point error margin.
Gore and Bush are statistically even in the Voter.Com Battleground
poll (3 percentage point error margin), with Bush at 41 percent and
Gore at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY'S TRAVEL TOPS $1 MILLION FOR TAXPAYERS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign trips to New York aboard
government aircraft have cost taxpayers more than $1 million,
according to White House records that congressional Republicans
have released. The data show the first lady took 93 such trips from
June 1999 through August 2000 at an estimated cost of $1.22
million. Her campaign reimbursed $184,995, or 15 percent of the
total, the records show. Clinton flies on government aircraft at
the Secret Service's request. She reimburses the government the
same way presidential candidates do: at the rate of a first-class
commercial ticket. But that's well below the actual cost. For
example, a C-20, on which she sometimes travels, costs an estimated
$3,705 an hour to fly. The practice is legal, but is being
criticized by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S OFFICIAL: THE LIBRARIAN WON IT
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old retired Long Island librarian who spent a paltry
$40,000 on her Democratic campaign for Congress won the primary
against Rep. Michael Forbes by a 35-vote margin, officials declared
today. The final vote from the recount of the Sept. 12 primary gave
Regina Seltzer 6,077 to Forbes' 6,042. Seltzer will face Republican
Felix Grucci, the Brookhaven Town Supervisor, on Nov. 7. Forbes, a
three-term congressman who switched parties and became a Democrat
last year, amassed a $1.4 million war chest, some of that coming
from a fund-raiser last April that featured President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he planned to call Seltzer and wish her well. ``I
hope people will rally behind her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTIVE CHARITIES GET CORZINE LARGESS
</P>
<P>
   After trying for months to avoid disclosing his charitable
contributions, Jon Corzine, the Democratic Senate candidate in New
Jersey, revealed he's given at least $100,000 to groups whose
leaders or sponsors later endorsed him. Corzine, the
multimillionaire ex-stock brokerage chief who spent $35 million in
winning his party's primary, said those gifts were part of more
than $10 million in cash and stock he gave to dozens of charities
since the beginning of last year. During that time, he started
giving to far more New Jersey charities and organizations. He
insisted at a news conference that there was no connection between
his charitable donations and his political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENT DEFENSE: 63 DAYS WITHOUT A NEWS CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has surpassed his previous record for the interval since
his last open news conference, a mark that now stands at 63 days.
His typical day on the road is often driven by setting as much as
by substance. While he grants occasional interviews, they often are
limited to subjects of his choosing. Gore's strategy isn't a new
one, either for him or for American politics. ``This is line one
from the Reagan playbook,'' said S. Robert Lichter, president of
the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan group that
monitors coverage of campaigns. ``There's no need to generate good
press when you're in the lead. You just step aside and let your
opponent's bad press keep accumulating.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR AN RX ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   Now that Democrats have pulled together to push the prescription
drug issue to the top of this fall's campaign agenda, congressional
Republicans are scrambling to catch up. They have no lack of ideas;
what they're missing is a common strategy for action. Key lawmakers
concede that enactment of a big new prescription drug plan is
virtually impossible before Congress adjourns next month. But voter
surveys indicate that the question of how to protect older
Americans from crushing prescription drug costs is among the most
potent campaign issues. Democrats seized the initiative early and
haven't let go. Many Republicans worry it could erode their
prospects for keeping control of Congress and winning the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   TV AD TAKES SHOT AT `DIVERSITY'
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group is airing TV ads that urge voters to
support Republicans, featuring a woman who says she pulled her son
out of public school because there were drugs, violence and ``a bit
more diversity than he could handle.'' The ad is running in Kansas
City, Mo., where a bitter battle over school desegregation is being
fought. The 60-second ad goes on to promote educational savings
accounts, which give parents tax breaks to save for private school
tuition. The Republican Ideas Political Committee plans to air it
and other ads in additional markets this fall, said founder and
conservative commentator Richard Nadler. Missouri Republicans were
wary of the unsolicited help and distanced themselves from it.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER AD IN KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg points to a new ad by Rep.
Anne Northup (R-Ky.) as ``one of the most effective spots in recent
memory.'' Northup's November opponent is Democratic state Rep.
Eleanor Jordan. The 30-second TV ad has a shot of Jordan in front
of a microphone on the floor of the Kentucky House. ``I urge you to
pass this bill. Let's get on with it,'' says a clearly impatient
and annoyed Jordan. As she looks down at her watch, Jordan delivers
this line: ``I have a fund-raiser at 6 o'clock, and I want to get
out here.'' The ad's tag line: ``Jordan, putting herself first.''
</P>
<P>
   POSITIVE OUTWEIGHING NEGATIVE _ SO FAR
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads get the most attention, but most of the advertising
in the presidential race so far has been positive. Al Gore's and
George W. Bush's ad campaigns have been almost totally positive, as
they left the attacking to their political parties, who run ads on
their behalf. But even the parties _ particularly Republicans _
have run a largely positive campaign. Two in three Republican Party
ads shown in the nation's top 75 markets have promoted Bush, with
just 20 percent attacking Gore. The remainder contrasted the two.
At the same time, only half of the Democratic Party spots were
purely positive, with about one-third attacking Bush, according to
an analysis of ad spending through Sept. 13 by the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSPAPERS NOTICING LETTERS WITH FAMILIAR RING
</P>
<P>
   The strangely similar letters started popping up over the last
month or so in newspapers across the country. People supporting
George W. Bush sent virtually identical letters to the editor. Some
papers got dozens. Many others published letters from readers who
used nearly the same words _ sometimes exactly the same words _ to
express positive sentiments about Bush. All these said Bush was
working to ``make sure the American dream touches every willing
heart.'' It was hardly a coincidence. The letters have their
genesis in a ``sample letter to the editor''' contained on the Bush
campaign Internet site (www.georgewbush.com). When the site is
opened, a window pops up that leads to instructions for writing
letters. Al Gore's campaign is making a similar effort, but it
hasn't caught on as well.

 &HT;    Fuzzy military goals: U.S. troops need a clearly stated mission
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans were warned earlier this year to stop
trying to run foreign policy and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gov. George W. Bush's warning, congressional Republicans
are at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are trying to set a deadline for withdrawing American
troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Congress exercises the power of the purse strings, but the
president is commander in chief of the military and in charge of
setting the nation's foreign policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in Congress doesn't especially like the
way President Clinton has deployed American troops. Bush doesn't
like having Congress tie his hands on issues that he would have to
decide were is elected president. That makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Senate and House negotiators are trying to arrive at
a compromise bill to cut off funds for U.S. troops in Kosovo. The
idea is to force an American withdrawal as peacekeepers in Kosovo
by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   America's fighting troops have been used in unusual ways since
the end of the Cold War. Many Americans, especially Americans in
uniform, are confused and displeased with the trend to use
America's professional warriors as international police officers,
social workers, border control officers, fire fighters and drug
agents.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to be done is to establish a clear mission for
America's men and women in military uniform so they can train for
that mission and then be prepared to execute their training.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to maintain the military's traditional mission of
national defense _ to fight wars to defend the United States
against its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should beef up peacekeeping through the United
Nations. The U.S. military should be prepared to defend the nation
against foreign aggressors, whether they are traditional nation
states, rogue states or terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mission is established, then Congress must ensure that
the military receives the funding necessary to maintain a high
state of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Military readiness should be commensurate with the threat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces have been reduced severely since the end of the Cold
War, from 2.2 million troops in 1989 to 1.4 million now. At the
same time, inflation-adjusted funding has been cut back from $392
billion to $292 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, U.S. troops have been sent on humanitarian,
nation building and peacekeeping deployments in Bosnia, Haiti,
Somalia and Kosovo, not to mention daily air patrols over Iraq
since 1993 following the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Because of funding and personnel cutbacks, coupled with an
increase in unusual open-ended deployments, the military has seen
reduced training, shortages in spare parts, difficulty keeping
personnel and difficulty recruiting replacements.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a new consensus on the military's mission and a
renewed commitment to ensure the military can maintain readiness to
fulfill its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Room to wait
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was correct to leave the decision for building
an anti-missile system to the next occupant of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few more months left in office, he has decided he
will not handcuff his successor.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear if the technology, which actually is rocket
science, will work. So far, test results have not been promising.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, an anti-missile defense system makes no sense
if it prompts a renewed nuclear arms race or destabilizes the
current international equilibrium. It's better to wait.

SUPPRESSION OF REBELS SETS UP REFUGEE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines _ Four days into a surprise government
assault on the hideouts of rebels who have been wreaking havoc in
the southern Philippines, thousands of civilians are on the run
from bombarded areas, short of food, water, and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign, however, that the army was any closer to
resolving a five-month crisis that has endangered the dozens of
hostages seized by the rebels, enriched the kidnappers beyond their
wildest imaginations, and embarrassed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada confidently predicted the assault would
end triumphantly within a week, but as of Tuesday, the government
had achieved neither of its two goals: rescuing 19 hostages and
destroying a ruthless band of criminals that has been a thorn in
Manila's side for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The military attack launched Saturday followed months of
kid-glove treatment of the Abu Sayyaf, a self-proclaimed Muslim
extremist group that turned kidnapping for ransom into a local
industry. The flow of ransom money has funded the purchase of
weapons and speedboats, ostensibly to aid the struggle for
self-rule for Muslims in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In protracted negotiations, Manila quietly allowed foreign
interests to pay an estimated $15 million for the release of 20 of
21 people seized from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23, and
about 20 reporters captured while covering the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping negotiations going until last weekend, Estrada had
deferred to foreign governments that had begged him not to risk the
lives of the hostages. But that seemed only to embolden the
hostage-takers, who detained dozens of evangelists who had come to
pray for the hostages along with journalists reporting on their
fate. The Abu Sayyaf seized an American a few weeks ago, and three
new victims from a Malaysian resort 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, that was the final straw. ``Enough is
enough,'' Estrada declared Saturday in announcing the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The military operation, which is costing Manila a reported
$666,000 a day, is a major gamble for the embattled Philippine
president, and could go terribly awry. Yet with public fury
mounting over the kidnappings, rumors of a possible coup, and his
nation's pride at stake, Estrada arguably had no choice but to use
force on Jolo, 600 miles south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The assault was widely praised by Philippine lawmakers,
newspaper editorials, and even bishops' groups, and opinion polls
showed the nation strongly behind the attack. But critics charged
that Manila's inconsistent and haphazard policies toward a group
labeled as terrorists by both the Philippine and U.S. governments
had fueled the rapid growth of the Abu Sayyaf, which had just 200
members earlier this year, into a force of several thousand armed
men and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite declarations that it would not pay ransom, the
government quietly paid ``board and lodging fees'' to secure the
release of more than 100 hostages over five years, and the
kidnappings became more outrageous. Some analysts question whether
a military solution can work this late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real strategy. This is driven by the fact that a
military attack is so popular with the people in our macho
culture,'' said Glenda Gloria, a fellow at the Ateneo Center for
Social Policy in Manila and co-author of a book on the rebels.
Estrada ``has used (this) to boost his sagging popularity, but if
he goes on like this, it will really set back the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the assault began, at least four civilians have been
killed and an estimated 5,000 driven from their homes on Jolo,
where 4,000 troops pressed an air and ground attack and imposed a
naval blockade. Ferries, thrice-weekly flights, and communication
with Jolo were cut. Civilians were trapped until Tuesday night,
when the navy agreed to transport a few hundred in both directions
_ a humanitarian gesture, but one that might allow rebels to escape
disguised as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Hasim, 28, one of 500 residents of Jolo stranded at
Zamboanga since Saturday, was anxious to board the ship to be
reunited with his wife and seven-year-old daughter. ``I'm worried
about my family,'' he said. ``A lot of people have been crying. . .
We only want the fighting to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The military said eight soldiers had been wounded, but sources
close to the rebels claimed 100 troops had been slain. The military
said it had overrun three rebel camps, killing seven Abu Sayyaf
members and arresting two dozen, but the whereabouts of the rebel
leaders and the hostages were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   If past experience is any guide, it will be nearly impossible in
the short-run for the military to wipe out a group that has proved
vicious and resilient. And in the longer run, the assault seems
unlikely to resolve one of southeast Asia's most nagging conflicts
_ a 30-year Muslim rebellion fueled by poverty and neglect by the
Catholic-dominated central government.
</P>
<P>
   The odds facing the military are daunting. The Abu Sayyaf are
protected by links to corrupt local politicians, businessmen, and
even police. The rebels are familiar with the mountainous jungles
and slip easily from one island to another.
</P>
<P>
   Clannish locals perceive the army as anti-Muslim and either
tacitly support the rebels or are too frightened to turn them in.
And the lure of millions of dollars in ransom money is also likely
to encourage a new crop of rebel recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, the military launched a similar attack on the
neighboring island of Basilan, where another faction of Abu Sayyaf
had taken 54 Filipino teachers, schoolchildren, and a priest
hostage. Half of the original group had been released in batches in
exchange for food and medicine, but after the Abu Sayyaf beheaded
two teachers as a ``birthday gift'' to Estrada, the government
struck back.
</P>
<P>
   But the military took a week to reach the hideout and lost many
soldiers along the heavily mined route. The Abu Sayyaf leaders
escaped, apparently through a World War II-era tunnel, and the army
found four hostages who had apparently been shot dead by their
captors. Eventually the attack achieved the release of the
remaining hostages, but the rebel leaders evaded a blockade similar
to the one now encircling the island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is this will be a similar defeat,'' said the Rev.
Angel Calvo, executive director of Peace Advocates for Zamboanga
and a former priest on Basilan, where several clergy have been
taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resorting to a military operation shows you haven't been able
to solve the issues before,'' said Calvo. The problem is that ``the
government doesn't accept the historical reality of Muslims in
Mindanao and their demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Island residents have been fighting foreign rule since Spanish
colonizers arrived 400 years ago. The Abu Sayyaf, who consider
themselves descendants of those fighters, began in 1991 as a ragtag
group of 20 guerrillas with a nebulous ideology. The original
leaders, educated in Pakistan and the Middle East, returned with
radical ideologies and purported ties to terrorist networks. But
their followers began to kidnap civilians to raise cash and
devolved into little more than a gang of bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Ustadz Shariff Julabbi, a regional leader of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, a much larger rebel group that has distanced
itself from the Abu Sayyaf, said the ``government will try to
capture a small area and raise a flag and say, `We've won the war.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then after one or two days, they'll leave and say, `We've
overrun all the rebel camps,' but that's impossible. There are too
many of them, and they are too ensconced.''

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ In a signature triumph for the
Clinton administration and American business, the Senate voted
Tuesday to forge a new economic relationship with China, clearing
away trade restraints that stood for 20 years in anti-Communist
policy. By Eric Schmitt.

   CHINA-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis. The Senate's
overwhelming vote to give permanent trade benefits to China ended a
decade-long clash between America's global economic interests and
the notion that the United States could use the annual threat of
trade sanctions to change Beijing's behavior. In the end, it wasn't
even close _ and behind that lies a new reality in how Washington
deals with the most populous nation in the world. By David E.
Sanger.

   BUSH (Chicago) _ The question came by way of an e-mail message.
Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of confessional television, relayed it,
and Gov. George W. Bush took it head on: What's the public's
largest misconception of him? ``I'm running on my Daddy's name,''
he answered instantly. `Really?'' she prodded. ``That, you know, if
my name was George Jones I'd be a country and western singer,''
said Bush, the son of a president. ``I've lived with this all my
life. Of course, I love my dad a lot. he's a fabulous man and I'm
proud to be his son.'' For an hour Tuesday, Bush took his turn in
Oprah's chair, just a week after Al Gore did, trying to woo her 7
million daily viewers, most of them women. He gave her a kiss,
which Gore did not. He resisted some of her efforts to force him
into introspection. Joked at others. He talked of God, of stopping
drinking. And his eyes welled up with emotion as he spoke of his
wife and the birth of his twins. By Alison Mitchell.

   NY-AIDS-SERVICES (New York) _ Finding that New York City had
failed to provide adequate services for thousands of people with
AIDS, a federal judge in Brooklyn on Tuesday ordered the federal
government to assume oversight for city's agency for AIDS services.
The decision by District Judge Sterling Johnson was believed to be
the first in which federal oversight of a municipal social services
agency has been mandated. By Laura Mansnerus.

 &HT;    Austin Fortune 500 Forum expecting two protest groups
 &HT;    By Susan Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Two protest groups should be expected at the
upcoming Fortune 500 Forum: One for people who have a bone to pick
with ``global corporatism'' and another for the local business
people who aren't invited to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune Forum, organized by the prestigious business
magazine, is sure to invoke class anger and green envy in some
Austinites during the three-day visit of the Fortunates beginning
Oct. 7. Participants are limited to executives of companies with
assets or annual gross sales in excess of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions, however. Mayor Kirk Watson, whose
office is handling some details of the event, and representatives
of local companies who paid the $250,000 sponsorship fee also will
attend the Forum. And in addition to the 150 world-class CEOs,
Fortune has invited 100 local business, academic and political
leaders. The list of participants is private.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP event is one more sign that Austin is part of the global
corporate village _ even if many of the residents of the People's
Republic of Travis have to be dragged into the village kicking and
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   But the private shindig has a public impact. And the public,
complaining about rising housing costs and crowded streets, may be
green with envy with good reason over the agreement between the
city and Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the city will assist Fortune in securing
customized Texas license plates for the cars that will be used
during the event, provide parking for approximately 100 cars in
close proximity to the hotel and ``provide staging, traffic
control, security and support within the boundaries of Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Fortune would like Austin's support in securing
well-known talent for the opening night and would also like to
invite well-known personalities/celebrities to the opening night
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials emphasize that the Fortune event is no different
than other special events that the city handles, from Halloween on
Sixth Street to Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Joe
Lieberman's recent fund-raising visit. The Police Department has a
$700,000 budget for overtime this year. It's unclear how much of
that will be eaten up by the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Public Works director Peter Rieck says Forum organizers have
requested two street closures in the downtown area. But Fortune
will pay fees, like any other group, for use of city streets and
services, says Rieck.
</P>
<P>
   Some additional public costs could be picked up by private
sponsors, says Ric Luber, executive director of the Austin
Convention and Visitors Bureau, who's working on the event.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd hardly compare the Forum bash to the annual Halloween
bash.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Fortunates don't bring something to the table. The
city will ring up formidable sales taxes from the event. And the
Forum, which has been hosted by cities including Boston and San
Antonio, may be a way to attract convention business to the city
and elevate the city's already elevated business profile.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where there are more unfortunates than Fortunates,
not everyone's excited about using public resources for a private
shindig.

ISRAELIS CANCEL, THEN RESCHEDULE, MEETING WITH PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel canceled a scheduled meeting with Palestinian
negotiators Tuesday, raising concerns that the fragile peace effort
had reached another potential breaking point. But by day's end, the
Israelis had arranged another meeting for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the first cancellation, Palestinian negotiators quickly
condemned the Israelis for what they described as an indefinite
suspension of negotiations, saying the move put in question
Israel's commitment to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regrettable decision that shows that the Israeli
government is trying to prepare for itself a path out of the peace
process,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office quickly started playing
down Tuesday's cancellation, describing it as insignificant hiatus
intended to give the Israelis time to assess where things stood in
the deadlocked peace effort. And after a string of murky comments
from Barak's associates, his office announced at 9 p.m. that
``contacts'' would resume on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting will be a continuation of the meetings that took
place at the beginning of the week and after such a meeting did not
take place today,'' the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are taking pains to distinguish between
``meetings'' and negotiations. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky,
said the Israelis did not believe that negotiations have resumed
since the Camp David peace summit meeting in July _ only ``meetings
to see if we can find a basis to resume negotiations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Erekat, however, suggested that the Israelis were being
disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the first two days of meetings, a schedule had
been established that apportioned time for all the major issues on
the table in the final-status peace negotiations. He said he was
surprised by Tuesday's cancellation. Later, he said he was dizzied
by the re-scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel Rosen, the diplomatic correspondent on Israeli
television's privately owned Channel Two, described what Barak was
doing Tuesday as ``something between a muscle flexing and a cry of
SOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Israeli radio, Danny Yatom, Barak's security
adviser, maintained that there was no rancor involved. ``We are not
angry with the Palestinians, and they are not angry with us,'' he
said. But he suggested that the Palestinians consider taking a more
``moderate, constructive'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself linked the resumption of negotiations _ as opposed
to ``discourse,'' which he said was ongoing _ to a demonstration of
greater flexibility by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
``Negotiations themselves may be held once Chairman Arafat agrees
to discuss the ideas raised by President Clinton at Camp David or
since,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery interview on Palestinian satellite television Tuesday
night, Mahmoud Abbas, who is known as Abu Mazen, expressed intense
frustration with the Israeli and American pressure on the
Palestinians to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Mazen, who is secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and is in line to succeed Arafat as chairman, said the
Americans threatened the Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were threatened with a cut in U.S. aid if we did not
sign,'' he said. ``And if we signed, we were promised more aid.
Here we are talking about a superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Mazen said the Palestinians would not concede ``our
legitimate rights,'' including full sovereignty over East
Jerusalem. But he suggested that the peace effort should not
disintegrate into violence, since the Palestinians would lose an
armed conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle does not necessarily mean that we carry arms,''
he said. ``Our struggle is in holding strong. We know the
capabilities of other side. They have all the power, and we have
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace effort has been troubled since Camp David, when in 15
days the Israelis and the Palestinians made significant headway on
almost every issue except the status of Jerusalem. Both sides claim
that there has been backsliding since then in the conversations
that have taken place sporadically between senior officials on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, said in New York on
Monday that the Americans were expected to assess by week's end how
to direct the beleaguered negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's associates said he placed the possibility of returning
to a summit meeting and reaching a deal at less than 50 percent,
which is why the prime minister has turned his energy to the civic
reforms that he hopes to initiate before he meets his political
fate when Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if he has not reassembled a majority coalition, he will
face a serious challenge to his continued leadership, with the
possibility of new elections. If no agreement with the Palestinians
has been reached, the peace effort would probably be frozen by the
move to elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is important,'' Abu Mazen said Tuesday night. ``But we
won't let it become a sword directed at our necks.''

BUSH OFFERS CHARM TO SOFTEN IMAGE ON `OPRAH' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sitting at the knee of the high priestess of daytime
television, George W. Bush was faced Tuesday with a true Oprah
Winfrey moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us, she said, speaking on behalf of her 7 million, mostly
women viewers, about a time when you needed forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my heart turns dark, when I am jealous, or when I am
spiteful,'' the Republican presidential contender said, terse and
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient but also devilish, Winfrey bore in, ``I'm looking for
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are,'' Bush rejoined, shaking off his reserve with
a grin, ``But I'm running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to Winfrey's famed Harpo Studios seeking not
forgiveness or redemption or any other salve for the soul, but
rather a political lift. He is lagging behind Vice President Al
Gore in some polls _ especially among women voters. And last week,
the Democratic nominee, in his session on the show, appeared to win
over Winfrey, a cultural force who this year decided to add
politics to a sphere of influence that includes broadcasting, books
and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore exchanged high-fives with Winfrey, joked easily with her
and marveled at her choice of footwear _ bright red boots. She
pronounced the stereotypically stiff vice president a ``fun, funny
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, although Winfrey probed him about the emphatic kiss he gave
his wife at the Democratic convention, Gore didn't greet her or say
good-bye with a kiss. ``No kiss?'' she said, disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush filled the gap as soon as he hit the set, planting an
emphatic buss on the cheek of a surprised Winfrey, who thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pleasure,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the energy of the opening, the interview took a
stodgy turn until Bush found his humorous way out of Winfrey's
question about forgiveness. It proved something of a breakthrough
moment. Over the next hour, they talked about his decision to stop
drinking 14 years ago, about the defining moment in his life, and
about the time he asked Queen Elizabeth II about the black sheep in
her family _ and got a raised royal eyebrow in return.
</P>
<P>
   The program was marred by one heckler, the first, Winfrey said,
in the 15-year history of her show. She dispatched him with
imperial calm, saying to cheers, ``I'm sorry, you're interrupting
and we're going to go to commercial break and remove you from the
audience. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the program, Bush whiffed when a 25-year-old unemployed
black woman lobbed him a softball that a more naturally glib
politician would have hit out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   How, asked a woman named Millicent, do people like me fit into
your Republican platform?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you fit into my platform by having a country that says
the American Dream is available to you,'' said a sleepy-eyed Bush.
``In other words, first and foremost, it doesn't matter how you're
raised, what your background is, if you work hard, you can realize
the greatness of the country. I don't know what you're education
background is like, but the young Millicents need to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a commercial break and the forgiveness question, Bush
loosened considerably even as Winfrey and her audience delved as
deeply into the Texas governor's soul as anyone has managed in this
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What's the biggest misconception about you, a viewer asked in a
sidewalk interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably (that) I'm running on my Daddy's name,'' said Bush,
referring his father, former President Bush. ``That if my name were
George Jones, I'd be a country-and-western singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked if Bush was running to vindicate the family name
after his father was beaten by Bill Clinton in 1992?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in the teenyist part of yourself?'' the hostess came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the teenyist, tinyest part,'' he replied.
``Because basically what you're saying is, `Are you running because
of revenge?' Revenge is such a negative thought. I'm running for
positive reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked if Bush's wife, Laura, gave her husband an
ultimatum before he quit drinking in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's a lot of speculation about what Laura said ...
`It's either you or Jack Daniels,' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that true?'' Winfrey replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I think she got disappointed on some evenings. I was
always a fairly disciplined person, I wasn't drinking all the time,
but there were some times when she said, you know, you need to
think about what your doing,'' Bush recalled. ``But she understood
what I understand now and what our society has got to understand:
It requires the person involved to make up his or her mind. That is
what needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostess also asked Bush to describe the defining moment in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the defining moments in my life were, one,
marrying Laura, and, second, the birth of our twins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled how his wife became ill with toxemia after
becoming pregnant with their now 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and
Jenna. Because of her condition, she moved from their home in rural
Midland, Texas, to the more cosmopolitan Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes misting, Bush recalled: ``She got on the airplane and she
said, `These babies are going to be born healthy.' She had that
West Texas determination. I'm kind of tearing up about it a little
because it was such a powerful statement by a mother who said,
`These children will come to be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, Winfrey asked Bush if he was the black sheep
of his family, as he once told the queen of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm running for president, of course, I'm not the
black sheep of the family,'' he said, again triggering laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also related how his trip from Midland to boarding school
gave him his greatest moment of self doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up to a place called Phillips Academy Andover in
Massachusetts, where it was just a whole different world, a
completely different environment from where I was raised and I can
remember thinking how brilliant all the other kids were and how
hard I had to work to catch up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked Bush, who is dogged to this day about his
intellect despite an Ivy League education, if he ever felt he was
not smart enough for the prep school.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, eventually I realized that smarts are not only whether or
not you can write well or whether or not you can do calculus, but
smart is also instinct and judgment and common sense,'' he said.

 &HT;    SENATE PASSES BILL NORMALIZING TRADE WITH CHINA
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. With CHINA-TRADE
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate convincingly approved permanent terms of
trade with China on Tuesday, closing a decade of bitter debate over
the use of sanctions to press for political and social reforms in
the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's 83-15 vote, following House passage of the bill
last May, sets the stage for China to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Geneva-based court that governs global
trade, as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Tuesday that would open the world's
fastest-growing market to increased exports from American
factories, farms and financial service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton applauded the Senate action on a measure he has
repeatedly called the most important foreign policy issue of the
year before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill grants China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
with the United States, assuring Chinese products the same
low-tariff treatment this country accords most of its trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
   That ends a practice rooted in Cold War policies under which the
Congress would review China's trade status each June.
</P>
<P>
   That action had become an annual exercise that linked the rules
that govern U.S.-China trade to the vexing bundle of human rights,
political and strategic concerns at the contentious hub of
Sino-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking those issues off from the trade debate has long been a
central goal of the Chinese government and of large U.S.
corporations that are projected to do $105 billion worth of trade
with China this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who embraced this approach shortly after taking office
in 1993, cast Tuesday's vote as ``a step in the right direction''
toward ushering China into the fold of U.S. partners and the larger
group of nations bound by multinational agreements and common
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about building a world in which more human beings have
more freedom, more control over their lives, more contact with
others than ever before; a world in which countries are tied more
closely together, and the prospects for peace are strengthened,''
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade alone won't create this kind of world,'' he said. ``But
bringing China under global rules of trade is a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill, however, said it moved U.S.-China policy
in the wrong direction. They argued it strips Congress of its
ability to use U.S. trade policy as a tool for hammering Beijing
over a broad range of ongoing human rights and labor abuses, its
efforts to sell advanced weapons technology to U.S. foes and even
its continuing attempts to intimidate the neighboring island
republic of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will deeply regret the stampede to pass this legislation,''
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said during Senate debate on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone attempted to amend the legislation with two separate
provisions seeking to strengthen worker rights in China and to
prohibit trade in products produced in Chinese prisons. Both
amendments failed in separate votes last week, and Wellstone voted
against the bill on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we as U.S. senators do not speak out on human rights, we
are all diminished, and we have not spoken out on human rights in
China,'' said Wellstone. ``Our silence is betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents said China's poor record of complying with
international agreements concerning weapons non proliferation,
human rights concerns and trade accords suggests that Beijing will
perform no better as a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will violate any trade agreement if if serves the
national interest of China to do so,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.
Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be any different this time,'' asserted Byrd. ``We're
suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters, though, hailed its passage as a victory
for the U.S. economy, now taking a beating from the lopsided
Sino-American trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese exporters will sell some $75 billion more worth of
clothing, auto parts, telephones and other goods to the United
States this year than American concerns will ship to China.

</P>
<P>
   The PNTR agreement, and China's entry into the WTO, call on
Beijing to end massive subsidies for state-run enterprises, reduce
import tariffs across the board and end import restrictions that
make it all but impossible for thousands of American companies to
ship their products to China, said Robert Kapp, president of the
U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington trade group representing
some 250 U.S. corporations that do business with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be portrayed as a victory of fat cat companies over
people of conscience,'' Kapp said in a telephone interview. ``But
that is a canard. That, in fact, is not intellectually
legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapp's group has contended for years that increased U.S. trade
with and investment in China would act as a catalyst for
constructive change. The president agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more China opens it markets to our products,'' Clinton
said, ``the wider it opens its doors to economic freedom and the
more fully it will liberate the potential of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and several of the bill's Senate backers conceded that
it would not resolve the long list of issues outstanding between
the world's wealthiest democracy and its largest Communist
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that there will continue to be bumps, some
serious crises indeed, in our relationship with China,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither membership in the WTO nor normalized trade relations
with the United States will magically impose the rule of law on
China or institute deep-seeded respect for human rights,'' Moynihan
said during the Senate debate. ``But certainly it has the potential
to advance those purposes, and that is why we are here and why we
will shortly take this epic decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent normal trade relations means that
Chinese products can be shipped into the United States under the
same low-tariff arrangements this country extends to most of its
global trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   That status has been subject to annual review up until now,
however, in a congressional exercise that has exposed China to the
uncertainty _ and through Beijing's eyes, humiliation _ of having
its behavior placed on trial each year in the court of American
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   WTO rules prohibit such blanket assessments as the basis for
trading relationships among member nations.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations, the United States and China reached
agreement last November over the terms of China's entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
   China is still in separate negotiations with Mexico and
Switzerland over WTO entry. Upon completion of those talks, China
would be eligible for entry, pending the invitation of the WTO's
governing council.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the WTO, China would have the right to seek the
Geneva-based institution's judgment on trade disputes it might have
with the United States, or any other of the WTO's more than 130
member nations.

serious crises indeed, in our relationship with China,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither membership in the WTO nor normalized trade relations
with the United States will magically impose the rule of law on
China or institute deep-seeded respect for human rights,'' Moynihan
said during the Senate debate. ``But certainly it has the potential
to advance those purposes, and that is why we are here and why we
will shortly take this epic decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent normal trade relations means that
Chinese products can be shipped into the United States under the
same low-tariff arrangements this country extends to most of its
global trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   That status has been subject to annual review up until now,
however, in a congressional exercise that has exposed China to the
uncertainty _ and through Beijing's eyes, humiliation _ of having
its behavior placed on trial each year in the court of American
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   WTO rules prohibit such blanket assessments as the basis for
trading relationships among member nations.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations, the United States and China reached
agreement last November over the terms of China's entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
   China is still in separate negotiations with Mexico and
Switzerland over WTO entry. Upon completion of those talks, China
would be eligible for entry, pending the invitation of the WTO's
governing council.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the WTO, China would have the right to seek the
Geneva-based institution's judgment on trade disputes it might have
with the United States, or any other of the WTO's more than 130
member nations.

<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ The federal government and domestic oil producers
have quietly allied themselves in a push to exploit new oil fields
discovered in the deepest waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that oil lies so deep underwater and so far from
shore that the old-fashioned oil rig and pipeline way of doing
business just won't work. So the industry wants to do away with
pipelines altogether, anchoring a supertanker-sized ship over a
deep-water well and using it as a combination drilling rig and
storage facility that could hold up to 2 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pipeline, a smaller supertanker would visit every
three days, suck the crude from the storage rig and shuttle it to a
refinery on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The oil would be expensive to find and extract, but each new
floating rig would have the potential to generate about $2 billion
worth of oil per year, according to one government estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the deep-water oil will be crucial to any American
attempt to get out from under the thumb of the OPEC cartel, and
there has been little public opposition to the proposal, even from
environmental groups usually antagonistic to offshore drilling.
</P>
<P>
   But ferrying oil from these deep-water well systems may pose new
environmental risks not usually associated with the conventional
wells and pipelines already in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The system could raise the likelihood of a major oil spill. The
tankers leaving the rigs every three days would each be carrying
more than twice as much oil as was spilled in 1989 during the Exxon
Valdez disaster in Alaska. Some of the large storage rigs used in
these systems hold 96 million gallons, more than eight times the
oil lost from the Valdez, one of the worst such spills recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, public documents outlining the new oil-extraction
process provide few details on the danger of a collision between a
700-foot-long tanker and a 1,000-foot-long storage rig. Nor do the
documents fully answer whether the new rigs could withstand the
most severe hurricanes the Gulf can dish out.
</P>
<P>
   Oil production experts say that safety and technological
improvements in recent years have significantly decreased the
number of spills per mile traveled by the supertankers, and
lessened the possibility of a catastrophe like the one involving
the Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree no one would bother drilling in such
out-of-the-way fields if prices weren't so high _ $35.10 a barrel
this week, compared to $10 a barrel in early 1999 _ and if federal
regulators weren't holding out carrots worth billions of dollars in
savings to oil companies that start digging deep.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``royalty holiday'' means the government will give
up the 12.5 percent of all revenues it usually claims from
producing oil wells. According to government projections, that
would amount to about $228 million a year for each floating tanker,
roughly the cost of one of the new ships.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson with the Minerals Management Service, a division
of the U.S. Department of the Interior, indicated that the
government will almost certainly be open to the use of the system
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy predicts that domestic oil production
in both the Alaskan fields and the near-shore fields in the Gulf
will decrease by 20 percent in the next 10 years. The government
hopes deep-water oil will fill the gap. About the only thing
standing in the way is the Environmental Impact Statement, an
official government survey of the potential damage to the
environment from the proposed system.
</P>
<P>
   Minerals Management has published its first draft of this impact
statement and is holding a series of hearings to accept public
input on it.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental assessment offers the system a basically clean
bill of health, concluding it poses few new risks. The agency aims
to finalize the document by the Christmas holidays, with the
understanding that any future floating rigs will have to get
individual approval.
</P>
<P>
   The impact statement makes clear that, in many ways, these rigs
pose no more environmental risk than conventional rigs already
operating in the Gulf. But there is at least one major exception,
and that's what oil experts call ``lightering'' _ essentially the
handoff of oil from one boat to another. That's how the companies
plan to get around the lack of pipelines in the deep water.
</P>
<P>
   The floating storage facilities considered in the impact
statement can pump 500,000 barrels of oil every three days,
requiring smaller tankers to visit at least that often. In the
scenario discussed in the study, each new facility will require at
least 110 handoffs of oil while at sea per year. Tankers would
return to sites nearer port and off-load the oil they've just
picked up, adding another 110 handoffs.
</P>
<P>
   These operations are already common in the Gulf. Minerals
Management reports that every day there are at least three
supertankers too large to enter Gulf ports. These tankers must be
unloaded at sea using lightering techniques. Today, most of these
transfers occur near shore and they are suspended in rough weather.
Higher seas 100 and 200 miles off the coast, where the new system
would be used, presumably could make the transfers more hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coast Guard statistics, there were 15 oil spills
during 4,391 of these handoffs between 1986 and 1990. Most of those
spills were small, involving less than 1,000 gallons of oil, the
documents say. Still, that works out to 3.4 accidents per 1,000
transfers. Using these statistics, the Gulf would experience 3.4
more oil spills per year for every five of the floating systems in
use.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coast Guard statistics don't include all the spills that
have occurred during handoff operations, and they overlook one of
the Gulf's largest. In a 1990 accident, an oil tanker caught fire
off the Texas coast during a handoff operation and spilled 3.9
million gallons of oil. An official report concluded the accident _
caused when a pump being used in the oil transfer exploded _ was
``not directly related'' to the handoff procedure.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 similar rig systems have been in use for 20 years off
the coast of Indonesia and in the North Sea. Collisions between the
floating rigs and shuttle tankers have occurred in those places,
the government report acknowledges. But the report provides little
detail and minimizes these risks, simply stating that ``there have
been service vessel collisions with shuttle tankers during hookup
operations, but no spill incidents as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   While the document does attempt to estimate the probability of
disaster under the best of conditions, it offers only scant
information on what could happen when hurricanes or severe storms
create the worst conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used to shut down the pumping mechanisms in the
wells in case of a severe storm has a good record. These devices
can shut down the wells before the storm hits, ensuring that no
matter what happens on the surface, no oil will leak into the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to protecting an oil-laden tanker anchored to
the ocean bottom and tossed by towering waves and hurricane-force
winds, guarantees may be hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that an anchored supertanker loaded with
500,000 barrels of oil could ride out a 100-year storm. According
to the Alabama Oil and Gas Board's oil rig certification
regulations, a 100-year storm would have 130- to 150-mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there have been stronger storms in the Gulf, at
least twice in the past 50 years. In 1969, Hurricane Camille had
winds estimated at about 200 mph. In 1989, Hurricane Gilbert
twirled around the Gulf with winds approaching 225 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The government's impact statement deals with hurricanes in such
a cursory manner that two Minerals Management public relations
officers familiar with the document were unaware that the storms
were discussed at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The one section of the document dealing specifically with storm
risk did not address whether the tanker needed to be emptied to
survive the storm, whether the rigs would keep pumping oil, whether
crew members would stay on board or what would happen if waves or a
collision ripped a ship from the oil-pumping umbilical cord tying
it to the well and the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' said Barney Congdon, with the
Minerals Management Service, when asked what would happen to the
rig and well in a hurricane. ``Perhaps someone could bring it up in
one of the public meetings. Perhaps it was addressed and deemed not
to have environmental consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   One Minerals Management Service official suggested that
hurricane dangers may be more fully addressed in a risk-assessment
report being prepared by Texas A&AMP;M University. However, service
official Deborah Cranswick said the public will not have access to
the report. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Congdon of the Minerals Management Service said that overall,
the proposed rigs already seem to meet the criteria the government
considers when weighing approval for new drilling technologies _
that is, they pose no greater risks than existing systems. Congdon
said that the risks of the floating rigs and tankers appear to be
no worse than the problems posed by 33,000 miles of pipelines now
servicing the thousands of stationary rigs already in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, it is likely the new floating rigs will clear the
rest of the regulatory hurdles and begin harvesting oil from
beneath deep Gulf waters in the near future.

   POOR WRITERS: Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly is not so
sure he likes the new world of journalism at these Games. Olympic

media outlets are using their newspaper, magazine and broadcast

aren't too happy about that. ``I can remember when you came to SI

to write 12 times a week. I'm going for the triathlon of SI writing
_ the magazine, the Web and SI Presents.'' Reilly said some of his

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very warm breezes from the southwest will make it feel more like
the middle of July than the next-to-last full day of summer in the
Middle Atlantic and Northeast Wednesday. Readings will soar into
the 80s in many locations, with some of the warmest spots treading
into the low 90s with moderate humidity under sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, a cold front will bisect the nation from the
northern Great Lakes to the central Mississippi Valley. Along this
front, abundant clouds and showers will develop. Meanwhile, behind
the front, winds will be directed up the Front Range of the Rocky
Mountains, producing clouds, patchy drizzle and very cool
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, central California will remain hot as brisk offshore
breezes dry and warm upon descending the Sierra Nevada. The warmth
will also persist in the Southwest deserts.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MILE-HIGH HEAT
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the temperature at the mile-high city of Denver
soared to a record 95 degrees. Sunday also was the 61st day this
year in which the temperature reached 90 degrees or higher,
breaking the record set in 1994. In the East, the high peaks of the
southern Appalachians rest at a similar elevation and latitude as
Denver. However, 90 degrees is never observed at a mile elevation
in the East. In the Appalachians, altitudes over 5,000 feet are
isolated peaks surrounded by the cool, free atmosphere. In
contrast, Denver is on a large plain, which can be heated
substantially by the sun.

&HT;     BUSH APPEARS ON `OPRAH;' GORE URGES PRIVACY FOR MEDICAL RECORDS
 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's TV talk
show Tuesday, rejected any suggestion that he's seeking the
presidency to vindicate his father's loss of the White House in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term Texas governor bantered with the popular host of
the nationally syndicated Chicago-based television program as
Democrat Al Gore pressed his self-declared populist campaign
against ``special interests'' with a call for new federal laws to
prevent the health insurance industry from misusing patients'
private medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Latest nationwide polls showed Bush narrowing the edge Gore had
built up after the Democratic convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's margin in two surveys slipped to between 2 percentage
points and 5 percentage points. In a hypothetical four-way contest
that included third party candidates Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan,
the bipartisan Voter.com-Battleground poll released Tuesday showed
Bush leading Gore, 41 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A compilation of state-by-state polls tracked by National
Journal's Hotline newsletter put Gore ahead in 20 states with 260
electoral votes and Bush leading in 28 states with 247 electoral
votes. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, warming up for the give-and-take of three televised
presidential debates next month, appeared relaxed and jovial in his
appearance on the Winfrey program, which reaches 22 million viewers
each week, 80 percent of them women.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leaned forward in his easy chair and discussed such
personal moments as the birth of twin daughters 18 years ago, the
challenges of raising teenagers and his decision to quit drinking
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admitted that his life would be ``so much simpler'' if he
and his family had chosen to forego ``the meat grinder of public
opinion'' and remained in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who has less experience in elected office than any GOP
presidential nominee since retired Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in
1952, said ``there's a big call'' that he must answer to lead the
nation because ``I'm deeply concerned about the future of the
country, concerned that some folks are going to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Winfrey to identify Americans' ``biggest
misconception'' of him, Bush replied: ``Probably (that) I'm running
on my daddy's name.'' Bush added: ``I love my dad a lot and I am
proud to be his son. But that is not why I am running.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasized his quest was ``not even in the teeniest,
tiniest part'' motivated by a desire to restore the Bush family to
the White House in order to vindicate the 1992 defeat of President
George H.W. Bush by then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his running
mate, then-Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenge is such a negative thought; I'm running for positive
reasons,'' Bush declared. ``There are better ways to uphold the
honor of my family and that is to be a decent loving citizen who is
willing to contribute to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's humor flashed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked Bush if he had ever needed for forgiveness,
emphasizing: ``I'm looking for specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are,'' Bush quipped. ``But I'm running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP nominee became teary eyed when he discussed the birth of
his twin daughters following his wife Laura's medically troubled
pregnancy. Bush said the couple had been pursuing adoption at the
time Laura became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had appeared on the season premiere of Winfrey's show last
week, becoming the first politician invited to appear on the
15-year-old program. Like Bush, Gore shed his policy-laden campaign
persona to reveal a playful side that included his elliptical
confirmation that he likes to sleep naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the picture?'' Gore told Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday while campaigning in California, Gore sounded the
populist themes that have helped him overcome Bush's pre-convention
lead in nationwide polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to be a fighter for the people, not the powerful,''
Gore told an audience of 150 senior citizens and health specialists
at Sam's Cafi at New Horizons Community Center in North Hills,
Calif., near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, a veteran of 24 years in national office,
cited a case where a medical marketing firm had tried to sell a
database with the names of 380,000 people who suffer from clinical
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong for the insurance companies and the drug companies
to sell your medical information _ putting profits ahead of
people,'' Gore said, adding: ``You have a fundamental right to
privacy, and no powerful interest should be allowed to sell it off
or take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore called for new federal laws to strengthen patients' privacy
protection for electronic and paper records; new criminal and civil
penalties for use against violating insurance companies or HMOs;
and expansion of existing federal law to prohibit insurance firms
from using genetic screening information to discriminate against
people seeking jobs, promotion or health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal was criticized by Bush campaign spokesman Dan
Bartlett, who cited a Sept. 6 review of 24 security government
agency security audits by the General Accounting Office of Congress
that found ``serious weaknesses'' in medical records' security at
the Health Care Financing Administration during the Clinton-Gore
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Al Gore's watch, sensitive medical records of millions
of seniors were left unprotected,'' Bartlett said. ``How can we
expect Al Gore to enact and enforce new privacy laws when his
administration can't even enforce the laws currently on the
books?''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign later accused the Bush campaign of
``selectively using'' information from the GAO study. ``Bush has no
specific plan to improve medical privacy protection,'' Gore
spokesman Douglas Hattaway said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also seized upon Gore's call for greater
privacy safeguards to accuse the vice president of breaching the
privacy of his own mother-in-law, Margaret Ann Aitcheson, to ``make
a political point about prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told a group of senior citizens in Tallahassee, Fla., on
Aug. 28 that pharmaceutical companies are charging such exorbitant
prices that his mother-in-law must pay $108.90 for a one-month
supply of the arthritis medication Lodine _ nearly three times the
$37.80 monthly cost for the veterinary version of the same
medication being used by his ailing 14-year-old Labrador Retriever,
Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty bad when you have got to pretend to be a dog or
a cat to get a price break,'' Gore told the audience of senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But questions have since been raised about the accuracy of
Gore's anecdote. Gore campaign aides now concede that Gore drew the
figures from a House Democratic study on drug prices rather than
from his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway, the Gore spokesman, said Monday that the Gore campaign
would not discuss the costs of the medication. ``We're not going to
give out his mother's private medical information,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush spokesman said that it was ``increasingly likely'' that
Gore had ``fabricated information about his mother-in-law and dog
to score political points,'' adding: ``He's hiding behind medical
privacy when it was the vice president himself who divulged his
family's medical information in the first place. It's too late for
him to hide. He owes the public an explanation of whether he's made
this whole thing up.``

KEEPING ARMS FROM IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMERICAN EFFORTS TO dissuade Russia from selling Iran laser
technology that may be used by the Islamic republic to develop
nuclear weapons qualify as the proverbial ounce of prevention that
is worth a pound of cure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has complained directly to Russian President
Vladimir Putin about the transfer of the laser technology, and Vice
President Al Gore and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson have also
lodged objections with Russian counterparts, as reported in The New
York Times. Such uses of the dialogue between Washington and Moscow
are justified by the perils of nuclear proliferation to regimes as
dangerous as those in Iran or Iraq. The capability of American
leaders to hector Russian officials for this purpose validates the
cooperation the two nations have instituted since the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the American brief against the transfer of laser
technology to Tehran seems to have met with success. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that, as a result of
administration objections, the contract for the sale of Russian
laser technology to Iran ``has been suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial that Putin's government keep its word on this
matter. Because of Russia's dire need for export revenues and
because of Putin's strategic ploy of courting old Soviet clients
such as Saddam Hussein, his government has acquired a reputation
for conducting promiscuous commerce in weapons and military
technology with oil-rich dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Russia is as much in need of cooperation
against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the
United States. Because of Russian brutality in the Chechen
conflict, radical Islamists from Afghanistan to Algeria have marked
Moscow as no less an enemy to Muslims than America. And along the
Asian rim of the vanished Soviet state, Russian forces are
assisting autocratic regimes to resist fundamentalist guerrilla
movements that have a rear-guard sanctuary in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's suspended contract for the sale of laser technology to
Iran ought to be seen as one indication among many that the
security of America, Russia, and the rest of the world depends upon
a cooperative struggle to prevent, or at least delay, the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said recently
that Iran was within five years of having nuclear weapons while
Iraq was less than two years away. The world must hope those
regimes disappear before they acquire such weapons; until then,
nothing in Russia's relationship with Washington should take
precedence over this need for an ounce of prevention.

STICKING TO IT, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By DANA KENNEDY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Beautiful'' may be the title of the new movie
that marks her debut as a film director, but it's not an adjective
Sally Field has heard much during her 36-year career in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never pretty enough, I was never sexy enough,'' says
Field, 53, in the den of her cozy, modest Brentwood home, where her
two Oscars and one Emmy sit inconspicuously on a shelf next to her
youngest son's sports trophies. ``Casting directors would say it to
my face. I've spent a whole lot of my time being devastated. The
business can be profoundly painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Painful, perhaps, but not enough to deter Field, whose unusual
tenacity and often fierce nature have kept her a serious player in
movies and television despite the kind of adversity and petty
humiliation that might have sidelined others years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been easy, it's always been a struggle,'' she says
of a career that ranges from the 1960s sitcoms ``Gidget'' and ``The
Flying Nun'' to Oscar-winning performances in ``Norma Rae'' (1979)
and ``Places in the Heart'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the original little engine that could,'' says Field, who
is indeed little at 5 feet 2 inches and 100 pounds, and whose
childlike voice and easygoing demeanor belie her competitiveness.
``I simply refuse to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Field is celebrating the start of her fifth decade of refusing
to go away with both ``Beautiful,'' which opens Friday and stars
Minnie Driver as a driven beauty-pageant contestant, and a
six-episode guest-starring stint on NBC's ``ER.'' this fall. She
will play the mother of the nurse-turned-resident Abby Lockhart.
The ``ER'' gig, which came in the form of a personal request from
the executive producer, John Wells, was a pleasant surprise. ``I
can't even say what kind of character I play yet,'' she says. ``But
it's an actor's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful,'' however, came as much less of a surprise. It's
the result of the same dogged, sometimes outrageous, career
strategy that Field has used since 1967, when ``The Flying Nun''
ended after a three-year run and she was 21. Field faced the
daunting task of convincing Hollywood that the lively young woman
who had played Sister Bertrille was a serious actress worthy of
film roles. ``No one wanted to see me at that point, no one,'' she
says. ``That was one of the biggest walls I ever faced. Back then,
there was a real stigma attached to television actors. Hardly
anybody crossed over.''
</P>
<P>
   Field got over that hurdle after an audacious audition with the
director Bob Rafelson, when he was casting the 1976 film ``Stay
Hungry.'' Field showed up at the audition and heard Rafelson tell
the casting director that he wanted no part of the former flying
nun. Field, who says she came to the audition dressed in character
as the movie's ``little tart,'' impulsively slipped the
receptionist a note for Rafelson in which she bragged explicitly
about her sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what the character would have said,'' Field insists. It
got Rafelson's attention. ``I'm not the kind of man who will
decline that kind of note,'' he recalls, ``I said, `Send her up
immediately.'''
</P>
<P>
   After several more auditions, Field got the part. ``I still
didn't think Sally was the sassiest, sexiest actress I could have
gotten,'' Rafelson says. ``But she had the most talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Field realized she had hit a different kind of
industry wall: Her age was working against her. ``It's been very
gradual,'' she says of the difficulties facing older actresses.
``But it started creeping up on me and I started preparing. It's
just been fewer and fewer roles. Women over 45 tend to get lost in
this industry. It's not something I dwell on; it's just a fact. So
I decided to look for another way to tell stories outside myself
and stay in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, in 1994 Field began working at the filmmaking lab
at Robert Redford's Sundance Film Institute, first as an acting
adviser to student filmmakers and then in other aspects of
production.
</P>
<P>
   She is now on the board of the institute and works at the lab
with students for several weeks every year. In 1996 she was the
director, executive producer and co-writer of a television movie
called ``The Christmas Tree,'' starring Julie Harris. Two years
later she directed an episode of her friend Tom Hanks' miniseries,
``From the Earth to the Moon.'' ``I wanted to fall in love with
directing and I have,'' she says. ``Now it's just about becoming
really good at it.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Driver and her sister Kate, who produces many of her movies,
brought the ``Beautiful'' script to Field, who was drawn by its
strong roles for women. She saw parallels between Driver's
character, Mona, a working-class woman who sees beauty pageants as
the only escape from her troubled past in a dysfunctional home, and
her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Field, who appears to be a devoted mother to her sons _
Peter, 30, and Eli, 28, by her first marriage and Sam, 12, by her
second _ Mona is ruthless. As she single-mindedly pursues her goal
of winning a pageant, she allows her own daughter, played by Hallie
Kate Eisenberg, to be reared by her best friend (Joey Lauren
Adams), whom the child is led to believe is her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Field elicits an especially strong performance from Eisenberg,
7, as a tough little girl who suspects Mona is her true mother.
Field ``used all the tricks and tools I've learned as an actor'' to
help the soft-spoken Eisenberg speak up forcefully. ``We would
scream at each other so she could learn to shout back at Mona,''
Field says. ``She knew I wasn't really angry at her. It helped her
come up with the right emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Field says, there are many similarities between herself and
Mona. ``I empathized with her need to win and how as a child she
goes to this fantasy world to escape her family,'' she says. ``But
like a lot of us, she puts a cloak on as a child because it's cold
in the house, and keeps it on even when she grows up and doesn't
need it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Field grew up in a show-business family. Her mother was the
B-movie actress Margaret Field, and her stepfather was Jock
Mahoney, a successful stuntman and the star of the 1950s television
show ``Yancy Derringer.''
</P>
<P>
   Most interviews with Field over the years have included stories
about the domineering six-foot four-inch Mahoney, who was, Field
has said, capable of tossing her across the yard in a fit of
temper. ``He was a big, loud, uh, colorful person,'' she says
dryly. ``You were either the world's most colorful human being and
should be anointed in oil or you were an absolute harlot and should
be boiled in that oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Field says, she does not harbor bitterness toward
her stepfather, who is now dead, and credits him with toughening
her up. ``I was a thorn in his side because I was a fighter,'' she
says. ``I decided if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. I decided to be
as big and bold and ugly as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of her friends and colleagues _ like the actresses Kate
Capshaw (whom she hikes with) and Goldie Hawn and the Hollywood
power broker Michael Ovitz, a former junior high and high school
classmate _ say it took a while before Field truly became big and
bold.
</P>
<P>
   One of her oldest friends, Madeleine Sherwood, 78, a retired
Broadway and film actress who played Mother Superior on ``The
Flying Nun,'' says Field ``had an air of desperation'' when she was
younger.
</P>
<P>
   That desperation may have come from her dislike of working on
``The Flying Nun,'' a job that entailed such indignities as
agreeing to fly through the air on a wire at the second Golden
Globes awards ceremony, in 1965, and landing in John Wayne's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood recalls that Field ``smiled so much back then _ this
big grin all the time.'' But she says Field is ``not that concerned
about pleasing everyone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last season of ``The Flying Nun,'' it was Sherwood
who forced Field to audition at the West Coast branch of the
Actor's Studio, of which Sherwood was a member. ``Sally said she
wanted to do more but was afraid,'' recalls Sherwood, who played
opposite Field in the audition scene that won her acceptance into
the studio. Field adds, ``And she made sure I kept studying there
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she went two years without a job after a third,
short-lived sitcom, ``The Girl With Something Extra,'' her part in
``Stay Hungry'' led to her Emmy Award-winning role in the
television drama ``Sybil'' that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Field was on her way to movie stardom, complete with
high-profile romances like her stormy five-year relationship with
Burt Reynolds, with whom she co-starred in ``Smokey and the
Bandit'' (1977) and ``Hooper'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anyone, she's paid her dues,'' says Robert Benton,
who directed her in ``Places of the Heart'' and who watched her
give her infamous ``You like me!'' acceptance speech after
receiving the best actress Oscar the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Of that speech, which has entered Hollywood lore as one of the
Oscars' most cringe-inducing moments, Benton says: ``She just
voiced what a lot of people really feel but would never say when
they win. She's not as cynical as the rest of the world. But she's
as smart as they come. Reinventing herself over and over as an
actress, a producer, a director, she's a textbook case of how to
stay alive creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention comes at a price, however. Her need for people to
like her _ or at least to like what she does _ has not entirely
gone away. When Field, who is currently single, took her old friend
Sherwood to the premiere of ``Beautiful'' at the Toronto Film
Festival this month, Field was ``dreadfully nervous'' about how the
audience would react to the movie, Sherwood says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel waves of tension emanating from her while she sat
curled up in the seat next to me,'' she says. ``I was tense too. I
kept reminding both of us to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Events took a bizarre turn when Sherwood and some of the film's
producers spotted Burt Reynolds, who is currently filming a movie
in Canada, sitting quietly in the same row as Field during the
movie. Sherwood says he never came over to say hello, and Field
says she hasn't seen him in more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to tell her Burt was there, but after we
left, a man out on the street shouted at her that Burt was still
inside,'' Sherwood says. ``She was startled, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   When Field is asked about the Toronto premiere, she admits that
she felt slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, she sounds very much like
the giddy woman at the Oscars in 1984 who wanted people to like her
and was thrilled when they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my little Madeleine by the hand,'' she says of Sherwood.
``It was all a big blur. I just kept holding on tight.''

TIME WARNER AND EMI TRY TO ASSUAGE EUROPEAN REGULATORS' CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a last-ditch attempt to keep European
regulators from blocking their $20 billion merger, Time Warner Inc.
and EMI Group on Tuesday proposed what they called ``substantial''
concessions that may include selling some of their record labels.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger, which would unite two of the world's biggest
music distributors, still faces heavy skepticism from European
antitrust officials who have threatened to block it if the
companies do not make big concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Without spelling out details, an executive at EMI said Tuesday
that the companies ``offered substantial undertakings that go far
beyond'' the limited proposals they had made earlier this month and
are both ``structural and behavioral in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported Tuesday that the companies had offered to sell
off several record labels in Spain, Denmark and other countries, as
well as to withdraw from manufacturing compact disks in Europe and
to make changes in their distribution and production arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the deadline for Time Warner and EMI to propose
remedies aimed at allaying the European Commission's concerns,
which center on the fact that the merger would reduce the number of
major record distributors from five to four and could, officials
fear, severely limit competition.
</P>
<P>
   The EMI deal is closely tied to the $165 billion merger proposed
between America Online Inc. and Time Warner. That deal faces
equally serious objections on the grounds that it would create an
integrated media giant that would control a vast supply of
entertainment as well as the world's biggest online information
service.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on the Merger Task Force, part of the competition
directorate controlled by European Commissioner Mario Monti, have
already circulated a draft recommendation that calls for rejecting
both deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Monti's aides have met with Time Warner and AOL executives
to discuss possible compromises, and the bargaining is now down to
crucial days. The European Commission must decide on the EMI deal
by Oct. 18 and on the AOL deal by Oct. 24.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monti is trying to adhere to tough deadlines that prohibit the
companies from making any new proposals any later than one month
before the deadline for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   After Monti recommends a decision one way or another, the issue
must be aired by an advisory committee of antitrust officials from
all 15 European Union member countries and then be voted on by the
European Commission itself.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the discussions said EMI had already volunteered
to make its music available to competitors of America Online, as
well as to agree on adhering to the prices on the use of
copyrighted music set by national copyright organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Monti appears to want the companies to sell off some of
their catalogs and perhaps even some of their record labels before
he recommends approval. EMI clearly signaled that it has proposed
divestitures, but it and Time Warner own so many record labels
between them that the crucial details lie in exactly which ones
they offer to divest.
</P>
<P>
   During the next several days, European officials in Brussels,
Belgium, will circulate EMI's proposals to rivals, consumer groups
and other companies within the music industry. Among the most
vociferous critics is Walt Disney Co., which has strongly suggested
that both deals are simply too anti-competitive to fix.

BY FINANCING OPPOSITION, U.S. AND EUROPE HOPE TO OUST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In his race for re-election, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is running against NATO and the
United States, not against his democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   He is not entirely wrong to do so. The United States and its
European allies have made it clear that they want Milosevic ousted,
and they have spent tens of millions of dollars trying to get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as the defender of Yugoslavia's sovereignty
against a hostile, hegemonic West led by Washington, Milosevic and
his government argue that opposition leaders are merely the paid,
traitorous tools of enemies who are continuing their war against
him by means other than the bombing that NATO used last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav elections are on Sunday, but there has hardly been
a day since the bombing began in March 1999 that state television
news has not railed against ``NATO aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign at its height, the government has spread its
attacks to include all opposition political parties, independent
newspapers, magazines and electronic media, the student
organization known as Otpor, or Resistance, and any nongovernmental
organization working to promote democracy, human rights or even
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic is trailing the main opposition leader, Vojislav
Kostunica, in opinion polls, the anti-Western campaign is having an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the West is going to most of the institutions
that the regime attacks for receiving it _ sometimes in direct aid,
sometimes in indirect aid like computers and broadcasting
equipment, and sometimes in suitcases of cash carried across the
borders between Yugoslavia and Hungary or Serbia and Montenegro,
which together make up Yugoslavia. Most of these organizations and
media groups could not exist in this society, which is poor and
whose market economy is distorted by foreign economic sanctions,
state monopolies and repression.
</P>
<P>
   Even with foreign aid, government restrictions on newsprint
supplies, border controls and other mechanisms, including high and
repeated fines after suspiciously quick court cases, make it hard
for the independent media to reach their natural market.
</P>
<P>
   As for the opinion polls that show Kostunica in the lead,
Yugoslavia's information minister, Goran Matic, says that these are
orchestrated and manipulated by the United States and the Central
Intelligence Agency. According to Matic, Milosevic is actually far
ahead of Kostunica, and the polls simply serve as a vehicle for the
opposition to claim that the government stole the election once
Milosevic wins.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Matic asserts that the Atlantic alliance has come up with
various scenarios, which include infiltrating its soldiers among
the Yugoslav police and army forces to make it possible for the
opposition to encourage civil unrest in the streets after the
election while claiming that the police and the army are actually
on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Matic has attacked various non-governmental organizations,
including the Center for Free Elections and Democracy, which is
trying to monitor the vote count, as paid instruments of U.S. and
alliance policy. Many such organizations have been raided by the
police, who confiscate computer files and also appear to be
gathering evidence about foreign funding.

<P>
   ``President Milosevic will win this election,'' said Ljubisa
Ristic, the president of the Yugoslav United Left party founded by
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``This is not Hollywood.''
Washington and the West ``are like little kids, wanting something
to happen so much they're fooling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ristic said that the alliance's war produced a new solidarity
among Yugoslavs and ``killed many illusions people had about the
West and about their own opposition leaders, who went to the
countries that were bombing us to seek their support.'' The issues
are clear now, he said. ``It's a decisive time. This is not an
election so much as a referendum, a decision on being an
independent country or a colony. People see what's happened in
Kosovo, what happens when NATO troops enter the country, and they
are not going to allow the alliance's hand-picked candidates to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Kosovo War, the United States was spending up to
$10 million a year to back opposition parties, independent media
and other institutions opposed to Milosevic. The war itself cost
billions of dollars. This fiscal year, through September, the
administration is spending $25 million to support Serbian
democratization, with an unknown amount of money spent covertly to
help the failed rallies of last year, which did not bring down
Milosevic, and on the current election. For next year, the
administration is requesting $41.5 million in open aid for Serbian
democratization, though Congress is likely to cut that request.
</P>
<P>
   Independent journalists and broadcasters here have been told by
U.S. aid officials ``not to worry about how much they're spending
now,'' that plenty more is in the pipeline, said one knowledgeable
aid worker.
</P>
<P>
   There have been complaints that the Americans are clumsy,
sending e-mail messages from addresses like state.gov, the State
Department's address, or summoning people to impolitic meetings
with U.S. officials in Budapest, Hungary; Montenegro; or Dubrovnik,
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   There is little effort to disguise the fact that Western money
pays for much of the polling, advertising, printing and other costs
of the opposition political campaign _ one way, to be sure, to give
opposition leaders a better chance to get their message across in a
quasi-authoritarian system where television in particular is in the
firm hands of the government.
</P>
<P>
   While that spending allows the opposition to be heard more
broadly, deepening the opposition to Milosevic, it also allows the
government here to argue that it has real enemies, and that the
Serbian opposition is in league with them.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, in the state-run newspaper Politika, a long
article used public information from the United States _ including
congressional testimony and Web site material _ to show that the
United States is funding the opposition.

   ```Independent,' `non-governmental' and `democratic' are the
standard phrases the CIA uses to describe organizations established
all over the world to destroy the governments and the societies
that the U.S. government wants to colonize and control,'' the paper
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional testimony, from July 29, 1999, cited U.S.
officials then involved with Yugoslav policy, like Robert Gelbard
and James Pardew, telling Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware about their
projects to create a ``ring around Serbia'' of radio stations
broadcasting into Serbia from Bosnia and Montenegro and about $16.5
million spent in the previous two years to support
``democratization in Serbia,'' with another $20 million spent to
support Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic, who broke away from
Milosevic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony listed some of the recipients of U.S. aid here,
including various newspapers, magazines, news agencies and
broadcasters opposed to Milosevic, as well as various
non-governmental organizations engaged in legal defense and human
rights and projects to bring promising Yugoslav journalists to the
United States for professional training.
</P>
<P>
   All such projects are portrayed by Politika and state television
as a way to undermine the legal government here and its recipients
are labeled traitors to their country.

   Opposition leaders like Kostunica regard such regime tactics as
crass propaganda, but even he is skeptical of U.S. intentions in
paying for non-governmental organizations, some of which, he
believes, are even unconsciously working for U.S. imperial goals
and not necessarily Serbian values.
</P>
<P>
   Other democratic leaders, like Zoran Djindjic and Zarko Korac,
regard these attacks as an indication of Milosevic's desperation
and anxiety on the eve of the first election he is likely to lose
in his entire political career. Given the stakes for Milosevic,
they believe he will do all he can, including the wholesale
stealing of votes, to insure a victory in the first round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are fundamental for Milosevic,'' Korac said.
``These elections are crucial, not necessarily for the immediate
handover of power, but because for the first time Mr. Milosevic
will be delegitimized in the eyes of his own people. He was an
elected dictator, with popular and legal legitimacy. But from now
on he's a true dictator, and he will only be able to rule by force
_ that's a big step for Serbia.''

WHERE AMERICAN POLITICS BECOME A TELEVISED SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 24) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the second debate of his 1984 re-election campaign, Ronald
Reagan was reminded by Henry Trewhitt, then the diplomatic
correspondent of The Baltimore Sun, that he was ``already the
oldest president in history.'' Trewhitt asked whether he had any
doubts about his capacity to function effectively on little sleep
during a national emergency like the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' the president blithely replied, ``and Mr.
Trewhitt, I want you to know also, I will not make age an issue in
this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my
opponent's youth and inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   People all across the country laughed at Reagan's two-liner, but
at the time few considered it decisive. The man at whom the barb
was aimed, Walter Mondale, Reagan's Democratic opponent, was an
important exception, we learn in ``Debating Our Destiny: Forty
Years of Presidential Debates,'' a lively, two-hour PBS special
that has its premiere Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the audience with that,'' Mondale tells the program's
host, Jim Lehrer. ``I could tell that one hurt. I walked off and I
was almost certain the campaign was over, and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of candid, unsparing response, so different from the
evasion and obfuscation most politicians habitually deploy in the
heat of partisan combat, is the hallmark of the program. It
includes interviews with about a dozen participants in presidential
and vice presidential debates in campaigns past, along with
compelling moments from many of the debates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they said had the ring of credibility about it,''
said Lehrer, who conducted all the interviews. ``No game-playing at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   With televised presidential debates once again big political
news, the program's timing is ideal. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican nominee, tried for several weeks to circumvent the
bipartisan commission that has run the debates for a dozen years,
hoping to effect radical changes in the dates, the number and the
format of the series. He failed, largely because he looked as if he
was trying to insulate himself from Vice President Al Gore's
debating skills.
</P>
<P>
   The American voter doesn't much like chickens, and such was the
picture of himself Bush was projecting. It was a major league
blunder. So he reconsidered, backed off and accepted the
commission's terms. The first of three debates will be Oct. 3 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That episode, like the documentary evidence Lehrer has
accumulated in his interviews, conducted over a 10-year-period,
demonstrated just how deeply debates and television have wormed
their way into the American political tradition. We tell ourselves
that we are a nation of laws, but our political system is shaped as
much by habit and party rules as by statute. No law requires a
state to hold presidential primaries or caucuses, no law stipulates
that nominees be chosen at conventions and no law regulates
presidential debates _ yet those are the main events in the process
of selecting a president.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of television has transformed American politics. Unlike
many European countries, the United States allows a free market in
short, often superficial, political commercials, which have
unquestionably coarsened our political discourse. Debates, in the
meantime, at the state as well as national levels, often offer the
less-known candidate his or her only real chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   But do the debates distort reality, or illuminate it? Genuine
clashes of ideas _ real debates in the Oxford style _ are rare;
more often, the candidates, determined to stay ``on message,''
offer only slightly modified versions of their packaged positions.
Journalists, the semi-official scorers, deliver snap judgments that
inevitably influence the electorate. Lincoln and Douglas would not
recognize these televised affairs as the lineal descendants of
their bouts, which seeped rather than slammed into the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, without the debates, American politics might well be even
more mindless than it now is.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer, who has moderated six presidential debates, including
all three in 1996, and who will moderate all three this year, draws
no conclusions in the program about the efficacy or the
desirability of the debates, which have been criticized by some
historians and political scientists for skittering too glibly
across the political surface, subordinating serious issues to
point-scoring and gaffe-avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a conscious decision,'' he told me earlier this
month. ``I decided this was a time to let the participants speak
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view, which is worth about the same as anyone else's,
is that the politicians are stuck with this now. They have to do
it. Nationally televised debates play a big part in the electoral
process, for good or for ill. I think that's a healthy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton tells Lehrer in an interview that he is
convinced debates helped him be a better president. He adds: ``They
force you to come to terms with what you really believe because if
you get into a big fight in a debate, unless you are the world's
greatest actor, it's hard to sit there and defend a position in a
convincing way that you don't believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton is an accomplished debater, especially in the
town meeting format used in the second debate in 1992. ``I love
those things, and I loved that one,'' he says. ``I think I did very
well there.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Bush's seeming aversion to debates reflects,
like so much else in his campaign, the views of his father, the
former president George Bush, a man who has never been possessed of
noteworthy fluency.
</P>
<P>
   When Lehrer asks the elder Bush whether debates should be ``a
required part of the process,'' he replies: ``Nope. I think you
ought to do what's best to get you elected. And if that's best that
you have no debates, too bad for all you debate-lovers. If there
was a guy that couldn't, say, couldn't finish a sentence and yet is
a brilliant contribution as a public servant or an academic or
whatever, why should that one thing be mandatory? Why should a
person be burdened with that decision to have to debate?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad when the damn thing was over,'' Bush says of the
town meeting debate, during which he twice looked at his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush complains that he had been set up, telling Lehrer:
``Beforehand they had rehearsed and identified some of the
questioners, and there was some guy that was, you know, so clearly
was going to be antagonistic to me. And the way the questions were
asked, and I was told later, that how about you back there in the
fourth row, and they singled him out to be the contentious
questioner of George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to part of his performance in a
vice-presidential debate against Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, he is
in a sunnier mood.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he said then: ``Almost every place you can point,
contrary to Mondale's _ I've got to be careful _ but contrary of
how he goes around saying everything bad. If he sees ... if
somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out
there. Whine on harvest moon! I mean, there's a lot going on, a lot
of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is what he says now: ``I was the guy who just said
English was my second language, so maybe ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Several erstwhile debaters compare the experience to a sporting
event. Bush says it was ``like a ball game,'' in a way; the former
president Jimmy Carter says he went in ``as though it was an
athletic competition,'' and the former president Gerald Ford,
harking back explicitly to his gridiron days at the University of
Michigan, says, ``I was anxious to get into the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer begins at the beginning, with the 1960 debate, which was
watched by 60 million to 70 million people and introduced a young
and virile John F. Kennedy to the nation while showing a
flu-ridden, poorly made up Richard Nixon. Bob Dole recalls
listening to it on his car radio and thinking that Nixon was
winning; only when Dole saw the television replay did he realize
that Kennedy ``wiped him out.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, televised debates disappeared from the American
political landscape until 1976. Neither Lyndon Johnson in 1964 nor
Nixon in 1968 and 1972 thought they had anything to gain by
debating. Then, by 1976, Watergate, Vietnam, assassinations and
other experiences had changed forever the way Americans viewed
their government. Many deeply distrusted it, and debates came to be
seen as a useful tool in restoring confidence in the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Carter was grilled about the infamous Playboy
interview, in which he confessed to having ``committed adultery in
my heart many times,'' and Ford astonishingly asserted that ``there
is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.'' That same year in a
vice-presidential debate, Dole described World War I, World War II
(in which he was grievously wounded) and Korea as ``Democrat
wars.'' In retrospect, all three came to believe their missteps had
cost them votes, and his mistake, Dole says, ``made me more
cautious in future debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan scored in 1980 by telling Carter, ``There you go
again,'' when Carter criticized his record on Medicare. It showed,
Carter confesses to Lehrer, ``that he was relaxed and had a sense
of humor, and it was kind of a denigrating thing to me.'' Reagan
scored again at the end when he told voters, ``It might be well if
you ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years
ago?''
</P>
<P>
   But four years later, in Louisville, Ky., Reagan did badly
against Mondale. In his own account, given in 1990, he was too
prepared _ in contrast to Adm. James Stockdale, Ross Perot's
running mate in 1996, who tells Lehrer that he learned only a week
before the debate that he was to take part, was given no briefing
papers or briefing books, and in fact ``never had a single
conversation about politics with Ross Perot in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan spent months getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had more facts and figures poured at me than anyone
could possibly sort out and use, and I call it overtraining,'' he
says. ``When I got there I realized that I was racking my brain so
much for facts and figures on whatever subject we were talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Lehrer's researchers unearthed this gem of
incoherence from that debate: ``7.7 million elderly citizens who
were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings, 7.7 million have
moved up into another bracket since our administration took over,
leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there
had been more than 13 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I didn't do well,'' Reagan tells Lehrer _ but he did
better the next time out, thanks to Trewhitt and his own
quick-wittedness.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests a moral, I suppose: If you're going to mess up,
mess up early when you can still recover.

   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Mike Bailey, a professional, waded into a
manmade pool, grabbed an eight-foot alligator by the tail and
started tugging &UR;  &LR; it back and forth like a wet mop as tourists
watched from behind a steel fence at Seminole Okalee Indian Village
and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait,'' screamed 3-year-old Ryan Keats. ``You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But for $12 an hour, Bailey does.
</P>
<P>
   He reached into the water, wrapped his arms around the
squirming, hissing, 220-pound alligator and carried it to a spit of
sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he gonna bite?'' Ryan screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gonna try,'' grunted Bailey, straining to pin the
alligator to the sand.
</P>
<P>
   The alligator opened its jaws to show two U-shaped rows of
flesh-rending teeth, 40 on the top, 40 on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance for its alligator wrestlers, point out
officials of the Seminole Nation, is available.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey grabbed the alligator's open jaws in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   There are, Seminole officials say, immediate openings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite generous pay and benefits, ``We just don't have enough
alligator wrestlers,'' said Alexandra Frank, operations manager at
Seminole Okalee Village, a small museum and tourist stop between
Miami and Fort Lauderdale on the Seminole Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Seminoles here have entertained tourists _ and
relieved them of their vacation dollars _ by wrestling alligators.
But now, Seminoles say, there is a shortage of young people within
the tribe who want to go into the line of work, preferring college,
e-commerce, casinos and, well, anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So, tribe officials are trying to recruit alligator wrestlers,
and ``just because someone's not a Seminole, doesn't mean we'll
look down on them,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe even advertised in The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel
newspaper. ``WANTED: Alligator wrestlers. Must be brave and a risk
taker. Males and females OK. No experience needed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few people have applied. Most have been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't very many of them going to have a chance of getting a
job,'' said Bailey, a powerfully built 22-year-old who is not a
Seminole but does have a stepfather who is part Choctaw. ``Most of
them just weren't any good.''
</P>
<P>
   And, says Bailey, there is really no such thing as a bad
alligator wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll kill you in a second,'' he said, ``or if you're lucky,
they'll just tear your fingers off.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the chief of the Seminoles, James Bille, lost
a finger while wrestling an alligator in a tourist stop in the
Everglades, as about 100 tourists looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, Seminoles pursue other careers,'' Frank said.
``They're being told again and again to go pursue a college
education. It would be nice to keep it a tradition, but it's their
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   One applicant is Lance Holmquist, 39, who owns a charter boat
company in Key Largo, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never really asked us if we were qualified for the job,''
said Holmquist, who had an interview recently along with a few
others. ``Their only big concern was if we had any kind of heart
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not doing it for the money, but the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I like to take risks,'' he said. ``I like to chase
hurricanes and ride fierce waves. I like to ride my motorcycle in
heavy downpours. I love to go spear-fishing, being surrounded by
sharks in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminole officials said his application is still being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for the call back,'' Holmquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Alligator wrestlers put on four shows a day at the Okalee
Village, and every move, they say, is carefully thought out.
</P>
<P>
   When Bailey grabbed the alligator's tail and began to swing the
gator back and forth in the water, he was not trying to make it
mad, but to make it tired, so that it could be more safely handled.
</P>
<P>
   Alligator wrestling runs deep in Seminole history, long before
the tourists came. Once, the Seminoles captured the alligators and
kept them as a ready source of food, much the same way sailors once
stowed live turtles in ship holds on long journeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't domesticate them,'' said Michael Osceola, 26, who is
the only Seminole alligator wrestler at the Okalee Village. ``They
don't know you, and they'll definitely never love you. They're
dangerous animals. Anything they eat, they swallow whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been drawn to alligator wrestling all his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of my culture,'' said Osceola, as he watched Bailey
wrestle an alligator named Scratch. ``It's not something you can
read out of a book and learn how to do. I'm still learning. I train
every other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Seminole Indians choose not to do what I'm doing,''
he said. ``They're going to college. They're choosing other
careers. They're going off to better themselves. I also thought
that. I went off to college and got my degree in electronics. But
this is what I love, what I'm hungry for.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, tourists passing through South Florida have paid _
the going rate now is $5 _ to watch the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists have complained for years that the
alligator wrestlers abuse the animals during the shows, which end
with the wrestler sitting on the alligator's back, gripping its
snout.
</P>
<P>
   But the alligators are hard to hurt, wrestlers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there's any physical harm done,'' at least to
the alligator, said Kent Vliet, an alligator biologist at the
University of Florida. ``But the animals definitely don't like it.
They try to turn and run. I think they'd prefer to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the alligator pit, Bailey rode Scratch's back as Ryan
tried to climb his father's leg in the audience, begging to be
picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' said his father, Steve Keats. ``I'll protect
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people have no concept of how dangerous an alligator is,
said Osceola. They move faster across dry land than a person can,
and if they attack in the water, they are even more deadly.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he wrestled three of them. ``I knew I was alive,'' he
said, when it was all over and he was still intact. ``I was still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications are still being taken.

<P>
   The University of Chicago's newest classroom building seems like
a riddle unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is not actually new; it originally opened in 1885. It
features not gargoyles and spires, as the university's neo-Gothic
campus does, but gold-plated carvings and hand-painted tiles. And
it is not anywhere near Chicago. In fact, it sits directly across
the street from the offices of the current president of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   But sure enough, some 84 students filed into the building _ a
former plantation house owned by a Chinese spice merchant who lived
in Singapore _ this week to start a two-year MBA program that is
part of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. Mostly executives in
their 30s, the students comprise the new campus' first class, and
they personify the expansionist dreams of the best-known American
business schools.
</P>
<P>
   Imitating the companies they study, some of the business schools
are spending millions of dollars to set up satellite operations
around the globe. The schools' rationale for expansion mimics the
goals of international companies as well: they hope to find new
sources of revenue, establish a brand name in far-away places and
learn lessons about how other markets function.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Singapore building is modeled after one in Barcelona
that the school built in the 1990s. Last month, Duke began offering
classes in Frankfurt, Germany, and will open a campus there in
January. The Harvard Business School has set up research centers in
Hong Kong and Buenos Aires and plans to add another in Europe.
Northwestern and the University of Pennsylvania are collaborating
with McKinsey &AMP; Co., the consulting firm, to create the Indian
School of Business in Hyderabad next year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Europe's top schools have undertaken similar
initiatives. The London Business School and Columbia are accepting
applications for the first class of an MBA program they will
jointly run. Meanwhile, not far from Chicago's Singapore campus,
Instead, a 40-year-old business school based in Fontainebleau,
France, opened its own MBA program at the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a major business school,'' said Gary D.
Eppen, a deputy dean at Chicago who oversees the Singapore program,
``we think it's important that you be represented in the major
economic cities of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the activity is in Asia, where there is no
internationally known MBA program but where thousands of students
want the degree. ``There's going to be a great talent pool to
tap,'' said Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman
Sachs, who sits on the advisory board of the Indian School of
Business along with the top executives of DaimlerChrysler, GE
Capital, Royal Dutch/Shell and other large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These economies are changing rapidly, and we all need business
leaders who understand the dynamics of technology-driven global
marketplaces within the context of their own business realties,''
Paulson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the universities, the new campuses also represent one of the
most elaborate experiments yet undertaken in so-called distance
learning _ the use of the Internet to teach classes. The new MBA
programs are something of a middle ground between traditional
on-campus courses of study, which require students to live near one
another and their professors, and the less expensive online-only
degrees now being offered by for-profit schools like Jones
International University.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at most of the foreign outposts, students spend a week
or two studying with professors who have flown in from the home
campus to teach them. They then take about a month off from
classes, return to their jobs and do homework at night and over the
weekend. They use e-mail to bounce ideas off one another and to
pose questions to teachers living thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the schools are betting that there is a substantial
number of managers in other countries who are willing to pay a
large premium to receive a prestigious American degree, rather than
attending a local school that awards MBAs.
</P>

<P>
   Jeanette Wong is a typical customer. A native of Singapore who
has worked for J.P. Morgan the last 14 years, she runs its office
there and helps manage its foreign exchange, bond and other
markets-oriented businesses. But Wong still thought she needed the
kind of detailed training that rarely comes on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing so fast,'' she said. ``I'm looking for
fresh insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her experience, she was not sure she would learn enough at
any of Singapore's local MBA programs to justify the time it would
take to earn the degree. Traveling to Hong Kong or another city for
a part-time program was out of the question, she added, because she
and her husband have 10- and 12-year-old sons.
</P>
<P>
   So Wong applied to the first class of Chicago's new program _
largely because of the school's reputation for quantitative rigor,
she said _ and is paying out of her own pocket $65,000 for the
two-year program. The tuition is more than twice what another
program in Singapore would have cost, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in contrast to students in those other programs, Wong will
have only limited access to her teachers. Once every six weeks, two
Chicago professors will fly to Singapore to teach five days of
intensive classes in marketing or finance and then return to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule, which is similar to Chicago's in Barcelona and
Duke's in Frankfurt, contains potential problems for both the
students and faculty members. The students will have much less of
an opportunity to have impromptu discussions with their teachers _
and each other _ than they would at a full-time program. Schools,
meanwhile, have to convince their professors to fly halfway around
the world every year to keep the programs afloat. Otherwise, they
must rely on part-time teachers and can no longer credibly say that
the programs are similar to the American versions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The programs can become a large new revenue stream for the
schools, however. Because companies often pay the tuition bills for
their executives, business schools are sometimes able to charge
considerably more for part-time programs than they do for full-time
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Deans say that most of the difference covers additional lodging
and technology costs. Still, the numbers can quickly become
attractive for academic institutions with modest budgets. For
example, Duke will take in about $15 million this year solely from
the students in its two international programs, one that meets both
in Frankfurt and on the Duke campus in Durham, N.C., and the other
that meets in several cities around the world over two years.
</P>
<P>
   There are intangible benefits, too, deans say.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the combination of a strong economy and a
relatively small number of people in their 20s has caused
applications to full-time MBA programs to drop at most top schools
the last two years. Without the continuing boom in foreign
applicants, particularly from Asia, the drop would be even steeper.
By building campuses overseas, the schools tap new pools of
students who do not want to move to the United States for a
full-time MBA program and also broadcast their names to those who
are considering a move.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new programs force faculty members to put their
research in the context of another country. ``We can't just take
our notes and use them in Europe or Asia without any changes,''
said Robert S. Hamada, Chicago's dean.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that business schools have looked
overseas. About a decade ago, as students and corporate executives
were criticizing MBA programs as too focused on the United States,
some schools began offering classes abroad, too.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first was the University of Michigan, which began
teaching MBA classes in Hong Kong in 1991. It limited enrollment to
the executives of a small group of companies that had agreed to
support the program. Other schools, like Northwestern, have signed
partnerships with foreign schools and award degrees jointly. But
the Asian financial crisis delayed some of the most expensive
projects, like Chicago's Singapore campus.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most ambitious of the current round of efforts is
the Indian School of Business. Conceived by Rajat Gupta, a native
of India who is McKinsey's managing director, the school plans to
open next year in Hyderabad, a technology-heavy city in the
south-central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The program will last one year and, unlike Chicago's and Duke's
programs, will require students to quit their jobs and enroll full
time. For faculty, the Indian school will rely on other
universities _ mainly Northwestern and Pennsylvania _ for half of
its teachers and hire its own professors for the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping the local talent pool helps solve one of the biggest
problems facing the globalization of the American business school:
a decided lack of wanderlust on the part of some research-minded
professors. ``The main challenge is how do you get your faculty to
go to these locales year after year,'' said Russ Winter, a
professor of marketing at the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business, who is on a committee now
trying to decide whether the school should start a program in Asia.
``Two weeks or three weeks in a foreign locale is not conducive to
research productivity.''

<P>
   Many political junkies long have thought it appropriate the
presidential elections and the Olympics always are held in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   OK, for sure one old ragtag political writer long has thought it
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   I offer the caveat because if there is one thing political
writers and, especially, broadcasters have in common with their
sports counterparts, it's not just a pronounced tendency to
exaggerate. It's the strong inclination to see everything as a
death or victory situation almost minute by minute and, certainly,
without shame.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you know how it is. A team wins a game or two and it's
looking great and is well on its way to the sport's grand title. It
loses a couple and that's it for the season _ and, quite likely,
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The sports folk virtually can move from the thrill of victory to
the agony of defeat on a play-by-play basis. Expand it to a winning
or losing streak of three or four games and we're assured the team
either has the title cinched or is halfway or more to the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Victories can _ and are _ attributed to all sorts of folk.
Probably more often than not the commentators declare the victories
are the products of a player or players who really came to play.
Losses _ at least those without a spectacular player goof-up _ tend
to be piled on the backs of coaches or managers.
</P>
<P>
   During the Olympics, we have a veritable myriad of games with
opportunities for gold medals, at least spots on the victory stand,
or terrible disappointments for the players, their coaches and,
yes, their countries. All these conclusions, you understand,
usually are alternated throughout the playing of one game, with one
flat declared at the end of each session on the playing fields _ no
matter if the fields are surface, water or air.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of something less than three minutes the other
night, a women's water polo team from the United States was doomed
to losing, hinted at deserving drowning and yelled to be a terrific
example of skilled and brilliant athletes. As a viewer who saw just
those few minutes of play, I felt enormous relief the commentators
never had a chance to literally pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   As a political writer who had been reading a lot of political
writing that night, I confess to an awful feeling of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Let us, for example, recall the already hazy history of Democrat
Al Gore and his current _ and most recent _ run for the presidency.
Because he's the vice president, and vice president to the
controversial Bill Clinton at that, not many pundits and/or
reporters even harkened back to 1988 when Gore ran a perfectly
dreadful nomination campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a great general tendency to contend he'd
likely never be able to shake off his ties to Clinton _ the
president he'd declared to be great.
</P>
<P>
   Remember? Remember when Bill Bradley was going to give Gore a
great race for the Democratic nomination, how former New York
Knicks player Bradley was a cinch to do well in the Northeast _
especially in New York and in New Jersey, which he had served as a
U.S. senator?
</P>
<P>
   How many who were telling you all this also were telling you how
George W. Bush already had won the Republican presidential
nomination before he even formally announced his candidacy? How
many? About the same number who then brightly reported John McCain
was well on his way to whipping the pants off the Texas governor
and was almost certain to wind up the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone who dealt with the Democrats back then who even
paused to take a deep breath between predicting great things for
Bradley and declaring, correctly, Gore was a dead cinch to win the
Dem nomination? Yeah? Name 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, is the textbook example of one who well knows
the peaks and valleys of sports and political correspondents. After
all, he was associated with the Texas Rangers baseball team; ran
successfully against Democrat Ann Richards, an enormously popular
Texas governor few thought he could beat; and was suggested to be
dead in the political waters after one presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   That, you understand, all came before about every political
pundit of any caliber had made it clear he was light years ahead of
Gore, the Dem vice president who almost certainly never could catch
up to the GOP governor.
</P>
<P>
   Heard or read any political commentary lately? Most of the
commentators already are tired of Gore's being way in front, so now
there's a great tendency to insist this is going to be the closest
presidential race since 1960 and still could go either way _
especially if Bush wins his first debate with Gore on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and who's going to decide who won the debate and why?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, piece of cake. Just ask a sportswriter. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joel I. Klein, the head of the Justice Department's
antitrust division and chief architect of the government's case
against Microsoft Corp., announced Tuesday that he would be
stepping down at the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's departure will come within days of the Supreme Court's
decision on whether to review the order proposed by the government
to break up Microsoft following a court's findings that the company
bullied competitors, stifled innovation and repeatedly violated the
Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Since he will be succeeded by A. Douglas Melamed, his chief
lieutenant and right-hand man in the Microsoft matter and other
major pending cases, officials said the resignation would have no
impact on the direction of the antitrust division. Klein's
departure had been widely expected as the Clinton administration
entered its final months.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials said Tuesday that Klein, 53,
could command a top position should Vice President Al Gore become
president, Klein suggested that it was time, after nearly eight
years as an official in the Clinton administration, to leave
government. He had joined the administration in 1993 a few months
after President Clinton came to Washington, replacing Vincent
Foster as deputy White House counsel after Foster committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relaxed in an open-collared shirt and blue blazer,
Klein said Tuesday in an interview in his office that he had no
idea where he would land next, other than that he was ``exploring
options throughout the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the chance of a lifetime, to spend time and talk to a
lot of people about what to do next,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein leaves the Justice Department with a formidable track
record. While less aggressive than some earlier antitrust chiefs _
particularly those during the 1960s and earlier in the century _ he
challenged some of the nation's biggest businesses, forcing
corporate captains to take notice of Washington when contemplating
mergers, joint ventures, business expansions and pricing policies.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the Justice Department announced a number of
record-breaking antitrust fines, recouping nearly $2 billion in
total, an unprecedented sum for one of the department's smaller
divisions. (The annual budget of the division is about $100
million.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed mergers or joint ventures that were abandoned
in the face of challenges by Klein were Lockheed Martin-Northrop
Grumman, WorldCom-Sprint, and Northwest-Continental. The division
also has pending a number of important civil cases, including a
monopoly maintenance suit against American Airlines and an
anti-competition case against Visa and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   In the criminal arena, the department broke up a major global
vitamins cartel and began an investigation of Sotheby's and
Christie's.

TOKYO PREPARES ANOTHER SPENDING PACKAGE TO BOLSTER ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government is preparing yet another package
of supplemental spending aimed at propping up the economy, which
has failed to gain enough momentum on its own despite several
previous injections of money.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials suggested Tuesday that the new supplemental
budget to be announced on Wednesday would increase public
expenditures in the current fiscal year by 3 trillion to 4 trillion
yen, or $28 billion to $37.4 billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   They said the so-called headline amount might exceed 10 trillion
yen, or $94 billion, with the inclusion of credit guarantees for
small businesses, tax breaks for home buyers and other programs
that do not require cash outlays.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is already the world's largest debtor, and the new package
will add further liabilities to be financed. Earlier this month,
Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit rating on Japanese
government bonds for the second time in two years, concerned about
the country's rapidly growing debt load.
</P>
<P>
   This year's record 85 trillion yen budget _ currently $795
billion _ had been intended to ensure against the need for further
spending. But as the public works appropriations in the last
supplemental budget were exhausted, and support for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party plummeted, politicians decided that
additional spending was necessary to protect the country's
off-again-on-again economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, their concern about further swelling the
government's liabilities was clear Tuesday, reflected both in the
smaller size of the new package and in pledges by government
officials to limit the issuing of bonds to finance the package.
``The basic policy is to minimize bond issues,'' said Taichi
Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Shizuka Kamei, the head of the governing party's
policy-making arm and a critic of colleagues who advocate fiscal
restraint, said the government was likely to issue construction
bonds to pay for a portion of the additional expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the market, a bond is a bond,'' said Ronald Bevacqua,
senior economist at Commerz Securities. ``Whether it's a
deficit-financing bond or a construction bond, it increases the
government's financial obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sakaiya and other officials worry that further bond
issuance will cause a rise in interest rates, making the
government's debt payments more expensive. ``Their job is getting
tougher and tougher,'' said Kunji Okue, senior economist at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. ``They're worried about an
increase in their debt service obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to any new bonds, the government will be required to
issue a staggering amount in bonds to refinance existing debt. This
fiscal year, the government will issue 53 trillion yen in
refinancing bonds _ now $495 billion _ and that will rise to 63
trillion for refinancing the following year. By the fiscal year
2006, almost 100 trillion yen in bonds will be needed just to
refinance public debt, Okue said.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget seems to be a small victory for fiscal
conservatives in the government, like Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Koichi Kato, a leading figure in the ruling party who
has lobbied hard for restraint. The last supplemental budget,
passed in November 1999, cost 18 trillion yen, and Kamei, the
Liberal Democrats' policy chief, was lobbying for a similarly large
supplemental budget this time.
</P>
<P>
   Kamei sought Tuesday to emphasize the total size of the package,
notably the noncash components like credit guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But economists doubted their effectiveness, and noted that there
was still 7 trillion yen in government credit guarantees _ about
$65 billion _ available under less restrictive programs from the
last two supplemental budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a small-business person borrow from a more
restrictive loan program when he can still tap the special program
that doesn't require any rigorous financial checks?'' Okue of
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson asked.

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Talking to Darrell was like opening the
``Physicians' Desk Reference'' and throwing a handful of darts. The
telephone company retiree rattled off ailments that have afflicted
him and his wife and the medicines that have provided varying
degrees of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Darrell's only regular drugs are to control his blood
pressure and help his circulation. His wife is also using only a
couple of prescriptions routinely at the moment. Their total
monthly outlay for drugs, he said, is not much more than $100. Part
of the cost is picked up by his retirement plan, and even more is
laid off on a supplemental insurance policy, he said with sheepish
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   So would Darrell like for the government to pay for the couple's
prescriptions? You bet, he said, perhaps predictably and without
hesitation, as he walked toward his car in the parking lot of a
national discount store.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take Madame Curie to discover why the idea of adding
prescription drugs as a guaranteed benefit under Medicare is
popular and is one of the issues driving the presidential race in a
state like Florida _ where about one-third of likely voters are 60
or older. In a low turnout election, seniors can account for 40
percent or more of those who show up at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceuticals are the fastest growing health-care expense,
according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and are
expected to increase this year by an estimated 11 percent, compared
with 7 percent for physician services and 6 percent for hospital
care. While Americans 65 and older make up about 13 percent of the
population, they account for more than a third of the nation's
total drug expenditures, the foundation reported.
</P>
<P>
   But most seniors have seen a thing or two in their lifetimes,
and the prescription-drug plans being offered by presidential
contenders Al Gore and George W. Bush are not being swallowed
without some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell and other elderly shoppers who stopped to chat,
including some with their own medical horror stories, are concerned
about the overall cost of any government plan _ to themselves as
well as to the government. And they wonder whether everyone,
regardless of means, should be covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, on paper, wants prescription drug coverage,'' said
Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South
Florida. ``But there's a little apprehension. They have a gut
feeling it's going to be expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Democratic National Convention, as the race
tightened nationally, Vice President Al Gore hit Florida to promote
his $253 billion plan (over 10 years) to include a
prescription-drug benefit under Medicare. Three weeks later, Gov.
George W. Bush showed up with his $198 billion plan focused on the
poorest seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Each party is running a television ad in Florida that touts its
candidate's proposal and seeks to raise doubts about the opponent's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of them has a loophole,'' MacManus said. ``That really
confuses people.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the highly unscientific parking-lot survey, the issue
is not a slam dunk for either candidate but seems to favor Gore.
While Bush raises questions about Gore's $600-a-year ``big
government access fee'' (as it's called in a new Republican
National Committee television ad), the shoppers said that seemed a
fair price for full coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend Gore's proposal is but the latest example of
Democrats' ``Hillarycare,'' their taunting tag for the first lady's
fumbled attempt, at the beginning of the Clinton-Gore
administration, to provide government-financed universal health
care.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans may not be reckoning with the seniors' outrage
at pharmaceutical companies _ a frequent Gore target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a powerful issue,'' MacManus said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the ages have shown, do not underestimate the political
power of bread, circuses and government-subsidized Percodan.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS TO ACQUIRE COBALT NETWORKS IN $2 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems Inc. said Tuesday that it had
agreed to acquire Cobalt Networks Inc. in a stock swap valued about
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., produces
so-called Web appliances, which are relatively low-cost computers
preconfigured and preloaded with software to perform specific tasks
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Cobalt allows Sun to address a fast-growing portion of
the market that could not be reached readily with its own typically
more expensive and more complex products. Cobalt also gives Sun a
product line based on the Linux operating system and Intel
microprocessor design.
</P>
<P>
   Sun shares gained $2.625, to close at $117.875, in Nasdaq
trading. Cobalt shares rose nearly 40 percent, to close at $57.375,
up $16.25. Cobalt went public in November and rode the enthusiasm
for Internet and Linux stocks to a 52-week high of $172.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sun has been one of the fastest growing and most
profitable technology companies in recent years, it has been
perceived as vulnerable to an onslaught of inexpensive servers
running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2000 operating system or Linux.
Although Sun's own servers and its Solaris operating system are
something of a gold standard on the Internet, they are neither
inexpensive nor easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said the Cobalt
acquisition addressed that potential vulnerability head on. ``This
extends their reach and gets the product line below $1,000,'' he
said. ``I think we can stand up and applaud this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt's core products include the Raq, a thin server typically
bought by Internet service providers and used in stacks of as many
as 40 machines, and the Qube, a small, desktop server designed for
small to medium-size businesses or business units, which comes
preloaded with software for Web access, e-mail management and file
service. Primary competitors include the PowerApp line by Dell
Computer for the Raq and the Interjet by IBM for the Qube. The Raq
and the Cube are both built using Intel-compatible microprocessors
from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more users are aware of the appliances and how easy
they are to use, and how much time and money can be saved in
administration costs,'' said Pushan Rinnen, an analyst with
Dataquest. ``Sun is jumping to buy a good platform. Another
distinct feature for Cobalt is they have over 1,500 developers
doing applications solely for this platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun said it believed that the Cobalt acquisition would be
accretive, meaning that it would add to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains on the sale of equity
investments and research and development charges for the second
half of this fiscal year. In the first half of its fiscal year,
which ended June 30, Cobalt had revenue of $28.3 million, nearly
four times the $7.7 million it reported in the period a year
earlier. Cobalt's net loss for the six months ended June 30 was
$8.6 million.

10 CUBANS RESCUED AFTER PLANE CRASHES IN GULF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a dramatic sea rescue reminiscient of the Elian
Gonzalez saga, 10 Cubans were pulled from the Gulf of Mexico
Tuesday and brought to US soil after their small plane went down
during an apparent hijack attempt from western Cuba, US and Cuban
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine survivors and one corpse were plucked from the waters of
the Yucatan Pass, about 60 miles west of Cuba, by the crew of a
passing merchant ship. All of them were being brought to Key West,
Fla., accompanied by US military and Coast Guard personnel, where
the survivors will be treated, US officials said. But their fate
beyond that _ whether they would remain in the US or returned to
Cuba _ was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials had been able to confirm that there were only
10 people aboard the plane _ despite initial reports of 18 _ there
were still more questions than answers about the flight and how it
ended up in the water between Cuba and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At least one survivors appeared to be badly hurt, officials
said. The remaining survivors _ two men, three women and three
children _ were not believed to be seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern at this time is the safety of the
individuals who have survived,'' Rear Admiral Thad Allen of the US
Coast Guard told a press conference at the Opa Locka Airport in
suburban Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of Cuban exiles who strongly oppose the 40-year
communist rule of Cuban President Fidel Castro, confusion _ and
rumors _ surrounded nearly every facet of the incident, first aired
on Spanish-language radio early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban aviation authorities in Havana contacted Miami airport
officials that the plane was hijacked from the island's western
Pinar del Rio province and was possibly US-bound.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Soviet-built Antonov An-2, was used mostly for crop
dusting in Pinar del Rio's tobacco fields. Cuban officials said
they received word of the hijacking from the pilot soon after
taking off from the town of Herradura, but offered no details on
those aboard or the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was said to be low on fuel, was then reported
missing over the Florida Straits, but a Panamanian merchant ship
radioed rescue officials it had found the passengers clinging to
debris in the water about 180 miles southwest of Key West and 60
miles west of the west end of Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico. Rather
than head toward Florida, the plane appeared to have flown west
toward Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials asked the ship to head toward Key West and
said they would rescue the passengers when they were closer to land
and within flying range of their headquarters. An agency
spokeswoman said a doctor would be lowered from a helicopter to the
ship to determine the extent of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A US Coast Guard aircraft was flying over the area of the rescue
to confirm the wreckage was that of the plane and to look for any
more survivors. It was not known if the plane had crashed or
deliberately ditched.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the survivors once they reach US soil will
likely turn out to be another tricky test for US immigration
authorities, who struggled through the six-month long ordeal of
Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old shipwreck victim who was rescued off
the Florida coast last November.
</P>
<P>
   Under US immigration policy, which was revised in 1994, Cuban
migrants who escape their country and reach US shores are allowed
to stay but those rescued at sea are returned to Cuba unless they
can convince authorities they would face persecution if
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   The US Immigration and Naturalization Service declined to
comment on what might happen to any survivors. Likewise, Cuban
officials made no official comment on Tuesday's sea rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A senior US State Department official, asked about how the US
government would deal with any hijackers, said, ``If they want an
asylum hearing, that would be a consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been previous hijackings of planes from Cuba in
recent years. In August 1996, a small plane hijacked by three
Cubans plunged into the Gulf of Mexico on its way to Florida. All
three hijackers and a pilot on board were rescued by a Russian
freighter.

&HT;     ADVOCATES OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE OVERHAUL PRESS CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain vowed Tuesday not to give up
fighting for an overhaul of the nation's campaign finance rules,
although he has conceded that action is highly unlikely in a
presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Senate will not proceed next year until we take up
and address the issue of campaign finance reform,'' said McCain,
R-Ariz., who co-sponsored the overhaul with Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow a minority of the U.S. Senate to stay in the
path of these reforms,'' McCain said, referring to members of his
own party who have blocked the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ the principle legislation aimed at banning the
largely unregulated donations known as soft money _ has stalled in
Congress, which is scheduled to wrap up its work by early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think realistically, our hopes are focused on the next
Congress,'' said Jeff Cronin of Common Cause, a nonpartisan group
that specializes in campaign financing. ``As soon as February of
next year there could be a major showdown on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, advocates of the McCain bill are continuing to
lobby for changes during what is almost certain to be the most
expensive federal election in history.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill rally, McCain and Feingold joined Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura in pressing for an end to ``politics with a
pricetag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need campaign finance reform now because a democracy
shouldn't run on money. It should run on ideas,'' Feingold said.
``No one should have to pay a toll to have access to our elected
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., urged lawmakers to
close the soft money loophole that allows corporations, unions,
special interest groups and individuals to donate unlimited amounts
of money directly to the political parties, skirting regulations
that govern donations to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The money is not supposed to be used to directly benefit a
candidate, but can be used for party-building activities,
get-out-the-vote initiatives and issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions directly to candidates are known as hard money.
These donations are limited by law and go directly to candidates
for helping them get elected.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 and the first part of 2000, the two parties have
accepted $256 million in soft money, 82 percent more than this time
four years ago, according to a Common Cause report. Of that money,
the Republican Party has raised $137 million, the Democrats $119
million.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties raised a combined $262 million in soft money for
the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are poised to surpass the 1996 record, said Steven
Weiss of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies the role
money plays in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties will raise record amounts of soft money in this
election cycle, probably in the realm of half a billion dollars,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties bend the rules by using soft money to pay for
advertising that often advocates _ or attacks _ issues or positions
linked closely to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say soft money pays for political research,
fund-raising efforts and voter drives _ all of which affect federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more soft money a party raises, the more soft money they
can spend on issue ads,'' Weiss said. ``The issue ads have been
shown to work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft money that frequently funds the advertising only
contributes to the voting public's distrust of the political
process, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not have a full understanding of the role of money
in politics, but they do know there's a lot of money in the
system,'' Weiss said. ``The more money that's involved in the
political process, the more removed the voters are from the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Although voters have the power to elect representatives,
``voters have little if any control over who their politicians are
thankful to,'' Weiss said. ``The more money that's involved in the
process, the more interests they'll be thankful to once they are
elected. And that means the politicians are listening to a lot more
than their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush and
Democratic hopeful Albert Gore have supported overhaul plans
although neither has foresworn soft money.

   During the Democratic National Convention, Gore pledged that if

enacting campaign reform.

reform will be the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I send to

TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL ENTRIES FOCUS ON WOMEN AND THEIR SEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (for release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's Toronto Film Festival, which ended last weekend,
highlighted at least one trend worth noting: women directing women
in movies that are openly about sex _ not lyrical playhouse
lovemaking, but extreme behavior that makes the participants come
to grips with the way that sex can ruin lives.
</P>
<P>
   No one is completed by physical relations in ``Baise-Moi'' (
``Rape Me''), ``Une Vraie Jeune Fille'' (``A Real Young Girl'') or
``Scarlet Diva'' _ none of which have release dates yet in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French film ``Baise-Moi,'' co-directed by Virginie Despentes
and Coralie Trinh Thi, had to be the most talked about picture at
the festival; it happens to be one of the most talked about movies
in Europe this year as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Manu (Raffaela Anderson) and Nadine (Karen Lancoume), a
pair of young Frenchwomen, are raped together, their violation is
shown in explicit detail: There is no being spared the horrific act
of penetration because the filmmakers don't cut away. Probably the
most awful onscreen moment in years is seeing Manu, her face
distant and impassive as she's being brutalized. Because she
doesn't react, this scene burrows into the most primal fear.
</P>
<P>
   During the scene, a gasp _ the kind that the extras in movie
crowd scenes never get right _ erupted in the theater, and a number
of people rose shakily to their feet to exit. It is such a powerful
sequence that one strains to imagine what could follow it, and,
unfortunately, the directors did not strain their imaginations
enough.
</P>
<P>
   After the repellent cruelty, the stars of ``Baise-Moi'' chase
thrills and wreak their vengeance on men: The movie could be
described as ``Thelma and Louise Get Busy.'' When the movie plops
into the grinding ordinariness of a porno film, complete with a
second-rate score with chittering wah-wah guitars and bleating
horns, all the horror that the film conjured up is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The real shock of this film is the inability of the directors to
seize upon the discomfort of the audience and expose them to Manu
and Nadine's suffering. As a result, the slender border between art
and exploitation is quickly destroyed, and when the two women begin
their spree of violence, the cheap-looking splatter of viscera
distracts the audience. Something raw and haunted has been
squandered, and it's understandable that by following this trail of
gore, these characters are chasing what little self-esteem they had
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Scarlet Diva,'' written, directed and starring Asia
Argento, the daughter of the Italian genre filmmaker Dario Argento,
the protagonist seeks to expose the yearning consuming her. Parts
of her depiction of _ gasp _ the violence coursing through her
psyche in a roaring version of her own life seem sophomoric and
half-baked: B-movie as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Argento's presence and inchoate quality as an actress
occasionally move the picture from caricature into something more
three-dimensional. With her dazed eyes and strong shoulders, she
has the look of a model who turns a stroll down a fashion runway
into a march along a criminal court's perp walk. She's an arresting
combination of fear and arrogance, and her story almost functions
as an addled version of ``Candide'' without Dr. Pangloss to lend a
whiff of optimism. She seems to be trying to say something about
the emptiness of her life, and the onslaught of cliches of
meaningless sex and drugs leaves even her bored.
</P>
<P>
   Argento is still finding her way as a performer, trying on
American hip-hop dialect and then bouncing from French to Italian.
It's like she's going through exercises for an acting class. She's
not exactly in control of the material, and ``Diva'' lurches from
humid sex scenes to meaningful stares into space to slipshod
indictments of the American film industry, as evidenced by a scene
in which a loutish producer comes on to her like a pig digging
around for truffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Une Vraie Jeune Fille,'' the first film from the French
novelist-turned-director Catherine Breillat, about a young woman's
discovery of herself as a sexual being, made its North American
debut at this year's festival. The ``Jeune Fille'' screenings
provoked interest because of ``Romance,'' Breillat's mournful
treatise on sexual encounters, which was released last year and
stirred a sensation of its own because of its explicit sex.
Although her directing technique in ``Jeune Fille'' (1976) was
primitive and attenuated, there was an aura of heartache which
added a depth of feeling missing in her more recent work.
</P>
<P>
   The American director Kathryn Bigelow showed up at Toronto with
her newest work, a film adaptation of Anita Shreve's ``Weight of
Water'' that stars Catherine McCormack and Sarah Polley. The gothic
and allusive ``Water'' has parallel stories that shift back and
forth in time over the course of 100 years: the events surrounding
the past murders of the sister and sister-in-law of a young woman
(Polley) are being investigated by a modern-day writer (McCormack),
as contemporary and period sexual politics come into play. In
discussing her film, Bigelow posed a question that could serve as
the theme for all of these women's works: ``If a woman is pushed to
the edge, how would she behave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to put it in gender specific terms, but women
internalize,'' said Bigelow, whose previous films include ``Near
Dark'' and ``Blue Steel.'' Her movies trade on the frighteningly
close relationship between intimacy and violence, and her films
illustrate how quickly one can cross the line into the other.
``Filmmaking is an opportunity to externalize,'' she continued. ``I
started as a painter, an Abstract Expressionist, dealing with the
visceral. Painting can be a fairly elitist medium, and film is
accessible to all, it cuts across all cultural and social lines.
What you can do in movies _ what I did in `Weight of Water' _ is
have the characters commit heinous acts, and you can feel sympathy
for them, sympathy for marginal acts.''

NVEST INVESTORS OK PURCHASE OF CDC ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nvest LP's investors voted Tuesday to approve the purchase of
the Boston-based investment firm by CDC Asset Management of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.2 billion deal must still go before the shareholders of
Nvest's mutual fund families, other investment clients and
regulators. The company said it expects the deal to be completed in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a national labor group is opposing the deal and
launching a proxy fight against Nvest.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C.-based Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union has set up a Web site and drafted a
letter to fund shareholders, urging them to vote against the buyout
unless Nvest lowers its fund fees and improves investment
performance in certain funds.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which has 300,000 members, is not a client of Nvest.
The group's pension menu included an Nvest fund, Capital Growth,
until 1998, when it was dropped ``for poor performance,'' according
to union research analyst Andy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Nvest spokesman Larry Dwyer said the company had not received a
request from the union for a shareholder list _ a necessary step in
the process of soliciting shareholder votes. In addition, Dwyer
said, the union has not approached the company for a meeting to
discuss its complaints.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first time the restaurant and hotel union has
taken action against a mutual fund group, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do track firms like Nvest around the country,'' he said.
``This is a company that we're particularly concerned about because
they manage a lot of union funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Nvest owns 18 fund groups and investment advisers, including
Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., Kobrick Funds, and Harris Associates, which
manages the Oakmark funds. In total, Nvest's firms manage $130
billion. CDC oversees $170 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives did not attend the investor meeting
Tuesday. Yet Lee, the analyst, said the buyout is an opportune time
for fund investors to take a stand, arguing, ``The acquisition does
not provide significant benefits to shareholders, or address
serious problems including high fees and poor performance.'' The
group's Web site, www.nvestwatch.com, went live Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The question came by way of an e-mail message to
Oprah, the queen of confessional television, and Gov. George W.
Bush took it head on: what's the public's biggest misconception of
him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on my Daddy's name,'' he answered instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' she prodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if my name was George Jones I'd be a country and
western singer,'' said Bush. ``I've lived with this all my life. Of
course, I love my dad a lot. He's a fabulous man and I'm proud to
be his son.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour on Tuesday, Bush took his turn in Oprah Winfrey's
chair, just a week after Al Gore did, trying to woo her 7 million
daily viewers, most of them women. He gave her a kiss, which Gore
did not. He resisted some of her efforts to force him into
introspection and joked at others. He talked of God and why he
stopped drinking. And his eyes welled up as he spoke of his wife
and the birth of his twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us about a time when you needed forgiveness?'' Winfrey
asked. ``Right now,'' Bush deflected, then added, ``When my heart
turns dark. When I am jealous. Or when I'm spiteful.'' But Oprah
wanted more. ``I'm looking for specifics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are,'' Bush retorted, ``but I'm running for
president.'' The audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to find a way back into the lead in a tight race,
the Texas governor is no longer playing it safe and scripted the
way he did all spring and into the summer. Now, Bush is taking
questions everywhere. Right after he taped Winfrey's show, he
answered the queries of school children at the Beethoven elementary
school in Chicago's South Side, where he promoted his ideas for
bolstering school safety by shielding teachers from lawsuits
resulting from their disciplining of students.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is also seizing television opportunities. He sat for an
interview with Paula Zahn of Fox on Monday. Tuesday he sat not just
for Winfrey but also for Diane Sawyer of ``Good Morning, America.``
On Thursday he will be on ``Regis.'' And the Bush campaign tried to
work out an appearance with David Letterman this week, during
Bush's brief visit to New York City but found out that Letterman
was not taping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bush campaign seemed to get what it wanted from
Winfrey's show. Aides said they were delighted that Bush had the
chance to speak to voters for an hour, ``unfiltered'' by the news
media. Viewers, said Karen Hughes, his chief press aide, ``got to
see the Gov. Bush I know and work with every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, though, tried its best to keep Bush off
balance. Seizing on Bush's comment to Winfrey that ``a leader is
someone who is not afraid to take positions'' it peppered reporters
covering Bush with an instant news release taking issue with a
number of Bush's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey made no secret that she was trying to break through the
``wall'' of sound bites that she said was usually put up by
politicians. So her interview mostly dealt with his biography, not
policy.
</P>
<P>
   She pressed Bush on his father, asking whether he was running to
restore his family's name and legacy. When Bush said he was not,
she wondered whether ``not even in the teeniest tiniest part'' of
himself he was seeking to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the teeniest, tiniest part,'' Bush insisted.
``Basically, what you're saying is, `Are you running to get
revenge?' Revenge is such a negative thought. I'm running for
positive reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked him to talk about his decision to give up drinking at
the age of 40. ``Alcohol was beginning to compete for my
affections,'' Bush said, ``compete for my affections for my wife
and my family. It was beginning to crowd out my energy and I
decided to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked if his wife, Laura, had ever given him an
ultimatum. ``I don't think it was quite that,'' Bush said, but he
acknowledged ``she got disappointed some evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't drinking all the time,'' he said, ``But there were
some times when she said, `You need to think about what you're
doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For one moment a heckler tried to shout out a question from the
audience and Winfrey cut him off and moved directly to a commercial
break. She said it was the first heckler in her 15 years of doing
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Winfrey asked Bush to describe a time when he was
overwhelmed with doubt. He recalled going to preparatory school in
the East after a childhood in Texas and in the process seemed to
respond to critics who question whether he is intellectual enough
to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking how brilliant all the other kids were,''
Bush said. ``Eventually, I realized smarts are not only whether or
not you can write well or whether or not you can do calculus, but
smarts also is instinct and judgment and competence.'' He said,
``I've got a lot of experience, I'm well educated. But I'm
certainly not the kind of person who talks down to people because
of my education.''

   &UR; THE GENEROSITY OF MORRIS ENGELBERG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris Engelberg &LR; , who represents the estate of  &UR; Joe DiMaggio &LR; 
and has been so particular about ways to honor DiMag in San
Francisco, has donated $150,000 worth of DiMaggio memorabilia to a
Catholic high school in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's connection with Xaverian High, the school's  &UR; Sal &LR; 
 &UR; Ferrera &LR;  told Personals, is that  &UR; Rock Positano &LR; , the Yankee
Clipper's foot doctor, was an alumnus. Positano was ``the only
doctor that gave him relief'' from heel spurs that ended the
baseball star's career, said Ferrera. One other connection: The
school's sports teams are the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 items donated, all of which will be auctioned after
a period of display at Xaverian: an autographed oil portrait of
DiMaggio, a photograph of him with other Italian American athletes,
pictures of the DiMaggio family, a jersey signed by him and various
other photographs, some of them particularly rare, said Ferrera,
because they are signed with the middle initial ``P.''
</P>
<P>
   Most precious of all are photos signed ``best wishes,'' a phrase
DiMaggio rarely used, said Ferrera, who met the slugger at a
banquet for the school in 1996. ``The reason was that if he didn't
know you, he wouldn't want to wish you the best.''

   &UR; Gore Vidal &LR; , who is related to  &UR; Al Gore &LR; , provides readers of

Bush dynasty:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family, starting with  &UR; Senator Prescott Bush &LR; , father
to  &UR; George I &LR; , has always been a middling sort of family,
undistinguished intellectually and largely ineffective politically.
 &UR; Nixon &LR;  the Wise told  &UR; Murray Kempton &LR;  after Bush became president,
`There's really nothing there. He's the sort of person you
appointed to things.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the dark, wise old face gleamed satanically. `Now that
Barbara, she's something else. She's really vindictive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Broadway opening of Vidal's play ``The Best
Man,'' he talked with Fox411 about his own voting record.  &UR; Susan &LR; 
 &UR; Sarandon &LR;  and  &UR; Tim Robbins &LR;  ``have been trying to get me to vote
for  &UR; Ralph Nader &LR; ,'' he said. ``I'm all for being green. But I
haven't voted in a presidential election since 1964, when I voted
for  &UR; Lyndon Johnson &LR; , the peace president.''

   - The latest doll in the American Girls Collection of historic
dolls is Kit. The doll and related accessories reflect her time,
which is 1934, says the catalog. ``The news in the early 1930s is
full of sad stories about Americans losing their jobs, their homes,
their money. Kit Kittredge never thought it would happen to her
family. Before long, though, Kit's family does fall on hard times,
and all of a sudden, the Great Depression is her story, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the accessories in Kit's Sweet Dreams collection: beach
pajamas and slippers, daybed, nighttime necessities, tufted bedding
set and night table. The price for the collection is $130.

CENSUS RESPONSE RATE IS BETTER THAN FORECAST, ENDING TREND OF
DECLINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A higher proportion of households completed and
returned census forms this year than in 1990, reversing what had
been a three-decade long trend, census officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said that 67 percent of households that received a form in
the mail filled it out and sent it back, compared with the 65
percent that returned the forms 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results delighted Census Bureau officials and surprised
outsiders who had predicted this year would continue a trend of
declines in the percentage of households completing and returning
census forms. In 1970, the first year officials conducted the
initial part of the census by mail, 83 percent of households
returned the questionnaires. In 1980, 75 percent of households sent
them back, before the response rate hit 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures for 2000 released in May showed that 66
percent of households were being returned. And prior to the start
of th census program this year, bureau officials had predicted that
61 percent of households would return their forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade-long trend line in social behavior is hard to change,
hard to reverse,'' said Kenneth W. Prewitt, director of the census.
``Trend lines are stubborn things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students of American society noted that the Census Bureau
achievement was all the more remarkable because it comes at a time
of declining participation in community activities, like voting,
church attendance and philanthropic giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against that background, to have successfully produced a two
percentage point increase in mail-back response rates is actually
stunning,'' said Robert Putnam, a political science professor at
Harvard University who wrote ``Bowling Alone: The Collapse and
Revival of American Community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm genuinely surprised,'' he added. ``I tended to be a
skeptic. I told Ken Prewitt he would never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau figures indicate that 29 states raised their
mail-back response rates from what they were in 1990, with five
states _ California, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Nevada and
Wyoming _ lifting those rates by 5 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Prewitt, the improved response rate came in spite
of a fall-off in the number of households that completed the
long-form questionnaire. This year, the gap between those household
returning the long form and those returning the short form was 11
percentage points, double than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, had
suggested that people might consider not returning the long form
because its questions were too intrusive. But census officials
could not say how much, if at all, those comments contributed to a
decline in response on the long form.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the bureau's preliminary analysis suggests that
the higher response rates can be attributed to improved performance
among Hispanic households. Many of those cities that showed the
greatest improvement over 1990 _ Hialeah, Fla.; El Paso; and Santa
Ana, Anaheim and San Diego, Calif. _ have large and growing
Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   Response rates in white communities showed much less improvement
over 1990, and in some cases produced declines. Several states,
including Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri and Tennessee,
did not improve at all over 10 years ago. And response rates
declined in Minnesota, Kansas, Washington, Wisconsin, Idaho,
Vermont and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Among those counties that produced the most significant
improvements was New York County _ Manhattan _ which raised its
response rate to 60 percent, up from 52 percent in 1990. It was the
third-best improvement among the nation's 100 most populous
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials calculate the mail-back response rate by
dividing the number of households that return the questionnaire by
those households that were sent one, even those houses and
apartments that officials later discover to be vacant. The
proportion of households that return the form, therefore, may
actually be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Though gleeful about the public's cooperation, census officials
warned that the relatively high response rate did not mean the
census would be able to avoid the problems it had in 1990 when 8
million people were missed, and another 4 million were counted
twice. Indeed, nearly 70 percent of people missed by the census in
1970 were in households that had returned the questionnaire, but
filled it out incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials hope to factor in those who are missed in this
census by conducting a separate survey of 330,000 households and
use the results to adjust the final population counts. Republicans
have fought against _ and Democrats have strongly supported _ using
this sampling technique because of the widely held belief among
political strategists that it will raise the numbers of minorities
living in traditionally Democratic areas, and thus give Democrats
an advantage when boundaries for congressional districts are
redrawn.

 &HT;    Bush appears emotional, relaxed on `Oprah'
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, not a
guy who usually does his soul searching in public, did plenty of it
Tuesday under the insistent, at times needling, guidance of
America's talk show diva, Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance came one week after Democratic rival Al Gore
appeared on the show, and Winfrey told viewers Monday that she
believed many people would make their voting decision after
watching her show.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at first reluctant, seemed to warm to the experience. His
campaign is clearly mindful of Winfrey's clout and of the
opportunity her show gave Bush to show off his easy personality and
impish sense of humor. An estimated 7 million people _ most of them
women _ tune in to ``Oprah'' each day.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging and at times emotional conversation, Bush and
Winfrey talked about the tightening presidential race _ ``It's
tight enough to give me white hair,'' Bush joked. He also discussed
his decision to quit drinking, his love for his wife and daughters,
his religious faith and the legacy of being a president's son.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a viewer what the biggest misconception about him is,
Bush said: ``Probably (that) I'm running on my daddy's name. ...
He's a fabulous man and I'm proud to be his son. He gave me the
great gift of unconditional love, which is a fabulous gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush said he understands why his twin daughters, Jenna
and Barbara, 18, have opted not to make many public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sensitive girls, and I can understand why,'' Bush
said. ``I've been the son of a president and a presidential
candidate, and it's not a pleasant experience. It's much easier to
be the candidate than it is the son.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he never dreamed about running for president as a boy
and didn't think about it when he was a college student at Yale
University. He said he is not motivated by revenge against
President Clinton for winning the White House from his father in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life would be so much simpler to be in Texas with my wife and
not putting our children through the meat grinder of public
opinion,'' he said. ``So, yeah, there's a big call. And I'm deeply
concerned about the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush teared up when he told her about the safe birth of his
daughters. He and his wife, Laura, were preparing to adopt when she
became pregnant. Later, after Laura Bush became ill during the
pregnancy, she told her husband: ``These babies are going to be
born healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thinks he's smart enough to be president, Bush
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not the kind of person that talks down to people
because of my education,'' he said. ``I don't think that's what a
leader does. I think a leader needs to inspire and unite, and you
can't inspire and unite by thinking you're smarter than everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview wasn't entirely without glitches. Early on,
Winfrey had an audience member, who twice shouted an angry question
at Bush, removed from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bush was relaxed and eager to show that he can roll
with the punches. When Winfrey asked whether he cares what people
think of him, Bush said, ``Oh, I care what 51 percent of the people
think about me.''

 &HT;    CUBAN PLANE, SAID TO BE HIJACKED, CRASHES IN OCEAN
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ A small plane that may have been hijacked in
Cuba crash-landed in the open ocean Tuesday, killing one man and
leaving nine others clinging to the wreckage until they were
rescued by a passing ship.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials reported the small crop-duster was hijacked,
although according to media reports in South Florida, the pilot of
the plane may have picked up his family in an attempt to flee Cuba
and reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are discrepancies in what we're hearing, but the pilot
may have told the Cuban air tower that he was being hijacked as a
cover story for what was a bid to reach the U.S.,'' said Mary
Murray, an NBC News producer contacted in Havana by Miami
television station NBC-6.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the nine survivors _ one seriously injured _
would be picked up by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, while the injured
man would be airlifted to Key West and then possibly to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the males is reported to have critical head and neck
injuries,'' said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who briefed reporters
in Miami. The other survivors included two men, three women and
three children, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the survivors told their rescuers they were the only
people aboard the plane, contradicting earlier reports that as many
as 18 people might have been on board.
</P>
<P>
   The incident seems likely to further strain relations between
the governments of Cuba and the United States, which have exchanged
heated rhetoric in recent weeks over the long-festering problem of
Cuban immigration to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine there will be a lot of questions about what
should be done with the survivors,'' President Clinton told
reporters when asked about the incident. ``I think the most
important thing now is just to worry about their care. To me,
that's the overwhelming question.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities contacted air traffic controllers in Miami
shortly before 9 a.m. (ET) to report the Russian-built Antonov AN-2
plane had been hijacked after taking off from Herradura Airport in
western Cuba near the town of Pinar del Rio(cq) in the heart of
Cuba's tobacco-growing region. A Cuban aviation official told
reporters the plane was a crop-duster, although Antonov AN-2s are
also used to carry passengers in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. controllers never made contact with the plane by radio, but
watched as it disappeared from their radar shortly before 11 a.m.,
Federal Aviation Administration officials told reporters. It was
unclear whether the plane ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard jets, scrambled to search for the downed plane,
initially scoured an area about 90 miles southwest of Key West. The
plane's wreckage was found, however, about 200 miles further away
in the Yucatan Channel, about 60 miles from the western-most tip of
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Chios Dream(cq), a Panamanian freighter bound for New
Orleans, spotted the wreckage and picked up the survivors,
including the corpse of the dead man, Coast Guard officials said.
It was unclear how long the survivors were in the water before the
freighter arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard cutter Nantucket was dispatched from Key West to
rendezvous with the merchant ship Tuesday night, while a Coast
Guard helicopter was to fly from Key West to pick up the injured
man, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the other survivors would remain on the Nantucket,
but it was unclear whether they would be brought to Key West or
taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Miami television station NBC-6 also reported that a cruise ship
in the area with a doctor on board might rendezvous with the
Panamanian freighter so that the doctor could examine the injured
man.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is not the first time Cubans have attempted to flee
their communist island in stolen or hijacked airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   A similar plane was stolen by its pilot and four other Cubans in
1991, but landed safely at Miami International Airport. In 1996,
three Cubans hijacked another plane and forced the pilot to head
for the U.S., only to crash-land in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The men were rescued by a Russian freighter and eventually stood
trial in Tampa for hijacking, but were acquitted. The Cuban
government denounced the acquittal, saying it would encourage more
hijackings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, all Cubans who reached the
U.S. were granted automatic asylum. Several waves of uncontrolled
immigration in the 1980s and 1990s, however, prompted the two
governments to reach a new set of agreements in an attempt to
discourage the dangerous attempts to flee Cuba, most of which take
place on boats or rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreements, 20,000 Cubans are permitted to
immigrate to the U.S. each year. Those picked up at sea are taken
back to Cuba, but those who set foot on U.S. soil are allowed to
apply for asylum.

   Big 12 schools prefer to feast on cupcakes, creampuffs
</P>
<P>
   By NEIL HOHLFELD
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Another series of slaughters concludes Saturday when Big 12
teams finish the non-conference portion of their schedules. The
76-0 and 51-3 routs will give way to more evenly matched games.
</P>
<P>
   Bye bye, Bobcats. Adieu, Ragin' Cajuns. Move over, Miners.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the road, Hawkeyes. Fly away, Eagles and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 teams are 23-9 in non-conference games with six more to
be played Saturday. They have beaten up on the likes of Southwest
Texas State, Louisiana-Lafayette, Texas-El Paso, Iowa, North Texas
and Ball State by a combined score of 361-76 in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the surface, however, and another picture emerges.
Despite a schedule filled with creampuffs and cupcakes, this has
not been a sweet September for the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   In five games played by the Big 12 against teams ranked in the
Top 25 when the game was played, the conference's record is 1-4.
The only victory was by No. 1 Nebraska, which escaped with a 27-24
overtime win at then-No. 23 Notre Dame on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado and Missouri each has been beaten twice by teams in the
Top 25. The Buffaloes lost 17-14 to both Southern Cal (No. 11 at
the time) and Washington (No. 9.) Missouri was pummeled 62-9 by
Clemson (No. 17) and edged 13-10 by Michigan State (No. 22).
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State gets the conference's last chance Saturday for
redemption against a ranked team, hosting No. 22 Southern
Mississippi. But Cowboys coach Bob Simmons doesn't feel his team
has the honor of the conference riding on its shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking win for our own university,'' Simmons said.
``This has to do with Oklahoma State first. Does it bring status to
the Big 12? Sure. But we can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, however, is more than a little concerned after going
0-3 and losing the games by a combined 10 points. Compare that to
Kansas State, which is 3-0 and has outscored Iowa, Louisiana Tech
and Ball State by a combined 157-17.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a tough non-conference schedule, Colorado is going
against the grain. Many teams have followed the Kansas State model
of bringing in bottom-of-the-barrel teams for home games and
sending them away with big paychecks and a shellacking.
</P>
<P>
   Who's better off? No question. Kansas State remains in the
running for the national championship, while Colorado will have a
difficult time winning six games and qualifying for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Frank Solich, who usually sticks to his own
knitting, said he thinks Colorado's ambitious non-conference
schedule is not in the best interest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a schedule that is not necessary,'' Solich said. ``Every
team would like to have its best chance at winning their conference
and playing in a national championship game. It's obvious to me
anymore that you don't have to have an extremely tough schedule in
order to get in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to go undefeated, and to have a schedule
that's loaded on the front like Colorado's is doesn't give you your
best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Gary Barnett, who was not at the school when the
schedule was made up, said his big problem is not the tough
non-conference games. His gripe is having to start the Big 12
season with games against Kansas State, Texas A&AMP;M and Texas. There
is not a breather in sight until Oct. 21, when the Buffs play at
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the league tells me I'm going to play Kansas State, Texas
A&AMP;M and Texas (to start the Big 12,) then I'm going to change my
(non-conference) schedule,'' Barnett said. ``That's crazy. The way
the league is now, they're discouraging you from playing a good
non-conference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make a decision, in my opinion, how they want us
to go. If they want us to play teams we all can beat up and mop up
on in the preseason and not have any great television games, OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the model for a non-conference schedule consisted
of at least one difficult game against a ranked team and two games
against lesser opponents, enabling coaching staffs to get an idea
about their depth while giving the players the taste of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M had such a schedule this year, traveling to Notre Dame
to open the season before playing Wyoming and Texas-El Paso at
home. To give an idea how watered down the Big 12's non-conference
schedules have become, the Aggies probably had the third- or
fourth-toughest slate this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked having a good opponent to open the season,''
Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said. ``It gives you focus and speeds up
your preparation when you have to get ready to play a tough game.
It helps you down the road when the players have been in that kind
of game.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Aggies likely would be in the Top 25 had they
played a weak sister and not lost 24-10 at Notre Dame. They were
ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press preseason poll, but they
dropped out after the loss to the Irish and haven't surfaced again
despite outscoring Wyoming and UTEP 96-20.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett agrees that Colorado's three non-conference games this
season might be counterproductive. Because strength of schedule is
not considered by bowl committees, teams that don't take chances
early have a better chance to qualify for bigger payoffs in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless more things are taken into consideration for strength
of schedule in the BCS (Bowl Championship Series), then that's
probably smart,'' Barnett said of scheduling weaker opponents.
``You look at the teams that will be in it, and their schedule
probably will have reflected that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you want to test your team. Obviously, if you
could set it up, you'd have an easy one first, a not-so-hard one
the second time and the third one would be your hard one. But you
can't always do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, however, has thrived by scheduling nothing but
sure wins. The Wildcats have taken criticism for their creampuff
schedule over the last decade, but they continue to rack up early
victories against opponents that have no business being on the same
field.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Bill Snyder seemed put out after Kansas State
demolished Ball State 76-0 last week, scoring touchdowns on its
first 10 drives and adding an Aaron Lockett punt return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much over before it began,'' Snyder said. ``One of
the upsides is that we made great strides in identifying our depth.
Our second and third team got an awful lot of time, and that's
important for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is that we didn't get much time to work our
passing game, either on offense or defense. Our No. 1 quarterback
(Jonathan Beasley) threw the ball six times in the first quarter,
and our No. 2 quarterback (Ell Roberson) threw six times in the
second quarter. We needed more work in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri coach Larry Smith gladly would have been in that
position Saturday. After being trounced by Clemson Sept. 9, the
Tigers put up a good fight at home against Michigan State before
losing by three points. Smith indicated he thought the
non-conference portion of Missouri's schedule was too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have 11 chances to win games in the regular season,
and I think it's important in non-conference to come out with two
or three wins,'' Smith said. ``Winning begets wining. I don't care
who you play when you win, you still get that win. When it comes
down to the tough part of your schedule later on, if you've won
some games, you've got that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, strength of schedule can hold back a team's prestige.
Texas Tech is the lone Division I-A team at 4-0, but the Red
Raiders might as well have played four scrimmages for all the
attention they have received. In the latest AP poll, the Raiders
were deep among the ``also receiving votes'' teams, getting
mentioned on only 10 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech has beaten New Mexico, Utah State, North Texas and
Louisiana-Lafayette, teams with a combined record of 2-10. In
addition, the Red Raiders have not made a seamless transition to
new coach Mike Leach's offense. So they will face Texas A&AMP;M in the
Big 12 opener Sept. 30 with questions about just how good they
really are.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State knows the euphoria of non-conference can quickly end
once Big 12 play starts. The Cyclones are 3-0 with victories over
Ohio, Nevada-Las Vegas and Iowa. A year ago, they beat Indiana
State, UNLV and Iowa in non-conference play and proceeded to go 1-7
in the Big 12, beating only Missouri 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the challenge with this team,'' Iowa State
coach Dan McCarney said. ``This is where we were last year, and we
didn't carry it over in the Big 12. We've been there before, but I
feel like we're better than last year's 3-0 team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Big 12 teams aren't rushing to schedule
tougher non-conference games in upcoming seasons. There has been a
mild switch in philosophy at Kansas State, of all places. The
Wildcats begin a home-and-home series against Southern Cal in 2001.
However, the likes of Idaho, New Mexico State, Utah State and
Arkansas State remain on future K-State schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M will continue to play at least one non-conference game
against a big-time team. The Aggies have a home game against Notre
Dame in 2001 and play Virginia Tech in a home-and-home series
starting in 2002. Texas starts a home-and-home series against
Arkansas in 2003 and plays Ohio State in 2005-06.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has an easier time next year when it plays Colorado
State, San Jose State and Washington State, but the Buffs have
Southern Cal and UCLA on the 2002 schedule and travel to Florida
State in 2003.

INTERPUBLIC REALIGNMENT TO FORM GIANT PR HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Interpublic Group of Cos., the $4.5 billion New York
communications giant that owns many ad agencies including Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston, is realigning part of its
portfolio of public-relations shops to form what it's billing as
the world's largest PR firm.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to more efficiently serve clients with global
needs, the company plans to consolidate complementary offices and
practices of Weber Public Relations Worldwide of Cambridge, Mass.,
Shandwick International of New York and Golin/Harris International
of Chicago, effective Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for pieces of Weber and Shandwick to be merged to
create Weber Shandwick Worldwide of New York.
</P>
<P>
   With annual revenues of nearly $300 million, the firm will have
a client list that includes General Motors, Microsoft Corp.,
Eastman Kodak Co., Monster.com and Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest PR firm in the world,'' said Larry
Weber, who will become chief executive of Weber Shandwick a few
years after he sold his Cambridge firm to a unit of IPG.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts should lose no jobs because of the realignment,
said a spokeswoman for Weber Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Golin/Harris, a firm that now does most of its
business in the United States, will add offices in Europe and Asia
as a result of the realignment, IPG said. Golin/Harris has annual
revenues of about $114 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 100 days, IPG will study how office space can be
combined and teams merged from the various firms, Weber said. No
layoffs are expected at firms that collectively employ 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, communications giants such as IPG and
archrival Omnicom Group have been on buying sprees, using their
stock shares to finance acquisitions of numerous ad agencies, PR
firms and database companies.
</P>
<P>
   These firms have sometimes been kept separate to avoid issues of
conflict of interest. Now IPG seems to be taking another step
toward integrating its resources.
</P>
<P>
   In May, IPG folded its PR firms into an umbrella group called
Allied Communications Group and put Weber in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Weber has decided these PR firms can be more
efficient at helping global clients adapt to the new economy if
they are realigned into two PR brands, instead of three.

GORE SPLITS TIME BETWEEN MONEY, MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Al Gore is showing both sides of the modern
politician this week: man of the people by day, man of the
pocketbook by night.
</P>
<P>
   At a small community center in the San Fernando Valley Tuesday,
Gore pitched more details of his plan to make affordable medical
care available to every American. Once again he went tieless, just
like a regular Joe. He made it clear that this was his kind of
crowd _ middle-class Americans worried about the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, his motorcade headed out to make supposedly
spontaneous stops at local eateries, giving Gore more mingling time
with genuine folks. Then the sun set and the stars came out again.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's stars were of the Silicon Valley sort: high-tech
entrepreneurs attending a $10,000-a-couple fundraiser. Monday
night's were star stars, Hollywood heavyhitters such as Tom Hanks,
Dustin Hoffman and Garry Shandling, as well as top directors and
entertainment executives whose names are less well-known to the
public. The take: $4.2 million, with the 300 attendees paying
$10,000 apiece for a dinner catered by Wolfgang Puck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the contrasting imagery of populist afternoons and
pricey evenings is common to presidential campaigns, and to both
parties. But with relatively few scheduled events during his
three-day Western swing, Gore's hobnobbing with the entertainment
and Internet elite underscores the disparity between the people
candidates speak to and those with whom they sit down to eat.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for instance, the Democratic nominee addressed a
rally at a Las Vegas college campus, collected the endorsement of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and then flew to Los
Angeles for a far more exclusive event at the home of billionaire
Ron Burkle, a supermarket tycoon. The college gymnasium was small
and stifling, and Gore wore short sleeves. Burkle's mansion was, to
say the least, spacious, with its own carousel and a dog house
large enough for a human to occupy. Gore, joined by running mate Al
Lieberman, donned a suit and tie before making his entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Other contrasts abounded. At the University of Nevada rally in
Las Vegas, 70s rock and roll played over the speaker system. At
that night's fundraiser, 70s rock and rollers Don Henley of the
Eagles played live. Elton John, who also hit the music charts in
the 70s, was scheduled to entertain donors Tuesday night at the
Silicon Valley home of Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of
computer network giant Novell. A Gore spokesman said the singer
would even take a request or two.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Bush campaign has blasted Gore for
accepting money from the same industry he and his running mate have
critized in recent days for marketing sex and violence to
teenagers. In turn, in a week when it is emphasizing fair and
affordable health care, the Gore campaign continued to berate Bush
for being the tool of special interests such as HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue about who our supporters are or who our
supporters aren't,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``The issue
is who is going to stand up for American children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane stressed that Gore and Lieberman's tough stance on what
Hollywood pitches and to whom proves that their policy positions
are not for sale. Still, at Burkle's house, Lieberman seemed to
take away some of the sting, promising ``we will nudge you, but we
will never become censors.'' Gore, who mostly stuck to the
highlights of his basic stump speech, said he knew the actors and
producers and directors will ``be standing with us on the fights
that determine the kind of country we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he was at the New Horizons Workshop, which trains
and finds jobs for developmentally disabled adults in suburban
North Hills. The non-paying crowd was a third smaller than Monday's
paying one. Gore wore a brown suitcoat but no tie. No food was
served. No jokes were told by famous comedians. It was like another
country, if not another world.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at New Horizons was somber. As he prepared to field
questions, microphone in hand like a daytime TV talk show host,
Gore said, ``That is why I am running for president: to fight for
you, to fight for your family.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions, the personal horror stories from doctors and
patients who learned their medical records had been improperly
released -- and Gore's appropriately sympathetic responses -- went
on for almost an hour. And Gore sounded like he could go on longer.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the event was to announce a new plan to protect
medical privacy, one that would in part make it illegal to disclose
patient records without permission and hold HMOs or insurers liable
for unlawful disclosure. He also endorsed a bill that would prevent
genetic information from being used deny health and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make sure you medical records are always safe and
secure,'' Gore said. ``You ought to have control of your medical
records.''

 &HT;    CARE pulls foreign staff from trouble in Guinea
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARE, the Atlanta-based relief and development agency, said
Tuesday that it has evacuated its international staff members from
southern Guinea after an attack in the area killed an unknown
number of people, including a United Nations employee.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's four international staffers were evacuated overland to
Conakry, the capital of the west African nation _ a 12-hour drive _
in a convoy along with international employees of other
nongovernmental agencies in the area, Nick Webber, CARE director
for Guinea and Sierra Leone, said in a telephone conversation from
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all out. They're all well. They're all safe,'' Webber
said. But he said some of CARE's Guinean staff members feared they
had lost family members in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Guinean staff members are keeping the CARE office
open in Gueckedou, the southern city from which the agency runs a
large relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gueckedou region, CARE has been distributing food to more
than 200,000 Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Guinea hosts more than 460,000 refugees, one of the
largest refugee populations in Africa. About 330,000 are from
Sierra Leone and 126,000 from Liberia. The pullout of staff by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, CARE and other
nongovernmental organizations leaves those refugees temporarily in
the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, in a few days, we will be able to resume
operations,'' Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for Sunday's attack in Macenta, a town near
Gueckedou, is not known for certain, but Webber said there is no
reason to think humanitarian workers were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely nasty that humanitarian workers have been
caught up in a problem they are unrelated to,'' he said.

 &HT;    Fate of Atlanta gun suit up to high court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - When the Georgia Legislature passed a law in early
1999 barring Atlanta's lawsuit against gun manufacturers, the
industry expected a quick dismissal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, lawyers on all sides of the issue asked the
Georgia Supreme Court to rule on who has the power to decide if a
jury will ever hear the case _ state lawmakers or a Fulton County
judge. The court must issue a ruling to resolve the separation of
powers dispute by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   If it rejects the industry's bid, the case will proceed toward
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court now has an invitation in writing to do what I'll
call the `Georgia Sidestep,''' senior state attorney Alfred Evans
Jr. told the court, describing the city's efforts to continue the
lawsuit. ``That invitation should be declined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the ability to govern,'' Evans said. ``(The
lawsuit) is nothing less than the city of Atlanta trying to usurp,
to seize, governmental power that is placed solely by the Georgia
Constitution in the General Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the courts traditionally have deferred to a trial judge's
discretion in deciding motions to dismiss a lawsuit in its early
stages. Fulton County State Court Judge Gino Brogdon last fall
ruled the lawsuit should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Judge Brogdon has ruled and exercised his
discretion,'' said Atlanta lawyer Willie Lovett, who argued on
behalf of Brogdon. ``He has done what he is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The city filed the lawsuit Feb. 4, 1999, against 14
manufacturers and three trade groups. It alleges that gun makers
did not use enough safety devices to keep ``unauthorized users,''
including children, from using them. The suit seeks unspecified
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, the Legislature passed a law allowing only the
state of Georgia to bring such litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon granted the industry a partial victory by throwing out
the city's product liability claims. But Brogdon kept alive the
city's negligence claims, which seek compensatory and punitive
damages for the cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The industry then sought a writ of mandamus _ which is a lawsuit
to force public officials to do what they are supposed to do _
against Brogdon and the city. It asked Fulton Superior Court Judge
Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore to require Brogdon to dismiss the case
and order top city officials to withdraw the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Moore declined, saying Brogdon was acting within his discretion
when he decided the case can continue.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's lawsuit is one of more than 30 filed by government
entities nationwide against the gun industry. So far, four have
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a judge in Chicago dismissed that city's $433 million
lawsuit. But the same day, a San Diego judge rejected an industry
motion to dismiss a group of lawsuits filed by 12 California cities
and counties, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the industry fears that the city's case will proceed
and pre-trial fact-finding _ called discovery _ will begin in
earnest, with industry executives required to testify, said Joshua
Horwitz, executive director of the Washington-based Educational
Fund To End Handgun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is trying to do everything they can to keep this
bottled up,'' he said. ``The gun industry has been able to
distribute its products with very little oversight, and they're
scared of it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong arguments Tuesday, a few of the Georgia
justices seemed intent on deferring to Brogdon's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice George Carley wondered aloud if the industry was ``using
mandamus in lieu of appeal.'' Carley also expressed concern about
what type of precedent the court might set if Brogdon is overruled.
</P>
<P>
   Will this put the court ``on a slippery slope for other cases?''
he asked. ``Do you see my concern?''
</P>
<P>
   But David Bailey, a lawyer representing the gun manufacturers,
said there will be ``few, if any,'' other cases where the General
Assembly barred lawsuits against a specific industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question of power,'' he told the justices. ``Despite
the act's clear and obvious intent and despite its clear and
unambiguous language, the suit continues....We're enduring the very
thing the Legislature has said we do not have to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Norman Fletcher picked up on that line of argument. He
asked city attorneys, ``If the General Assembly has the power to
abolish the city of Atlanta, why wouldn't it have the power to
abolish its right to pursue this litigation?''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Nicholas Moraitakis, hired by the city to head
the litigation, replied that while that was not the issue before
the court in this appeal, the law passed last year by the
Legislature is open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The industry lawyers) are here talking about the merits of
the case, but the issue before the court today is Judge Moore's
order,'' Moraitakis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to talk about that,'' he said, looking over to
the industry lawyers. ``That order is unassailable.''

TV NOTES: `GIDEON'S CROSSING'; `CONFESSIONS'; IMPEACHMENT;
`SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLD THE ADS, ABC DECIDES
</P>
<P>
   The world of network television is increasingly about creating
events, and ABC, with its plan for ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a medical
drama, has found a way to make one of its new shows stand out.
</P>
<P>
   As it announced last week, the network plans to present the
premiere of the show on Oct. 10 without commercial interruption.
Aside from a one-minute commercial at the start of the show and
another at the end, the show will run for 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sole sponsor will be Johnson &AMP; Johnson Co., which agreed to
the approach, said Andrea Alstrup, its vice president for
advertising, because it was so impressed with the quality of the
show and because the medical connection seemed, she said, ``such a
good fit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson plans to advertise separate pharmaceutical
products in its two commercials. ``Gideon's Crossing'' stars Andre
Braugher as a crusading doctor in a teaching hospital who takes on
what appear to be hopeless cases. Critics have identified it as one
of the most promising new dramas of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC clearly hopes that the premiere will help establish the
series as one of the hits of the new season. ``Making it an event
is the whole idea,'' said Alex Wallau, the president of ABC. It had
better be, because Wallau conceded that ABC was not making nearly
as much in advertising as it would with a normal roster of
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning a specific figure, Wallau said, ``This is
seven figures less than the normal price we'd get.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallau, who came up with the idea for the commercial-less
premiere, said that as far as ABC could determine it was a first
for a regular television series. Three years ago NBC broadcast the
film ``Schindler's List'' without commercial interruption after
Ford Motor Co. signed on as the sponsor that would bracket the film
with commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Wallau said that ABC's task was harder because the premiere had
already been assigned ``many million dollars of advertising.'' The
problem, he said, was not that ABC felt that interrupting certain
content would be in bad taste so much as that the network did not
want to cut that much of the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot came in at 65 minutes long,'' Wallau said. ``We felt
we'd be butchering the show to squeeze it down to less than 50
minutes to fit in the commercials.'' ABC could have tried to extend
the show to 90 minutes, but Wallau said that would have meant
cutting back another ABC show during premiere week, which the
network was loath to do.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Gideon's Crossing'' will run as though it were on HBO: no
breaks, not even for promotions of other ABC series.
</P>
<P>
   Alstrup has also been a leader of the Family Friendly
Programming Forum, which has urged the networks to offer more
family-oriented programming early in the evening. She said that by
backing ``Gideon's Crossing,'' she wanted to advocate ``quality
programming of every kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and Wallau said that the move could hardly be seen as a
precedent. ``It could only work for unique situations,'' Alstrup
said. ``I don't think it would be affordable on any other basis.''

   `CONFESSIONS' GONE
</P>
<P>
   The hotly debated Court TV series ``Confessions'' lasted all of
two episodes as the cable channel responded this week to outrage
over the use of taped confessions of murderers as entertainment
programming by announcing that it was canceling the series. The
move came after many protest calls, including some from the
families of victims of those featured in the confessions.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings were no better or worse than those the show usually
receives, a Court TV spokeswoman, Betsy Vorce, said Tuesday. But
she said, ``The show offended a wide range of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions,'' which ran Sunday nights at 10, will be replaced
this week, but as of Tuesday there had been no decision on a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   2 ON THE IMPEACHMENT
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the announcement by HBO that it would present a
miniseries devoted to the impeachment of President Clinton, based
on Jeffrey Toobin's book ``A Vast Conspiracy,'' Columbia TriStar
Television has acquired the rights to the book ``The Breach,'' by
Peter Baker, a reporter for The Washington Post. The book is
published by Scribner.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is being excerpted this week in The Post, covers
the impeachment from inside the congressional process. Based on
current support for the NBC series ``The West Wing,'' Helen Verno,
the head of movies and miniseries for the Columbia television
studio, saw the opportunity to do an inside-Washington process
story.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia began offering the project to the networks as either a
film or miniseries starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO film, meanwhile, is to cover the impeachment story more
from the president's point of view as reflected in the Toobin book,
whose title is taken from Hillary Clinton's denunciation of the
effort to remove the president as a ``vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   `SURVIVOR' FALTERS
</P>
<P>
   CBS's decision to bring back ``Survivor'' as counterprogramming
to the Olympics has not had nearly the impact the network had hoped
for.
</P>
<P>
   Repeats of the series clearly do not carry the same degree of
fascination that the first run did _ or even a fraction thereof.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night the show drew the lowest rating on CBS for the
night, less than a 5 rating for the hour. (Each rating point
represents just over 1 million homes.) It finished last among shows
running from 9 to 10 p.m. The network had hoped that some of the
viewers who tuned in to see the later episodes might come back to
see the early ones they had missed. But that has not proved to be
the case.

SEPTEMBER IS CRUELEST MONTH FOR STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street legend would have everyone believe the stock market
is vulnerable once October rolls around. In truth, September is the
most dangerous month.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market during September has declined in more years
than it's been up, dating all the way back to 1897, said Harry
Laubscher, a market analyst for Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York.
Although the October crashes in 1929 and 1987 may be unforgettable,
the October market has risen more often than it's fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a historical standpoint, September hasn't been a very
good month,'' Laubscher said. He couldn't fully explain why, but
ventured that ``people have a summer rally in July and August and
then it's just profit-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   September 2000 has been particularly punishing for investors. A
variety of factors _ from seasonal profit-taking to a plunging euro
and soaring oil prices _ have taken their toll on stock values. But
a big culprit this month has been a resumption of the decline in
technology stocks, which pulled down the tech-saturated Nasdaq
Composite index, as well as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and, to
a lesser degree, the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they were helped when tech was soaring, all three major
indexes _ not just Nasdaq _ are vulnerable on the downside to tech.
</P>
<P>
   The country's biggest chip maker, Intel Corp. _ one of the 30
stocks in the Dow index _ lost 19.4 percent of its value between
Aug. 30 through Tuesday's close, at $68.63 a share. Another Dow
member, Microsoft Corp., has dropped 6.9 percent so far this month,
while JDS Uniphase Corp. is down 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq recovered Tuesday, regaining what it lost on Monday.
The Nasdaq closed at 3865.64, up 139.12 points. The S&AMP;P 500 added
15.39 points, closing at 1459.90. The Dow dipped by 19.23 points,
closing at 10,789.29. Despite a rebound in technology after a
nearly 3 percent decline on Monday, the indexes have lost
significant ground this month: The Dow and S&AMP;P have lost 3.8
percent and the Nasdaq has lost 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted more rockiness for the stock market in the
upcoming earnings season and possibly lasting through the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   What sets September 2000 apart is that it follows unprecedented
gains in technology stocks last winter. The March correction mainly
hit the tech industry, and Nasdaq has been volatile since then,
making little progress. But this month, tech stocks have fallen
further from their still-lofty heights due, analysts said, to
earnings reports that do not meet investors' impossible
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, shares of Oracle Corp. plunged 8 percent last
Friday after the software giant said its sales gains would slow.
This was hardly terrible news: the California company estimated
sales would still rise about 20 percent each quarter _ but short of
the 32 percent rise posted in its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle was particularly vulnerable due to a price-earnings ratio
that still hovers around 90 _ far above the norm. But it's not
alone, said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street
Global Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation level for some investors owning these
securities clearly is still set at the zenith of all conceivable
expectations,'' Riley said. ``If there's any glitch, big or small,
investors suddenly decide the company has major problems or they
react as if it has major problems. It was just as irrational on the
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, take Cisco Systems, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of
about 90 _ down from nearly 190 last spring. The stock has dropped
9.7 percent in September, and Riley said investors seem to be
``waiting for an accident to happen.'' Cisco, he added, ``is the
best in its field but even the best needs to take a rest and get
rejuvenated.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Abry, managing director in Boston for CIBC Oppenheimer &AMP;
Co., noted that ``second-tier'' stocks in Nasdaq are struggling
even more due to a drying up of capital for risky ventures, or
departures by executives seeking safety in big tech companies or
leaving the high-flying industry altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had expected we had seen the lows before,'' Abry said.
``But a lot of stocks that had hit lows before are now trading
lower than they were after the last decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an analysis of data from Bloomberg News on 123
Massachusetts tech companies tracked by The Boston Globe shows that
99 of them lost value in September. Many of those hardest hit this
month, declining by 20 percent to 40 percent, are in this second
tier, including Engage Inc., Kopin Corp. and Be Free Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As investors learned earlier this year, when tech stocks were
rising, the industry's influence extends far beyond Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   In the broad S&AMP;P 500 index, for example, high-tech and
telecommunications stocks account for 40 percent of the index's
aggregate value. Although the Dow is less tied to tech, it
nevertheless counts among its 30 stocks such dominant technology
companies as IBM Corp., Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corp. and Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, analysts say that investors may be entering a
rocky patch that will get rougher as companies report their
third-quarter earnings. Tucker Anthony's Laubscher believes that
the Nasdaq, which is 1300 points below its all-time high in March,
is still lumbering in a bear market. ``It's going to take awhile
for that recovery to occur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although technology, long-term, may pay big gains, analysts are
divided over whether to be optimistic or pessimistic about the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   John Forelli, senior vice president of Independence Investments,
a mutual fund company owned by John Hancock Financial Services,
said the swing out of tech reflects investor defensiveness. Much of
this year, as a result the market has risen on such conservative
industries as utilities, energy and financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years have been growth, growth, growth,''
Forelli said. He said he's pessimistic about tech in the near
future, because ``valuations too high. In that market it'll be hard
for the tech stocks to really be the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sowerby, portfolio manager and investment strategist at
the Detroit office of Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., is an optimist and views
the current technology market as a ``buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, he noted that while some tech stocks are
overpriced, many in the industry have returned to reasonable
levels, including Intel Corp., IBM Corp., and Apple Computer. The
technology stocks in the S&AMP;P500 had a price ratio on Tuesday of 48
_ far below their stratospheric levels early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As tough as September has been much of it is anxiety over
pending earnings news,'' Sowerby said. ``When that is done, and
companies report actual third quarter numbers in October, it'll be
another solid quarter.''

``Spider-Man'' founder Stan Lee. ``Star Trek's'' faithful know it
to be the ship commanded by Capt. Hikaru Sulu. Both Stan the Man

developing the latter's ``Starship'' idea into an Internet

 &HT;    Dark skies and dampened spirits
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storm clouds opened up suddenly over Manhattan at lunchtime
Tuesday, dousing many arriving at Bryant Park's big tent to see
Oscar de la Renta's womenswear ideas for spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Their muddy shoes and soggy clothes matched the increasingly
dampened spirit of many Fashion Week attendees who can't quite get
amped about what they're seeing on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta's show was emblematic of the sensuous charge
designers have tried to pump into their spring collections. Most of
his outfits were flirtatious and revealing, in a dignified sort of
way. His leathers glistened, his party dresses sparkled, and he
showed a rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's doubtful de la Renta's bread-and-butter clients _
the ladies who lunch _ will ever wear them, the omnipresent
microskirts were here as well; his knife-pleated ``tennis''
versions came in enticingly sheer silk pastels. He played a game of
peekaboo with thigh-high dresses and suits worn under knee-length
coats. He encased models in clingy sheaths made of
contrasting-colored strips of intarsia and Jacquard silks. And he
stripped ball gowns of some of their seriousness by poking them
with dots.
</P>
<P>
   People applauded overpolitely when New York's elder statesman of
design came out for his bows. But you could tell they weren't fully
amused.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tracy design chief Linda Allard staged a scaled-down
spring preview in her showroom Tuesday. Too bad. The moody
indifference wafting around the shows might have been lifted if
more than a few dozen select guests could have seen the
presentation. Showing just 45 outfits, Allard proved she can still
make sensible clothes for serious women without stripping them of
their sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest things she showed: simple, solid-shaded dresses
with armholes opened nearly to the waist; a minty-green blazer
layered deliciously over a chocolate brown halter top and caramel
knit pants; a halter top and skirt printed in tangerine-and-cream
leopard, and a reptile-print suit in a mix of chartreuse and
violet.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, said BCBG honcho Max Azria, he has the darling,
departed Audrey Hepburn in mind when he tackles a new collection.
But he kept thinking of the demure Catherine Deneuve as she
appeared in ``Indochine,'' he said, while creating his most
delicate and demonstrative clothes to date. His show Monday night
mainly offered up dainty and detailed dresses, sharply tailored
coats and featherweight tweed suits. Most memorable: the sheer silk
bucket caps models had coyly pulled down over their eyes.

 &HT;    Protect yourself by making sure your doctor's `permission slip'
for treatment gets to your insurance company.
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you don't have your permission slip, you're not going on the
field trip.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically the premise behind managed care's policy that
patients need to get referrals and precertifications before they
can go see specialists or have procedures done.
</P>
<P>
   And like a permission slip, if these papers aren't signed and
delivered in time, a patient might have to delay appointments by
hours, days or weeks. Or even worse, if a patient goes ahead with
visits or procedures, there's a good chance he'll be stuck with the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   So why does it sometimes seem so hard to get that one little
piece of paper? As more patients belong to managed care plans,
doctors' offices and hospitals are swamped with these requests, and
they're not getting the stuff filled out correctly in time _ if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they don't have the motivation that the hospitals and
insurers have. Hospitals need those precertifications to get paid
and insurers get fined by the insurance commissioner's office if
they do not deliver reimbursement in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   But in an increasing number of cases, doctors' lack of
follow-through results in frustrated patients stuck waiting for
rescheduled appointments, on the phone tracking down their
referring physician or arguing with the insurer about an
unexpected, unresolved _ or simply unreimbursed _ bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a major issue for us and for patients,'' said
Mike Mason, director of operations at Emory Clinic. ``We have about
800,000 patient visits annually, and about two-thirds of them
require some kind of precertification before the procedure can
occur. ''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is hardly unique to Emory, which is feeling the
crunch so badly it is planning to hire 50 to 75 more clerks to call
the doctors and the insurers to get the required paperwork for the
hospital to get reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hospitals are groaning under the weight of these
referrals and precertifications so much that the Georgia Hospital
Association met last week with the state's HMO Association to
eliminate some of this paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to ultimately help the consumer,'' said Cathy
Dougherty, director of Gwinnett Hospital System's revenue
management who also participated in the meeting. ``It's taken a
long time to get to the table, but we're sensing there's more of a
desire for everyone to put a focus on this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett Hospital has also had to add precertification clerks to
handle the increase in paperwork, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even insurers are realizing that the backlog of problems is
significant enough to change their procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna-US Healthcare, for example, plans to eliminate the need
for precertification for many procedures, a trend other insurers
are following nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers already place the burden of referrals and
precertifications squarely on doctors and hospitals. Blue Cross &AMP;
Blue Shield, for example, writes that responsibility into its
contracts with medical providers. But consumer advocates say that
in most cases, the ultimate responsibility for getting the
paperwork still rests with the patient.
</P>
<P>
   And that means that patients have to become more assertive in
making sure the necessary paperwork is done long before they step
through the doors of a specialist or a hospital. You can protect
yourself by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calling the insurer at least two days before the procedure or
visit and checking to see if the necessary paperwork has been
received. If it hasn't, follow up with the hospital and/or doctor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asking the referring doctor to fax a copy of the referral or
precertification to you when they fax or send it to the hospital or
specialist. Although hospitals and doctors say they don't think
this is necessary, insurers believe this is a good way to make sure
you have the paperwork to get your bills reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Searching for primary care physicians who are well-wired.
Although many physicians now have electronic claim submission, you
want one who can also do electronic referrals. Often, reimbursement
gets snagged because paper referrals arrive long after the
electronic submission has been sent out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asking your insurer, who, ultimately, is responsible for
getting referrals and precertifications. If it's the doctors, then
pressure them to do their paperwork. If it's you, keep detailed
records of all medical transactions _ it's no different from any
other financial matter.
</P>

 &HT;    Dark skies and dampened spirits
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storm clouds opened up suddenly over Manhattan at lunchtime
Tuesday, dousing many arriving at Bryant Park's big tent to see
Oscar de la Renta's womenswear ideas for spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Their muddy shoes and soggy clothes matched the increasingly
dampened spirit of many Fashion Week attendees who can't quite get
amped about what they're seeing on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta's show was emblematic of the sensuous charge
designers have tried to pump into their spring collections. Most of
his outfits were flirtatious and revealing, in a dignified sort of
way. His leathers glistened, his party dresses sparkled, and he
showed a rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's doubtful de la Renta's bread-and-butter clients _
the ladies who lunch _ will ever wear them, the omnipresent
microskirts were here as well; his knife-pleated ``tennis''
versions came in enticingly sheer silk pastels. He played a game of
peekaboo with thigh-high dresses and suits worn under knee-length
coats. He encased models in clingy sheaths made of
contrasting-colored strips of intarsia and Jacquard silks. And he
stripped ball gowns of some of their seriousness by poking them
with dots.
</P>
<P>
   People applauded overpolitely when New York's elder statesman of
design came out for his bows. But you could tell they weren't fully
amused.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tracy design chief Linda Allard staged a scaled-down
spring preview in her showroom Tuesday. Too bad. The moody
indifference wafting around the shows might have been lifted if
more than a few dozen select guests could have seen the
presentation. Showing just 45 outfits, Allard proved she can still
make sensible clothes for serious women without stripping them of
their sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest things she showed: simple, solid-shaded dresses
with armholes opened nearly to the waist; a minty-green blazer
layered deliciously over a chocolate brown halter top and caramel
knit pants; a halter top and skirt printed in tangerine-and-cream
leopard, and a reptile-print suit in a mix of chartreuse and
violet.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, said BCBG honcho Max Azria, he has the darling,
departed Audrey Hepburn in mind when he tackles a new collection.
But he kept thinking of the demure Catherine Deneuve as she
appeared in ``Indochine,'' he said, while creating his most
delicate and demonstrative clothes to date. His show Monday night
mainly offered up dainty and detailed dresses, sharply tailored
coats and featherweight tweed suits. Most memorable: the sheer silk
bucket caps models had coyly pulled down over their eyes.

GORE COURTS WOMEN VOTERS, BUT NOT ALL ARE SMITTEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps David Letterman put it best. After Vice
President Al Gore appeared on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' last week,
talking up his marriage and his family life to millions of female
viewers, Letterman joked: ``Al, you go, girl!''
</P>
<P>
   The wisecrack neatly caught a dynamic of the last few weeks of
the presidential campaign. While Gore trails Gov. George W. Bush
among male voters in most polls, he has a strong lead among women _
11 points in a New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   But not all women are signing on to the Gore campaign. While
most single women support Gore, Bush _ like Republican candidates
in other presidential elections _ leads among married women,
particularly those under 50 with children still at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage gap is even more dramatic than the gender gap,''
said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has specialized in
tracking women voters. This gap has been evident over the last few
presidential elections, with married voters preferring the
Republican and unmarried voters preferring the Democrat. In 1996,
President Clinton led Bob Dole among unmarried voters by 26
percentage points, according to polls of voters leaving polling
places. Dole had a 2-point advantage among married voters.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted Sept. 9 to 11
with 843 registered voters, shows a similar contrast. Married women
prefer Bush over Gore, 45 percent to 37 percent, while unmarried
women strongly prefer Gore to Bush, 57 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey for the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 24 to
Sept. 10 with 1,999 registered voters, found similar sentiments.
The poll shows that Bush is ahead among both married mothers and
married fathers and among married men who have no children, but
that Gore leads among most other gender-based categories, including
unmarried men of all ages, which is a significant gain for him.
(The New York Times/CBS News poll, however, has Bush 2 percentage
points ahead among unmarried men, and 6 points ahead among all
men.)
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are tied among married men over 50, according to
the Pew poll. Gore is less interested in them than Bush is, because
they form the natural Republican base _ in favor of tax cuts, the
death penalty and building up the military, and against gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the focus has been to reclaim the family for
Democrats and Al Gore,'' Stanley Greenberg, Gore's pollster, said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew poll, found strong differences
in the views of married mothers under 50 and those of women under
50, unmarried or married without children. The married mothers said
they liked Bush better and considered him a stronger leader than
Gore. They said Bush seemed more honest and more likely to get
things done.
</P>
<P>
   But on all of these issues, unmarried women _ of all ages _
think more highly of Gore than married women do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The close race between Bush and Gore among parents masks a
sharp divide between married and single parents regarding who is
the better candidate,'' Kohut said in his survey. ``While Bush has
a 50 percent to 41 percent lead among voters who are married with
children, voters who identify themselves as single parents _ 63
percent of whom are women _ favor Gore 55 percent to 34 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg says the explanation lies partly in differing economic
circumstances. ``People who are in two-parent households have more
money and more ability to deal with the ups and downs of life,'' he
said. ``People who are single are more vulnerable to changes in the
economy and are more in need of government services.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut also foresees Gore benefiting from an underlying sense of
anxiety that voters, especially women, have about their personal
financial situations. Gore is succeeding, he said, because he is
addressing these concerns with proposals to provide money for a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare, health care, college and day
care and allow for targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lake agreed. She said that unmarried women were ``much, much
more likely'' to want government to provide a social safety net
than married women were.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the goal is obvious. ``Younger, blue-collar men are
more receptive to his message than college-educated men are,'' Lake
said. Men who are both educated and affluent tend to support Bush
because they like his tax cut proposal, his antigovernment stance
and his support for privatizing part of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have identified a string of recent events that have
swung women to Gore, starting with his selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate on Aug. 7 and including what Gore
called his ``overwhelming surge of emotion'' when he kissed his
wife at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Since the convention, Gore has overtly aimed his message at
women. And he has paid particular attention to the concerns of
married women and those who may have dismissed him because of
Clinton's problems. He focused an entire week of events on health
care and another week on education. His hourlong visit with Winfrey
was saturated with glimpses of family life, family concerns and
statements of support for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has not forgotten men. His populist turn of phrase _ as
a ``fighter'' against ``the powerful'' _ had working-class men in
mind, as have various recent photo opportunities, including those
at a truck factory in Michigan, at batting practice with the
Detroit Tigers and with firefighters in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Kohut's polling suggests that Gore has not been
able to appeal to married women on the issue of gun control. Young
mothers with young children _ the kind of woman who joined the
``Million Mom March'' against gun violence _ favor Bush on this
issue, even though Bush signed a law allowing citizens to carry
concealed weapons, including into church. But in Kohut's poll, 39
percent of young mothers favor Bush on guns, while 37 percent favor
Gore. Unmarried women, both under 50 and over 50, favor Gore on
this issue.

AFRO-AMERICAN SPECIALIST TO TAKE LEAVE FROM HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cornel West, one of Harvard University's most popular
and outspoken professors, is taking leave this year for medical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials wouldn't comment on West's medical condition.
However, one of his colleagues said he's fine and will be back
teaching next September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing serious; it's treatable,'' said Henry Louis
Gates, Jr., chairman of the Afro-American studies department.
``He's been very active on campus and in the (presidential)
campaign. Cornel is the hardest working man in the American
academy. What he needs now is just to sniff the flowers and take a
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   West, who was scheduled to teach this semester, only recently
requested the time off, Gates said. The leave came too late for
Harvard to note the change in its course guides before classes
began this week.
</P>
<P>
   The late news disappointed many students planning to take his
``Introduction to Afro-American Studies,'' one of Harvard's most
popular courses.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 undergraduates waited in vain for the class to begin
Monday at Lowell Lecture Hall. ``People were just quietly
waiting,'' said Royd Chung, 21, a senior majoring in government.
``You could say I'm upset. I hoped to hear Professor West lecture
at least once before I graduated. I guess that's that.''
</P>
<P>
   West, 47, is not the only professor with health problems at
Harvard's Afro-American Studies department.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who had hip-replacement surgery in May, was operated on
again last month after suffering a rare infection in the replaced
hip. Still on crutches, the 50-year-old scholar is working
half-days.

   BUSH (Chicago) _ The question came by way of an e-mail message.
Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of confessional television, relayed it,
and Gov. George W. Bush took it head on: What's the public's
largest misconception of him? ``I'm running on my Daddy's name,''
he answered instantly. `Really?'' she prodded. ``That, you know, if
my name was George Jones I'd be a country and western singer,''
said Bush, the son of a president. ``I've lived with this all my
life. Of course, I love my dad a lot. he's a fabulous man and I'm
proud to be his son.'' For an hour Tuesday, Bush took his turn in
Oprah's chair, just a week after Al Gore did, trying to woo her 7
million daily viewers, most of them women. He gave her a kiss,
which Gore did not. He resisted some of her efforts to force him
into introspection. Joked at others. He talked of God, of stopping
drinking. And his eyes welled up with emotion as he spoke of his
wife and the birth of his twins. By Alison Mitchell.

   YUGOSLAVIA-ELECT (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia is running for re-election against NATO and
the United States, the countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year,
not against his democratic opposition. Portraying himself as the
defender of Yugoslavia's sovereignty against a hostile, hegemonic
West led by Washington, Milosevic and his government argue that
opposition leaders are merely the paid, traitorous tools of enemies
who are continuing their war against him by other means. The
elections are on Sunday, but there has hardly been a day since the
bombing war against Yugoslavia began in March 1999 that state
television news has not railed against ``NATO aggressors.'' By

MILOSEVIC SEEN RESTRICTING FOREIGN PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government has delayed
or rejected visa applications from US news outlets to cover
Sunday's election, and a former State Department official said
Tuesday that the Balkan leader is trying to thwart unfavorable
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A reduced foreign press would not be as vigilant in tracking
down election fraud or intimidation, said James P. Rubin, the
former US assistant secretary of state and longtime department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, in Boston for a morning speech, said Milosevic's
alternatives are losing the election or stealing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two outcomes in this election that seem
plausible _ both of which Mr. Milosevic wouldn't want the outside
world to focus on,'' Rubin said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of the regime, they don't want the world
to know what happens, because whatever happens will delegitimize
the regime,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Milosevic trailing challenger Vojislav
Kostunica, who has the uncharacteristically united backing of 18
opposition political parties and one trade union. But Milosevic
opponents in Kosovo and Montenegro may boycott the vote, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, correspondents from several leading US
newspapers have had their visa applications rejected or delayed,
raising fears of a Belgrade ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all,'' said Ann Cooper, executive
director of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
``This is a very serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition activists and European governments fear that
Milosevic, fighting for his freedom as well as for his political
survival after being indicted by a UN war crimes tribunal, will
declare victory regardless of the results _ or unleash his police,
army or plainclothes supporters in a crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 14 countries, mostly from the former communist bloc,
joined the European Union's plea to Serbians to throw out
Milosevic, who in a decade in power has overseen the nation's
collapse in disastrous wars over Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The only country currently negotiating EU membership not to
associate itself with the plea was Slovenia, the first part of the
former Yugoslavia to break away. But Slovenian officials said their
objection came on a technicality, and they fully agreed with the
EU's desire for Yugoslavs to move beyond Milosevic.

GORE FENDS OFF DRUG COST CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his aides continued Tuesday to try to
fend off a controversy over whether he misspoke last month in
saying that his mother-in-law's arthritis medicine costs three
times as much as the same drug taken by his dog Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not her, the issue is what seniors around the
country are paying and the wholesale price is between two and three
times as much as what is charged for pets,'' Gore told reporters in
Los Angeles, as his campaign sought to quell two days of questions
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 28 Gore told a group of Florida seniors that his
mother-in-law pays $108 a month, and his dog just $37.80 a month,
for the same arthritis medicine, Lodine, declaring, ``This is an
example in our household.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Globe reported that Gore lifted those costs from a
House Democratic study, not from his household records. The study
numbers are for manufacturer's wholesale prices, and, as Gore used
them, presume that Shiloh would take an adult dose, a potential
overdose for the Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that the
cost of the Lodine for Gore's mother-in-law, Margaret Ann
Aitcheson, was $2.13 a pill. Shiloh's pill -- EtoGesic, the animal
version of Lodine -- costs 92 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehane said he did not know whether Aitcheson, who lives
with the Gores, actually pays for her pills, or whether she has an
insurance plan that covers the drug. He also left reporters
wondering why Gore, a long-time supporter of generic drugs, does
not get that low-cost alternative for Aitcheson. The generic, which
now accounts for 85 percent of all Lodine prescriptions, costs as
little as 40 cents a pill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's oblique acknowledgement followed two days of accusations
that Gore's yarn about his family's costs for Lodine was yet
another example of Gore's habit of embellishing facts about his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits an ongoing pattern where he will simply make things up
if it sounds good,'' Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said.
``It is troubling that he would fabricate a story that puts his
mother-in-law in the middle of a campaign, in a way that involves
her private medical information, especially if what he said isn't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite mounting evidence that Gore misspoke, Lehane declared,
``The facts are absolutely accurate.'' The Bush campaign's focus on
the issue, he added, ``shows their desperation. They don't seem
able to find an issue they can talk about.''

 &HT;    Judge: Gibson murder case needs review
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dudley Bowen took the bench in the case of death row inmate
Exzavious Gibson with arm-twisting on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the defense table was a 28-year-old man sentenced to
die for stabbing to death a Dodge County grocer. Gibson, who has
been diagnosed with borderline mental retardation, is the only
person in the modern history of the death penalty to have been
required to proceed without a lawyer during an important hearing on
his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lawyer in this courtroom who, in the exercise
of intellectual honesty, could say that this case is one which has
no troubled background,'' said Bowen, a federal judge in Augusta.
``...This case has got some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing was over, Bowen had taken the extraordinary
step of leaving the bench to begin his arm-twisting, telephoning a
state court judge in Waycross and urging him to reopen Gibson's
case.
</P>
<P>
   With intensified national debate over the death penalty,
Gibson's case raises anew concerns over the adequacy of legal
representation provided defendants facing capital charges. And the
recent hearing, held Sept. 8, shows the resolve some judges have in
ensuring that a thorough examination of a death penalty case be
conducted before the condemned killer is executed.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was convicted 10 years ago of stabbing Eastman grocer
Douglas Coley 39 times during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, he filed a habeas corpus petition, a lawsuit that
is brought by almost every death row inmate and which, on occasion,
can uncover misconduct by the prosecution team or jurors, errors
made by judges and inadequate representation by the defendant's
trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gibson filed his petition, he no longer had a lawyer.
And Judge Carlisle Overstreet, who was assigned the case, promptly
scheduled hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Resource Center, a state-funded agency that assists
indigent death row inmates, scrambled in vain to find Gibson an
attorney for the Sept. 12, 1996, proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing began, Beth Wells, a Resource Center lawyer,
stood in the courtroom gallery and implored the judge to grant a
continuance. But Overstreet proceeded and at one point during the
hearing, ordered Wells removed from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of that hearing showed Gibson had little idea of
what was going on, at one point saying he did not know how to
plead, even though the proceeding did not require one. He presented
no evidence, asked no questions, lodged no objections.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet denied Gibson's state habeas corpus petition out of
hand. This April, Gibson turned to the federal courts, and a court
date was set. On Sept. 8, Gibson appeared before Bowen, a
law-and-order judge appointed by former President Carter, who had
to decide whether to grant Gibson an evidentiary hearing in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gibson was represented by counsel: Resource Center
director Thomas Dunn and Courtland Reichman of King &AMP; Spalding,
Atlanta's most prestigious law firm, which took the case after
Gibson went through his 1996 hearing without a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen opened the hearing saying that he had presided over
numerous death penalty cases that hung around for years because of
prolonged appeals. Gibson's wasn't going to be one of them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's federal petition asserts he deserves a new trial
because his trial lawyer billed for only 32 hours of pre-trial work
and had a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Senior assistant attorney general Susan Boleyn argued to Bowen
that none of these new claims should be considered. She said Gibson
is barred from raising them because he failed to do so in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowen said the 1996 hearing resembled ``a sparring match''
and Gibson's claims deserve ``meaningful'' review. Bowen asked if
Gibson's new lawyers tried to file a second state habeas corpus
petition. Boleyn said one was filed but, coincidentally, it was
dismissed the previous day, on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bowen would not let it rest. ``Why would it not be better
to let the second state habeas go ahead?'' he asked. ``...In other
words, let the second one go forward as if the first one had not
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Boleyn, bearing the brunt of Bowen's persuasion, agreed to let
Bowen telephone Clarence Blount, the Waycross judge who dismissed
Gibson's second petition the previous day. Bowen later emerged from
his chambers, saying he persuaded Blount to consider reopening the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``After fighting so long and so hard, we're pleased it looks
like Exzavious is finally going to get his day in court,'' Reichman
said.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding will increase its role. Its Washington office
will put five additional lawyers, including two partners, on the
case, Reichman said.
</P>
<P>
   If a new state court hearing is granted, the new lawyers will
attack the performance of Gibson's trial attorney. Their court
motions note Cochran attorney Dennis Mullis was a special assistant
attorney general at the time he represented Gibson. Mullis had an
obligation to disclose to Gibson and the courts that he was being
paid by the state, but Mullis did neither, the court motions say.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   And if Mullis had adequately prepared, Gibson's new lawyers
assert, he would have found out Gibson's mother was a prostitute
who was shot to death by one of her customers when Gibson was 2
years old, and that Gibson had suffered severe abuse, including
lashings with curtain rods and electrical cords, by an alcoholic
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had counsel done any meaningful background investigation, he
would have discovered that Mr. Gibson suffered a horrific childhood
which left him mentally and psychologically scarred,'' the motion
said, adding that the jury should have known this before sentencing
Gibson to life or death.

 &HT;    Alliance could break lock on mailbox use
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The real target of FedEx Corp.'s proposed alliance
with the U.S. Postal Service could be the mailbox at the end of
your driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service has claimed sole access to the nation's
mailboxes since 1934 when a single sentence in the federal code
granted the agency exclusive delivery rights. Private firms like
FedEx have tried for years to break the lockout, but so far without
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's system of mailboxes was built and paid for by
mail recipients, not by the Postal Service,'' FedEx founder
Frederick W. Smith told Congress last year. ``Unless the law on
mailbox access applies equally to all competitive products, the law
will perpetuate a tremendous bias in favor of the Postal Service.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx and the Postal Service are currently negotiating a
controversial deal that Postmaster General William Henderson says
will allow FedEx to carry Postal Service next-day packages on its
airplanes and let the Postal Service deliver FedEx Ground packages.
As an added bonus for FedEx, mail carriers could pick up and
deliver FedEx packages at individual mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx customers who wished to return items purchased online, for
example, could simply put them in mailboxes for postal carriers to
retrieve. FedEx would then collect the shipments and deliver them
to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx and Postal Service officials won't say whether mailbox
access for FedEx is part of their ongoing negotiations. But being
barred from mailboxes has long put private delivery firms at a
major disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Couriers must walk to doorsteps, and packages placed there are
far more susceptible to theft and damage. A Postal Service study in
the 1960s determined that deliveries to doorsteps cost the agency
twice as much as those that went to mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the burgeoning e-commerce market propels
business-to-residential deliveries, the strategic value of
mailboxes is higher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mailbox is a perfect place to deliver pharmaceuticals,
contact lenses, books _ all sorts of things that are bought and
sold on the Internet 24 hours a day,'' said Mason Kauffman, chief
executive at logistic firm AccuShip.com. ``Mailboxes are dry and
secure _ but it's a federal crime for your neighborhood association
to put newsletters in them.''
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service Inc., the world's largest transportation
firm, plans to challenge the planned FedEx/Postal Service alliance
on public policy grounds. It's unfair, UPS says, for a governmental
agency like the Postal Service to favor any company in a
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, UPS officials say their company will
quickly take advantage of any loosening of mailbox rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way the Postal Service could suspend its
regulations on mailboxes for one company and not others,'' said
Norman Black, a UPS spokesman. ``I have no reason to suspect that
mailbox access is even on the table in the negotiations between the
Postal Service and FedEx. But if the general prohibition is lifted,
I'm sure UPS customers would be interested in receiving small
packages in their mailboxes. And so would members of my
neighborhood association.''

 &HT;    FedEx, UPS take opposite courses
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - United Parcel Service Inc. and rival FedEx Corp. are
using similar technology to pursue radically different strategies
for pre-eminence in the $75 billion U.S. small package delivery
market.
</P>
<P>
   UPS uses its Internet-based package ordering, tracking and
billing to funnel more packages through its core transportation
system. But FedEx has begun using those tools to link its
transportation network to a variety of partners.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx announced Sept. 12 that it signed an agreement with the
French post office to transport its international shipments on
FedEx planes in exchange for the French agency delivering FedEx
packages in Europe. FedEx also confirmed this month it is
negotiating a far-reaching agreement with the U.S. Postal Service
in which FedEx planes will carry next-day letters for the Postal
Service, and mail carriers will handle FedEx Ground packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a definite point of departure for two companies that
have been getting more and more similar over the years,'' said
Gregory Burns, transportation analyst at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in New
York. ``UPS is a one-stop shop where UPS employees pick up, sort,
transport and deliver every package. FedEx doesn't have that
capability _ but it does have technology that can tell customers
where their packages are and when they'll be delivered no matter
who is carrying them. And in today's market, that may be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx's new posture reverses its former policy in which
``custodial control'' was an important selling point.
</P>
<P>
   But if FedEx successfully navigates the transition, the
potential payoff is huge. The company will be able to extend its
ground deliveries to virtually every address in America without
having to buy more trucks or hire more workers. Overseas, FedEx can
use its fleet of aircraft to tie into ground delivery networks
around the world. And lower unit costs will help FedEx compete
against UPS, which consistently offers lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't cost FedEx anything to carry Postal Service
packages because FedEx planes are already flying to those same
cities every night,'' said Mason Kauffman, founder of AccuShip.com,
a logistics consulting firm. ``And it doesn't cost the post office
anything to deliver FedEx Ground packages because postal carriers
are going to those same addresses anyway. The potential cost
savings for both sides is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a FedEx/Postal Service alliance raises hackles at
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs firm says it should be illegal for a
quasi-governmental agency like the Postal Service to favor any
private company in a competitive marketplace. UPS has promised to
challenge the proposed partnership between its two biggest
competitors in Congress and the courts if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.), chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, asked the Department of Justice to probe
antitrust issues involved in the proposed FedEx/Postal Service
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, no such alliance should be finalized without a
full understanding of its competitive implications,'' he wrote in a
letter to Joel Klein, head of the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   UPS says FedEx's alliance strategy is tacit acknowledgment that
it can't match the world's largest transportation firm's
proprietary network. And UPS believes shippers will favor companies
that handle packages from pickup to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``FedEx can't duplicate the system we already have in place,''
said John Flick, a UPS spokesman. ``If you're a customer and you're
dealing with two companies in an alliance, where does one stop and
the other begin? If you have a question, who do you call? We've
always taken a long-term approach to building our network, and
we've always believed it's better to own our own infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schlesinger, transportation analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette in New York, said FedEx risks tarnishing its brand and
harming its reputation for high customer service if it enters an
alliance with the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``FedEx is betting that its technology can bridge a very wide
gap,'' he said. ``With the Postal Service, it's inevitable that, at
times, the screen will go dark. The flow of information is going to
get interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial FedEx and the bureaucratic Postal Service may
seem like odd partners, but the two organizations have worked
together frequently in the past. FedEx carried first-class mail on
its small jets from the time it was formed in 1971 until more
profitable small packages began filling its planes later that
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, RPS Inc., now a FedEx subsidiary, hired the Postal
Service to deliver packages in rural areas that RPS couriers
couldn't reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense for four delivery vans to drive down the
same street carrying 10 packages each,'' said Satish Jindel,
founder of SJ Consulting, who engineered the RPS/Postal Service
agreement. ``It's much more efficient for one van and one courier
to take 40 packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Graf Jr., FedEx executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said the company is exploring partnerships
around the world designed to improve efficiency and lower costs.
FedEx technology, he said, will continue to give customers detailed
information about their shipments _ even if packages are traveling
in another company's trucks, vans or airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as customers know where their packages are and when
they'll be delivered, the logo on the outside of the vehicle
doesn't matter. And surging demand for international shipments is
forcing companies to expand faster than they can build their own
delivery networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do it all on our own,'' Graf said. ``In places where
we can take advantage of infrastructure that's already out there,
we'll do it. If it makes sense for us to use others' assets to
enhance our capabilities, we will. But FedEx will retain total
control over the information flow.''

 &HT;    Brunch at Tiffany's, a soiree at Saks: Parties are in fashion
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion Week, the semiannual gathering of frock
stars, rock stars and reporters from mid-sized newspapers, is
always a see-and-be-seen scene. But this fall, as designers preview
their spring threads, Palm Pilots are keeping track of more parties
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? Is Fashion trying to give herself a lift after a
summer of slumpy sales? Or maybe she wants to shake off the gloomy
vibe of last February's shows _ the fur protesters, the
photographers' walkout, the general feeling of ``wake me when this
season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the champagne is chilling. Breakfast at
Burberry. Brunch at Tiffany's. Light refreshments at Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Buchman is serving tea. Sears is serving cocktails. Saks
Fifth Avenue is swinging open its doors to the A-list for a private
shopping event.
</P>
<P>
   And Hermes looks to trump the lot of 'em with a store opening
that received a full-page preview article in the October issue of
Vanity Fair. The magazine describes the soiree, outside the
company's five-story Madison Avenue flagship, as ``a hybrid ballet,
hip-hop concert and haute street fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's entertainment will include buglers in hunting
clothes and Russia's Beroizka ballet company, fluttering through a
four-minute version of Swan Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Riding habits? Tutus and toe shoes? Rest assured, by week's end,
someone will declare them spring's next big thing.

</P>
<P>
   This season, headliners Tommy Hilfiger and Vivienne Westwood are
sitting out the festivities in Bryant Park, the midtown venue that
serves as the center of the style universe during Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   The pair always produces shows with ``oomph'' and attract a
celestial guest list, but no one will have time to notice their
absence. Roughly 130 designers are trotting out Spring 2001
collections, with at least one show scheduled every hour from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m. A few highlights of today's schedule:
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. Socialites young and old flock to the front row at Oscar
de la Renta. Wonder where the ladies will lunch afterwards ...?
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m. Marc Jacobs launches a new label called, simply,
``Marc.'' (Will the hemlines be abbreviated, too?)
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. No waifs allowed. Playboy Playmates strut the runway for
the unfailingly quirky Betsey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   7:30 to 10 p.m. Donna Karan, who will show her eponymous line on
Friday, gives folks a look at DKNY eyewear, as well as the DKNY
women's and men's collections.

SUAVE RIVAL HAS WORDS FOR U.S.: `EN GARDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the French satirical television show that twits the United
States for being the ``World Company.'' that invades people's lives
around the globe, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine,
expresses frustration, and perhaps a little envy, at America's
dominion.
</P>
<P>
   He is more elegant, although for a top diplomat refreshingly
undiplomatic, in how he expresses what he sees as the problem of a
world run exclusively by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is unprecedented: what previous empire
subjugated the entire world, including its adversaries?'' Vedrine
writes in his new book, in which he loves to use his shorthand for
the United States, ``hyperpower,'' which makes the Clinton
administration cringe.
</P>
<P>
   But Vedrine says that a new equilibrium will eventually evolve,
and France, as the current president of the European Union, is busy
trying to construct it with a more streamlined Europe _ with France
at its center _ rising as a future equal, rather than a junior,
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not worry about this, he said in an
interview. Europe, he said, is not about to take on the
``hyperpower,'' which he finds the most telling way to describe
America's military, linguistic, cultural and business dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it would necessarily lead to rivalry,'' he
said between meetings with fellow foreign ministers at the U.N.
General Assembly earlier this month. ``It could be a real alliance
between the United States of tomorrow and the Europe of tomorrow. I
don't mean an alliance as we know today but a real partnership. But
it would, I grant, disturb the habits and usual trends of American
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming foreign minister three years ago, Vedrine, 53, a
lawyer and previously the senior foreign policy adviser to Francois
Mitterrand when he was president, has made a priority of making
distinctions between France and the United States. That has left
senior U.S. officials muttering more than usual about the French.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Vedrine stunned Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
with whom he converses in French, by making France the only country
of 107 attending nations to refuse to sign a declaration on
democracy that she had organized in Warsaw, Poland. (``Democracy is
not like instant coffee where you can just add water and stir,'' he
says).
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``France's Assets in the Era of Globalization,''
(to be published in English later this year by the Center on the
United States and France at the Brookings Institution), Vedrine
argues that France has much to offer the world and must find the
self-confidence to work toward a ``multipolar world'' that would
undo the ``uniformity and the unilateralism'' that results from
U.S. supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   He scolds his fellow Frenchmen, who, he says, have much to be
proud of in their modern age, for being too attached to their past:
``We have to avoid giving the impression that all we're doing is
trying to keep a fading star from burning out completely.''
</P>
<P>
   To move Europe toward being the political and military
powerhouse that France would like, the European Union has initiated
a European defense plan. ``Many American officials are of two minds
about this,'' said Vedrine. ``There's the usual complaint that
Europe is not taking a big enough share of the burden. And then
there is the other traditional reaction that whenever Europe does
something, people say, `Be careful, you're going to resuscitate
American isolationism.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reservations at the Pentagon about the new European
plan, particularly because it could duplicate the work of NATO,
President Clinton was in favor of it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he said, the plan to strengthen Europe's defense should
not be interpreted as a threat. ``We're not talking about having a
go at the hyperpower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Vedrine said that while many Europeans were
sympathetic to France's complaints, they also believed that if
France were as powerful as the United States today, the French
would be even more unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``France most of the time has a mythical approach to its
history,'' he explained. ``I'm trying to tell them that there is no
point in being nostalgic about when you were a great power. In
France we're always talking about the voice of France, the
universal mission of France. I'm trying to say that you're only
well received if we come up with bright ideas that no one else
has.''

moved closer to easing the Cuban embargo, giving initial passage to
measures that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, as
well as a bill that would ease travel restrictions that currently
bar most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba. If the latter measure
wins final approval, it could prove a bonanza for the Cuban tourism
industry, which has grown dramatically in the past decade.

More than half a century later, amid the ongoing information boom,
social scientists say little has changed. American voters are
disturbingly ignorant about the country's political life and its
leaders. Even in the age of radio talk shows and Internet chat, a
majority of Americans have trouble identifying their congressman or

   (For Atlanta) TECH-GADEL _ WASHINGTON _ As high-tech companies
mushroom, Georgia's old economy - largely built on peanuts, poultry
and pulp wood - is being transformed. The new foundation rests on
computer bits, bytes and biotech. While only about 4 percent of
Georgians are farmers today, about 7 percent are high-tech workers,
such as computer engineers and programmers. In metro Atlanta alone,
roughly 10,000 tech companies employ about 220,000 people. But
while the tech sector is driving up the state's population and
wealth, Georgia's 13-member delegation to Congress remains outside
the inner circles of tech political power. Though they won't speak
on the record, many of Georgia's business executives and lobbyists
grumble about their lawmakers' lackluster leadership on tech
issues. (Geewax, Cox News Service)

   OPTIONS _ One out of five American workers _ clerks and assembly

The trend is driven by business necessities, including a tight

   FLIGHT-SERV _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull
Flightserv.com out of its dive in late May, he faced some
Internet-sized challenges. The Atlanta company's stock had dropped
90 percent from its 52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's
best-performing stock last year. A New York money manager had
cancelled the second half of a $10 million investment. Few business
travelers were using Flightserv's Web site, www.flightserv.com.,
which offers individual seats on private jet flights between
Atlanta and New York. And the company was running out of cash. So,
over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and chief
operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget and suspended
flights. Bottorff also plunged into retooling Flightserv's business
model and rounding up new investors and business partners.

   SAVING-CAVES _ Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful

is not well known, which has protected the formations growing from
the floor and the ceiling. They took thousands of years to form.
They can shatter in seconds. In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of
Lafayette and Bill Putnam of Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying
quiet moments in the cool embrace of the earth. ``You know how some
people are beautiful and stunning and others are just as plain as
plain can be?'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are like that too. Every
one is different.'' Putnam is a director the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc., which Cousineau chairs. For the
past several years, the 600-member organization has rapidly
acquired caverns from West Virginia to Florida both to hold and to
protect. Most are near Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia border, a region
with perhaps more caves per square mile than anywhere in the United
States. ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We
just need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest
goal.'' (Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

other big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio

eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up

VATICAN LOOKS TO NEW CARDINALS AND PAPABILI 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ For Catholics, a Holy Year is a time to make pilgrimages
to Rome and throw open the doors of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican, however, there are signs suggesting that top
church officials are working behind closed doors during this Holy
Year to reorganize top echelons and prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring signal was the reassignment of a close aide to
Pope John Paul II, Bishop Giovanni Battista Re, 66, the deputy
secretary of state, whose Vatican job description is akin to that
of a White House chief of staff. Last weekend, the bishop, a career
Vatican diplomat, was put in charge of the office that selects
bishops, a powerful post that will almost certainly result in his
elevation to cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   That administrative reshuffle, which was prompted by the
resignation of Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves, a 75-year-old
Brazilian, for reasons of illness, also suggested a deepening
awareness of the 80-year-old pope's failing health.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cardinals under age 80 _ and therefore eligible to
vote in a conclave to choose a new pope _ has shrunk to 100, from
the maximum 120 allowed. That means that John Paul could soon
appoint as many as 20 cardinals who are within the age range to be
both electors and potential papal candidates. If Re is made a
cardinal, for instance, he would be eligible to be elected pope, or
at least to help shape the election process.
</P>
<P>
   The busy Holy Year calendar has not deflected preoccupation in
the church administration with the cardinal-selection process,
which is expected to be completed by February. ``All you hear is
talk about cardinals and when they may be named,'' said Bishop
Joseph Fiorenza of Galveston-Houston this summer after visiting
Vatican offices.
</P>
<P>
   The reassignment of Re, moreover, has prompted Italian reporters
to re-handicap the race among ``papabili,'' the Italian word for
candidates who could be elected pope. In its Sunday issue, the
daily newspaper La Repubblica printed a giant chart dividing major
cardinals into seven conclave categories, including ``moderates,''
``Third World'' and ``traditionalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaticanisti, as Italian experts on the subject call themselves,
have long debated whether the cardinals, building on the precedent
of a Polish pope, would move toward electing a candidate from
Africa, Latin America or Asia, or whether they would return to an
Italian. But the oft-cited battle between so-called liberals and
conservatives inside the Vatican may be a bit of an exaggeration.
John Paul has appointed almost all of the current cardinals, and
they share his basic views.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, however, shows no signs of winding down his mission
after the Holy Year comes to a close, Vatican officials say. In
recent weeks, plans have been floated for the pope to visit Armenia
either this year or in early 2001. The Vatican secretary of state,
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said last week that the pope wanted to
resurrect his plan to make a pilgrimage to Ur, a city in Iraq, a
trip that was canceled in December after the Iraqi government
withdrew its consent.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other recent signs in the Vatican that the pope's
closest advisers are seeking to nail down his legacy. Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger, who directs the Congregation for the Doctrine of
the Faith, issued a stern 36-page document this month on the
primacy of the Roman Catholic Church, which declared that it cannot
be any group's ``sister church'' because that would imply a
``plurality.'' And it said non-Christian religions, while holding
out the possibility of divine grace, ``are in a gravely deficient
situation in comparison with those, who in the church, have the
fullness of the means of salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the document seemed to deflate the pope's bold efforts
to further ecumenicism and interfaith dialogue, most notably with
his silent prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem last March. The
document offended many leaders of other churches, who saw it as a
tactless step backward.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who on Monday opened a joint commission on dialogue
between Catholics and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, did
not allude to any change in his own thinking, saying, ``The
commitment of the Catholic Church to ecumenical dialogue is
irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the Ratzinger document was aimed at Catholic theologians
who have sought to reduce the distinctions between different
faiths. The day before issuing the document, the Rev. Jacques
Dupuis, a French Jesuit, was summoned before Ratzinger, whose
office was once called the Holy Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dupuis was ordered to stop teaching at the
Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, after Ratzinger opened a
heresy investigation into his book, ``Toward a Christian Theology
of Religious Pluralism.'' The investigation has not yet published a
conclusion, but the cardinal's document hinted at the probable
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But as Vatican officials lay down the law, other Catholic
institutions have been searching for signs of change. America, a
Jesuit magazine published in New York, this month ran an article
suggesting that the Vatican was growing more tolerant about the use
of condoms to combat the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, John D. Fuller and James F. Keegan, drew on an
article by a French Vatican official, Jacques Suaudeau, published
in the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, in April. It
condemned the use of condoms to fight aids but allowed that in
Thailand, the government's distribution of condoms to prostitutes
to contain the spread of HIV was a ``lesser evil,'' though it
``cannot be proposed as a model of humanization and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in his Vatican office, Suaudeau insisted that his
article did not seek to enlarge church teaching, but simply to
explain it. He said his article reiterated the church's stance that
abstinence before marriage and conjugal fidelity remain the only
effective method for preventing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why people want to interpret what I stated
clearly in my article,'' Suaudeau said with a sigh. ``But there is
no change in church teaching.''

 &HT;    A circle of faith: Kids, Jesus no longer poles apart
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrea Vickers and about two dozen of her classmates at
Wellington High School have little red stickers about half the size
of a dime on their watches, jewelry and bookbags _ any place they
look at regularly. They are there to remind them to say a quick
prayer for an unsaved classmate.
</P>
<P>
   (And according to Vickers, it works. On Sunday Vickers' ``dot''
from last year accepted Jesus as her personal savior. ``We both
went to church this morning,'' Vickers said. ``We both wept.'')
</P>
<P>
   The ``unsaved'' may see evidence of more people praying for them
Wednesday morning: At Wellington High School, and across the state
and the nation, 3 million high school and middle school students
are expected to gather at the 11th annual ``See You at the Pole''
prayer meeting. The gatherings _ usually around flag poles at 7
a.m., before school starts _ began in Texas in 1990 and have grown
exponentially ever since. Their purpose is to encourage students to
pray for their school, their communities and their country, and to
pray that others will accept Jesus as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the gatherings have taken off. Three years ago in
Wellington three students met to pray around the flagpole; last
year there were about 150, said Kalah Hernandez, a 16-year-old
junior and leader of the Christian Youth Club. Along the way the
Christian club has grown, too, with more than 100 members. Each of
the leaders is asked to reach out to bring new friends to the
meetings and to pray for their friends who are unsaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one influence on kids is other kids,'' said David
Brower, the area director of a Christian youth group called First
Priority, which is helping to organize the ``See You at the Pole''
gatherings. ``The best way to reach them is through another kid.
That's who they're getting advice from, that's who they are
listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez takes that charge seriously. ``I believe that my sole
purpose at Wellington High School is to reach out to other kids, to
set an example,'' Hernandez said. ``Last year both of my dots
received Christ. Now I have two new dots. It's an amazing
feeling.''

TECH STOCKS ADVANCE STRONGLY, LIFTING NASADQ; DOWN OFF 19.23 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks, under pressure for much of
September, moved sharply higher Tuesday, driving the Nasdaq
composite index to its biggest one-day gain in more than three
months.
</P>
<P>
   A good day in the bond market and a dip in oil prices provided a
positive backdrop for stocks. But traders and analysts said that
computer-related shares were ready for some sort of corrective
bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seen a pretty ugly market for the first couple of weeks
this month, and some of the stocks had been pretty oversold,'' said
Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset
Management. ``But that doesn't remove the uncertainty of
third-quarter earnings, which is why I am not convinced this
rebound will feed into a sustainable rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by gains in Intel, JDS Uniphase and Microsoft, the Nasdaq
composite index gained 139.12 points, or 3.7 percent, to 3,865.64.
It was the biggest one-day gain in the index since June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Tuesday's rise, however, the Nasdaq is down more than
8 percent from its close on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Other major market averages were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.39 points, or
1.1 percent, to 1,459.90, helped by stocks like Cisco Systems,
Nortel and EMC.
</P>
<P>
   But weakness in cyclical stocks like Alcoa and International
Paper were a drag on the Dow Jones industrial average. The
blue-chip index fell 19.23 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,789.29.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve stocks fell for every 11 that rose on the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading volume on the Big Board exceeded one billion
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had spots of pretty good activity, but I don't see
investors putting the pedal to the metal on either the sell or the
buy side,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has been under selling pressure this month, was the
most actively traded issue Tuesday, rising $4.56, to $60.38.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, JDS Uniphase jumped $10.13, to $107.94. Microsoft
gained $2, to $65. And PMC Sierra soared $22.94, to $224.31.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa fell $1.31, to $25.81, after the aluminum maker said it
expected third-quarter profit to fall short of Wall Street
estimates. The company cited higher energy costs and slower sales
in the building and transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll-Rand, a maker of construction equipment and
architectural hardware, also issued a profit warning, and its
shares fell $4.06, to $35.69.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks had a very good day. Genentech rose $4.38,
to $160. Immunex gained $2, to $45. And Human Genome Sciences
closed at $153, up $9.
</P>
<P>
   Falling interest rates helped lift bank and financial services
stocks. Bank of New York rose $1.38, to $51.81. And Citigroup was
up 41 cents, to $53.97.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group closed up 13 cents, at $88.50,
after Evan Greenberg abruptly resigned as president. The
resignation leaves the insurance giant with no clear successor to
Greenberg's father, Maurice Greenberg, who is chief executive.

ADVERTISING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS INCREASED HEALTH CARE SPENDING,
STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advertising to consumers has stimulated a major
increase in retail spending on prescription drugs, the
fastest-growing item in the nation's health-care budget, a new
study says.
</P>
<P>
   The study, issued Tuesday, says that 25 of the most heavily
advertised drugs accounted for more than 40 percent of the increase
in retail drug spending last year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it said, sales of Lipitor, a Warner-Lambert/Pfizer
product that lowers cholesterol, rose 56 percent, to $2.6 billion
last year. Consumer advertising for the drug rose to $55.4 million,
from $7.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published by the National Institute for Health
Care Management, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that conducts
research on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it said, retail spending on prescription drugs rose to
$111.1 billion in 1999, from $93.4 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that advertisements may be persuading
consumers to push for newer, costlier medicines when less expensive
drugs would work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advertising of drug products has exploded since the
Food and Drug Administration relaxed the rules on such marketing in
1997. Virtually anyone who reads a magazine or watches television
sees drug advertisements, most of them for only a handful of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass media advertising of prescription medicines is heavily
concentrated among a relatively few drugs, about 50,'' the study
said. ``Sales of these drugs contributed powerfully to the steep
increase in prescription drug spending in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Findlay, the author of the report, said: ``Our analysis
suggests that consumer advertising could be responsible for 10
percent to 25 percent of the recent increase in prescription drug
spending. Other factors include the increase in insurance coverage
of drugs, the aging of the population and the fact that more
medicines are being approved by the Food and Drug Administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, a drug industry trade association,
said advertising alerted consumers to new drugs, encouraged people
to visit their doctors and provided useful information about
conditions that might otherwise go untreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are getting their health care information from
newspapers, television, the Internet and advertising, not just from
their doctors,'' Cottrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Findlay, the director of research and policy at the National
Institute for Health Care Management, agreed with all those points
but said, ``The advertisements could also be inducing inappropriate
demand for some prescription drugs including anti-arthritic
medicines like Celebrex and Vioxx.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, said she shared that concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs advertised on television are often high-cost substitutes
for other therapies that are just as effective,'' Lehnhard said.
``Except in a small number of people with gastrointestinal
bleeding, Celebrex is no more effective than generic Tylenol or
ibuprofen that you can buy at the drug store for pennies a day to
treat arthritis pain. But it's much more expensive, and it gobbles
up the drug benefit provided under insurance plans that limit
coverage for prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study gave examples of advertising that appeared to
contribute to increased sales:
</P>
<P>
   _ Schering-Plough spent $137 million advertising various forms
of Claritin, an allergy medication, to consumers last year. This
was the largest amount spent on any drug. Claritin sales rose 21
percent, to $2.6 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $43 million on consumer advertising
for Glucophage, an oral diabetes drug, in 1999. Sales rose nearly
50 percent, to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales of Prilosec, a widely used ulcer medication, rose 24
percent last year, to $3.6 billion. The manufacturer, AstraZeneca,
spent $79.4 million advertising the drug in 1999, up from $49.7
million in 1998, and the company spent $42 million on such
advertising in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The study said that advertising for allergy drugs coincided with
a significant increase in the number of visits to doctors by people
who had symptoms of allergies. The number of such visits was
relatively stable, at 13 million to 14 million a year from 1990 to
1998, but it shot up to 18 million in 1999, as advertising
increased, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not discuss the accuracy of drug advertising. But
in the last three years, the federal government has repeatedly
reprimanded drug companies after finding that they made false or
misleading claims in television commercials and magazine
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has admonished companies about
commercials advertising drugs for allergies, asthma, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure, hair loss and sexually
transmitted diseases. It has also found problems in advertisements
for birth control pills, anticancer drugs and medicines to help
people lose weight and stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the government said, the advertisements violated
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they overstated the
benefits of a particular drug, minimized the risks or falsely
suggested that one drug was superior to another. The FDA also found
that many companies had been promoting their drugs for uses not
approved by the government.

EDUCATION COLUMN: GETTING GOOD TEACHERS FOR POOR SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: TEACHERS-PAY)  
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many urban teachers' unions have negotiated the right for senior
members to pick the schools where they teach. Some have gone
further. In Los Angeles, teachers can even choose which classes to
teach. And in Boston, principals cannot rehire promising first-year
teachers if senior instructors want the novices' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   School boards have been aiming to end these practices. This has
led to conflicts with unions. Boston teachers are now refusing
extra duties to protest district proposals. The Philadelphia union
has taken a strike vote, partly over a seniority dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that union-negotiated transfer rights can conflict
with good educational management. Rigid rules for filling vacancies
can harm principals' efforts to meld teachers into effective teams.
But seniority is also becoming something of a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Without more flexible teacher pay policies and better principal
selection, abolishing seniority won't help much.
</P>
<P>
   New York and other cities often place new teachers in the
poorest and lowest-scoring schools, which senior teachers can
avoid. These sites have openings because teachers transfer out of
them, selecting schools deemed more desirable, with easier-to-teach
children.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles used to spend less on schools in poorer
neighborhoods because many teachers in them, new to the job, had
lower pay. But a court order has forced schools with above-average
spending to fill openings with newer hires.
</P>
<P>
   In August, New York state Education Commissioner Richard P.
Mills sued to force New York City to place certified teachers,
regardless of their wishes, at low-scoring sites. City Schools
Chancellor Harold O. Levy replied that there were too few certified
teachers to go around and that he could not force on them
placements they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise this year, Levy hired new certified teachers for
low-scoring elementary schools, before other schools were allowed
to offer them jobs. The dispute will arise again in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was correct. It is foolish to ignore senior teachers'
preferences. If assigned involuntarily, they may move to suburban
districts or leave teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some racially biased teachers may think good schools are those
with few minority pupils. Such teachers should be urged to use
seniority rights to transfer _ if they stay, they could harm
children for whom they have low expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But teachers may also want to work closer to home, or seek
easier jobs with pupils more ready to learn. As teachers age,
desires for lighter burdens are normal. These are good reasons to
honor seniority.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better way to move good teachers to difficult
schools. Market forces suggest raising salaries at hard-to-staff
sites. Then, experienced teachers will want to move into difficult
schools, not out of them. But big boosts are needed. Rudy Crew, the
former chancellor of New York City schools, offered a 15 percent
bonus to volunteers for the lowest-scoring schools, but still could
not fill the jobs. Board officials now guess it would take about a
$20,000 differential to attract high-quality teachers to the most
difficult places.
</P>
<P>
   Pay differentials can also solve science, bilingual and
special-education shortages. Higher pay would lure mathematicians
to teaching and encourage more undergraduates to major in math.
</P>
<P>
   Unions usually resist this idea, typically accepting only token
increments for bilingual teachers or those in poor neighborhoods.
Union leaders recall old fights to win single salary schedules in
systems that paid men more than women and whites more than blacks.
But this history should not preclude sensible differentials today.
</P>
<P>
   Salary and seniority reform alone won't staff the most difficult
schools. A surprise discovery in the Los Angeles litigation was the
low turnover in some sites in low-income neighborhoods, while it
was high in some seemingly desirable schools. The same is true in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The most challenging schools that still retain teachers have
principals with clear goals who establish order and inspire
teachers to accept difficult challenges. When good teachers bail
out, it may indicate a lack of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing principals who can build high-performing teams is the
most important task of district leaders. Then, with pay
differentials for difficult schools in place, principals, perhaps
in consultation with other staff members, should be able to select
compatible teachers without seniority as a deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Unions typically claim that experienced teachers can work
anywhere. But just as some principals are more effective, teachers
also vary.
</P>
<P>
   A few districts have reformed seniority. In St. Paul, senior
teachers once claimed openings, but now principals can reject
applicants who don't seem to fit. Seattle, Columbus and Milwaukee
have made similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   To get the best teachers for difficult schools, limiting
seniority is only a partial solution. Also needed are pay
differentials when volunteers are scarce, and principals who make
good teachers want to stay.

ANGLERS PROTEST TO KEEP A SHRINE TO FLY-FISHING INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABBOTTS BARTON, England _ Silky smooth, the river flows through
pampered banks, and anglers, crouching to cast lines to skittish,
savvy trout, like to say that this is their shrine, the place where
the arcane arts of fly-fishing were honed one hundred and more
years ago. Indeed, this spot where willows weep and the waters
sparkle is known not just to Britons but to American fly-fishers
too as the cradle of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the summer this 3-mile stretch of the River
Itchen, crisscrossing the water meadows of Hampshire near
Winchester, has been propelled from understated idyll to burning
issue. A local conservation agency struck dread into the hearts of
the anglers by decreeing that part of the hallowed Abbotts Barton
fishery must be allowed to revert to nature.
</P>
<P>
   No more would riverine weeds be trimmed or bankside reeds cut
back to create just the right mix of sheltering weed and gravel
beds, a perfect habitat for trout. No more would the streamside
footpaths be cropped smooth for the benefit of anglers. No more
would farmed brown trout be stocked alongside wild brown trout, and
no more would voracious pike _ which eat most things from ducklings
to milder species of fish _ be kept far away.
</P>
<P>
   The anglers struck back. Letters were written to The Times of
London. Legislators were drafted into the fray. Fly-fishing
magazines took serious umbrage. ``Cultural vandalism,'' thundered
Total Flyfishing. ``Tragedy at Abbotts Barton,'' said Trout and
Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Was this in essence a class war between the conservationists and
the 25 anglers in the Abbotts Barton club _ known, in fly-fishing
parlance, as rods? The members brave a five-year waiting list and
then pay $1,500 a season to fish three days a week for six months a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it a broader question of where conservation begins and
ends?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, perhaps, lies in a particular British reverence for
chalk-stream waters like the Itchen and its sister stream in
Hampshire, the Test, where fly-fishing has become especially
refined as a skill and where access is largely restricted to
sometimes snooty clubs and syndicates whose annual fees make the
Abbotts Barton water look cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can rightly be described as the cradle of dry-fly
fishing,'' with the fly on the surface, said Roy Darlington, 59,
who held the lease to the Abbotts Barton fishery for 25 years.
``Modern fly-fishing has its origins here.''
</P>
<P>
   The local Hampshire Wildlife Trust _ one of a plethora of
environmental agencies _ ended Darlington's tenure this year,
giving him until the end of September, when the season closes, to
wind up his affairs on the two-thirds of the fishery it owns. The
rest is owned by a local family that has not objected to the
anglers' regime.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not solely about fishing, says the Hampshire
Wildlife Trust, which bought the Abbotts Barton property in 1981 to
forestall housing and other development. Rather, the trust argues,
it is about what flourishes there, how it is managed and who gets
to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, it is a nature reserve that's been intensively
managed for fishing,'' said Ian Woolley, the trust's chief
executive officer. ``We would like to see biodiversity and not just
for trout.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, since the trust suspended Darlington's lease
this year, preventing him from intensive management of the river
and banks, ``there are many varieties of flowers and insects that
are there now and weren't there previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlington sees it differently. ``We argue that it's because of
management over 400 years or more that there is biodiversity for
the wildlife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise may be in the works, permitting fewer anglers _
only 15 _ to fish on shorter stretches of managed water while the
rest of the fishery is left to nature. Woolley says the proposal is
under consideration as part of a five-year plan for the whole area
of streams and water meadows that could, indeed, make parts of the
property soggier than now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing is one of a whole series of issues,'' Woolley
said, but ``we are not going to walk away and turn it into a bog.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Shuttle crew prepares to land Wednesday at Kennedy Space Center
 &HT;

 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a generally favorable weather forecast for its Florida
landing site, crew members of space shuttle Atlantis prepared late
Tuesday to end their 12-day mission to the international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis and its seven-man crew was scheduled to touch down at
NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida today (WEDNESDAY) at 2:56
a.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters closely monitored the Atlantic waters off Florida
for scattered rain showers that would prevent the astronauts from
landing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a backup landing opportunity in Florida at 4:33 a.m.
CDT.
</P>
<P>
   If foul weather blocks both opportunities for a pre-dawn return
to Earth today, NASA planned to bring Atlantis back to either
Kennedy or Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., early Thursday, said
Wayne Hale, the flight director who was supervising landing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew includes commander Terry Wilcutt, pilot Scott
Altman, flight engineer Rick Mastracchio, mission specialist Dan
Burbank, mission specialist Ed Lu, and Russian cosmonauts Yuri
Malenchenko and Boris Morukov.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle
lifted off Sept 8. Once docked with the space station, the
astronauts equipped it with life support systems and other
provisions that will enable the first resident crew to move aboard
in early November for a four-month stay.

 &HT;    Woman taking their rage to the road
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, when somebody was so close to your back
bumper that you could smell the garlic on their breath, you could
almost guarantee it would be a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the drivers who would rip and snort their way though
traffic, without regard for turn signals or leaving more than a few
inches between cars, were almost always men.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. More and more women are dangerously
aggressive drivers, and it is no longer unusual for a woman to take
the next step from aggressive driving to road rage, actually
commiting acts of violence from behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Curbow, an assistant professor of social and behavoral
sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has looked into
the driving behavior of some working women, and it's not a pretty
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Curbow has found that when women face a demanding job in the
workplace and are then confronted with the additional stress of
trying to provide a good home life for their families, they often
become Mad Maxine on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are just feeling pressed by trying to fulfill both of
these big roles,'' she said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Curbow studied the driving habits of 218 female
telecommunications workers. A majority (56 percent) were married or
living with a partner. Most (67 percent) had more than a high
school education and an even larger number (76 percent) were
parents. They averaged 42 years old and 18 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Her most shocking findings: 56.1 percent admitted they drove
aggressively. A quarter confessed they ``take my frustrations out
from behind the wheel.'' Two in five admited they yelled or
gestured at other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's just more anger in general in our society,''
said Curbow. ``And I think there's a great sense of anonymity in
our society. Instead of just swallowing these feelings, I think
(women feel they can) just let them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Curbow found more correlation between home lives and road rage
than job-related bad driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road rage was highest for women with low home rewards and high
home responsibilities,'' she said. It was ``lowest for women with
high home rewards and high home responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for some perspective. The best known study on road rage,
conducted by researcher Louis Mizell in 1997 for the AAA Foundation
for Traffic Safety, examined 10,037 incidents classified as ``road
rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those, only 413 involved female motorists. However, of those
cases, 285 of the women used their car as a weapon and on 31
occasions, the victim was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like men, women who engage in (road rage) have used firearms,
knives, baseball bats, defensive sprays and fists to settle
arguments,'' Mizell wrote. ``But the weapon of choice for most
women who react aggressively to traffic disputes and traffic stops
is the automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Cmdr. George Hatfield of the Cobb County police
said he sees plenty of aggressive female drivers these days, but
most road ragers are still men. Hatfield said he's seeing more
tickets being written to school bus drivers, who are predominately
female.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely to be speeding and tailgating these days,
two symptoms of aggressive driving. ``We're seeing higher speeds by
women that we formerly did not see,'' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Curbow said researchers need to examine the differences between
offensive road rage and the defensive variety. In other words, do
women initiate conflicts or merely react to perceived slights on
the highways?

<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ The microphone was burning, the telephone
switchboard was flashing and this time it was Victor Correa on the
line to Radio Ecclesia, 97.5 on the FM dial. And the three
government officials taking calls in the studio braced themselves
for yet another public whaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you opposition politicians, you sit there and do
nothing!'' bristled the angry voice of Correa, whose call was
broadcast live across this shabby capital one recent morning. ``You
receive orders from the government. You do nothing on your own. I
ask you one favor: can you please stop driving expensive cars and
play the role of a real opposition?''
</P>
<P>
   The officials _ opposition members who are part of a national
unity government _ shifted uncomfortably, unaccustomed to the
verbal flogging, which would have been unthinkable only a year ago.
In this war-riven country, where public dissent is typically
suppressed, Radio Ecclesia is one of only a handful of independent
media outlets willing to challenge a government that is
increasingly criticized for corruption and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   But this daring has come at a price. Moving to sharply restrict
the operations of independent news media like Radio Ecclesia, the
government has now proposed legislation that would send journalists
to prison for criticizing or questioning government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed law, journalists who publish or transmit news
or facts ``which attack the honor'' of government officials or
offend ``public morals and good habits'' could be imprisoned for
two to eight years. The news media would also need government
approval to operate, and the authorities would be allowed to seize
and ban publications at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had already
stirred an international outcry over the past year by searching
newsrooms, seizing audio tapes and unpublished articles and
arresting, detaining and intimidating journalists who work for
independent or foreign news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists say the new law would make it impossible for them to
do their jobs and would violate their constitutionally protected
right to freedom of expression. And Radio Ecclesia, which has
continued to operate despite repeated harassment, would probably
have to revamp its format to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Ecclesia, the country's only independent radio station, is
run by the Catholic Church here. And last year, three of its
journalists were arrested for broadcasting an interview with Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of the rebels in this country's long-running
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In June the station's director was kidnapped and fired on by
armed gunmen after he broadcast live a debate on how the country's
oil and diamond resources were fueling the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaking,'' the director, the Rev. Jose Paulo, said of
the kidnapping. ``This law is just another tool to repress
journalists. A lot of people are afraid of this. It's very bad for
democracy in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown here is just one of several across southern
Africa, a region known for more stable democracies and a respect
for human rights:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Zimbabwe, two journalists from the independent weekly
newspaper The Standard were jailed and tortured last year for
reporting on an alleged military plot against President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Zambia, 11 journalists from the independent daily The Post
were charged with espionage for reporting assessments that Zambia
could not withstand an attack from Angola.
</P>
<P>
   _ In South Africa, usually hailed as a model of press freedom,
the Human Rights Commission issued subpoenas to newspaper editors
in an effort to compel them to testify about racism in the media.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the leadership of the Southern African
Development Community, which represents 14 countries, the Committee
to Protect Journalists also reported harassment in Swaziland,
Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. But the committee singled out
Santos as one of 10 worst enemies of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists are very, very cornered in Angola,'' said Yves
Sorokobi, the Africa program coordinator for the Committee to
Protect Journalists, a New-York based group that has sharply
criticized the legislation. ``This new law will make it almost
completely impossible to talk about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists will continue to maintain some sort of independent
voice, but they will make sure not to cross the strict lines that
have been defined,'' Sorokobi said in a telephone interview from
New York. ``There will be an incredible amount of self-censorship.
The way Angola is run today, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials here have acknowledged that their review of the press
law is ``by its very nature controversial and sensitive.'' And the
government has taken the unusual step of inviting journalists and
others to voice their opinions on the legislation, which is
expected to become law by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to understand that what was presented was
just a draft,'' Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications,
said in an interview. ``We want a democratic discussion of the
proposed law. Freedom of information is a very important factor in
a democracy. What we intend to do is to find a law that everybody
can accept so that we will avoid trouble in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But journalists here say the government abuses the existing law.
</P>
<P>
   In the most widely publicized case, Rafael Marques, 29, was
convicted of defamation in March after an article in which he
described President dos Santos as a dictator. Marques was sentenced
to six months in prison, pending the outcome of an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Domingos Mussamo, 28, the chief editor of a provincial
office of the state-controlled radio, was detained for almost four
months after the police searched his home and office and discovered
an unpublished article he had written for an independent newspaper
about security preparations for a rebel attack. He was acquitted in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Neto defended the arrests, saying the news media are inevitably
under tougher scrutiny because the country is at war. ``We are
fighting Jonas Savimbi, so you don't put Jonas Savimbi on the
radio,'' Neto said, referring to the Radio Ecclesia interview.
</P>
<P>
   The government pressure has already had a chilling effect. Radio
Ecclesia stopped broadcasting a weekly radio show on Africa after
the government objected last year. Other journalists say they now
think carefully before they write.
</P>
<P>
   Domingos Mussamo's relatives are begging him to give up his work
for the independent press. As a result of his arrest, he was fired
from his job at the radio station, where he earned $7 a month and
supported a wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   And while he says he will continue to do free-lance work for the
independent media, he admits that he will now have to find other
means of support. ``I have to find a way to feed my family,'' he
said. ``I have to find a job.''

 &HT;    Georgia charity under fire
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four employees of a Georgia-based charity have been arrested in
Honduras and accused of smuggling cocaine in surplus U.S. military
vehicles, a Florida newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command told The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution that a military inquiry had found that
the charity, called Corazon a Corazon, had obtained the military
equipment under ``false pretenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Arthur Merkel, said a criminal investigation into
the matter is being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Crosby, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can neither confirm nor deny any investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Foster, a Dalton physician who founded the charity, said
Corazon a Corazon was being framed so the Southern Command could
take back the military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing that for months, that they would plant some
drugs on the boats so they could seize them back,'' Foster told The
Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was among gear no longer needed as the U.S. shut
bases in Panama in preparation for transferring control of the
Panama Canal to the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was auctioned, and nonprofit organizations could
obtain it for a nominal fee, Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Corazon a Corazon, which provided relief to Hondurans
affected by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, obtained landing craft,
forklifts, tires, warehouse equipment and other gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's proven that they're a nonprofit organization and it's
for a worthy cause, they cannot sell it or dispose of it for at
least one year, and I think that's where they broke all the laws,''
Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Foster, who repeated statements made to the Herald about his
organization being framed, told the Journal-Constitution that
Corazon a Corazon had fully complied with guidelines related to use
of the property and had obtained it legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we told them was true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corazon a Corazon says on its Web site that it is ``not a 5013c
corporation yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foster said the organization is a private, voluntary group
that is involved in humanitarian efforts and has never
misrepresented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, there's no question. We've never made a profit,''
he said. But he added, ``We never told the Army that we were a
nonprofit organization.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, an investigation by a Southern Command board of
inquiry determined that ``Corazon a Corazon obtained excess
property from the U.S. government by false pretense'' and used the
equipment ``in a manner inconsistent with the conditions upon which
it was granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the property should revert to the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, four staff members of Corazon a Corazon,
including one American, were arrested in La Ceiba, Honduras, where
police say the group had unloaded 79 packages of cocaine from one
of the landing craft a week earlier, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel said the Honduran investigation was separate from the one
conducted by the Southern Command.

LONDON-FRANKFURT MERGER: DEAL WHOSE TIME HAD PASSED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL and SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt,
Germany, stock exchanges collapsed last week, the participants were
left to confront an odd reality: those markets, it turned out,
could not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the London-Frankfurt deal had been a hurried
attempt to construct a ``merger of equals'' between unequal
partners, riven by national and cultural differences, regulatory
distinctions and concerns over technology and back-office clearing
and settlement procedures. And, when it came to making a final
decision on the merger _ it was challenged by a rival bid and by
opposition from retail traders and brokers _ the deal dissolved,
bringing down with it the chief executive of the London Stock
Exchange, who resigned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But, even as Europe's traditional exchanges maneuver for
position in a complex consolidation, some bankers and analysts
maintain that the market has already moved on, seeking simpler,
cheaper trading from more nimble Internet-based trading systems,
leaving the Continent's equities markets facing a lengthy and
uneven odyssey in pursuit of the vision of a pan-European market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the opening shot in a process that is going to be
very messy because you have all kind of forces coming into play,''
said a senior British banker. ``We have opened Pandora's box.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stock-trading experts have even come to question the basic
premise that mergers like as the proposed fusion of the
London-Frankfurt bourses are workable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe merger is the way out, or whether it even
makes any sense,'' said Narayan Naik, a professor of finance at the
London Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, as Europe's traditional exchanges weigh possible
combinations, some traders have begun to turn to alternatives like
Tradepoint Financial Networks PLC, an electronic market with a
portfolio of pan-European blue-chip stocks that is aiming to secure
20 percent of Europe's cross-border equities trading by late 2002.
And it is the challenge from such trading organizations known as
electronic communications networks, or ECNs, that will increasingly
put pressure on traditional exchanges to devise their own
pan-European solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is ECNs,'' Naik said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the London-Frankfurt deal was accelerated when
OM Gruppen AB, operator of the Stockholm exchange, made a hostile
bid for the 200-year-old London market. But even before then, the
fault lines in the London-Frankfurt merger, particularly in London,
had been clear. Retail brokerage firms feared it would hurt them.
Regulators in Britain and Germany raised alarms about the integrity
of the merged markets, which would have traded European blue chips
in London and high-growth stocks in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock merger bore little resemblance to a conventional
merger where the interests of shareholders presumably are the most
important. ``The deal was done in smoke-filled rooms behind closed
doors,'' the British banker said.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is whether any future consolidation effort
in Europe will be stymied by the same combination of national and
vested interests and other hurdles. Apart from fighting OM
Gruppen's hostile bid, the London exchange, which has been
completely electronic since 1986, is also a potential takeover
candidate for other predators _ including the parent of its former
merger partner the Frankfurt exchange, Deutsche Boerse in
combination with the Milan and Madrid exchanges, and by a
combination of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses called
Euronext.
</P>
<P>
   That has provided an opening for Tradepoint and other ECNs.
``Rather than having 200 years of history, we created our ECN from
a clean sheet of paper,'' said Steve Wilson, Tradepoint's director
of business development. ``We asked: What does the market want? And
the market said: We want a cheap and efficient way to trade, clear
and settle equities in Europe across borders, and that's what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While the traditional exchanges are looking at new business
models, we are able to get one with implementing our business
plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a deal, to be carried out next year, for the SWX
Swiss Exchange to take a 38 percent equity stake in Tradepoint in a
venture to trade Swiss blue-chip equities on Tradepoint, giving it
10 percent of cross-border European trading volumes, Wilson said.
The exchange plans to change its name to virt-X.
</P>
<P>
   Tradepoint, like other ECNs, has been established with backing
from the same big U.S. and European banks that dominate trading on
the London exchange and ultimately call the shots for many smaller
traders. The backers of Tradepoint, who control 54 percent of its
stock, include Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Deutsche
Bank and J.P. Morgan. But their influence is dependent on their own
prospects for growth.
</P>
<P>
   And, while ECNs are seen as a challenge to formal exchanges,
they are unlikely to displace the big exchanges either in some
regulatory functions or as the prime source of liquidity that sets
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that many of the major current exchanges will be
supplanted by much more nimble, lower-cost Internet trading
systems,'' said Ruben Lee, director of the Oxford Finance Group, a
consulting firm. ``However, the need to regulate markets means that
these new systems will have to adopt similar regulatory functions
and so will be called exchanges. It's not that exchanges will go
away, but will morph into something different.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore wooing deep pockets, not necessarily voters, during
California swing
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may seem strange that seven weeks from the
presidential election, Democratic nominee Al Gore is devoting two
days to campaigning in a state where polls show him cruising
comfortably ahead of his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But on this latest swing through the Golden state, Gore is
busier wooing the wealthy than the general electorate, scooping up
$7 million at Democratic fund-raisers hosted by stars from two of
the state's top industries _ Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The usually frenetic Gore held only one major public event
Tuesday, touting a plan to ensure privacy of medical records,
before flying to San Jose for a fund-raiser with technology
executives at the home of Novell founder Eric Novell.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Elton John was scheduled as entertainment for a crowd of
fans who shelled out $10,000 each to help the Democratic Party pay
for election activities.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry, heavily concentrated in northern
California, has become increasingly politically active and has
contributed $22 million to both parties during the current election
cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have received $11.8 million from the high-tech moguls
while Republicans have collected $10 million, according to the
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are waking up to the fact that their industries are
affected by decisions in Washington,'' said Gary Jacobson, a
political science professor at the University of California at San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said neither Gore nor Bush is likely to spend much
money here because of Gore's strong lead. A poll of likely voters
released this week by the Public Policy Institute of California had
Gore leading Bush 48-39.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson said neither candidate can completely ignore a
state with 54 electoral votes and a number of tight congressional
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are interested in showing the flag and raising money,''
said Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   However, much of the money raised likely will be spent in other
states where the race is much closer and where television costs are
lower. The Democratic National Committee is not now running any ads
in California, said spokeswoman Jenny Backus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending our money in other states where the vote totals
are a lot closer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in California last week, where he attended a number of
money events for his party. The Republican National Committee has
spent about $1.5 million in television spots in the state over the
last three weeks, mostly in middle-sized markets, said spokesman
Terry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
have attacked California's entertainment industry for marketing
violent products to minors, they continue to rake in the
contributions from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, a parade of celebrities, including actors
Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks and singer Don Henley, showed up at
the Beverly Hills mansion of supermarket magnate Ron Burkle to hear
Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a Federal Trade Commission report condemning
violence in the media, Gore and Lieberman recently threatened
sanctions on the entertainment industry if it didn't change its
marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Beverly Hills event, Lieberman toned down his
criticism of those who have been so generous to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Lieberman
said. ``And it's true from time to time we will have been critics
or nudges, but I promise you this: We will never put the government
in the position of telling you by law, through law, what to make.
We will nudge you, but we will never become censors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised a number of Hollywood figures, including
actor-director Rob Reiner, a host of the fund-raiser, for endorsing
his criticism of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true we feel strongly about the responsibility that the
entertainment industries need to take when it comes to marketing
inappropriate material to children,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic capitalized on his proximity to the entertainment
world Tuesday evening by visiting NBC's ``Tonight Show'' with Jay
Leno. Gore appeared only briefly on the late-night talk show, which
was abbreviated because of the Olympics coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at the New Horizons community center, Gore
promoted his plan to expand privacy protections for patients'
medical records. Gore said he would add new criminal and civil
penalties against anyone who inappropriately releases medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   He also would toughen the law to ensure that those in possession
of an individual's medical records, including employers, insurers
and workers compensation officials, could not use the information
for purposes unrelated to health.

COMMENTARY: PLAY OF THE WEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alas, poor euro! Europe's new currency, proudly introduced less
than two years ago at a value of $1.17, has fallen to a humiliating
85 cents. And things look rotten in the state of Denmark, where
next week's referendum _ to be or not to be part of European
monetary union, that is the question _ looks likely to result in
defeat for the pro-euro forces.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, when finance ministers from the major
industrial nations meet in Prague, Czech Republic, the slumping
euro will surely dominate the discussion. Europeans would very much
like the United States to join them in intervening _ that is,
buying euros and selling dollars _ to drive up the euro's value. By
all accounts, America won't go along. But it should.
</P>
<P>
   Let me admit that I have come around to this view only with
great reluctance. As a general rule, big economies like the United
States or the European Union can and should be relaxed about
fluctuations in exchange rates; I regarded the wailing as the euro
sank from $1.17 to $1 as much ado about nothing. Furthermore,
attempts to manipulate currencies through intervention have a bad
track record; they usually fail, and when they fail the currency
and the credibility of the government plunge in tandem. (Prime
Minister John Major tried to prop up Britain's pound in 1992; the
embarrassing failure of that attempt is one of the main reasons
Tony Blair is prime minister today.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when general rules don't apply, and this
looks like one of them. On Tuesday, Michael Mussa, chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, put it this way:
``Circumstances for intervention are very rare, but they do arise.
One has to ask, if not now, when?'' Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Why is intervention usually a bad idea? Because foreign exchange
markets are immense _ so immense that even a huge government
intervention will be blown away if it tries to stand in the way of
firmly held market sentiment. The Major government threw some $50
billion into the defense of the pound in 1992; the market,
convinced that the pound had nowhere to go but down, swallowed that
sum with hardly a burp, and the pound kept falling.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a run on a currency is driven not so much by
economic fundamentals as by herd mentality. When the herd is
running, there is a case for what people at the Fed call ``slap in
the face'' intervention. Basically, by ostentatiously buying a
currency that is plunging for no good reason, the authorities pull
investors up short, forcing them to consider if they really want to
bet against the finance ministries and the central banks. If all
goes well the market in effect shakes its head, says ``Thanks _ I
needed that,'' and returns to its senses.
</P>
<P>
   And the fall in the euro now looks very much like herd behavior.
To justify the euro's current weakness you have to believe not only
that America's ``new economy'' will keep delivering spectacular
growth indefinitely, but that Europe will never experience a
comparable surge of its own. And that just isn't plausible. The
extraordinary weakness of the euro is possible only because
investors, focused on the short term, have stopped thinking about
tomorrow _ or maybe the day after tomorrow. That's exactly the kind
of situation in which intervention is likely to succeed _ but
probably only if the United States joins in.
</P>
<P>
   Should we take that risk? No question, there are risks: The
intervention might fail, damaging our own credibility; or it might
succeed too well, sending the dollar into free fall. But there are
also risks in not intervening.
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has some direct interest in seeing a more
reasonable euro: the weakness in Europe's currency has reached the
point where it is starting to hurt the bottom line of the many U.S.
corporations for whom Europe is an important market. But the really
compelling reason to help Europe now is to set a precedent. Despite
its shambolic start, the euro is not going to vanish _ indeed, it
will be one of the world's two great currencies in the years ahead.
And while it may seem hard to imagine in these days of the almighty
dollar, there will someday come a time when we would like the
Europeans to support our currency. Let's do unto others now as we
would have them do unto us then.

 &HT;    Falcons search for way to slow runaway Rams
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, Rams quarterback Kurt Warner had just finished
another leg on what would be his whirlwind journey to becoming a
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-7 Falcons loss in St. Louis, Warner completed 17 of 25
passes for 275 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like the Keystone Kops,'' former Falcons free safety
Eugene Robinson said. ``I don't know if we were daydreaming or
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Another comically bad performance followed a few weeks later.
The Rams came to Atlanta and ripped the Falcons 41-13.
</P>
<P>
   This season, as the Falcons (2-1) try to come up with a game
plan to slow St. Louis (3-0) in the Georgia Dome on Sunday, nobody
is laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A few numbers sum up the scary Rams offense:
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Louis has scored 30 or more points in an NFL-record nine
consecutive games dating to last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rams are averaging 506 yards a game in total offense, on
pace for 8,096 yards, which would shatter the league record of
6,936 by Miami in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ Their current scoring rate of 41.6 points per game would total
635 at season's end, obliterating the NFL record of 556 set by the
Vikings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wide receivers Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are 1-2 in the NFC
with 345 and 298 receiving yards. ``You've got to harass Warner
somehow,'' Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to cover well, break on the ball well and tackle.
They're setting a new standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons feel like their secondary is better, thanks to the
offseason addition of former Pro Bowl cornerback Ashley Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, he and cornerback Ray Buchanan can play more combined
man-to-man coverage than last season. In 1999, current free safety
Ronnie Bradford was at cornerback, calling for constant zone and
double-team help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we match up pretty well,'' Bradford said. ``Last year,
. . . you didn't want to leave me too much on receivers of that
caliber. This year, we have two Pro Bowl corners, and I think we
can lock up more and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Leave that to Bruce, Holt and third receiver
Az-Zahir Hakim. Even if the Falcons play more press coverage, the
corners can't cover for long, and one misstep can leave a receiver
wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will need to pressure a passer whose release is
among the quickest. But blitzes could be disastrous. As the Broncos
learned in a season-opening 41-36 loss to the Rams, Warner and the
Rams are great at exploiting holes left behind by rushing
linebackers and safeties.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is better than running back Marshall Faulk, who leads the
league in yards from scrimmage with 280 rushing yards and five
touchdowns and 20 catches for 250 yards and another score.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has scored two more touchdowns than all of Altanta's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' defense improved dramatically Sunday in a 15-10 win
at Carolina by simplifying. But the Rams aren't simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They border on illegal almost every time, as far as getting
set and sending people in motion,'' Brooks said. ``They change
formations very rapidly, (and) Faulk . . . has to be accounted
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk accounted for 388 yards and two touchdowns against Atlanta
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are throwing downfield more this season. They are
averaging 10.5 yards per pass attempt better than any NFL team in
the 1990s and 14.7 yards per completion.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't really need to. In the first Monday-night game,
Hakim took a short hitch, broke one tackle, and raced 80 yards down
the sideline and had a chat with Holt en route. l
</P>
<P>
   To beat the Rams, Bradford said, the Falcons will need to make
tackles. ``That's key,'' he said. The Falcons ``have to hold their
yards after the catch. Once they get the ball in their hands,
they're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   And dangerous is not funny.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, the Signature Theater Company, which
devotes each of its seasons to the work of a single writer, has
been home to many of the nation's leading playwrights, including
Edward Albee, Arthur Miller and Maria Irene Fornes.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, is something of a departure for the
company; instead of featuring a single playwright, it has invited
each of its past nine resident writers to submit a new play, with
the goal of producing nine New York premieres during the next 20
months. Overseen by the artistic director James Houghton, the
series began on Sept. 17, with the opening of ``A Lesson Before
Dying'' by Romulus Linney. The next production, ``The Last of
Thorntons,'' by Horton Foote, is to open in early December.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times recently brought together a panel of
playwrights to ask how their experiences at Signature had affected
their artistic process, both while they were in residency at the
company and afterward. The panel, which consisted of Albee, Miller,
Fornes, Foote, and John Guare, was moderated by The Times' theater
columnist, Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: What was the effect of seeing a full season of your
work staged? Has it changed any of your subsequent work, or your
opinion of your earlier writing?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: I think the thing that surprised me the most was when I
was watching ``Marco Polo Sings a Solo'' and suddenly realized that
I would not have been able to write ``Six Degrees of Separation''
without having written ``Marco Polo.'' I realized, because I could
see the continuity, that ``Marco Polo'' somehow freed me, it gave
me a new voice, a voice that I had not had, or heard, before. I
mean, it sounds fancy to talk about, but I think that ``Marco''
gave me an elevated style, and I realized how important that was to
me, just as a writer, just in terms of upping the verbal ante. And
that realization never would have happened if they hadn't brought
``Marco Polo'' out of the shed.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: For me, I had a lot of short plays, some of which had
been done before, but others that fell during that 10- or 12-year
period where it seemed nobody was allowed to do any of my plays in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: The city had that order of protection out against you.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: [Laughs) Yes. They'd been done everywhere else, but they
were getting their first New York production. I believe we did the
plays sequentially, from the earliest one to the most recent one in
my season. So I think that was sort of interesting to let people
see the regression [laughs).
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: In my case, Jim had asked for three plays, and the only
stipulation was that one had to be created for the season. So the
last one that I wrote was one that I had started 18 years ago and I
had put it aside. One day, I was searching for something to work on
and I found it and I read it and I thought, ``Well, I still don't
know how to solve this,'' but I knew Jim was expecting something
new.
</P>
<P>
   So I took a ride. And in the course of that ride, I went by the
house I was writing about, and it was all boarded up. And I
thought, ``Strange.'' And I don't know what happened _ something
happened _ but I was invited to a breakfast the next morning and a
woman came to me and said, ``Do you remember me?'' And I lied and I
said, ``Yes.'' I didn't remember her at all. But she was the
18-year-old girl I had been thinking about in the play.
</P>
<P>
   And the whole thing just opened up. And I don't think, unless
Jim wanted this play, I would have done it.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: How was the experience of producing a play at the
Signature different from other productions you've had of late, if
it was different?
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: It's really very simple: it's that the emphasis here is
on the creative act. And it isn't that way in a commercial theater.
The commercial theater is hype, and it's pressure, and it's all
kinds of things about money and everything else. And what's up
onstage becomes this ancillary thing.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Considering some of the horrors that take place in
commercial production, where you're supposed to rewrite, or you
have to bring everything down to simple declarative sentences, or
you've got a star who's incompetent _
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Name names.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Not this time. Seriously, there's no pressure of that
sort here. This is a playwright's theater. The fact a playwright
gets an entire season is unique. I mean, these next two years, it's
sort of a different thing. But it is a playwright's theater. We
each have new work. We each have work that has not been seen before
in New York or has not been seen by anybody for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And people begin to get away from that erroneous idea that
you're as good as your last play. Which is nonsense. Sometimes
you're a lot better than your last play. And sometimes you're not
as good as your last play. But we get away from that. And people
get a whole perspective of what we've been doing for our entire
careers. That's exciting. And I didn't notice any pressures. You
want to do this play? Let's get the best cast we can possibly get,
the best director, and let's do it as you ordered.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: I found that the experience working here was wonderful.
But I am, in some ways, lucky that I'm not as successful or well
known as the gentlemen who are with me here. What I mean by that is
simply my work is not done on Broadway. My work is more Off
Off-Broadway, and not even Off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Our work isn't done on Broadway very much.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: No, but still, if you look back, it's almost like a
different type of work. I never imagined that I would be a
playwright. I never imagined that I would be dedicating my life to
this. I started as a painter. So when I started writing, a play
just came, like, without any intention of being my future or my
profession or my career. I started doing it out of some sort of
inspiration that came to me. But once you have that kind of
experience, you have to be crazy to give it up. And it happened
almost accidentally, almost like you're walking along and then
there is an electric wire and you touch it and you get almost
electrocuted. And there it is. And _
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: And you keep going back to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: Right.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: One more shock.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: Right. And suddenly, it was my hope, my dream. For the
first time, I did something that I was very excited about. The
pleasure of doing it was enormous, but the pressure wasn't.

 &HT;    Solo kayaker Shipley advances to finals
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Olympic solo kayaker Scott Shipley looks at his two
qualifying runs Tuesday and sees the glass that is half-empty and
half-full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sluggish and struggled all the way down,'' said the
Atlantan. ``I didn't get going well at the start and then I hit
some big water and it took me out of the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hit a gate on the first descent, tacking two penalty
seconds onto his time.
</P>
<P>
   His combined clocking was only fifth best in the field of 23,
nothing for a gold medal threat to e-mail home about.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he did advance to today's finals along with 14
others, who start from scratch with two more water rides. And, he
points out, ``Without that two-second touch, I would have been in
the lead after the first run.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shipley still might get to sip from a champagne glass. His
nemesis, Paul Ratcliffe of Great Britain, was third-best, on the
stern of No. 2 Thomas Schmidt of Germany and surprising pacestter
Mathias Roethenmund of Switzerland. Helmut Oblinger of Austria was
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make (the penalty) up on my second run,'' said
Shipley, wno nearly did, with the third-lowest points total.
</P>
<P>
   On what could be his last Olympics, Shipley says he reminds
himself of training on the Chattahoochee River in the winter cold
of 1996 when his event was in danger of being dropped from the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water was freezing, it was a dark, gray day, and I just
remember sitting in my boat and thinking 'I am never going to be an
Olympic gold
</P>
<P>
   medalist,' `` he said. ``Then I just made myself go on and
train, and here we are in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   For fellow Atlantan Matt Taylor, the stay in Sydney was short
and not very sweet. It can be summed up thusly: The first shall be
last.
</P>
<P>
   The leadoff team out of 12 in the double canoe, he and partner
Lecky Haller piled up 54 penalty seconds on their first run and
trailed the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to get through one gate and touched two others.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor-Haller improved a smidgen on the second try, glancing off
just one gate.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the cautious approach, the time was beyond
shouting distance and the duo could not climb out of the bottom.
Eight pairs advanced.

UNDATED: pressure wasn't.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKINLEY: To touch another topic, what is that like to go back
to this work that you wrote 20, 30, 40 years ago? Many of the works
done here are seldom-seen revivals.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Can we make a pact not to use that awful term
``revival?'' Being back from the dead is a revival.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: New production, then.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Well, I think that a play in a sense is an exorcism. I
mean you write a play because it's dealing with something that you
want to clean out of your life. You're trying to come to terms with
something. And when it's over, whatever the result of the play is,
you're moving on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: You develop a kind of affectionate objectivity about it.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Yes. I must say that the production of two plays, ``Marco
Polo'' and ``Buxoms and Neglect,'' brought back the reasons why I
had written them. And in them were, for the lack of better words,
``codes'' to me, things I could read. I found it very disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: You didn't change them, though?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: No, no, no. No, I didn't change them. But it was like
being thrown back into a Laundromat of time. And I did not feel
objective. I felt when I was in the play that I was back where I
was when I was writing the play. I felt very much in the present of
that play, which was very surprising. But you can't change or
improve or else use the benefit of 20 years later to say, ``Oh, I
know how to fix that.'' You have to say, ``This is the way I dealt
with it then.''
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Arthur, what about you?
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: Well, I did a wonderful production here of ``The
American Clock.''
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Had you looked at it before it went up here?
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: No. I don't have to look at it. I can remember it; I
wrote it [laughs). It was something that nobody in the commercial
theater would ever think of doing. It's too big to do. There are
too many actors in it. Like everything else, the commercial theater
is good for two-handers or three or four at the most. So there's
really no fundamental continuity possible in that environment. And
so this is really the best substitute we've got. Of course, I don't
have to tell you that you can't do any straight play anymore unless
it's been successful in London or some other place. I can't
remember when a Broadway producer produced a new play.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Unless it was at Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: Yes, but before that, it's been probably 15 years. Maybe
longer. And the result is that they gave it all over to the
musical, and there are really no producers very much.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: But I don't think any of us have a dream of being on
Broadway anymore.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Do you think that the experience here at Signature has
any reference, say, in what things were like in the 1950s or 1960s?
Is this closer to what it used to be like?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Very much. I felt it was very seat-of-the-pants theater.
It reminded me of being with the O'Neill. Because my new play was
going to be a different play. And then at the last minute, about
not quite eight weeks before we were due to open, or less than
eight weeks, we realized we had to quick, put in another play. I
went and found a play that was not finished that I hadn't expected
to do.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: This was ``Lake Hollywood''?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Yeah. And what I loved about it was that we had to throw
it up and I had to figure the play out. And on opening night I
said, ``Oh, my God, that's not what I meant.'' And what was
terrific about it was that the people from the Guthrie had come to
see the play and liked it. And asked if they could do it. And I
said, ``Yes, I could rewrite it.'' So I went out to Minnesota. And
all I could think of was, I did it in New York to get it ready for
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: New York is out of town.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Exactly. New York is out of town. But New York was ready;
it was there to get it ready for Minneapolis. And so it was all
part of that idea of the American national theater; of New York as
a link with all resident theaters and regional theaters all over
the country as a national theater. And to be a playwright today is
to be a Willy Loman, where you take your plays in a suitcase and go
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: That is to me what I'm after all the time. And Broadway
has never been a possibility for me, in my mind. Today, to try to
hope for a production on Broadway, which is going to have certain
elements that are more satisfying because you might get a better
actor, all you might get is a better set.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: We're not commercial hacks, either, honey.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: But you had a very bad experience, Irene. Your first
show, ``The Office,'' directed by Jerry Robbins, with Elaine May,
that Jerry Robbins, the brilliant Jerry Robbins, pulled the plug on
just before it opened. So I mean, you've had a very, very bad
experience in the commercial world.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: I think what's wonderful about the Signature Theater is
that it's eclectic: It doesn't demand one kind of playwright or a
certain choice of play. I mean, that includes Irene and Arthur and
all of us. Our styles are very different here. Its secret, it
seems, is to try out the new work, the way it might 30 years ago.
It just happened here that we just did it in a dyslexic way. But it
was very much in the spirit of an earlier era.

UNDATED: earlier era.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKINLEY: You've been asked by Jim to come up with a new play in
the next 20 months. How does the atmosphere here differ from if you
have to put it on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: Well, you don't expect that kind of pressure. You don't
feel limited in what you want to write about.
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: Right.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Low expectation?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: No. And it's not low expectation or even low pressure,
because you put pressure on yourself. Whether you're doing a play
on Broadway or here, believe me, there's no difference. It's no
different. You're not saying, hey, well, it's only 12th Avenue, you
know, I can just _ I just need one AAA battery.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Everybody wants to make money and everybody wants to get
good reviews. But the plays that we do here are not in the
expectation that they'll be commercially successful, or that they
will get good commercial reviews. They're not done with that
expectation. That's not a lower expectation; it's a totally
different kind of expectation.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Is it higher?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Yes, I think it is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Because the pressures, the commercial pressures don't
exist here.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: So it's a moral pressure. It's your life; it's aesthetic
pressure. It sounds fancy to talk about, but believe me, that's
much more demanding to have a whip at the back than saying, you
know, they didn't laugh, how are we going to run for another week
and the ad campaign has to change.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Do you think the plays that you're going to be writing
are going to be different because of the experience here?
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Well, I can only speak for myself, but I think the play
that I'm going to be doing here next fall is probably _ if it's the
one I think it is, if I ever get finished with the one I'm
finishing now _ I think it is going to probably be the most
experimental play I've ever written. Which means that it'll be
absolutely straightforward, absolutely _
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Because of this space, inspired by this space?
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: No, because I know that here there's an audience that is
not going to be puzzled by three-syllable words and they are not
going to start walking out because the play demands paying
attention to. And here I'll be free to make my experiments to see
whether they work or not. And that's one of the things that are
exciting about this.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: What about everybody else?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: The play I have that I've been working on might be a more
intimate play. A smaller play. And I just hadn't thought of that
until this very moment, but I think that being here, when you do a
play here, you rely on the good will of so many actors and people
that it's better to do a play that doesn't kill a cast of 15, 18.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: ``Thortons'' is a play I've had in mind for a while, but
it's because I'm here that I'm doing it. When I was a young
playwright, I was asked to meet with a very established playwright.
He told me that he wanted to help me because Broadway, which was
then flourishing, needed playwrights, and he said he had two
examples that served him well. One was never write a play about
someone you wouldn't entertain in your own living room. And it was
not very encouraging, because one of those plays I wanted to write,
you know, wouldn't fit. So I just nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Who was the playwright?
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: I'm not going to tell you [laughter). But all I mean to
say is that it was not very encouraging, because one of those plays
I wanted to write. And the other rule, I go back and forth about.
The other one was that when I take my plays out of town, I never
watch the actors; I only watch the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Of course, we all learn that.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: And you finally find a way to handle all that, don't you?
You just say, well, to hell with you, I'm writing a new play. I
mean, you know _
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: We are writers of plays.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: We write. And that reminds people out there that it is
not television, which is written by committees of writers, or
movies written by committees of writers, that there is such a thing
_ and I think being a playwright is probably the second-oldest
profession _ but I mean, it's greater, it's a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: Its rewards are there. Just the writing of it is the
reward, really, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Writing it and then putting it on. You write a play and
when you're ready to show it to somebody, a whole new world opens
up. A whole new world opens up. And we're writers of plays about
now: Horton and Irene and Edward and Arthur and all the young
writers coming up as we speak. We're writing about what it's like
to be alive now.
</P>
<P>
   FORNES: I think that as a writer, you are _ I'm already thinking
I'm wrong _ you are riveted from the day you begin writing. And you
are obsessed with it and you are entertained by it, and when you
stop, it's because you're tired and you're dying the next day to go
back to it; you are the first audience to your own output. You are
in heaven. It's like a love affair. And everybody else can
disapprove of it and think you're an idiot, but when you had it,
you never forget it, and that is really what lives inside you. And
it is in the work. Because you always find one person or another
who has experienced the same thing that you experienced.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: Have you all experienced that feeling?
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Oh, yes, I was just thinking, a couple of days ago I
finished a play. I see them and hear them on the stage as I write
them. I finished a play and I had the bizarre feeling: Gee, I've
had the experience of it; I don't need to see it. Completely
forgetting the fact that one of the reasons that I'd written it was
not just for my own satisfaction, because I wanted other people to
share it. But just for that one moment, I've had the experience of
it, and I didn't need anything else. I realized that was foolish,
ultimately.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: But it is exciting to have that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: It's wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   McKINLEY: It means you're doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   ALBEE: Still, you know that old phrase about people falling
through the cracks: Some people get famous and people who are just
as good don't get famous?
</P>
<P>
   GUARE: Yes. We're very lucky to have been, to be part of this
world.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTE: Yes.

 &HT;    Elegant, intimidating Williams routs opponent
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - You know how someone can walk into a room and command
attention? Venus Williams does that to an entire stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She is intimidating and elegant. Conversation ceases when she
arrives. Cameras flash. And opponents have to feel a little
jittery.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Williams has become. And she must like it because
the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion dresses the part.
</P>
<P>
   For her first Olympic match Tuesday, against Henrietta Nagyova
of Slovakia, Williams wore her hair pulled back in braids with a
diamond-laced headband, gold-loop earrings, a diamond and onyx ring
on her left hand and a choker necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant.
</P>
<P>
   And she also wore a look of determination. There were no smiles
prior or during the match. She had the icy look of a boxer.
Intimidation. Of course, with sister and doubles partner Serena and
coach Zina Garrison watching from the stands, she won with amazing
ease, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the first game in what seemed like a minute.
Nagyova won the second game, but Williams got serious and broke
Nagyova's serve with a series a laser volleys.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on. It was a display of power and skill that made
Nagyova look overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every tournament I play at the end I'm standing there
with the trophy,'' Venus Williams said. ``It's been nice. I just
take it one game at a time and then, eventually, I come out the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused (on a gold medal) because I committed to be here.
For me, it's as simple as that. . . The Olympics stack up very well
against (major titles). You look at it and it's so many of these
athletes' dream. You see how happy they are to win the gold, silver
or bronze. It seems like a gold medal would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And inevitable, if she continues to play with the confidence,
precision and power she has since winning Wimbledon. According to
her, the major reason for her ascension has been her mental
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude,'' she said. ``I've always been a great player,
athletic and a good person. But my attitude is a lot better. Still,
there's a lot of room for improvement. Because I'm so athletic, I
can improve a lot. I look at it like Martina Navratilova. Martina
transcended tennis. She was able to go from one era to another
(because of athleticism).''
</P>
<P>
   Williams feels unable to fully enjoy the Olympic experience by
venturing out in Sydney. ``I'm kind of afraid to go to the city,''
she said, understanding her vast international appeal. ``There
could be a lot of people and I don't know about transportation. So,
I just stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even there she cannot hide from the unrelenting criticism from
former tennis brat John McEnroe, who again publicly critcized the
Williams sisters. This time, it was in an Australian newspaper that
McEnroe said the rising stars ``do not respect the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams seemed miffed about McEnroe's attacks. ``It's. . . I
don't know John McEnroe,'' she said after a long pause. ``He
doesn't know me. I've never had a conversation with him. I find it
difficult to form an opinion on someone I don't know. And I find it
difficult for someone to form an opinion on me and my sister when
he doesn't know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her exhibition of confidence during interviews could
impact McEnroe's opinions, Williams wore an expression of
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always honest,'' she said. ``The fact is, I'm a good
player. I don't know. It's pretty strange. I'm always a nice
person, basically. I'm pretty positive. In a world of negatives, it
would be nice to have a few positives.''

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long and often tumultuous struggle, a bill
to remove trade restraints with China passed the Senate in a strong
bipartisan vote Tuesday, giving President Clinton what he
considered one of his crowning foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with approval by the House in May, the vote Tuesday
ended the annual congressional review of China's trade status, a
Capitol Hill ritual for 20 years that Beijing considered degrading
but that critics argued was necessary to force China to improve its
record on human rights and religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   After the historic vote, which passed with little debate,
Clinton told reporters, ``This landmark agreement will extend
economic prosperity at home and promote economic freedom in China,
increasing the prospects for openness in China and a more peaceful
future for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad margin of the victory, 83-15, was all the more
remarkable coming less than two months before the presidential
election, and after nine months of passionate debate. It
demonstrated how a foreign-policy issue could retain bipartisan
backing even in the heat of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
nominee, has supported the legislation. ``This measure will help
open markets to American products and help export American values,
especially freedom and entrepreneurship,'' said Ray Sullivan, a
spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore feared losing the support of
allies in organized labor who opposed the measure as a threat to
union jobs, he voiced qualified support for the bill Tuesday. But
he stressed that American workers' rights must be protected. ``We
must combat unfair trade practices abroad when they harm our
working families,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters hailed the deal, which will expand a vast
overseas market for U.S. good from soybeans to semiconductors, as a
path-breaking step toward a new economic and security relationship
with China. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who tried unsuccessfully
to amend the bill to penalize Chinese companies that exported
advanced weaponry, voted for the measure but said he would continue
to press China to curb its arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, free trade leads to freer markets, and freer
markets can lead to more open societies,'' Thompson said in a
statement. ``I will keep pushing to hold the Chinese accountable
for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure ensures that the United States will
benefit fully from a market-opening accord that Washington and
Beijing negotiated last November to slash Chinese tariffs on a wide
range of farm and industrial products and removes barriers to
American service providers, like banks and telecommunications
companies. Almost everything from apples to wine would have a
better chance of getting into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement paves the way for China to enter the World Trade
Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for
global commerce. China will join the trade organization, probably
later this year, and would have done so regardless of how lawmakers
voted Tuesday. But without Congress' blessing, China could withhold
some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other
members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For U.S. farmers, businesses and working people, this
agreement opens up a range of opportunities in China across all
sectors and all fields of a magnitude unprecedented in the modern
era,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Some provisions of the agreement have already taken effect, she
said, noting that orange exports to China from Florida and
California, for instance, have increased 100-fold since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``From semiconductors to circuit boards, from PCs to cell
phones, China is simply the most dynamic international market for
U.S. high-tech exports,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the
Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the United States bought $82 billion worth of
Chinese-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of
what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second-largest,
was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the trade bill warned that several challenges
remain in dealing with China, most immediately resolving disputes
over some agriculture tariffs and how Taiwan will join the WTO at
the same time as China. ``We've got a lot of work ahead of us,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.

 WASHINGTON: Baucus, D-Mont. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of Tuesday's vote was never in doubt. The fierce
lobbying that pitted corporate America against organized labor and
religious groups in the run-up to the House's approval of the
measure in May, by a vote of 237-197, never materialized in the
upper chamber because all sides knew the question in the pro-trade
Senate was never if the measure would pass, only when and by how
much.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters still faced a delicate procedural and political
balancing act in the Senate, where lawmakers zealously guard their
prerogatives and a lone senator has the power to delay the most
popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation said it was essential to press for a
measure free of amendments because, they said, there was not enough
time to reconcile an amended Senate bill with the House version
before Congress adjourned for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had the votes, but what was difficult was that
there was no margin for error in the Senate,'' said Steve
Ricchetti, a deputy White House chief of staff who was Clinton's
point man for the bill in the Senate. ``It had to pass exactly as
it passed out of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   So supporters adopted a low-key strategy aimed at leaching from
Senate consideration all of the volatile politics that enmeshed the
House vote. Tactically, that meant having Clinton project enough
support to show he still cared deeply about the bill, but not
raising the rhetoric high enough to prompt some foe to take the
bill hostage to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's original point man on the bill, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, left the Cabinet in June to head Gore's
presidential election campaign, some supporters fretted that
momentum was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., balked at scheduling a vote
before the July 4 recess, arguing that the Senate had more pressing
business in wrapping up many of the 13 must-pass spending bills
that keep the government running. ``If we go into September, our
chances for passage drop preciptiously,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
the minority leader, warned in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, critics seemed to have a point. Just as the
vote in the House created unusual political alliances between
liberal labor groups and conservative religious organizations in
opposition to the bill, the Senate battle produced odd political
couplings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., perhaps the Senate's most liberal
member, teamed up with Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the chamber's
staunchest conservatives, to back amendments on human rights,
religious freedom and prison labor in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the gloomy predictions proved wrong. Lott and Democrats
agreed in late July to bring the bill up for a final vote after the
five-week summer recess. Despite its long-simmering tensions with
Taiwan, Beijing heeded private warnings from administration
officials to avoid any diplomatic or military provocations that
could fuel opposition to the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill never became the political issue that some
expected, partly because pro-trade Republicans were loath to
antagonize their corporate benefactors in a tight election year,
and labor leaders never believed they could win enough Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, 20 different amendments to improve human
rights, religious freedom and labor standards in China fell by
lopsided votes, not because senators opposed them on merit but
because of their potential harm to the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate awaited the most popular amendment, sponsored by
Thompson and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to penalize Chinese
companies that trafficked in nuclear, chemical, biological weapons
and long-range missiles. The measure struck an especially strong
chord with lawmakers who had grown increasingly alarmed by
intelligence reports of Chinese arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's final vote, all but seven Democrats and eight
Republicans supported the trade bill. Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., who is Gore's running mate, was campaigning in California
and Ohio, and did not vote. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, also did
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement would benefit American business
and values. ``The Senate has cast an epic and overwhelming vote,''
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``By so doing, we bring
China back into the trading system that it helped to establish out
of the ashes of the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents criticized the measure as one that would undercut
America's moral authority in the world, and reward a government
that threatens its neighbors, persecutes its own citizens and sells
advanced weaponry to America's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety and security of the American people come first,''
Helms said. ``That safety and security will be ensured ultimately
not by appeasement, not by the hope of trade at any cost, but by
dealing with communist China without selling out the very moral and
spiritual principles that made America great in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   This year has been the most productive for trade legislation in
nearly a quarter century. In addition to the China bill, lawmakers
approved bills to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration's last major trade victories were
passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which created the World Trade
Organization, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993,
which established duty-free commerce among the United States,
Mexico and Canada.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The question for Gov. George W. Bush came by way of an
e-mail message to Oprah, the queen of confessional television, and
the governor took it head on: what's the public's biggest
misconception of him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on my Daddy's name,'' he answered instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' she prodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if my name was George Jones I'd be a country and
western singer,'' said Bush. ``I've lived with this all my life. Of
course, I love my dad a lot. He's a fabulous man and I'm proud to
be his son.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour on Tuesday, Bush took his turn in Oprah Winfrey's
chair, just a week after Al Gore did, trying to woo her 7 million
daily viewers, most of them women. He gave her a kiss, which Gore
did not. He resisted some of her efforts to force him into
introspection and joked at others. He talked of God and why he
stopped drinking. And his eyes welled up as he spoke of his wife
and the birth of his twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us about a time when you needed forgiveness?'' Winfrey
asked. ``Right now,'' Bush deflected, then added, ``When my heart
turns dark. When I am jealous. Or when I'm spiteful.'' But Oprah
wanted more. ``I'm looking for specifics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are,'' Bush retorted, ``but I'm running for
president.'' The audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to find a way back into the lead in a tight race,
the Texas governor is no longer playing it safe and scripted the
way he did all spring and into the summer. Now, Bush is taking
questions everywhere. Right after he taped Winfrey's show, he
answered the queries of school children at the Beethoven elementary
school in Chicago's South Side, where he promoted his ideas for
bolstering school safety by shielding teachers from lawsuits
resulting from their disciplining of students.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is also seizing television opportunities. He sat for an
interview with Paula Zahn of Fox on Monday. Tuesday he sat not just
for Winfrey but also for Diane Sawyer of ``Good Morning, America.``
On Thursday he will be on ``Regis.'' And the Bush campaign tried to
work out an appearance with David Letterman this week, during
Bush's brief visit to New York City but found out that Letterman
was not taping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bush campaign seemed to get what it wanted from
Winfrey's show. Aides said they were delighted that Bush had the
chance to speak to voters for an hour, ``unfiltered'' by the news
media. Viewers, said Karen Hughes, his chief press aide, ``got to
see the Gov. Bush I know and work with every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, though, tried its best to keep Bush off
balance. Seizing on Bush's comment to Winfrey that ``a leader is
someone who is not afraid to take positions'' it peppered reporters
covering Bush with an instant news release taking issue with a
number of Bush's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey made no secret that she was trying to break through the
``wall'' of sound bites that she said was usually put up by
politicians. So her interview mostly dealt with his biography, not
policy.
</P>
<P>
   She pressed Bush on his father, asking whether he was running to
restore his family's name and legacy. When Bush said he was not,
she wondered whether ``not even in the teeniest tiniest part'' of
himself he was seeking to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the teeniest, tiniest part,'' Bush insisted.
``Basically, what you're saying is, `Are you running to get
revenge?' Revenge is such a negative thought. I'm running for
positive reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked him to talk about his decision to give up drinking at
the age of 40. ``Alcohol was beginning to compete for my
affections,'' Bush said, ``compete for my affections for my wife
and my family. It was beginning to crowd out my energy and I
decided to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey asked if his wife, Laura, had ever given him an
ultimatum. ``I don't think it was quite that,'' Bush said, but he
acknowledged ``she got disappointed some evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't drinking all the time,'' he said, ``But there were
some times when she said, `You need to think about what you're
doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For one moment a heckler tried to shout out a question from the
audience and Winfrey cut him off and moved directly to a commercial
break. She said it was the first heckler in her 15 years of doing
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Winfrey asked Bush to describe a time when he was
overwhelmed with doubt. He recalled going to preparatory school in
the East after a childhood in Texas and in the process seemed to
respond to critics who question whether he is intellectual enough
to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking how brilliant all the other kids were,''
Bush said. ``Eventually, I realized smarts are not only whether or
not you can write well or whether or not you can do calculus, but
smarts also is instinct and judgment and competence.'' He said,
``I've got a lot of experience, I'm well educated. But I'm
certainly not the kind of person who talks down to people because
of my education.''

   WASHINGTON, D.C. _The defense rested its case Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The same group that ranked 30th in the league prior to Monday
night's game in Washington showed a different act. Facing what some
considered a must-win situation, the Cowboys responded with their
best defensive performance of the young season.
</P>
<P>
   The night belonged to linemen Alonzo Spellman and Leon Lett,
linebackers Darren Hambrick and Dexter Coakley, and safeties Darren
Woodson and George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   A team that had trouble tackling in its first two games was
largely responsible for a 27-21 victory over the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to control the run on defense and control the line of
scrimmage on offense,'' Coach Dave Campo said Tuesday. ``That's
something we worked hard at last week. Our guys rose to the
occasion. We eliminated big plays, which was in our favor. Up front
we played very well on both sides of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, rewarded with a game ball after earning his first victory
as a head coach, gave extra credit to the defensive line and
linebackers. They took control of the game by limiting Redskins
running back Stephen Davis to 3.6 yards per carry. The most
important offensive weapon did not have a running play longer than
9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Campo downplayed the perception that it was a must-win game for
the Cowboys, saying, ``That would probably an overstatement,'' he
said. ``I don't consider anything a must-win unless it's the Super
Bowl. You win or you're out. I look at this game as a building
block. We were hoping to get something done quick, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (1-2) made some subtle defensive changes after
losing 32-31 to Arizona 10 days ago. For starters, Spellman
replaced Ebenezer Ekuban at left end because Spellman is better at
run defense.
</P>
<P>
   The line's ability to stuff the run enabled the linebackers and
secondary to stay deeper in the defensive backfield. That rattled
Washington quarterback Brad Johnson, who could not find any
receivers open deep.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson, who usually helps on run support, stayed
back and helped the pass defense instead.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Barron Wortham had seven tackles in his first
start for the Cowboys. He will play at least two more games while
Dat Nguyen recovers from an injury.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the game ended, Washington fans were booing Johnson,
urging the coaches to replace him with veteran Jeff George. This
will be an intense week in Washington for coach Norv Turner, whose
own job security has been questioned, too.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Cowboys, they continue to have a quarterback
controversy of their own. Troy Aikman missed his second straight
game after suffering his ninth career concussion Sept. 3 against
Philadelphia, but he will return Sunday against San Francisco if
he's ready, Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he has not been influenced by backup quarterback
Randall Cunningham's strong performances against Arizona and
Washington. His scrambling ability and leadership have been
instrumental in helping the offense improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Troy's ready to go, he will start, '' Campo stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Aikman's status for the 49ers game is uncertain. For
the third staight week, his availability will not be determined
until a team of physicians evaluates his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Wane McGarity suffered a high ankle sprain but is
expected to be ready for the next game. Receiver Rocket Ismail has
a ``tweak'' in his hamstring but it should not prevent him from
playing, Campo said.

BUSH INCREASES ADVERTISING IN FLORIDA, A SIGN THAT STATE IS IN
PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring how crucial and competitive the race for president
has become in Florida, Gov. George W. Bush and the Republican Party
have vigorously stepped up their advertising efforts in the state
in recent weeks and have outspent the Democrats on television there
by more than $2 million, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   The large Republican expenditure is significant, analysts say,
because polls indicate that the state, viewed as vital to Bush's
chances of winning the presidency, is now a tossup. And though both
parties have been advertising in Florida all summer, it did not
figure prominently in the early calculations about those states
seriously up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by the magnitude of what I saw in Florida,''
said Ken Goldstein, a political science professor at the University
of Wisconsin who is tracking expenditures for political commercials
in the top 75 markets, which encompass 80 percent of the nation's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of Florida's frequent support for Republican
presidential candidates and partly because its governor, Jeb Bush,
is Bush's brother, the state was initially thought to be in the
Republican column.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists on both sides say that where the national parties
and candidates choose to run commercials in heavy rotation often
indicates which states are the most competitive. For much of the
summer, both parties' advertisements have concentrated on 17 to 20
battleground states, including Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also recently ran commercials for about 10 days in North
Carolina, Goldstein and Republicans there say. North Carolina had
been viewed as safe for Bush. ``It's an insurance policy,'' said
Dan Gurley, political director of the North Carolina Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who is analyzing and releasing the advertising data
in a project with the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law, said that the Republicans have ``bought
massively'' in the last two weeks in many contested markets.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising buy in Miami, he said, had created a
particularly sharp disparity between the Bush and Gore campaigns.
The most recent buys have raised the Republicans' expenditures
there to $1.8 million since June, while Vice President Al Gore and
the Democrats have spent just $125,000 in the period.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 14, Bush and the Republican Party spent about $4.8
million in the state, and Gore and the Democrats about $2.7
million. Across the nation, Goldstein said, the increased
Republican spending since the conventions has brought the two
parties to approximate parity. Each side has now spent about $31
million on commercials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were tabulated by the Campaign Media Analysis Group,
a company retained by news organizations and other institutions to
track and calculate the advertising expenditures across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Florida contend that Republicans were caught off
guard by Gore's strong showing in recent polls, and that moves like
his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate
lifted the ticket's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore owns the momentum now in Florida,'' asserted Tony
Welch, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party. ``The language
of this race has changed. It has gone from `Maybe it's in play' to
`Definitely, it's a horse race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials acknowledged they had increased their focus
on Florida. But they maintained that their advertising was a
response to unfair efforts by Gore to alarm Florida voters about
Bush's proposals about health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a swing state, and it's a state in which Al Gore
and other Democrats have reverted to their `Medi-scare' tactics,''
said Clifford D. May, communications director for the Republican
National Committee. ``We will use our resources to tell voters the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   May also contended that the Democrats, for their part, are also
advertising heavily in some states that should be considered
reliable for them, like Washington and Oregon. Both states'
electoral votes went to the Democrats in 1992 and 1996.

 &HT;    Hot-shooting Italians fade, U.S. wins 93-61
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The opponents change, but the results do not.
Inevitably, Team USA's talent, depth, will and defense win out.
Italy was the latest victim.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling to pull away from the physical and feisty
Italians in the first half, the American weighed in after the
break, and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   As much a part of the United States' 93-61 triumph was fatigue.
Italy was enamored with three-point shooting, and the more the U.S.
team ran in fresh bodies in the fast-paced game, the more the
Italians worn down.
</P>
<P>
   Down only 45-35 at halftime, dog-tired Italy found itself
trailing 82-50 with six minutes to play, the result of a
methodical, draining 37-15 U.S. run.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, Italy shot 32.8 percent, which pleased Team USA
because its goal is to hold all opponents under 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' former Hawk guard Steve Smith said. ``They
come out hard and hyped and eventually we just wear them down.
Those jump shots they love, they can't hit because they don't have
the legs.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Knick guard Allan Houston had fresh legs, having missed
the first game with a jammed right wrist. He played against Italy,
and if the results of the three jump shots he took were an
indication, he's just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to sit out that first game, but we had to be
cautious,'' said Houston, who had eight points in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Italy was anything but cautious in the way it opened the game.
There was a lot of pushing and bumping, so much so that U.S. center
Alonzo Mourning (team-high 12 points) had to be calmed down a few
times.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mr. Nice Guy, Smith, had a moment where he was ready to get
busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first play of the game, (Giacomo Galanda) elbowed me,''
Smith said. ``If it was the NBA, I would have elbowed him back. But
we did a great job of just playing and not letting that stuff get
to us.''

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's overwhelming vote on Tuesday to give
permanent trade benefits to China ended a clash between America's
global economic interests and the notion that the United States
could use the annual threat of trade sanctions to change Beijing's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was not even close _ and behind that lies a new
reality in how the United States deals with China, the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge margin by which President Clinton won on
Tuesday _ 83-15, his biggest legislative victory in the foreign
policy arena since the passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993 _ the reversal of policy toward China cemented
into law on Tuesday was hardly assured.
</P>
<P>
   During the past four years alone, it looked like the effort to
normalize trade relations could be derailed by allegations of
Chinese meddling in American elections, by accusations that Chinese
spies had stolen American nuclear secrets, by considerable evidence
that China still ships missiles to Pakistan, by Chinese threats
against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the measure passed on Tuesday despite the State
Department's recent conclusion that China's human rights violations
have, if anything, grown more egregious this year. And it passed
precisely seven weeks before a presidential election, even though
America's labor unions viewed the accord as a threat to their jobs
and strongly hinted they would punish Democrats who supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every time a crisis erupted and receded, China's economic
and political role in the world seemed to loom ever larger, from
Motorola plants in Illinois to farms in Iowa. Over time it became
clear that Congress' periodic threat that it would refuse to renew
China's annual trade status was empty, and the Chinese came to
dismiss it as saber-rattling. Meanwhile, American business became
more energized about stabilizing the U.S. economic relationship
with China _ and thus preserving their ballooning investments there
_ than on any other issue in recent legislative history.
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday senators of every stripe ended up voting for the
trade bill. That included Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who conducted the
campaign finance investigation and last week derided the ``little
people'' in the business community who ``need to be taken down a
notch'' because they orchestrated the defeat of an amendment to the
trade bill that would have punished China for arms proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the hard part starts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments still rage about whether the North American Free Trade
Agreement helped or hurt the booming American economy. In the case
of China, the facts are different: all the trade concessions were
on China's part, the price of entering the World Trade
Organization. Nonetheless, it is only a matter of time before China
begins to drag its heels on carrying them out, for fear that
letting in American steel will wipe out huge state-owned industries
or letting in Japanese and American cars will threaten China's
efforts to become the next industrial behometh.
</P>
<P>
   But the real test will come as America tries to use its
deepening trade relationship as leverage to open China's political
system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won the battle over trade with China by first convincing
himself, and then helping convince Congress, that rejecting normal
economic ties with the world's most populous country would hurt the
American economy, and benefit Japanese and European competitors.
Then he gradually elevated the argument from the economic to the
strategic, making the case that rejection would also help political
hard-liners in China who are certain that America's real agenda is
to contain growing Chinese power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton celebrated his victory on Tuesday with a line he used
often during his efforts to sell the idea of giving permanent trade
benefits to China, telling reporters that ``We will find, I
believe, that America has more influence in China with an
outstretched hand than with a clenched fist.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the next breath, as eager as always to repair the breach
with unions and environmentalists and others who believe they were
sold out by the White House, he insisted that opening China to more
commerce with shrink the control of the government. ``It will
strengthen those within China who fight for higher labor standards,
a cleaner environment, for human rights and the rule of law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will be proven right, maybe not _ it will be years,
maybe decades, before anyone can judge. As Clinton himself
acknowledged on Tuesday, ``None of us should think for a moment
that any of these outcomes are guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the experiment interesting is that only eight
years ago, both the Congress and Clinton were headed in precisely
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when memories of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre were still
vivid, Congress made the annual renewal of China's trading rights
conditional on a range of changes in Beijing. President George Bush
vetoed the measure. The Senate fell just short of the two-thirds
vote needed to override him _ which would have essentially
terminated China's trading privileges with the United States _ by a
vote of 60-38.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Clinton was charging Bush with ``coddling
dictators.'' It was not until he arrived in the White House, and
spent a year unsuccessfully trying to link trade with China's human
rights record, that Clinton ended a fierce fight within the White
House and reversed himself. He became a passionate adherent of
Bush's policy _ and took it several steps further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case where Clinton's new position gathered momentum
slowly,'' said Lee Hamilton, the former congressman from Indiana
who spent much of his career dealing with China issues. ``Tiananmen
seems like a long time ago. Then the business interests started
lobbying this very hard. And good economic times have been a
factor: People are now persuaded that trade has a lot to do with
our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is persuaded, not by a long shot. Those who
voted ``no'' on Tuesday included a hardy band of China's strongest
critics on the left and right, liberals like Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the disillusioned, but resigned, human rights
community. Mike Jendrzejczyk, a top official of Human Rights Watch,
noted that the timing of the vote ``is particularly unfortunate,
just as human rights conditions are worsening. Beijing is closing
down all channels of political dissent _ including the Internet _
even while it is opening its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, who finished
the 13-year-long negotiations with China over the rules under which
it would enter the World Trade Organization, said in an interview
this week that there were two major lessons she learned from the
roller-coaster effort to negotiate the huge accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first is that you need an economic agreement whose
advantages are beyond any doubt,'' she said. But the second
argument, Barshefsky said, is that ``you can only get trade
agreements this big if you put them in a broader security
framework, and link it to the security of the United States, or
peace in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the hallmark of Bill Clinton's foreign
policy: The linkage of trade to broader diplomatic goals.
Essentially, he is betting that China cannot open its markets
without also opening its political system. It cannot let in
Amazon.com, he believes, without also letting any Dissidents.org
broadcast their message around China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership also believes that their entry into the
WTO will bring about change, ushering in foreign technology and
foreign capital. But they think it is change they can manage and
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have come to the conclusion that
globalization is inevitable and China can benefit from it,'' said
Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings Institution,
referring ot China's president and its prime minister, whose
political lives are on the line with this gamble. ``They see real
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, Clinton's legacy is linked to Jiang's and Zhu's.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote has cemented in place the Clinton imprint on
American foreign policy, the use of economic engagement to foster
political change. But the judgment about whether he has created an
opening to China depends, in the end, on what China's leaders do
with the economic and political opportunity.

HONDA WARNS OWNERS OF MORE THAN 500,000 VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Honda Motor Co. on Tuesday became the third major
Japanese company in the last month to issue an extensive product
recall, warning owners of 556,924 vehicles that they might have
potential oil leaks or audio wiring flaws that could cause fires.
</P>
<P>
   The recall was announced against a background of heightened
sensitivity in corporate Japan about defective products. Earlier
this month, the Transport Ministry punished Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
for systematically concealing consumer complaints about its cars
and trucks for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said the recall had no relation to Mitsubishi's scandal,
which resulted in the recall of 1 million Mitsubishi vehicles.
``It's just that the timing of the announcement came at this
moment,'' Honda said through a spokesman. ``It's best to do it
fast, but we had to study and assess the case before submitting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda, the No. 2 Japanese automaker, behind Toyota Motor, said
the recall affected vehicles sold mostly in Japan but included some
Accord models sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company said wiring in audio equipment supplied by Alpine
Electronics for 320,720 of its 1991-97 models that include the
Accord, Prelude and Legend could overheat and cause speakers to
ignite. Eleven instances of flare-ups or burning had been reported
since June but no deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said a defective oil seal that could cause leaks affected
236,214 of its 1993-95 models that include the Odyssey minivan and
the Accord. No deaths or injuries were associated with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls are considered particularly embarrassing to Japanese
manufacturers, historically known for their quality products.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive recalls in particular have been rising in Japan for
years. According to the Ministry of Transport, there were 45
recalls in 1995 involving 150,000 vehicles. By last year, there
were 132 recalls affecting 1.85 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Takaki Nakanishi, an automobile analyst with Merrill Lynch in
Tokyo, said the growth in recalls also reflected efforts by
manufacturers to cut costs. ``They may use the most economic
materials or cut certain phases of physical tests,'' he said. The
surge in recalls, he said, ``are the flip side of the coin.''

AMIRAULT READY TO SEEK A PARDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After nearly 15 years in prison, Gerald Amirault will
stand before the Massachusetts Advisory Board of Pardons Wednesday
morning to argue that he is no danger to society despite being
convicted of molesting children at his family's day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great deal of time,'' said James L. Sultan,
Amirault's attorney. ``We have an obligation to convince the board
by clear and convincing evidence that he's not dangerous. We have
put together a comprehensive release plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said he will tell the board that Amirault has been
interviewed and has a guarantee he will be hired as a shipper
loading crates at the H.P. Hood milk company, that a therapist will
meet with him weekly to help with readjustment, and that 10 of his
former Malden neighbors have written to say that they would welcome
him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel his return to the neighborhood poses absolutely no
danger to anyone,'' Sultan said. ``He'll be living in a very
supportive home environment with his wife of 24 years and his
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at H.P. Hood could not be immediately reached for
comment on the employment arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the board has granted Amirault a hearing, the
first given anyone since 1997, is a significant step, Sultan said.
If the board recommends that Amirault's 30- to 40-year sentence be
commuted, such a recommendation must be approved by Governor Paul
Cellucci and the Governor's Council.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the Advisory Board of Pardons has granted
hearings for only 29 of 250 commutation petitions. The hearings
resulted in 13 favorable recommendations, of which only seven were
granted by the governor and council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an enormous number of letters of support,'' Sultan
said. ``There's not a single communication in opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the attorney said he expects some opponents to speak
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Amirault, 46, has lost three appeals since his conviction in
1986 and is not eligible for parole until 2006. His mother, Violet,
and sister, Cheryl LeFave, were convicted of child sex-abuse
charges in 1987 but were freed on appeal in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Amirault died of cancer three years ago. LeFave's
conviction was reinstated last year by the Supreme Judicial Court,
but prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that she would not be
returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Amirault's lengthy stay in prison, Middlesex District
Attorney Martha Coakley has said she will oppose commutation for
what she considers an ``appropriate'' sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sultan said he is hopeful. ``This entire route of release
is certainly a long shot,'' he said. ``But having achieved a
hearing, we have surmounted a very big hurdle.''

ADVERTISING: FRENCH CONGLOMERATE SPENDING $30 MILLION FOR NAME
RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who _ or what _ is AXA?
</P>
<P>
   It's an invented word, meant to be pronounceable in the
languages of every country where AXA, a huge French financial
services conglomerate, does business. And in the United States,
where the company's American division, AXA Financial Inc., owns
Equitable Life, Alliance Capital Management and Sanford C.
Bernstein, it is also the name that has been given to the financial
planning arm of the company, known as AXA Advisors. AXA Advisors
was created from the retail sales force of Equitable.
</P>
<P>
   The AXA name is not new in the United States. It has been
kicking around for about a year. It was introduced in a series of
advertisements that ``told people who we were,'' said Terrance
Little, vice president for advertising and communications for AXA
Financial. But while brand recognition is far greater than it was,
he said, having last been measured at 20 percent among participants
in a tracking study, most people still do not know anything about
AXA Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that, a new campaign with billings of more than $30
million has just begun on television and in print, where AXA is
``not just telling people who we are, but what we can do for
them,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertisements are running on what he called AXA's
``franchise properties,'' including the CBS College Football
Halftime Report, ``Face the Nation,'' ESPN and CNBC. Print
advertisements will be seen in Fortune, Forbes, Business Week, Golf
Digest and Black Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, created by Seiter &AMP; Miller Advertising in
New York for both broadcast and print, feature eight real financial
planners, culled from among the 7,500 who work for AXA. Each
addresses a specific need a financial planner can help customers
meet: amassing retirement savings, for example, or handing over a
family business to a new generation without losing it to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went all over the county to find these people,'' said Dan
Cole, a senior partner at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the focus on them is ``unique in the industry,'' said
Livingston Miller, a principal of the agency and its creative
director. Other financial planners offer either ``a financial
supermarket'' in their advertisements or place an emphasis on
technology and ``how easy it is to do things online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our model is different,'' Miller said. ``It is a live
human being who takes the time to sit down and talk about what
really underlies financial decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   One such person is Ann Calvert, who addresses the concerns of
women older than 50, like her. In the television spot where she is
featured, she is driving a 1957 Thunderbird convertible, tooling
around a suburban neighborhood: ``Maybe it's death or divorce,''
she says, scarf flapping in the breeze, ``but all of a sudden women
have all kinds of new responsibilities.'' These women, ``suddenly
single,'' need help taking charge of their finances _ help she can
provide, she says. The middle-aged and older women she drives past
seem to agree. They take time from playing catch, changing storm
windows, gardening and washing the car to acknowledge Calvert and
return her waves.
</P>
<P>
   Another AXA adviser is Anthony Padilla, a burly young man seen
lifting weights in a gym who addresses himself to the need for
young people like him to begin accumulating savings,
notwithstanding other, seemingly more pressing needs. And there is
Mike Jarvis, who addresses himself to those potential clients in
their 40s who think they are too far behind to ever have enough for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can show you how to catch up,'' he says, as the spot shows
an overweight child slowly working his way to the front of the pack
in a foot race.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the television commercials, as in the print
advertisements, the spokesmen and spokeswomen for AXA are seen with
building blocks _ bricks, really _ labeled with the AXA logo on
their ends and words like ``Education,'' ``Savings,''
``Protection'' and ``Planning'' on their sides. And in all the
advertisements there is the tag line ``AXA Advisors _ Building
Futures.''
</P>
<P>
   Will all of this play?
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the issue of the name, still largely
unfamiliar. And then there is the fact that, as insurance sellers,
most of the AXA Advisors financial planners used to be paid on
commission. By going to a financial planning model, AXA has changed
their compensation to a percentage of assets under management, the
industry standard. There is risk in that, especially because AXA
Advisors also plans to charge new clients $600 to prepare an
initial financial plan for them, even though many rivals offer such
a service as a free inducement to new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the strategy is a good one, according to Jonathan Joseph,
an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, an investment bank specializing in
banking and insurance. He thinks abandoning the Equitable name was
appropriate; while the change may confuse some potential clients,
it minimizes the less-than-complimentary associations many people
still make when they think of insurance salesmen. And as far as
those salesmen (and saleswomen) are concerned, their new field is a
better _ and broader _ one than the one where they labored before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial planning is really growing today,'' Joseph said.
``It's the place where people in this business have got to be.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush gets emotional with Oprah, in quest for more women voters
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush,
usually averse to public introspection, wiped away a tear Tuesday
as he told Oprah Winfrey that the birth of his twin daughters was
one of the defining moments of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of the twins was an unbelievable moment in our
lives,'' the Texas governor said during an appearance on Winfrey's
syndicated television show.
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong interview, Bush also spoke about his parents,
his family, his faith and his decision to give up drinking at age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey's questions were designed to give her 7 million viewers,
mostly women, a window into Bush's personality. The governor often
answered with quips or personal reminiscences, but also looked for
opportunities to advance his campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes he is smarter than most people but tries
not to show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't inspire and unite by thinking you're smarter than
everyone else,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told Winfrey that one of the biggest misconceptions about
him is that he is ``running on my daddy's name'' or to avenge the
1992 re-election defeat suffered by his father, former President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenge is such a negative thought. I'm running for positive
reasons,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance is part of Bush's effort to regain support from
women in his contest against his Democratic rival, Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought to attract women voters by portraying himself as
a different kind of Republican, what he calls a compassionate
conservative who wants to help the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead Bush held with women evaporated last month as Gore
honed an image as a candidate with character who cares about
working people.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll done Sept. 4-10 for CNN/USA Today found Gore
leading among women 54 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance on Winfrey's show last week was almost a
love-fest, with the talk show host twice playing video of Gore
kissing his wife Tipper at the Democratic National Convention. But
Winfrey also joked with Gore that he did not kiss her as he came
onto the set of her show. Bush gave Winfrey a quick kiss Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is not concerned about how tight the race has
become, though ``it's tight enough to give me white hair.''
</P>
<P>
   While Winfrey tried to give her viewers an in-depth look at
Bush, he sometimes kept his personal shield up.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked about when he has needed forgiveness, Bush said,
``Right now.'' She pressed for an example, and he replied, ``When
my heart turns dark. When I am jealous or when I am spiteful.''
Winfrey pressed in, saying she was looking for a specific incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you are, but I'm running for president,'' Bush said, to
laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about rumors and gossip. I've revealed a lot about
myself in the campaign. I've said I'm a sinner who sought
redemption and found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he never thought about running for president when he
was growing up. ``I didn't think about it when I was in college.
Maybe I'd have behaved a little better if I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 54, retold the story of how he decided to quit drinking
after a heavy night of partying in Colorado Springs, Colo., to
celebrate his 40th birthday. But he also admitted that his wife,
Laura, had been pressuring him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it never got to the point where Laura said, ``It's you
or Jack Daniels,'' but he said she ``got disappointed some
evenings. ... There were some times where she said, `You need to
think about what you are doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Winfrey's viewers learned that Bush likes
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on white bread; that his
favorite fast food is tacos; and that he runs a 71/2-minute mile,
three miles a day every day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his favorite song is Wake up Little Susie, saying at
first it was by Buddy Holly, but then correcting himself and
identifying the artists as the Everly Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When Winfrey asked for his favorite dream, Bush raised his right
hand as if being sworn into office and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   A man in the audience briefly tried to interrupt Bush, but
Winfrey cut the heckler off and broke for a commercial so he could
be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the questioning, Bush repeatedly tried to emphasize
his issues. He won loud applause from the audience when he told a
25-year-old woman that his plans for using the federal budget
surplus would help her by giving her a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made campaign appearances in Chicago and Kentucky on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to appear on Regis Philbin's ``Live! With
Regis'' show in New York Thursday. He also has been invited to
visit ``The Late Show with David Letterman,'' as Gore did last
week, but Letterman is not taping during Bush's New York swing this
week.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    More residents of U.S. return 2000 census forms than in 1990
 &HT;

 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reversing a long slide in participation, more
residents of the United States returned census forms this year than
they did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans responded to census questionnaires by
mail, telephone or the Internet this year, two percent more than 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris County and Houston, census officials said, the number
of people participating in this year's national headcount increased
by five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That result halts a ... slide and actually begins to reverse
it,'' said Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, whose agency
oversees the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, participation in the census _ which is largely
conducted by mail _ has declined steadily since 1970, when 78
percent of Americans responded. Seventy-five percent of the
nation's residents participated in 1980, and 65 percent returned
their questionnaires in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt credited the turn-around
to the agency's extensive outreach effort, which included its
first-ever paid advertising campaign, to sell the importance of the
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 2000, the prediction was that (the response) would only be
61 percent,'' Prewitt said. ``In this context, the 67 percent
response rate is an unexpected, extraordinary public achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said a preliminary analysis indicates that many areas
with high minority populations made big improvements from the 1990
census. ``Minority areas ... improved more substantially than some
of the white areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the states, Iowa posted a response rate of 76 percent. In
14 states, the response rate was 70 percent or higher. In Texas, 64
percent of residents returned their questionnaires, up from 61
percent 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, 61 percent of residents responded to the census
questionnaire, up from 56 percent in 1990. The response rate in
Harris County, which includes Houston, was 64 percent this year, up
from 59 percent 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau _ which expects to report national and state
population totals by the end of December _ is completing its
follow-up visits to households where no one returned the agency's
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   A tabulation of the nation's population must be delivered to
President Clinton by Dec. 31. The figures are used to reapportion
the 435 seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the headcount provides the basis for allocating
money to the states under various federal programs. Whether the
tabulation is adjusted by using a statistical method known as
``sampling'' is under examination by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau plans to adjust the head count after surveying
314,000 households. The adjusted figures are due on April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of statistical sampling assert that it helps for
people missed in prior counts, especially the poor, minorities and
inner-city residents. These groups generally vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling, mostly Republicans, argue that only the
actually headcount made every 10 years is accurate. Other methods,
opponents say, should not be used for reapportionment, allocating
federal funds or helping state and local officials redraw various
district boundaries to adjust for population shifts.

   PAKISTAN: FATAL EXPLOSION
</P>

   A bomb placed in a crate of grapes exploded in a vegetable
market in the capital, Islamabad, killing 16 and wounding at least
75, the police said. No one took responsibility for the blast,
which the country's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, called a

   RUSSIA: INVESTIGATION OF MEDIA GROUP

<P>
   The prosecutor general's office began an inquiry into the
newspaper and broadcasting business of Vladimir Gusinsky, as the
conflict between Gusinsky and his largest creditor intensified. The
creditor, the gas giant Gazprom, which is partly owned by the
government, said it would take the dispute to court after Gusinsky
reneged on a secret agreement signed in July to sell his company,
Media-Most. On Monday, Gazprom asked the prosecutor's office to
investigate Gusinsky's business, particularly its charge that
Gusinsky moved parts of his company offshore to evade creditors.

<P>
   Two Italians announced that they had identified the remains of
Giotto, the early Renaissance painter, which were discovered 30
years ago in the crypt beneath Florence's Duomo during excavation
work. Some scholars suspected that the painter, who died in 1337,
might have been buried in the cathedral. Using modern forensic
tools, the two men, a journalist and an anthropologist, partly
reconstructed his cranium, and said it bore a striking resemblance
to a self-portrait in Giotto's ``Last Judgment'' fresco in the
Scrovegni chapel in Padua.

 &HT;    Tribute, monument talk honor Coverdell
 &HT;    By Melanie Eversley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tuesday was a day for remembering Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning memorial service, members of the Peace Corps
praised their former leader as a gentleman who believed education
was key to helping developing countries. The late Republican
senator from Georgia headed the agency from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, four senators, including Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.),
met for the first time Tuesday morning to discuss plans for
building monuments to Coverdell in Washington and in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell died on July 18 following surgery after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour program at Peace Corps headquarters drew several
people from Georgia, including Nancy Coverdell, the senator's
widow; Reps. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both Georgia
Republicans; and Miller, appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes to serve in
Coverdell's place until the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers lauded Coverdell for bringing more women into the
management ranks of the agency, initiating Peace Corps programs in
Zimbabwe and Mongolia, expanding programs in Central and Eastern
Europe after the Cold War, and reopening programs in troubled
places such as Haiti, Nicaragua and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Olsen, Peace Corps chief of staff under Coverdell, recalled
the words of the Polish deputy minister of education, one year
after Coverdell had promised and sent 100 English teachers to the
country. The minister addressed a Peace Corps meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ```He kept his word, and in doing so, he gave me courage when I
had none,''' Olsen recalled the minister saying.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at Tuesday's event also praised Coverdell's creation of
the program World Wise Schools, in which Peace Corps volunteers
share their experiences with U.S. schoolchildren, helping the
youngsters understand other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers announced the agency also will name a new, annual
award in Coverdell's name. The Paul Coverdell Award for Excellence
in Education will go to three educators who best embody the values
of international education and cross-cultural understanding in the
World Wise Schools program.
</P>
<P>
   ``His deep and abiding commitment to Peace Corps volunteers and
to the history, values and traditions of this extraordinary
organization stands as a model for all of us to follow, and it is
one that we will never forget,'' Peace Corps director Mark
Schneider told the audience of about 200.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a statement, praising Coverdell for
pioneering work that fostered better global understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as he recognized the benefits Peace Corps volunteers
brought to the countries they served, he also believed that the
greatest benefits would be felt here at home _ in the understanding
that stretches across barriers of language and geography, that is
felt through the letters sent home, the photos shared, the
experiences remembered,'' the president wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been planning such a memorial since Coverdell's
death, but Tuesday was the first day that Congress members, Nancy
Coverdell and others who wanted to attend were available to take
part, said Eileen Cassidy, Peace Corps press director.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Coverdell monuments, plans are in the very
preliminary stages, but one item the committee members discussed is
the possibility of erecting memorials in Georgia and in the
nation's capital, Miller said. The other committee members are
Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Mike DeWine
(R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the group decides, it will be up to Nancy Coverdell to
give final approval, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss said the funds for the monuments would most likely
come from a mix of private and public funds.

 &HT;    Buzek seeks consistency
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petr Buzek's fall last season did not have the impact of his
infamous car accident five years ago. A collision with a tree on a
windy road in the Czech Republic caused Buzek extensive damage. But
memories of hitting bottom last year linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two months, I think I played great,'' the Thrashers'
second-year defenseman said. ``After that, I don't know what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzek said, ``It was hard, not just on me but everybody, when
you're losing every night. Sometimes, you want to play your best
but you can't. In your head, you're telling yourself what you want
to do, but you can't play your best. But I went through it, and I
learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie was perhaps the team's best player for the first two
months of the season. But his play dropped off dramatically and
coach Curt Fraser benched him periodically. The two biggest factors
were typical rookie malaise and a crash into the boards in Montreal
in November. The latter left Buzek with a concussion and a sore
shoulder that lingered the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when (rookies) come into camp, it's all emotion,''
Fraser said. ``The adrenaline is pumping, and they're playing hard
every shift, trying to make the team. Then, when they do make the
team, all that disappears. You have to work hard to get back to
where you started at.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Don Waddell took Buzek from the Dallas system in
the expansion draft. ``He was playing so much the first two months
of the season that when he hit a wall physically, it also hit him
mentally,'' Waddell said. ``He went in the other direction for a
couple of months, and he lost some confidence and some of the
emotion of being a first-year NHL player. He can't play that way.
He has to play with a lot of jam and a lot of emotion every night
to be successful. He's a contact person; he has to make contact.
When he stops doing those little things, he'll revert to being a
very ordinary player.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell also said that after Buzek was named to the World team
for the All-Star Game, he got caught too often trying to make the
big ``All-Star'' type play. ``He's got to make sure he does what
got him here _ finishing checks, playing the man, moving the
puck,'' Waddell said. ``Don't worry about joining the rush unless
the opportunity presents itself. Those are the things he did for
the first two months.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Buzek looked strong on the Czech Republic's
gold-medal-winning team in the World Championships, where he was
paired with Thrashers teammate Frantisek Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awesome,'' Buzek said. ``It's like fighting for your
country. It's a great feeling. You win the game, and you're
standing on the blue line, and they're playing your national
anthem. When you go home, you're heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzek signed just days before training camp, the team's last
restricted free agent to come to terms. He did not want to take a
chance on alienating his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to miss any minute of the training camp,'' he
said. ``I wanted to be here from the first minute to the end. This
is a team sport and we're like family. If you're late, it's not
like you're doing everything for the team. I wanted to fight for
them and be here on time. I didn't want to come here after training
camp, like a big shot.''

 &HT;    U.S., Australia create greatest wake in swimming history
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - The American swimmer rises before dawn in anonymity.
From there, the crowd dwindles.
</P>
<P>
   The American swimmer does the requisite five hours a day in the
pool, turning out laps like Dale Earnhardt and getting bleached out
like June Cleaver's white load. Then comes the dry land work,
weights and stretching and whatnot. So much time and most of the
body hair, pfffft. For what? A smattering of applause every four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we're getting our swimmers to bring boyfriends and
girlfriends to fill out the (home crowds),'' said Jack Bauerle, the
Georgia coach here at the Olympics to assist the women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Then the American swimmer comes to Australia, and finds the flip
side. Acclaim, fame, crowds that treat the 4x200-meter relay as if
N Synch just showed up in Speedos. They've turned a 17-year-old
into such an icon that I expect to see Ian Thorpe's face on the
next golden $2 coin I'm handed.
</P>
<P>
   The American swimmer must wonder if there hasn't been some awful
freak chlorine explosion, and this is heaven.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days in Sydney, the U.S. swim team will be allowed a
glimpse at what it would be like if their sport torched the
passions of the home crowd. Every night, 17,500 fans singing,
cheering and generally making like this is some wet World Cup. What
the Americans have seen so far at the Olympic pool blows the swim
caps right off their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor for us to be here,'' said one of their leading
stars, Tom Dolan. ``(Swimmers) are way down on the ladder of
popularity, so it's great for us to come over here where the
swimming is the No. 1 sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in Athens, Bauerle knows a little something about
fanaticism. Where he's from, they bark. Over here, they chant,
``Aussie, Aussie, Aussie. Oi, Oi, Oi!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Olympic swim hall) is absolutely bonkers,'' Bauerle said.
``You think you're sitting in a football stadium. They are so avid
about swimming. They even know the heights and weights of swimmers,
about like we think of football.''
</P>
<P>
   So frantic is the the setting that the U.S. coaches find
themselves actually trying to rein in their swimmers for fear that
they'll be swept away in a tidal surge of adrenaline. ``We try to
tell them not to use up too much energy, make sure they don't get
too excited. The energy of the place will carry them through the
first 25 meters,'' Bauerle said.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so temporary. For even as they are halfway through
perhaps the greatest swim meet ever held, the folks back home are
busy getting their NFL fantasy teams squared away for Week Three.
</P>
<P>
   If only we could get Larry Munson over here growling, ``Look at
the world records falling from the sky!'' Ten of them so far. The
100-meter men's freestyle record has been reduced more often than
Oprah, and they still haven't run the finals of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the technical stuff and the addition of the
new slick speed suits, there is only one other physical explanation
that I can come up with: They must have built the pool downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say just the scene is worth several tenths of a
second, regardless of what colors you wear.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers swear that even if they are up to their eyebrows in
boiling water, they can pick up the general tone of the crowd.
Here, ``It's like being at a baseball game,'' said Kyle Salyards, a
Georgia signee who has moved on to the 200-meter breaststroke
final. ``There is a roar you can hear, especially the last 50
meters. I know it helped me at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that support, I wouldn't be at this stage now,''
Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
   This water park is pure magic. ``Nothing even close to it,''
Bauerle said. He can point to the phenomenal first day when five
records fell in four events, when the Aussie and American men
dueled in a classic 4x100-meter relay during which, the coach said,
``I couldn't even hear myself yell.''
</P>
<P>
   Day Four was almost as charged, and like the opening, it
climaxed in a relay. The Aussies sent out Man 'O War (Thorpe) and
Secretariat (Michael Klim) on the first two legs of the 4x200-meter
relay and predictably fried the world and its standing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are from the land Down Under!'' the stands sang in perfect
unison during the party that ensued, emphasizing that part of the
old Men at Work song.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely compelling swimming (there's a underused phrase). And
a captivating scene.
</P>
<P>
   The American swimmer doesn't know that kind of validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps us swim faster to know that we're going to the meet
where we're going to be the No. 1 show,'' Dolan said. ``The pool
will be packed every night and this meet will be the biggest thing
the Olympics has to offer here in Sydney. That only motivates us
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The track people may have something to say about that claim, but
they better run awfully fast if they want to put up an argument.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. swimmers will take their share of precious medals away
from this meet. But it will be a larger victory if the team comes
home with all the members it left with. Once allowed into heaven,
who wants to go back?

BUSINESS TRAVEL: A KILLING ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, The Associated Press sent out a short report
datelined Salt Lake City that began with this astounding sentence:
``A passenger who tried to break into the cockpit during a
Southwest Airlines flight was killed by other passengers who
restrained him, and not by a heart attack, an autopsy has
concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   The report didn't get much attention nationally, even though it
drastically revised initial accounts of the Aug. 11 incident, which
said that the unruly passenger had died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the updated news story, you might have the same reaction
as I did, to wit: Excuse me? Passengers on a domestic airline
 &UR; killed &LR;  someone in mid-August? And we're just now hearing about
it?
</P>
<P>
   If this had happened on a city street, there would be a clamor
for the facts. But it happened in the isolated, tightly controlled
environment of an airplane. In that case, and given that the death
has been ruled a homicide, do the authorities and the airline have
a duty to fully inform the public about the circumstances in which
19-year-old Jonathan Burton was beaten, choked and killed aboard
Southwest Airlines Flight 1763 from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City on
Aug. 11?
</P>
<P>
   No, say Southwest Airlines and the federal law enforcement
authorities who investigated the homicide and decided it didn't
warrant criminal prosecution. They are refusing to disclose exactly
what happened on that one-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers are among those frequent fliers who are
considered most likely to ultimately witness an incident of ``air
rage,'' a loosely defined category that can include anything from
an angry verbal exchange with a crew member to a berserk
passenger's attempt to break into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any question that the incident was a serious one, or
that some passengers and crew members believed that Burton was
acting in a dangerous manner that justified their attempts to
physically restrain him until the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are facts that aren't in dispute: Burton, of Las Vegas, was
flying to Salt Lake City to visit a relative when he became
involved in an argument with a flight attendant. The situation
deteriorated. A group of about eight people on board the plane
wrestled with him and restrained him. He died of asphyxiation, an
autopsy found. His body had multiple bruises and contusions on the
chest, legs, arms and face.
</P>
<P>
   After the autopsy, the Utah state medical examiner ruled the
death a homicide, defined as an intentional act that causes
another's death. Subsequently, the United States attorney's office
in Salt Lake City decided that there was no evidence of criminal
intent, and declined to bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The dead man's mother, Janet Burton, didn't know that her son
had been suffocated until she obtained the autopsy report last
week, said Kent W. Spence, a lawyer who is representing the family.
Spence, who said he had been unable to interview witnesses or get
an account of the incident from authorities, said that the dead man
had no history of violence, had not been in trouble previously and
was not known to be suffering from any physical or mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read an autopsy that says he was placed face down in
the aisle, with compression of the neck and torso by multiple
individuals; when I read about abrasions of the neck, soft-tissue
hemorrhage around the left carotid artery, blunt-force injuries of
the face and extremities _ that sounds to me like somebody who got
the heck beat out of them,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense to me, under any circumstances,
that someone has to die in a situation like this, even if they
needed restraint,'' he said. ``I don't have any evidence that he
needed restraint, but even if that was the case, especially since
there were so many people apparently involved, couldn't they have
restrained him without standing on his neck and choking the life
out of him? Couldn't Southwest Airlines' flight attendants see that
he was unable to breathe and that somebody needed to step in there
and say, `get off this guy, let him breathe, he's turning blue'?''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines said its employees acted responsibly in a
very difficult situation. ``We stand behind the conduct and actions
of our flight crew, and we understand and appreciate the feelings
of the passengers on board, including those who took steps to
protect themselves and others,'' said Linda Rutherford, a
spokeswoman. ``We believe the decision of the U.S. attorney's
office not to pursue charges against anyone involved is a good and
correct one in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``several'' passengers were involved in
restraining Burton, who she said ``assaulted a couple of
passengers'' in the aisle. ``This was a stressful situation
resulting from Burton's repeated attempts to kick through the
cockpit door,'' she said. ``The lives of 137 people were in the
balance.'' She would not discuss any further details.
</P>
<P>
   Spence stressed that he wasn't making judgments on the case
because he didn't have the facts. But serious questions ought to be
answered, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did this end up as a killing?'' he asked. ``Strangulation
is a slow process, a slow death. What happened? Why won't they just
come out and tell us what the facts are? The truth is the truth.
Whether there's a potential civil lawsuit or not, why not just let
the facts out to fall where they may?''

 &HT;    Role of Internet not yet living up to billing
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Mark Moore plans to revolutionize the way wholesalers
buy and sell food.
</P>
<P>
   His Internet marketplace, GlobalFoodExchange.com, will reduce
companies' inventory, guarantee freshness and save both buyers and
sellers a bunch of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after Moore founded his company and six months
after he snagged $13 million in venture capital, the vast majority
of transactions in the $800 billion food industry still are done
the old-fashioned way _ with salespeople. GlobalFoodExchange is
doing just ``hundreds'' of transactions per month, Moore said.
Still, GlobalFoodExchange and its many competitors believe the
future of food is online.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in almost every industry, the visionaries believe that
streamlining buying, selling and other business functions by using
the Internet is the way to save millions of dollars. Those dollars,
the theory goes, drop right to the bottom line. That streamlining
cuts the cost of doing business and is the great promise of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fulfillment of that promise is taking longer to realize
than anyone thought it would a year ago, when so-called
business-to-business Internet companies were popping up in every
industry sector. They were collecting and spending venture capital
at a furious pace. The future looked great. The markets were kind.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now the markets have soured, the venture
capitalists have become more conservative and the big clients are
thinking longer and harder about where and how to spend their
Internet-aimed dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the promise of the Internet is still greasing the wheels of
a torrid economy, but the whole process is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``B-to-b is evolving ... the models are still being figured
out,'' said Martin Tilson, a lawyer at Kilpatrick Stockton who
works with a number of business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   There likely will be consolidations because some industries _
such as food _ have tons of players.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he has already seen GlobalFoodExchange's competition
drop from 20 companies to about six. He attributes the drop to ``a
combination of consolidation and erosion.'' Some companies have
merged, some have gone under and some have narrowed their focus so
that they no longer compete with GlobalFoodExchange, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, start-ups were launching the marketplaces.
Companies such as GlobalFoodExchange raised venture capital and set
about luring traditional companies to the sites as buyers and
sellers. But there is a new trend of ``old economy'' companies
banding together to form their own marketplaces and bypass the
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of such consortia in Atlanta. Some large
chemical companies including BASF, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and
Ticona/Celanese launched Omnexus, which is housed in Andersen
Consulting's incubator. In another example, Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
International Paper and Weyerhaeuser Co. are launching
forestexpress.com here.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows for sure which business model _ start-up or
consortium of older companies _ will work better. Although the
companies started by industry leaders have access to lots of supply
and capital right away, there are problems with longtime
competitors working together. Plus, big companies aren't used to
moving at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consortia don't realize how difficult this is, the
technical issues, the financing issues, the staffing issues,'' said
Mike Dowdle, who heads the venture program at iXL and works with a
number of young business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dowdle predicted that in some industries the start-ups and
consortia may join forces. ``We are going to see more partnering,
acquiring, merging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors, hot for business-to-business six months
ago, have cooled. Faring only slightly better with investors than
business-to-business marketplaces are application service
providers. An ASP hosts software on a server and then ``rents'' it
to companies that don't want to pay a big upfront fee to buy the
software and/or have to fool with maintaining the software.
Customers access the software through the Internet, typically
paying either a monthly fee or a fee for every transaction done
with the software.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is home to a handful of application service providers,
which provide everything from employee benefits information for
small businesses to desktop applications for attorneys. One local
company, ePanacea, which grouped together ASPs and sold the
services to companies, recently ran out of money. Unable to raise
more, it closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The b-to-b world has taken longer to pan out than investors
thought it would, in terms of people getting customers, in terms of
people generating revenue, in terms of people hitting milestones,''
said Ed McCrady, a banker at Robertson Stephens who raises capital
for technology companies. ``Now, investors are realizing this could
be a 10- to 15-year process, not a 10- to 15-month process, like
some people thought in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneurs, some of whom list the local venture
capital scene as the biggest drawback to starting a company here,
may be particularly frustrated by the lack of available funding.
</P>
<P>
   The city is not home to any huge venture capital funds.
Noro-Moseley Partners recently raised a $320 million fund, the
largest ever for the city but still nowhere near the billion-dollar
funds in Silicon Valley, New York and Boston. Because the funds
here are small, a local venture capitalist is more likely to invest
$2 million to $5 million instead of $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, local investors are more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who is raising his second round of financing, said local
investors are scared to take a chance on a company such as
GlobalFoodExchange that is still losing lots of money. His
investors will be from outside Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (local) venture capital community is waiting for
significant revenue to invest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen See, president of technology marketing firm Abovo
Marketing, has 20 clients. Most get their first rounds of capital
locally but look elsewhere for the second _ and larger _ round of
funding, she said. She said Atlanta is known on the West Coast for
its ``chicken money. Everyone is chicken to put in the big
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Though venture capital may be a weak spot, Atlanta has plenty of
bright spots for business-to-business companies. Perhaps Atlanta's
biggest selling point, ironically, is its ``old economy'' companies
_ ones like Georgia-Pacific, United Parcel Service, BellSouth and
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Atlanta is more conducive to
business-to-business than Silicon Valley, which is surrounded by
the software industry. It isn't in tune with corporate America,''
said Moore, who has been able to find plenty of food industry
experts to hire in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta executives are used to selling inside big companies and
have key contacts, Dowdle said. ``You've got to have experienced
people who know how to work the hallways of the big, big
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, like other so-called technology cities, has the
infrastructure to help business-to-business companies get off the
ground: attorneys who are used to dealing with start-ups; real
estate brokers who know how to work a lease for high-risk,
fast-growing company; a network of angel investors and venture
capitalists; and Internet consulting companies that help companies
figure out an Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other bright spots are a relatively low cost of living, a strong
fiber network and an airport that makes traveling around the world
relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released as part of its January investors'
conference, Atlanta-based investment bank Robinson-Humphrey Co. set
out broad claims for ``Netlanta,'' arguing that Atlanta has
mimicked Silicon Valley in five critical ways: universities,
research, industry leadership, venture capital and culture. While
metro Atlanta cannot match the magnitude of the Valley forces, it
has assembled the same equation in smaller doses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Omnexus and other companies that have recently
chosen to put headquarters in Atlanta, Tilson said, ``Atlanta is
being seen as a great place to start a business-to-business
company.''

 &HT;    Georgia Tech linebacker Smith already thriving in key role
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - On signing day in February, Georgia Tech drew
attention when it posted its linebacker list on the board in Edge
Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hobie Holiday, 6 feet 4 and 245 pounds from Warner Robins'
Houston County, was the centerpiece of the class. The Parade
Magazine All-American was on the top of everybody's recruiting
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Keyaron Fox, the MVP in the Georgia-Florida All-Star game, also
was on the list of almost every major program.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Daryl Smith. A well-credentialed prep player
in his own right, Smith lacked the bulging portfolios of the other
two.
</P>
<P>
   So much for portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is one of only two Yellow Jacket freshmen to see
significant playing time this season. He and defensive back
Jonathan Cox will start Thursday night's game against North
Carolina State in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has moved steadily up the depth chart. He started out
behind sophomore Matt Miller at middle linebacker and saw limited
action in Tech's opener against Central Florida. Smith played more
against Florida State and then started last week's 40-13 blowout of
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   His progress also is reflected on the tackles charts: Central
Florida, four tackles, one for a 4-yard loss; Florida State, seven
tackles, one for an 8-yard loss, one sack; Navy, 10 tackles, two
for a total loss of 7 yards, one sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has are good instincts,'' said Ted Roof, Tech
defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. ``He keeps his feet
moving, and his feet don't stop at contact and that's why he knocks
people back. Daryl's just got an incredibly good nose for the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his early success stems from loving his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like hitting people,'' he said. ``I just lay them out.
I like having people feel like they can do something with the ball
and then showing them that they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Roof said his star pupil has attributes that can't be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to shake hands with him,'' said Roof, a former Tech
linebacker. ``He's got hands of steel, really powerful hands, and
he can disengage from the offensive linemen. But he's such a good
person and comes from such a great family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentally and physically, Smith, at 6-2, 225 pounds, is a good
fit for middle linebacker. But he is being deployed much the way
the Jackets used former star Keith Brooking. He is capable of
playing both inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great flexibility,'' Roof said. ``He's doing a lot of
things for us, and we're asking a lot of a kid to learn all of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, Smith was preparing to play Colquitt
County. But the Dougherty County grad will be a central figure
Thursday night in the Jackets' nationally televised conference
game. However, that prospect doesn't seem to faze him. In fact, he
didn't even tell his parents he was starting against Navy; he just
let them see from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good for what's going on,'' he said. ``I've got a good
feel for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daryl has the knack of staying in a good football position,''
coach George O'Leary said. ``He stays low, and he's just got a
knack for finding the ball. He has football savvy and can play the
run as well as the pass. He plays inside and out. He's progressed
further as a freshman than any defensive player we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Instincts definitely are part of Smith's gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the offensive play, and you just have a feel for
what's coming,'' he said. ``Speed is the biggest thing in going
from high school to college. The actual playing is pretty easy.
Learning the defense was hard at first, like during the summer, but
now I'm enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Holiday and Fox have played, but their appearances have
been mostly on special teams and in specific situations. Holiday
has been used at linebacker as well as a defensive lineman. Fox had
seven stops against Navy, mostly in the late going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be together soon,'' Smith said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Face to face with 300 of their most
generous contributors on Monday night, Vice President Al Gore and
Sen. Joseph Lieberman muted their criticism of the entertainment
industry as they sought to reassure Hollywood that their calls for
stricter marketing practices were not an attempt to squelch
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will nudge you,'' Lieberman, the vice presidential nominee,
said gently. ``But we will never become censors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Lieberman
added. ``We're both fans of the products that come out of the
entertainment industry _ not all of them, but a lot of them. And
the industry has entertained and inspired and educated us over the
years. And it's true from time to time we will have been, will be,
critics, or nudges, but I promise you this: We will never never put
the government in the position of telling you by law, through law,
what to make.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Gore spoke from a stage set up in a huge white tent on
the fairway-sized lawn of Ron Burkle, a supermarket magnate and
longtime Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of Southern California moguls, magnates and marquee
names responded by giving $4.2 million to the Democratic National
Committee, a record amount for a political fundraising dinner at a
private home. Among the guests were the actors Tom Hanks and Dustin
Hoffman; the studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg of Dreamworks,
Alan Horn of Warner Brothers and Robert K. Shaye of New Line
Cinema; and the comedians Garry Shandling, Paul Reiser and Larry
David.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was a bit more circumspect than Lieberman in his comments,
praising Rob Reiner, the director, for paving the way for their
visit and referring obliquely to ``the controversy of the previous
week.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``controversy'' was the threat by Gore and Lieberman that
if industry executives did not ``clean up their act'' within six
months on marketing violent movies, music and video games to
children, Gore would seek sanctions through legislation or
regulatory action against the industry for deceptive advertising
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that we feel strongly about the responsibility that
the entertainment industries need to take when it comes to
marketing inappropriate material to children,'' Gore said. ``Joe
and I believe this very deeply. And if I'm entrusted with the
presidency, we're going to fight to change that. And I know a lot
of you will be standing with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner, who has worked assiduously on Gore's behalf and
helped organize the fund-raiser, delivered a similar message. ``We
don't only have our parochial interests at heart,'' Reiner told the
contributors, with Gore seated nearby. ``We care about the same
things that all Americans care about _ we care about making sure
our children get a good education, we care about making sure that
we have health care. We care about a woman's right to choose, about
protecting the environment and making sure that we have meaningful
gun-control laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore and Lieberman began their push just over a week ago,
they have been harshly attacked by their Republican opponents as
hypocrites for chastising Hollywood by day and taking its money by
night. Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said
that the vice president was raising ``millions of dollars from the
same media moguls who are corrupting our children.'' The
entertainment industry is the fifth-biggest contributor to
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Gore campaign said there was no mystery about
what Gore and Lieberman believe. ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will
not hesitate to tell their friends and supporters when they're
wrong,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore. ``This message
has been consistently delivered loud and clear. Just because they
went to the event doesn't obscure the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke at length to the audience, but mainly stayed clear of
the entertainment industry issue. He mentioned his support for
abortion rights three times and emphasized that the next president
would appoint three or four new justices to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And as a student of stagecraft, he could not help but comment on
an earlier moment in the evening, when Carl and Rob Reiner, father
and son, crossing each other on stage, had embraced and kissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidentally,'' Gore said, ``the only thing I would change -
when you two kissed up here? You might want to hold that a little
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed tonight to another fundraising dinner, this one
in Silicon Valley, where he was expected to raise more than $3
million.

PLAN TO COMPENSATE NUCLEAR WORKERS IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An administration plan to compensate private-sector
workers who were made sick by exposure to hazardous chemicals or
radiation while building nuclear weapons may fall victim to a
jurisdictional dispute, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   A provision that would authorize compensation passed the Senate
on a voice vote, as part of the Defense Authorization bill, but
there was no similar provision in the House legislation, so the
issue is now before a House-Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement in the conference committee has been held up because
the Senate bill calls for the program to be administered by the
Labor Department, but members of the House Judiciary Committee want
it channeled through a Justice Department office that also handles
radiation claims against the government arising from nuclear
weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would cover thousands of people who worked for
private contractors on weapons projects. Nearly all are ineligible
for workers' compensation because their illnesses developed years
or decades after their exposures, according to the Energy
Department. The department acknowledged earlier this year that
hundreds of workers had a lung illness that could have been caused
only by their work on nuclear weapons components.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department says the Senate version of the program
would cost about $1.8 billion in the first five years, and less
thereafter. It would provide each worker with reimbursement for
lost wages or $200,000, whichever is larger, plus health care
expenses. The Senate provision, though, is only an authorization,
not an appropriation, leaving it to a future Congress to provide
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee favors a package modeled after the one
already on the books for uranium miners and people who were exposed
to fallout for weapons tests, which offers $100,000 per victim.
Among the issues before the conferees is why one group of victims
should be compensated more generously than another. It plans
hearings on Thursday, although the issue could be decided by
conferees on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred four members of the House, many with victims in
their districts, wrote to the conferees asking them to adopt the
Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Kanjorski, D-Pa., whose district includes a defunct
plant where workers were exposed to beryllium and where some now
suffer a debilitating lung disease as a result, said he was
``cautiously optimistic'' that the Senate version would be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alvarez, a former Energy Department official who is now a
consultant for a union representing some of the workers, said the
House program amounted to an ``apology payment'' as opposed to
reimbursement for losses, because it does not offer reimbursement
for lost wages.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson early this year became the
first head of that agency to acknowledge that weapons manufacture
had sickened or killed some of the 600,000 people who have worked
in the plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent on Monday to Floyd Spence, the chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, he said: ``The men and women who
worked for the Department of Energy and served our nation in the
nuclear weapons industries of World War II and the Cold War labored
under difficult and dangerous conditions with some of the most
hazardous materials known to mankind. It is time for Congress to
act to ensure that they get the help they have long deserved. These
workers, many of whom are now seriously ill, should not have to
wait to be compensated.''

TO DANCE VIVALDI, ASK VIVALDI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 By IRIS FANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Christopher Wheeldon had no intention of making a
ballet of Antonio Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' even though he thinks
the music is wonderful. When he saw James Kudelka's ballet to the
same score, he recalls, he thought: ``Wow, this is long. I love the
music but I would never do this.'' He couldn't see how to stretch
enough inventive steps over the length of such a familiar work.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he agreed to take it on because the Boston Ballet,
where he has been appointed principal guest choreographer through
2003, wanted the ``The Four Seasons'' for its repertory. While
studying the music for clues to where he should start, he found
inspiration in the composer's own words, inserted in the score.
``In the winter,'' Vivaldi wrote in one note, ``our feet chatter
with cold. We shiver in the snow.'' With that, Wheeldon's
imagination took off, and the ballet started to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon, who retired as a soloist with the New York City Ballet
last spring, says he has been working from ``noon to dusk every
day'' to finish the 48-minute ballet, which will have its world
premiere on Thursday at the Wang Theater, where the company's
season runs through Oct. 8. Collaborating with Santo Loquasto, who
has designed the scenery and costumes, Wheeldon was emphatic about
``wanting to escape the rather typical idea of the changing of the
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Santo to create for me a space that evoked a sense of
period in a way,'' he recalls. ``It has a hint of traveling
performers who come upon a space. We have four very different
seasons choreographically.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Wheeldon rehearsing in the top-floor studio of the
South End building that is home to the Boston Ballet is to note the
self-confidence and easy manner of a choreographer who works
comfortably with the dancers. A slow, backward slide for Lyn Tally
down a ramp from a heavy, gold-colored wagon was hard to achieve
until Wheeldon demonstrated the body pose he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the studio fairly unprepared for the ballet,'' he
says later. ``I'm not a big preparer anyway. I don't spend hours in
the studio alone, forming combinations. It's much more interesting
for me to create something for a personality. I'm interested in
learning the craft of building roles for dancers. After all, the
great choreographers of the past whom I admire _ Balanchine,
Robbins, Ashton, MacMillan, Kylian, Tudor and Taylor _ worked in
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 27 years old, Wheeldon has choreographed works for many
companies over the last five years, beginning with a full-evening
production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' for the Colorado
Ballet. It's a mistake to make too much of his age. The major
choreographers whom he reveres were also early bloomers: think of
Balanchine at age 21 in Monte Carlo, creating works for the
Diaghilev Ballets Russes, and Robbins making ``Fancy Free'' for
Ballet Theater when he was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon's current Boston assignment, his third new work for the
company since the 1999 productions of ``The Firebird'' and
``Corybantic Ecstasies,'' shares the program with another new work,
Daniel Pelzig's ``Resurrection,'' set to Samuel Barber's Concerto
for Cello and Orchestra. ``The Four Seasons'' is only one of many
premieres on Wheeldon's dance card this year. Since last spring,
when he announced he was retiring from performing to concentrate on
making ballets, he has created new works for his home company, the
City Ballet, as well as for the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal
Ballet of London and a workshop presentation of a Marvin
Hamlisch-John Guare musical, ``The Sweet Smell of Success,''
directed by Nicholas Hytner. The musical, based on the film of the
same name, is to have its preview in Chicago in December 2001, and
to open in New York in 2002. Wheeldon shared the choreography
credit with Susan Stroman in the recent film ``Center Stage,'' also
directed by Hytner.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon's 10-year dancing career started when he joined the
Royal Ballet of England in 1991. Two years later, after recovering
from an injury that sidelined him in London, he arrived in New
York, where he knew practically no one. He showed up at City Ballet
to take a guest class and within two days was invited into its
corps de ballet. ``It was fate,'' he says. ``I hadn't even seen the
Statue of Liberty yet.'' It was also fateful, perhaps, that Peter
Martins, the company's ballet master in chief, happened to be
watching class that day to audition a different young man.
</P>
<P>
   While a corps de ballet member of City Ballet, Wheeldon created
his first work for the School of American Ballet, which won him the
Mae L. Wien Award for choreography in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ringer, a principal dancer with the company, stepped
into the leading role of another Wheeldon work, ``Mercurial
Manuevers,'' last spring. She remembers when Wheeldon joined the
company: ``All of a sudden this new boy was here. He looked 12. He
was so open and friendly. And then he started dancing, and we were
amazed at what a beautiful dancer he was. Anytime there was a
five-minute break, if he had any energy, he would get up and do
some choreography. He'd bring a girl over and say, `Try this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon did not come to America unprepared. Born in Yeovil,
Somerset, in southwest England, he was enrolled at the East Coker
Ballet School at the age of 7 after having seen _ and been
enchanted by _ a Royal Ballet touring performance of ``La Fille Mal
Gardee.'' As he remembers his early classes, he was ``the only boy
in what seemed like a forest of girls in pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he was accepted at the Royal Ballet School in the
junior division, progressing to residential status at age 11. He
had a banner year when he graduated from the school into the
company at 17, won the gold medal at the Prix de Lausanne and
received the school's Ursula Moreton Prize for Choreography. His
interest in making dances had been fostered at the school from the
start. Anthony Dowell, the artistic director of the Royal Ballet,
keeps framed above his desk a program that Wheeldon designed at 11
to accompany one of his early choreography projects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gold medal, his two years dancing with the Royal
Ballet were not easy; he suffered many injuries. ``I had weak
ankles,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth MacMillan had been observing his progress and encouraged
him as both performer and fledgling choreographer. Cast in
MacMillan's controversial last work, ``The Judas Tree,'' about the
gang rape of a young woman on an industrial site, Wheeldon
remembers it as ``a strange experience for a 17-year-old, watching
this old, very bizarre, rather sickly Kenneth creating this twisted
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd literally just graduated from the Royal Ballet School,
having just danced Balanchine's `Valse Fantaisie' there,'' he says.
``That's when I first knew I wanted to explore American dance
more.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan's death at the theater during a performance of his
``Mayerling,'' while Wheeldon was onstage in its cast, was a blow
to the young dancer. ``I was disheartened.'' he says. ``Not to say
that my move to America might not have happened without it.'' In a
similar way, Robbins' death after Wheeldon had worked with him
often at City Ballet was another barrier, he says: ``I learned
quite a lot from watching him choreograph.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to concentrate on choreography came for many
reasons. ``I had wanted to be a super dancer,'' he explains. ``I
wanted it quite badly until I was promoted to soloist at New York
City Ballet in 1999. Then it seemed to me I had reached the point
that there was no looking back. As a dancer I had quite a lot of
problems partnering. I wanted to be able to turn, to jump, but
there comes a time in your career when you have to assess the
situation. You grow up.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   His choreography has gained wide attention; as early as 1996 he
was on the cover of Dance Magazine. Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The
New York Times in May: ``No ballet choreographer of his generation
can match his imaginative use of the classical vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Anna-Marie Holmes, the artistic director of the Boston Ballet,
says: ``I'll help him his whole career, any way I can. I'm thrilled
that I got him here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are dissenting voices. Jann Parry, a British dance
critic, commented on Wheeldon's progress in a review of his ballet
``There Where She Loves'': ``He rarely seems to deliver more, or
other than required _ and if he doesn't overreach himself in his
20s, how will he dare to do so later?'' She went on to say of the
ballet that ``as an examination of how things are between men and
women in love, it barely skims the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeldon admits he has much to learn. ``I can go to City Ballet
every night now that I'm not a dancer and study those fantastic
works,'' he says. ``I know how it feels to be dancing, to be riding
on top of the music, underneath the music, dancing through the
music. There's nothing like dancing in a Balanchine ballet because
you really just become the music. But you can't stand back from it
when you're amongst a corps of 38 or 40 dancers at the back of the
stage, concentrating on your counts. I'm looking forward to
learning the repertoire from an audience and choreographic point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   After he finishes ``The Four Seasons'' in Boston, Wheeldon will
take a monthlong break to settle into a newly purchased one-bedroom
condominium in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, which he shares
with his partner, Jock Soto, a principal dancer with City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after spending November and December rehearsing a new work
for a January premiere for City Ballet, where he has been appointed
artist in residence, he travels to Calgary, Alberta, to choreograph
``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' for the Alberta Ballet. From there,
it's on to Hamburg to make a work for John Neumeier's company,
before returning to City Ballet to choreograph still another ballet
for the spring season.
</P>
<P>
   He is next booked to work on ``The Sweet Smell of Success,''
with a ballet due on his contract with Boston for 2001-2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder he says ``a year doesn't seem like a very long
time.''

OPPOSITION IN PERU OFFERS TO MEET WITH GOVERNMENT TO END CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Saying they had yet more incriminating videotapes
of official misconduct, several leading opponents of President
Alberto K. Fujimori announced on Tuesday that they were willing to
resume talks with his government to find a solution to the
country's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders had previously conditioned their
participation in talks on the arrest of Vladimiro Montesinos, a
close aide of Fujimori's and head of the intelligence agency, who
was seen on one videotape offering a $15,000 bribe to an opposition
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Their change of heart came one day after Fujimori instructed his
Cabinet _without consulting other political groups _ to begin an
election process that would culminate in the inauguration of a new
president on July 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Their announcement also came against a backdrop of deepening
mystery and conflicting reports about the whereabouts of Montesinos
and continued silence from the military about its support for the
president. Fujimori, who has not made any public statements since
Saturday, made a brief visit to military headquarters Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real situation of emergency and disinformation so
that we can no longer remain on the margins,'' said Fernando
Olivera, a congressman with the Independent Moralizing Party, or
FIM. ``You have to avoid a power vacuum. This does not mean we
withdraw our demand for the arrest of Vladimiro Montesinos. What
would happen is it would be put on the table for discussion so
together we can make the correct decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups had been taking part in talks with the
Fujimori government under the aegis of the Organization of American
States, which was trying to help bolster confidence in the nation's
institutions after Fujimori won a controversial third term earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear on Tuesday if Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew from
that race after accusing the government of rigging the election,
has agreed to the renewed talks. On Monday night, he was acting
like a candidate as he addressed a crowd of 10,000 cheering
supporters at the Plaza San Martin and suggested that a
transitional government be established.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera said on Tuesday that this was not the time to campaign,
but to find solutions, hoping that talks would bring about
elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal would be for Fujimori to resign,'' he said. ``But I
think you have to be open to all types of alternatives. The
ultimate goal is open and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olivera, who triggered the crisis when he made public the
incriminating videotape, also tinged his overture with a sense of
its own mystery when he announced that he had other damning
videotapes. His assertion was backed up by Susana Higuchi, an
opposition lawmaker and Fujimori's former wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the military is pressuring Fujimori so there would
not be a coup,'' she said. ``That is why we do not plan to release
the other videos because there would be chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, however, said that he
did not think there was much appetite among officers for a coup in
support of Montesinos, who was thought to still be inside
intelligence headquarters. The official said he believed that
Montesinos' fate was being decided, and that it was a choice
between safe passage to another Latin American country or arrest on
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Fujimori insisted that the president was still in
control of the country, even if the military had yet to issue any
signals of allegiance. Martha Chavez, a congresswoman and head of
the legislature's Committee on National Defense, Internal Order and
Intelligence, said she had spoken with the president and that he
was ``serene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces are perfectly respectful of the decision of
the president,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said she was more worried about the opposition's claim that
they had more videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the protection of classified information?'' she said.
``That is more worrisome to me, because someone could be disposed
to more treason. They could have classified information about
national security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   While opposition groups have demanded that Montesinos come out
of hiding and be arrested, Chavez said that he is currently not
charged with a crime and that there were no restrictions on his
movements. At the same time, she insisted that she had no idea of
his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be at home or anywhere,'' she said. ``I have no
interest knowing where he is. I am only interested where my
daughter and husband are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of any sign of where his was or what he was doing
continued to trouble the opposition, which released more details on
Tuesday about the intelligence chief's response to their
revelations last Thursday. Olivera said that Montesinos' emissaries
contacted him soon after the videotape was leaked, urging Olivera
to reach an accommodation or face the possibility of a coup that
would target him and other opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not accept any pact of impunity,'' he said. ``We are
sure that no military adventure, no matter how bloody, would last
for more than 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the videotape was given to him by a ``patriot'' who
risked his life and who now had a bounty on his head.

   BRASS FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who has sharply criticized the Clinton
administration's defense policies, has picked up the endorsement of
several retired military leaders, including senior officers who
served in influential positions under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The list, to be announced Wednesday by Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, in Lancaster, Calif., includes Adm. Jay L. Johnson, who
stepped down as the Navy's top admiral in July, and Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, who
also retired this summer. Others include two former commandants of
the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles C. Krulak and Gen. Carl Mundy Jr.;
and two former chiefs of the Air Force, Gen. Ronald R. Fogelman and
Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, all of whom served under President Clinton.
The officers are part of a new group called ``Veterans for
Bush-Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING FOR ECONOMIST
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday that Gov. George W. Bush
showed a flawed understanding of the national economy when he said
earlier this week that he would not retreat from a tax cut in the
middle of a recession but would cut even more, even at the risk of
creating a ``short-term deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach very well might worsen a recession, Lieberman said
during a campaign stop in Fresno, Calif. ``We can't afford that,''
he declared. ``Deficits lead to higher interest rates, and what
does that mean? Higher mortgage payments. Higher car payments.
Higher student loan payments.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Bush's plan for a $1.3 billion tax cuts over
10 years would lead to deficits and noted that even Republican
leaders in Congress had not advocated so large a cut. Vice
President Al Gore has proposed a $500 million package of tax cuts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEE DICK RUN. SEE DICK FISH.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is an avid, even fanatical, fly fisherman. His
Secret Service code name is Angler. On the stump he often talks
wistfully about forgoing the fall fishing season in order to
campaign for the vice presidency. So he looked more than pleased on
Monday when he took a break from policy speeches and led his
entourage and motorcade to Kaufmann's Fly Fishing, just outside
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   After looking over the fly boxes, $600 rods and all-weather
gear, he picked up a rod and reel and headed out to the parking lot
to show off a few graceful casts, nearly landing a television
camera crew. Then he headed back to dry reality, a Chamber of
Commerce speech.

Branch in Galveston
 &HT;

 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal officials have ordered the University of Texas Medical
Branch at Galveston to immediately halt some of its federally
funded medical research until it corrects alleged lapses in
protections for patients participating in clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction is the second placed on UTMB this year. In July,
the Office for Human Research Protections ordered UTMB to suspend
enrollment of prisoners in 195 medical studies.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB officials said they would not know the number of suspended
research projects until Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB is scrambling this week to correct deficiencies cited by
the federal agency, following an investigational visit to UTMB last
week. The agency, a division of the Department of Health and Human
Services which oversees patient safety in research, severely
criticized UTMB for its informed consent procedures as well as its
review process for research proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The institution was caught off-guard by the agency's latest
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect this level of response from them,'' said Dr.
Cheryl Chanaud, director of UTMB's office of clinical trials. ``We
thought they would give us some guidance on what they would like to
see changed. We are making every endeavor to meet their
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions do not interfere with UTMB's federal funding
for research.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 14 letter written after the site visit, the agency
commended UTMB for its ``enthusiastic and sincere commitment to the
protection of human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter went on for 10 more pages outlining problems and
shortcomings with UTMB's oversight committee on patient research.
The committee, called an institutional review board, or IRB, is
charged with making sure research projects meet federal guidelines
to protect patients. Additional guidelines apply when research
involves prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The agency reviewed IRB files for more than 50 research
projects, and the minutes of review board meetings convened during
the past three years. Of 25 research projects approved for the
involvement of prisoners reviewed by the agency, it found problems
with more than half of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the criticisms stated in the agency's letter:
</P>
<P>
   -- Some of the studies were not considered to offer ``reasonable
probability of improving the health or well-being of the subject''
as required. The agency was concerned that some of the projects
posed ``greater than minimal risk'' to subjects.
</P>
<P>
   -- The review board made decisions without sufficient
information about patient enrollment procedures; according to
minutes of its meetings and discussions with the review board's
members and staff, ``little substantive review takes place at
convened meetings of the IRB.''
</P>
<P>
   -- UTMB overstated the potential benefits and understated the
risk of a particular project in its informed consent documents.
</P>
<P>
   -- The language used in informed consent documents frequently
includes ``complex language that would not be understandable to all
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   -- UTMB does not routinely require informed consent documents in
the native language of potential subjects who do not speak English.
</P>
<P>
   -- The current membership of the institutional review board
appears to lack the diversity of race, gender and cultural
backgrounds required under HHS regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``OHRP is concerned that the deficiencies cited above may be
indicative of an IRB overburdened by the large volume of research
for which is has oversight responsibility,'' the letter stated.
``It is OHRP's experience that such a large volume of human
subjects research warrants more than one fully functional IRB.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is requiring that UTMB provide a complete list of all
suspended research projects by Sept. 28, and submit quarterly
progress reports documenting implementation of required corrective
actions. The first report is due Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of enrollment of prisoners required by the July 10
letter must remain in effect until the protocols have been
re-reviewed and approved, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency is recommending that UTMB appoint more
than one prisoner or prisoner representative to the review board.
The agency asked UTMB to submit by Oct. 15 a detailed description
of the qualifications and background of any proposed prisoner
representative.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB has already installed one such representative, a member of
the Texas Inmate Families Association, on its 37-member review
board, which is made up of 32 UTMB faculty members, plus five
community members.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also recommends the use of independent monitors to
observe the informed consent process for prisoners, as well as a
formal, mandatory training program regarding ethical principles and
requirements for research involving prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   UTMB, which provides health care to the majority of Texas prison
inmates, has a research budget of more than $50 million. It is best
known for its research on tropical diseases, infectious diseases
and neuroscience.

Deborah Weisgall writes about the arts from Boston. 
 By   DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1629 Rembrandt was 23. He had tousled, curly hair, a
bulbous nose, a small mouth and round, staring eyes. He shared a
studio in his birthplace, Leiden, with Jan Lievens. Two years
later, having achieved fame and some fortune, to a large extent
from experimenting with images of his own face, he moved to
Amsterdam, the commercial and artistic center of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Many self-portraits of the artist appear in ``Rembrandt Creates
Rembrandt: Art and Ambition in Leiden, 1629-1631,'' opening Sunday
and running through Jan. 7 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
here. The exhibition examines how Rembrandt managed his career
during those critical years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a little show at the Gardner addresses large themes.
The museum's exhibition gallery, painted a warm gray, is hung with
9 etchings and 11 paintings, including 2 by Lievens and 2 with
tentative attributions. The show, conceived by the Gardner's former
curator of collections, Hilliard Goldfarb, and organized by its
current curator, Alan Chong, touches on the major issues of
Rembrandt scholarship: attribution, the evolution of his
experimental techniques and his historical, critical and cultural
context.
</P>
<P>
   It also asks a broader question: what values, what lessons, do
we take from his art today? The exhibition and its scholarly
catalog reveal as much about contemporary attitudes toward art and
artists as they do about Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it would seem difficult for such intimate works
to carry heavy arguments. (The largest, barely 35 inches high, is a
1629 self-portrait from the Gardner's own collection.) But these
are the images Rembrandt used to make his reputation and to
proclaim his presence in Leiden and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Each is arresting, each is suggestive and each conveys the sense
of a man fulfilling his powers and ambition. Rembrandt was learning
how to give emotional impact to shadows, attitudes, even
architecture. In the 1630 etching ``Christ Disputing With the
Doctors,'' he stages the drama on a theatrical platform set off by
curved steps. Joseph and Mary watch as their young boy holds his
own in a discussion of the law with wise men in the temples. An
outsize column emphasizes the sense of upset proportion as the
grand doctors, arranged in an arc, consult their books
incredulously or bend to listen to the boy, his face glowing, his
back in foreboding shadow. Looking on from the wings on the right,
the featureless figures of Mary and Joseph are stand-ins for
Rembrandt's Protestant audience.
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt also used etchings to practice portraiture. When he
was starting out, he lacked lucrative portrait commissions, so he
found anonymous models, old men and women, and he used himself,
experimenting with expression, with character, casting himself in
different roles. For centuries critics have compared him with
Shakespeare for his ability to conjure the gamut of human
experience. Rembrandt portrayed himself in a beggar's cloak with
his toes protruding from broken shoes, then in a dignified cape and
velvet hat; he presented himself laughing, raging, dejected.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ruthlessness to these images; Rembrandt refused to
make himself attractive, to dilute with beauty his exploration of
anger, or weariness, or pride. He also did not contradict the
attractive myth, already in circulation, of his youthful poverty.
(He was a miller's son, but his father was well off and well
connected, able to send his youngest boy to Latin school and enroll
him in the University of Leiden.)
</P>
<P>
   In a portrait by Lievens, however, Rembrandt appears handsome;
his nose is not quite so protuberant; his eyes gaze less fiercely
from under his arched brows. Lievens paints his lips full and
young; Rembrandt always gives himself the thin, hardened mouth of
an older man. Constantijn Huygens, a contemporary connoisseur,
visited the two young artists and recorded astute impressions: ``It
is as if you were looking at old men of many years, who were
already tired of frivolous diversions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lievens' portrait, for all its refinement, lacks a level of
intensity, that painting, along with his ``Head of an Old Woman
(Rembrandt's Mother),'' demonstrates that Rembrandt worked beside a
master of surface elegance, an artist whose paintings collectors
confused with Rembrandt's as early as 1633. But as Huygens
observed, ``Rembrandt is superior to Lievens with regard to
judgment and in the power to affect feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt painted ``Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of
Jerusalem'' in 1630. The city is burning; Rembrandt brushed smoke
in thin, wild strokes over a dark ground; against this violent
holocaust the prophet rests in a disorienting diagonal. His right
arm is hidden (a reference to Psalm 137, ``If I forget thee, O
Jerusalem, let my right hand lose its cunning). Flames illuminate
his aged face in a web of brush strokes catching exhaustion and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   Did Rembrandt choose his subjects and the small scale of these
works from a canny sense of what the market would bear _ his
self-portrait etchings found eager buyers _ or from an inner need?
</P>
<P>
   Ambition, in our skeptical and materialistic age, is a worldly
quality. We view artists very much in market terms: we ask how they
positioned themselves for success, how they figured out and
delivered what the public would buy. Yet ambition can also be
private, and that is the true subject of this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt'' arrives in armor. Like the
artist's ``Man in Military Costume,'' the show's carapace is a
formidable and informative catalog. But the works themselves are
hung without labels; a free descriptive brochure provides
identification and brief commentary. ``We wanted people to look,''
Chong said. ``To see these images unencumbered, and to think about
the existence of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1629, Rembrandt painted ``Artist in his Studio.'' The easel,
seen from the back, takes up most of the shabby room and dominates
the panel, which is only slightly bigger than a sheet of typing
paper. The artist stands in the background, a tiny figure
overdressed for work in a big hat and heavy robe with cumbersome
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his brushes, he stares _ round, dark eyes under arched
brows _ in an expression of profound and utter surprise. Is he
staring at us, at himself, at what he has created? His gaze _ his
astonishment _ encompasses all the world.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Supporters of gun control rip Congress over bill's bottleneck
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KAREN MASTERSON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning hope for passage of a gun-control bill
before Congress adjourns next month, advocates Tuesday chided
lawmakers for shirking the issue.
</P>
<P>
   They also named Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush
among ``the most dangerous'' elected officials because of his
record, including a bill he signed in favor of allowing concealed
weapons in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for Handgun Control Inc. said they were disappointed
that a provision to control weapons traded at gun shows has all but
died on Capitol Hill. The provision, which is part of a juvenile
justice bill, passed the House and Senate last year in different
forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun show loophole must be enacted,'' said Sarah Brady,
chairwoman of Handgun Control and wife of James Brady, the White
House press secretary who was shot and partially paralyzed in 1981
during an attempt on President Reagan's life.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure is unlikely to come up again because the parties
have been unable to reconcile their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the House-passed version is too lenient. The
Senate bill, while tougher, was passed amid a political battle that
ended in a tie vote. Vice President Al Gore made a rare appearance
on Capitol Hill to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The gun show loophole became an issue in the spring of 1999,
just after it was discovered that weapons used in the Columbine
High School shooting in Littleton, Colo., were obtained at a gun
show.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Senate bill was passed with the provision
that would require child safety locks on firearms, ban imported
weapons with large capacity ammunition clips, and impose background
checks at gun shows to prevent unregulated sales.
</P>
<P>
   The House version shortened the length of time permitted to
perform a background check _ from three business days in the Senate
bill to 24 hours _ and narrowed the definition of a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   No action has taken place since August 1999, when members of the
conference committee met to discuss the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Each party blames the other for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Hyde is ready to move forward with a compromise,''
said Sam Stratman, spokesman for Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads
the House Judiciary Committee. ``One gets an increasingly
suspicious feeling that some Democrats are more comfortable
(keeping alive) the issue than coming up with a solution'' so they
can use it as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Republicans are at fault for the measure's
inevitable death.
</P>
<P>
   ``(House Majority Whip Tom) DeLay was not receptive to the
bill,'' said David Carle, spokesman for Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Inaction has frustrated gun-control advocates. On Tuesday,
officials with Handgun Control pledged to spend $4 million this
year to support candidates who favor gun control and to help defeat
Bush. The amount is more than the group has spent in an election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan defended his boss' record: ``The
truth is, Governor Bush has cracked down on juveniles who illegally
carry guns, has made gun prosecution a priority and has helped
lower the violent and juvenile crime rates in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that voters are more interested in education,
health care reform and the budget deficit. Still, gun control
advocates say that for some groups and in some states, a
candidate's position on weapons will influence voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns in general will be an issue in a lot of congressional
races, and we're trying hard to make it a big issue in the
presidential race,'' said Marie Carbone, director of congressional
relations for Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   She said focus groups indicate that gun control will be a
deciding factor for suburban women and voters in some states. For
example, Colorado and Oregon have ballot initiatives to close the
gun show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that they haven't gone ahead and taken
action, especially in view of the tragedies at Columbine and other
places,'' said Dave Smith, head of the Houston chapter of Texans
Against Gun Violence. ``One would have thought that they would have
done something to prevent things like that from happening in the
future.''

EDITORIAL: A `TILT' TOWARD INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, India's nuclear tests provoked worldwide
condemnation and retaliatory sanctions by the United States. Yet in
recent months, culminating in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
visit to Washington last weekend, the United States has drawn
closer to India diplomatically than at any time since the early
1960s. President Clinton has shaped a new foreign policy course in
South Asia by embracing India and distancing the United States from
Pakistan's military government. These steps have far-reaching
ramifications for all of Asia, including China, as well as for the
issue of nuclear proliferation. The shift is justified by India's
growing importance. But it should be accompanied by more pressure
on India to exercise nuclear restraint and defuse tensions with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy in South
Asia was characterized by President Richard Nixon's famous decision
that the United States should ``tilt'' toward Pakistan in its war
with India in 1971. With the withdrawal of Russian troops from
Afghanistan and the collapse of the Soviet empire, the United
States and India have repaired their ties. A vibrant new generation
of Indian immigrants to America has contributed to an era of good
feeling, as has India's participation in United Nations
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   India can still be a nettlesome friend. It has fiercely
criticized U.S. positions on global warming and nuclear weapons.
But as the world's most populous democracy, it is a natural U.S.
ally on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   In improving its friendship with India, the United States needs
to be particularly careful not to incite feelings of distrust in
India's two wary neighbors Pakistan and China. The Senate vote
Tuesday to give permanent trade benefits to China caps Clinton's
welcome effort to stabilize relations with Beijing and to give
Chinese leaders every incentive to open their nation to commerce
and new ideas. India should now move quickly to sign the nuclear
test ban treaty, which Vajpayee has promised, and to exercise more
restraint on the deployment of missiles and production of fissile
materials, since failure to do so will not only provoke Pakistan
but raise anxiety in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, India's
only Muslim-dominated state, poses one of the gravest threats to
world stability. In the last two years, it is Pakistan that has
engaged in more provocative behavior by supporting guerrilla
insurgents and, a year ago, sending its own forces across the
border into the Kargil area. Clinton's pressure on Pakistan to
withdraw the troops was successful, but it became a factor in a
subsequent military coup last October by Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
India was restrained in its response to Kargil, but its leaders
need to do more to recognize that there can be no military solution
to the Kashmir problem. In the end, greater autonomy must be
granted to the region, and there should be more willingness to let
the United States or other outsiders try to mediate a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Vajpayee, Clinton made it clear that he hopes
to cement a new relationship with India that the next president can
expand. That may be difficult, not only because of the uncertainty
over the U.S. presidential election's outcome but also because
Vajpayee appears to be in frail health. His Hindu nationalist
government contains some claimants to leadership who might revert
to an unacceptably militant posture toward Pakistan. But if handled
sensitively, this new phase of friendship between India and the
United States, and America's warming relations with China, should
be forces for greater stability in the region and throughout the
world.

 &HT;    United States finishes fourth in women's gymnastics
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ No medal, no miracle. But except for the usual Bela
Karolyi controversy, no worries, either.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's gymnastics team finished fourth Tuesday at the
Olympic Games. And just like its predecessor, Atlanta's gold-medal
winning Magnificent Seven, it exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the experience is pretty similar,'' said Amy Chow, a
member of both teams. ``We didn't get a medal this time, but I
think we put forth our best routines, and you can't ask for more
from yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. had pulled itself up from sixth after a mistake-filled
qualification round Sunday. When the chalk dust settled, the
gymnastics world belonged again to the traditional powerhouses.
Romania, the team that was third in Atlanta, won the gold medal
when three Russians botched their beam routines. Romania scored
154.608, while Russia had 154.403 and China 154.008.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. scored 152.933, a marked improvement from two days
earlier, from their sixth-place finish at the 1999 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in much better shape than a year ago, and incomparably
better than two years ago,'' said Karolyi, the national team
coordinator who is still the biggest presence on the U.S. scene.
``Miracles cannot be done in one night, or six months. But there's
been definite progress since January.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. had its best scores on balance beam and floor exercise,
the final event. Only Chow and Elise Ray competed on all four
apparatus, as three-time Olympian Dominique Dawes, Maloney, Jamie
Dantzcher and Tasha Schwikert appeared on three. Karolyi calls
Schwikert, who is 15, ``miracle kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to be almost perfect to get a medal,'' said
Kristen Maloney. ``We're really happy with what we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet how they got there and what the future holds for the sport
in the United States continues to cause friction among the coaches,
the athletes and Karolyi. Because he wasn't an official coach,
Karolyi wasn't allowed on the floor for the first time in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Watching intently from the media seats, Karolyi fidgeted and
rocked in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sweat blood for the first time,'' said Karolyi, who isn't
used to sitting in one place for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But Dantzscher, who is coached by Olympic assistant Steve
Rybacki, said that Karolyi ``gets way too much credit'' for their
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't my inspiration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes credited team unity for their better performances.
They screamed for each other and gave one another hugs in the
absence of Karolyi's bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all so proud of each other, so proud of ourselves for
how far we've come,'' said Ray, who will compete in Thursday's
all-around along with Chow and Kristen Maloney. ``We did a
wonderful job tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Romania was led by Andrea Raducan with a score of 38.861,
followed by Maria Olaru and Simona Amonar. Russia's top gymnast,
Svetlana Khorkina, fell off the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   Chow said the U.S. team went out to have fun. ``After being in
sixth place,'' she said, ``we figured there's nothing to lose
because you can only go up .''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi said he would continue as national team coordinator ``If
they're going to need me.'' He added, ``with some major changes,''
but he wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   However Hill isn't a fan of the monthly training camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' she said.

PEPSICO LOSES TO COCA-COLA IN COURT FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Tuesday by
PepsiCo that accused Coca-Cola of unfairly wielding its influence
to control the beverages served in restaurants, movie theaters and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Filed two years ago in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the
lawsuit challenged Coke's widespread use of ``loyalty'' contracts
with food-service distributors, the independent vendors who provide
restaurants, convenience stores and sports arenas with everything
from cups to ketchup to the syrupy concentrate used in fountain
drinks. Through these agreements, Pepsi asserted, Coke pressed the
distributors to carry its fountain syrup exclusively, effectively
barring Pepsi's ability to compete in a $2.3 billion category that
is outpacing the rest of the soda market.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Loretta A. Preska discounted Pepsi's contention, saying
the company failed to present enough evidence to warrant a trial.
``By this measure, PepsiCo's brew falls flat,'' she wrote in her
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi officials said they ``obviously disagree'' with the
ruling, but fell short of saying they would appeal it. Many
analysts expect PepsiCo will have little choice but to challenge
the court's decision, because the company lags so far behind
Coca-Cola in an increasingly important segment of the soft- drink
business.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke claims roughly 44 of the overall market, compared
with slightly more than 31 percent for Pepsi, much of its lead can
be attributed to its ubiquity in restaurants, sports complexes and
movie theaters. Anchored by long-standing alliances with fast-food
giants like McDonald's and Burger King, Coke commands an
astonishing two-thirds of the fountain drink business, roughly
three times the size of Pepsi's share, according to Beverage
Digest/Maxwell, which tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the retail side, the two are locked in a perpetual tug of
war, with Coke only a few percentage points ahead of Pepsi. But as
consumers shy away from higher soda prices at the supermarket,
forsaking the cans and bottles that have long been the industry's
core, the pressure to sell more at restaurants and movie theaters
has never been greater. Last year, fountain drinks accounted for 23
percent of all soft drinks sold in the United States, up 10 percent
from a decade ago. In convenience stores, sales of fountain drinks
are growing faster than any other product, except for cigarettes
and gasoline, according to the National Association of Convenience
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi officials acknowledge that their courtroom challenge
represented an integral part of their plan to gain a greater
foothold in the fountain business, where many of their expansion
efforts have been thwarted in the past. As the former owner of
Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell, Pepsi once found
it difficult to convince other restaurant chains to serve drinks
that were owned and operated by the parent company of their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   That changed somewhat in 1997, when Roger A. Enrico became
Pepsi's chairman, spun off the company's restaurants as Tricon
Global Restaurants, and thus increased the number of outlets where
Pepsi was sold. At the same time, Pepsi also revamped its contracts
with bottlers, allowing the company to sell the concentrate
directly to the independent food-service distributors that were at
the heart of its legal claims.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Pepsi said that Coke had a monopoly in the
restaurant business, saying the distributors often did not carry
its concentrate. But Preska disagreed, saying restaurants and other
businesses can _ and often do _ buy their fountain syrup directly
from the Pepsi bottlers, without paying more or suffering
retribution from suppliers.

apparently ran out of fuel and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico,

   The survivors, including one man who suffered severe head
injuries when the plane dropped into the gulf about 300 miles off
the Florida coast, were rescued by the crew of a passing freighter,
the Chios Dream.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Panamanian-registered freighter found nine
survivors _ three men, three women and three children _ and the
body of a tenth person who was apparently killed when the plane
went down, said U.S. Coast Guard officials.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the flight, the people aboard and their chances of
remaining in the United States or being returned to Cuba were
incomplete late Tuesday evening, as a Coast Guard cutter and rescue
aircraft headed to meet the freighter and transport the most
seriously injured to hospitals, probably in Key West or Miami, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a single-engine Antonov An-2 Colt believed to have
been used for crop dusting, was headed west-northwest, away from
Cuba and Florida, when it went down, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from the Herradura Airport in Pinar del Rio,
Cuba, at about 9 a.m. Just minutes later, Havana air traffic
controllers radioed air traffic controllers in Miami, saying the
plane had been hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers in Florida never made contact with the
plane, and Coast Guard jets searched the area where the plane was
first believed to have gone down, about 90 miles southwest of Key
West.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane's wreckage, and the survivors, were found more
than 200 miles away in the Yucatan Channel, just 60 miles from the
western tip of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The last such hijacking was in 1991, when five Cubans landed
safely at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if any of the passengers will be allowed to stay
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans who reach shore in
the United States to apply for residency.
</P>
<P>
   Uncontrolled immigration, often on rafts and through smuggling,
has prompted the governments of both countries to reach accords to
discourage the often dangerous journeys from the island.
</P>
<P>
   Under new agreements, 20,000 Cubans are allowed to immigrate to
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban officials still criticize the 1966 law. Cubans
interdicted at sea are most often returned, while those who make it
onto dry land _ the so-called wet foot, dry foot policy _ are still
most often granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the nine survivors is further complicated by the
fact that they may have committed a crime in hijacking the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hijacking the plane is an international crime,'' said one
American official. ``That person would certainly be excludable.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, asked about the flight today, said he knew
``there will be a lot of questions about what should be done with
the survivors. I think the more important thing now is to worry
about their care.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not evacuated for medical attention will likely be
taken the the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In Miami,
Cuban-Americans blamed Fidel Castro's record of human rights abuses
as the cause for the desperate flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the extent of what people go through,'' said Jorge
Mas Santos, who heads the Cuban American National Foundation here.

IN BOSTON AND ELSEWHERE, AUTUMN OF TEACHERS' DISCONTENT IS
DAWNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., N.J., Calif., Ohio, Pa.)  (See also: EDUCATION-COLUMN)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Minutes before the fourth period bell rang, Kathy
Aborn, a computer sciences teacher at East Boston High, laid into
school district officials about their contract offer, saying the
city's teachers were dead serious in threatening to go on strike
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their offer is pitiful,'' she said. ``They're trying
to take away the few extra privileges we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Aborn complained that the school district wants to eliminate
many of the privileges that the most senior teachers have in
choosing where they teach and has proposed a wage increase of less
than 10 percent. She says teacher salaries have lagged far behind
those of other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are running so high that Boston's 6,500 public school
teachers narrowly defeated a motion to go on strike on the first
day of school. Instead they set Oct. 11 as a strike deadline and
adopted a ``work-to-rule'' strategy that calls for doing nothing
beyond what the contract specifically requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say teachers are the angriest I've ever seen them,''
said Edward Doherty, president of the Boston Teachers Union.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger, part of which may well be a negotiating tactic,
is not limited to Boston. It is a tense autumn in school districts
across the nation, including in three of the nation's largest
cities, New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where teachers'
contracts have expired or are about to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, feeling left behind by the economic boom and
emboldened by the teacher shortage, are pushing for large raises.
School boards, swept up in the nationwide push for educational
reform, are pushing back, demanding far-reaching changes to improve
performance, including merit pay, longer school days and an end to
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, 4,000 teachers went on strike for two days, while
21,000 Philadelphia teachers are threatening a walkout later this
week. In Los Angeles, teachers have also warned of strikes if
negotiations break off, while in New York City, the 80,000-member
teachers' union is already holding demonstrations even though its
contract does not expire until November.
</P>
<P>
   There have been teacher strikes in half a dozen smaller
communities, including Hamilton, N.J., Punxsutawney, Pa., and
Richmond Heights, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say that the nature of the negotiations is more complex
than in past years. In New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Los
Angeles, officials are seeking large-scale reform in the face of
louder and louder calls for charter schools and vouchers. As a
result, school officials have more ambitious goals this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed that teachers
be paid based on the test results of the students in their
classrooms. In Philadelphia, the school board is also demanding
performance-based merit pay, adding five days to each school year,
and getting rid of some of the seniority preferences that base
school staffing not on what a principal thinks is best, but on how
much seniority a teacher has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reforms that bear on teachers are beginning to
gain some traction on the ground, and teachers' organizations don't
like that at all,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., an education expert
at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers say that since they accepted pay freezes or low
wage increases during times of recession and budget deficits,
negotiations during these prosperous times should focus on giving
teachers large raises and increasing starting salaries to attract
the 2 million new teachers the nation will need over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the million-member American
Federation of Teachers, said, ``I think you're seeing teachers
feeling that they're being totally left out in a period when the
economy is booming and when there are surpluses at every level of
government, when demands on them are greater than ever and when
they go to the bargaining table, all anybody wants to talk about is
merit pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everything we won over the years they just want to
take it away,'' said Marie Ann Adduci, a first-grade teacher at
William E. Russell Grammar School in Boston's blue-collar
Dorchester neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers at that school, cited last year as one of Boston's
best, say they are angry that after putting in so many extra hours
to improve the school, the school district wants to place
restrictions on their daily preparation time and add up to 30 extra
hours onto their school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Richter scale, I'd say the tensions are about an 8,''
said Jim Fay, an elementary school math teacher for the past 31
years. ``A lot of teachers feel funny that their children in their
entry level jobs are earning twice what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas W. Payzant, superintendent of Boston's schools, said his
negotiating goals are not to squeeze teachers but to improve
education. And he and several other school officials acknowledged
that if they want to persuade state legislatures to increase
funding for their financially strapped districts, they need to push
for some of the changes that legislators want.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great pressure on public schools here and across the
country to improve, and that means we've got to focus on the things
we do well and change those things we don't do well,'' Payzant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Ramos, president of the Philadelphia School Board, said,
``This isn't just about modifying 35 years of work rules. This is
about the future of public education in Philadelphia. We know that
if all we do is keep the status quo, the school district will not
survive financially or academically.''

MARKET PLACE: EVEN WHEN MARKETS SLUMP, GOLDMAN SACHS KEEPS
ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anybody who has wondered why the world's biggest
banks have been scrambling for a foothold on Wall Street need look
no further than the Goldman Sachs Group's latest earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, one of the biggest investment banks, reaped big gains
from trading and from investing in private companies that more than
offset a slowdown in stock and bond underwriting. Despite the
slackening in the U.S. stock markets since the Nasdaq took a dive
in April, Goldman and other securities firms have continued to reap
extraordinary profits, especially from underwriting and advising on
mergers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said it earned $824 million, or $1.62 a diluted share,
in its fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 31. That was 29
percent more than the $638 million, or $1.32, the firm earned in
the same quarter of 1999 and 11 cents a share more than analysts
had expected, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Net revenue rose 33 percent, to $4.53 billion, in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the heels of the Nasdaq meltdown, they had a very solid
quarter,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman, which slipped from their record high of $133
last week after Chase Manhattan Corp. announced its plan to acquire
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., rose $1.38, to $119.94, in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were encouraged as much by Goldman's results as by
comments from its chief financial officer, David Viniar, about the
outlook for its business this quarter. Viniar said that Goldman had
as big a backlog of underwriting and advisory assignments as it had
ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq being flat has not really affected the business,''
Viniar said. ``There's still lots of demand for people to issue
equity; there's still lots of demand for advice on mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldman's revenue from investment banking dropped 17
percent from the second quarter as the number of new stock
offerings declined. What really helped out last quarter was the
demand from investors for shares in companies that Goldman had
invested in before they went public.
</P>
<P>
   The firm recorded $480 million in gains on those private equity
investments. About half of that was profit realized on the sale of
shares in unidentified companies, Viniar said. The rest came from
marking up the value of the firm's stakes in companies that had
recently gone public, increases that reversed markdowns in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong merchant banking results really carried the quarter,''
said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. He said
Goldman's earnings would probably have declined from a year before
without the increase from those investments.
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar said that other investment banks could also show big
gains from private equity investments when they report earnings
this week. Lehman Brothers Holdings is scheduled to report today
and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. is scheduled to report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James K. Schmidt, who manages the John Hancock Financial
Industries fund, said his fund owned shares of both of those firms
and he expected both to report earnings that at least matched the
consensus estimates of analysts. Lehman has repeatedly reported
earnings far better than analysts expected, but Schmidt said he
doubted that would happen again after the slow start to last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered Lehman, and possibly the much bigger
Merrill Lynch, as likely targets of the current wave of buyouts
that includes the planned purchases of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
by Credit Suisse Group and of PaineWebber Group by UBS.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said it earned 27 cents for every dollar of its
shareholders' equity, an impressive return by Wall Street
standards. Investment banking has been so profitable for so long
that some investors have come to expect returns on equity well
above the traditional target of 20 percent. But others have begun
to worry that the industry's growth is slowing while some firms are
still spending heavily to compete with the new breed of financial
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment banks have been hiring aggressively and spending
large sums to set up offices in London and other European capitals.
Goldman said it had 18,666 employees at the end of last quarter, up
almost 30 percent from the prior year. But Viniar emphasized that
Goldman had held its spending on employee compensation and benefits
to 50 percent of its net revenue, or revenue minus interest
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms are making bets on the potential for the business to
continue to grow over the long term at very attractive rates,''
Moszkowski of Salomon Smith Barney said. ``If that's the wrong bet,
firms will have high levels of fixed costs and low profits and they
will have to lay people off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moszkowski said that the biggest firms believed they had no
choice but to build up their competitive position in the most
lucrative areas of investment banking, including advising on
mergers and underwriting and trading stocks and high-yield bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the last 10 years has said that you can't be
too timid or you lose market share,'' he said.

   PSEUDO CLOSING ITS DOORS
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo Programs, a pioneer in producing original entertainment
for the Internet, this week became the latest in a string of
companies to fail at that endeavor. Pseudo's 175 employees were
laid off on Monday afternoon. Founded in 1994 by Josh Harris, the
co-founder of the research firm Jupiter Communications, the New
York-based Pseudo started as an online radio station and soon began
streaming video programming that ranged from live chat about
hip-hop music to short documentaries about New York City. Investors
included Intel, Tribune Ventures and the French luxury goods
retailer LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. But after several
management shake-ups, Pseudo's shows still failed to attract enough
viewers to build significant advertising revenues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILE-SHARING HERE TO STAY?
</P>
<P>
   Napster, the controversial start-up, says its file-sharing
service lets Internet users swap music online. The record companies
says it facilitates theft. But a report released Tuesday by
Forrester Research suggests the whole debate is moot, concluding
that the one certainty about Napster, and services like it, is that
they are here to stay. In the report, Forrester concludes that
consumers will use any means necessary to gain access to content
like music. The firm asserts that if the industry tries to combat
file-sharing services like Napster by encrypting music files or by
filing copyright infringement lawsuits, consumers will find other
ways to trade files online.

   HITACHI FIBER OPTIC VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics maker, said Tuesday
that it would transfer its fiber optic components business unit
into a new company to be called OpNext Inc., a joint venture with
Clarity Group. Clarity Group itself is a joint venture between the
Los Angeles-based Clarity Partners, a new fund that invests in
media and communications companies and the Marubeni Group of Japan.
Clarity Group will invest up to $450 million in the new company.

   QWEST MOVES TO OPEN SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   U S West, now part of Qwest Communications International Inc.,
announced a series of complicated technical initiatives yesterday
meant to help new local phone companies connect to its network.
Qwest said it would allow its competitors to put more of their
equipment in Qwest's facilities and ; would withdraw 17 lawsuits it
had filed against state regulators challenging their ability to
force the company to open its systems. The announcements could
begin a thaw between Qwest and the competitive local carriers, but
Qwest will still remain by far the laggard among the Bells in
opening its systems and in its prospects for winning entry to the
long-distance market.

   Hewlett-Packard plans to invest $52 million in a wireless

access to traffic navigation services, in addition to allowing
authorities to determine the location of cell phone users in 911
emergency situations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last April, on the first anniversary of the
shootings at Columbine High School, Vice President Al Gore
castigated Gov. George W. Bush for offering only ``half a
solution'' to the problem of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to address not just the spiritual dimension of this
challenge, but also the physical fact that there are too many
guns,'' Gore said. ``I think one of the lessons of Columbine is
that we have to stand up to the NRA and the gun industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself seems to have gone silent on the physical half
of that equation. He has chastised the entertainment industry for
glamorizing violence and marketing it to children. He has made
family values and religious faith centerpieces of his speeches. Yet
he has virtually stopped talking about gun control or the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts said they were not surprised by Gore's
effort to steal a bit of his Republican rival's thunder. Among the
more conservative swing voters he is trying to court, there is
greater political profit in criticizing the people who produce
movies than the ones who make, sell and own guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly gun control is not an issue anyone is going to ride to
the White House on,'' said Robert J. Spitzer, a professor of
political science at the State University of New York at Cortland
and author of the book, ``The Politics of Gun Control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood, on the other hand,'' Spitzer said, ``is an absolute
win all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said he had not backed away from his gun control
agenda, which includes licensing new handgun owners and limiting
handgun purchases to one a month. They said he is keeping his focus
on education and health care, and may return to gun control later _
though they offer no promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any ambivalence about the issue,'' said
Mark Fabiani, the deputy campaign manager. But privately, Gore's
advisers have long acknowledged that gun control is a potentially
double-edged issue. And so they have counseled him to avoid
discussing gun control in rural communities and to frame his
proposals as crime-fighting or child-safety ideas _ terms more
acceptable to gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton always viewed the issue as a big plus for him,'' said
Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit
advocate for gun control. ``With Gore, I think there is a lot of
ambivalence.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic of Gore's strategy becomes clearer with a glance at
the electoral map. His race with Bush is most sharply contested in
Midwestern and Great Lakes states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent voters and Democrats in those states are
socially conservative, pollsters said. And many own guns.
</P>
<P>
   Having consolidated his base among more liberal Democrats at the
Democratic convention, and having checked, at least for the moment,
the advances of Ralph Nader of the Green Party on his left, Gore is
now free to court those more conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he talked about gun control, he would lose further among
the white men in certain swing states, places like Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which are in play,'' said Ted G.
Jelen, chairman of the political science department at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, who has studied gun control as a
political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys of voters in the Midwest suggested that Gore's
tactic is working. Ed Sarpolus, an independent pollster in Lansing,
Mich., said polls that he conducted in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania
and Illinois last week showed Gore edging up among men, while also
receiving significantly stronger support among voters who said
family values were the issue they cared about most.
</P>
<P>
   Sarpolus noted that embracing gun control can be an effective
way to court women. But he said that Gore's popularity among women
had improved sharply in recent weeks without mentioning the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's winning on the issues people are thinking
about: health care, prescription drugs, education,'' Sarpolus said.
``So why change? If you get onto gun control, you take yourself
off-message. And then you might lose some of your own base.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Gore not to change his strategy is what many
analysts call the hassle factor: the ability of the National Rifle
Association to energize small groups to work against their
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Jelen suggested that gun control opponents were a
more unified and active voting bloc than gun control supporters.
That means, Jelen asserted, that Gore is likely to alienate more
voters than he can woo by talking about gun control, particularly
in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of gun control dispute that conclusion, arguing that
the shootings at Columbine and other schools have made supporters
of gun control a more single-minded and passionate voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   But those advocates said they also understood that the Gore
campaign needed to handle the gun control issue carefully. ``It's
not that they are not going to talk about gun issues,'' said Joe
Sudbay, political director for Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit
advocacy group. ``They are talking about it smartly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces his own conflicts on the gun issue. Though he wants
to win the conservative Democrats who oppose gun control, he is
also concerned about alienating women who support it. His response,
like Gore's, has been to avoid the issue whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   So both men have left the job of raising gun issues to their
supporters. For Bush, that has meant the NRA, which is promoting
him without endorsing him.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the task has fallen mainly to Handgun Control, which
is running commercials attacking Bush in several Midwestern cities.
</P>
<P>
   The risk in attacking the entertainment industry for Gore was
that he might lose financial support from the executives who had
lavished contributions on him and other Democrats in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Gore raised $4.2 million, much of it from film
and music stars, at a Los Angeles fund-raiser where he softened his
tone. In his remarks, he mentioned the gun issue only in passing _
even though Hollywood executives have been strong supporters of gun
control.

 &HT;    TV ratings hardly Olympic-class
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With NBC's Nielsen ratings for the Sydney Olympics slumping like
a fading athlete, the last thing the network wants to hear is from
fans of ``790 The Zone,'' an Atlanta sports talk radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only calls we're getting about the Olympics is about how
uninterested people are in the Olympics,'' says Andrew Saltzman,
the station's general manager. ``They're talking about how no one
cares.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ratings are running about 17 percent lower than it
anticipated and about 10 percent lower than the level it promised
advertisers. Although the network is touting that 111 million U.S.
viewers have seen at least some part of its coverage, audiences are
down considerably from Atlanta's 1996 ratings and Barcelona's 1992
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ratings continue as they are, it will be a serious
underdelivery, but not a catastrophe,'' says Joe Mandese, New York
editor of the media trade publication The Myers Report.
</P>
<P>
   What's to blame? Finger-pointing abounds, including the 15-hour
time delay between Sydney and the East Coast of the United States,
the lack of a big story, the same old coverage concept and enhanced
Internet coverage that gives fans almost-instant results way before
NBC's tape-delayed broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, these Games are being held in the United States' fall
instead of summer, when school is in session and people's viewing
patterns are different, and when other sports (college and pro
football, baseball playoff races, including the Braves) are
competing for sports fans' eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower-than-expected ratings, the network, which paid
$705 million for rights to the Games, is not changing its game
plan, says NBC Sports spokeswoman Cameron Blanchard. You'll
continue to see hours-old competition and those athlete
``profiles'' that are drawing almost as much heat as the tape
delays. ``With the time difference, this is the only way to do
it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bob Walker, general manager of WXIA, Atlanta's NBC
affiliate: ``It's not something we're overly concerned with. We've
had more viewers than the (network) competition combined.''
</P>
<P>
   That was for the first three nights, though. On Monday night,
the Braves-Mets game on TBS beat the Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ad buyers hesitate to give the NBC's coverage a bad score just
yet. The network sold a record $900 million in ads for these Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to call the Olympics down,'' says Michael
Greco, vice president of TV research for New York ad agency BBDO,
which handles Olympic advertiser VISA. ``We're just at the
beginning of it and as the drama of different events progresses,
more people will probably tune in.''
</P>
<P>
   One major advertiser, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, believes its too
early to be concerned, says spokesman Mart Martin. ``There are a
lot of events left in which to compete and a lot of medals yet to
be won,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   NBC hopes so, too. Gymnastics, normally one of the most popular
Olympic events, has failed to catch fire with audiences so far. But
the individual all-around finals are still coming, with the men
competing tonight on NBC and the women Thursday night. Track and
field events start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of NBC's concerns is advertisers ``make-goods.'' If a
network promises a sponsor a certain rating and doesn't deliver
that, the network has to make it good to the sponsor by airing an
extra commercial. NBC's Blanchard says it's too early in the Games
to tell if the network will have to add extra commercials, but it
had to do so with Seoul games in 1988, which followed the same
pattern as these Sydney games.
</P>
<P>
   As NBC hopes for an increase in viewers, here's what being said
about NBC and the Sydney games.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's the coverage. ``I think they've forgotten what television
is about. They have to do everything so artificially,'' says Gene
DeWitt, chairman of Optimedia, an ad buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched some of the coverage, but not a lot, so I'm
probably pretty typical,'' says Joe Dominick, professor of
telecommunications at the University of Georgia. ``I've become fed
up with those little vignettes that NBC runs. I really don't care
if the cyclist from the Ukraine had a bad case of athlete's foot
and is now making a comeback. Three to four Olympics ago, those
were fresh and new, but now they're really cliched.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of a big story. ``I don't think it's going to make a
splash till something big happens,'' says Jimmy Powers, executive
producer of 680 The Fan, another Atlanta sports-talk radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no particular attachment to a team or star or a
particular controversy,'' notes Jon Katz, a former TV news producer
who covers the Internet for Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's the Internet. Since scores are available all over the
Internet right after the events are over, anyone who cares to find
out knows the result before NBC airs the competition. Or so the
theory goes. Katz doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too easy to blame the Net,'' Katz says. ``It's not like
the whole country's saying, 'Oh my God, how can we get swimming
results?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be taking away from Olympic viewing, Katz says,
but only because it's just another general option for people's
time, like videotapes or computer games.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's the time delay. Because Sydney is 15 hours away from the
United States, hardly any events take place live in our prime time.
But even when the Games were in Atlanta in 1996, many of the events
were re-packaged and shown on tape in prime time in order to build
suspense and keep viewers tuned as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to one of the gymnastics events during the
afternoon (in 1996), and then watching it on TV that night,''
recalls Bill Maron, a banking consultant in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's the commercials. There's been widespread grousing about
the amount of commercials NBC is running. They're not running more
than normal, though. NBC is airing nine minutes of advertising per
hour, down 30 seconds from the Atlanta games, according to NBC's
Blanchard. That's also less than the 10-minutes-per-hour networks
usually run during prime-time entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is perception. When there's a break between, say,
``The Simpsons'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' we expect a big
block of commercials. During the Olympics, which is made to appear
seamless, there are no natural breaks between series.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's the season. This may be the biggest reason for the lack
of interest. The Summer Olympics normally run in the middle of
summer, when school is out and schedules are more relaxed. ``People
are busy with their kids,'' says Katz. ``They don't have the time
to plant themselves in front of the set like they do in July and
August.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Summer Olympics ran during the fall was Seoul
in 1988. Just like Sydney, the Games ran from mid-September to
early October. There was a 14-hour time delay. And in 1988, NBC's
ratings fell way short _ 20 percent _ of what it had promised to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, NBC had to start delivering make-goods, and crammed in
more ads in the second half of the Olympics, which upset viewers
even more.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's us. As cable channels have proliferated and more
entertainment options have entered homes, the slices of even the
big pies get thinner and thinner. ``Over the years, this
fragmentation of the audience has taken its toll,'' says DeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Katz: ``They put on these super-mega-production and they're
going to have to get used to the fact that people are busy doing
other things.''

 &HT;    Dr. Dot apologizes for 2 errors, loss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a routine grounder. The type Dot Richardson had handled
thousands of times before. Somehow, though, it ate her up.
</P>
<P>
   With the game scoreless in the 11th inning and a runner on
third, she bobbled the ball, then she threw too high to first,
allowing a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Then she did something even more surprising: She dropped a
throw, letting a second run in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't make those mistakes, we might still be playing,''
she said after the 3-hour, 40-minute game ended with Japan
celebrating a 2-1 victory and the Americans lamenting the end of
their 112-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time she made two errors in one game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably been a long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who turns 39 on Friday, is one of the most
accomplished players in international softball. Until Tuesday, she
was also considered one of its greatest pressure players.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss to Japan, the Americans stranded 20 _ leaving the
bases loaded in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings _ so there
were more than one player who could have won it.
</P>
<P>
   But only one who lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to everyone because I feel responsible,'' said
Richardson, an orthopedic surgeon. ``The two mistakes I made cost
us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it didn't do much harm to the defending Olympic
champions' medal hopes. The top four in the eight-team tournament
advance to the medal round, and the favored Americans (2-1) can
still finish first. They face China today.
</P>
<P>
   BEACH VOLLEYBALL
</P>
<P>
   Heidger-Wong: No tanking
</P>
<P>
   The Americans reacted defiantly to any implication that Rob
Heidger and partner Kevin Wong lost on purpose Tuesday in order to
secure an easier draw in the final 16 of the Olympic men's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to win the game. That's all there is to it,'' said
their coach, Dane Selznick. ``Volleyball is a game of momentum.
Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In their match against top-seeded Julien Prosser and Lee Zahner
of Australia, Heidger and Wong led 9-4 before losing 15-11.
</P>
<P>
   SAILING
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the wind
</P>
<P>
   Where's the wind?
</P>
<P>
   That shifty, patchy stuff that's puffed across Sydney Harbor and
out on the Pacific Ocean for three straight days isn't cutting it
for the Olympic regatta.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of catamarans flying across the water and sailors
struggling to keep them level has been replaced by the sight of
catamarans bobbing along and crewmen stretched out catching rays.
</P>
<P>
   The big Soling boats managed to get in two races on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very marginal sailing, really,'' said U.S. Soling
skipper Jeff Madrigali, who had a yo-yo day by finishing second and
15th to drop to ninth overall in the 16-boat fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last race finished in a dying breeze, in a lump,'' said
Madrigali, the 1996 bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze never got above 8 knots on the ocean. In the harbor,
it was even more placid.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL
</P>
<P>
   It's all about pitching
</P>
<P>
   Three games played, three earned runs allowed, three wins and
counting. The U.S. baseball team is onto something: Pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Ainsworth got the latest victory, pitching 6 2/3 innings of
a 6-2 win Tuesday over the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Ainsworth followed the lead of Ben Sheets and Jon Rauch, two
other high draft picks who made impressive starts in the first two
games and got things rolling.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Americans have been lightweights at the plate
so far, batting .267 as a team _ weak by Olympic standards.
</P>
<P>
   VOLLEYBALL
</P>
<P>
   On the brink of elimination
</P>
<P>
   One more defeat, and the U.S. men's volleyball team might as
well start packing for the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two teams in our pool aren't going to make it to the next
round,'' said outside hitter Mike Lambert, explaining both the
tournament setup and the American predicament. ``We've got three
matches left, and the way I look at it, we've got to at least win
two of those.''
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds of preliminaries, the United States is 0-2 and
struggling to keep up morale. They were soundly beaten by a better
Russian team, 25-18, 25-23, 21-25, 25-17.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. team must beat Yugoslavia on Thursday and South
Korea two days after that. A victory over Italy in the final Group
B match probably is asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   TRACK AND FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's workouts fast
</P>
<P>
   Recent workouts have indicated that Michael Johnson is fit
enough to break his own world record in the 400 meters on Monday,
the sprinter and his coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and cool temperatures, along with the physical drain of
running four rounds in four days could ultimately affect his speed.
But Johnson has run faster workouts than he did last August before
he set the world record of 43.18 seconds at the 1999 world track
and field championships in Seville, Spain, said his coach, Clyde
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Before Seville, Johnson ran a pair of 350-meter repeats, with
four minutes of rest, in 43.2 seconds and 42.80 seconds, Hart said.
Two days ago, Johnson did the repeats in 42.2 and 42.4, the coach
said. The sprinter has said that he believes he is capable of
running under 43 seconds, and desires to put his 400 record into
the same rarefied position as his remarkable time of 19.32 seconds
at 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have my 400 world record equal to my 200 world
record, so far out there that it's hard to understand,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   BOXING
</P>
<P>
   Americans are 8 for 8
</P>
<P>
   Jermain Taylor, an auto mechanic from Little Rock, Ark., knocked
down his Bulgarian opponent with a crunching right and became the
eighth American boxer to advance.
</P>
<P>
   As Dimitriy Usagin started to throw a right, the 22-year-old
Taylor whipped his right to the jaw and Usagin crashed to the
canvas. He struggled up, took a few tottering steps, fell into the
ring post, and the 156-pound bout was over with 10 seconds left in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The first seven Cubans to box also have won.
</P>
<P>
   TAEKWONDO
</P>
<P>
   Kim gets royal treatment
</P>
<P>
   Esther Kim, the taekwondo athlete from Houston who bowed out to
her best friend in the trials finals, has received the royal
treatment as guest of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Kay Poe
injured her knee in the semifinals and was a certain loser to Kim
for the Olympic team berth. Kim's decision to bow out, thus putting
Poe in the Games, drew the attention of Samaranch as well as media.
A round of talk shows was capped by ``Oprah.'' Said Kim, ``Still no
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   SPORTSMANSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Cheering for the underdogs
</P>
<P>
   As African athletes struggled during the first four days of the
Sydney Olympics, two won applause for showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Pognon, of Benin, lost 6-1, 6-1, to French Open
tennis champion Gustavo Kuerten in just 38 minutes. Yet the crowd
cheered Pognon, knowing he'd never played in a pro tournament
before.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moussambani, from Equatorial Guinea, received a standing
ovation at the aquatic center after winning his 100-meter freestyle
heat. He won only because his two rivals were disqualified after
false starts.
</P>
<P>
   Both athletes were nominated to participate under an Olympic
solidarity program encouraging sports in nontraditional countries.

 &HT;    Gore campaign barks back at critics of his comparison of
people-pet drug prices
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore's presidential campaign Tuesday barked
back at critics who claimed the vice president exaggerated the
difference between the cost of prescription drugs for his
mother-in-law and his arthritic dog.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign handed out a comparative drug price list to show
that that the cost per capsule for Lodine, an arthritis medicine,
was 231.5 percent higher than the charge for the same medicine,
called Etogesic in veterinary use, for the Gore's dog, Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Gore was harshly criticized by the campaign
of Republican contender George W. Bush after a Boston Globe story
called into question the Democratic candidate's claim on the
campaign trail that his mother-in-law's medication cost three times
as much as his dog's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had based his assessment not on actual drug bills, but on a
Congressional study of wholesale drug prices that found a 285
percent price differential between the cost of arthritis medicine
marketed for humans and canines.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign howled that the story underscored its
contention that Gore has trouble telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But after the media pounced on the story, Gore officials
produced the actual retail drug costs for his mother-in-law
Margaret Aitcheson, whose medication costs $2.13 a capsule and his
pet Labrador, whose treatments costs 92 cents a capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves the point that Al Gore was making that the drug is
much more for a person than for the dog,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said he did not know if Aitcheson had insurance to cover
her prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp continued to dog Gore for answers about how much
Aitcheson actually pays out of pocket, and why she doesn't use
cheaper generic equivalents of Lodine.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign even surveyed pharmacies in the Washington,
D.C., neighborhood where Aitcheson lives with her daughter, Tipper
Gore, and son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman claimed the survey found lower prices than
those Gore contends his mother-in-law pays.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed expanding Medicare to cover prescription drug
costs for the elderly and has made the issue of high drug prices a
staple of his stump speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Although he cited his mother-in-law's situation in his original
comments as a personal example, Gore defended actually using
numbers from a congressional study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not her, the issue is what seniors around the
country are paying and the wholesale price is between two and three
times as much as what is charged for pets,'' he told reporters
traveling with him.

ROSA AWAY FOR A WHILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Lee Hamilton, the afternoon drive-time
voice of XTRA Sports Radio, started talking last week about the
stalemate between the Los Angeles Kings and Jozef Stumpel by
saying, ``And with the devastating loss of Pavel Rosa. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Devastating is not the word the Kings used after Rosa, a popular
winger on the team two years ago, turned down a 10 percent raise
last spring to return this season. He recently signed with a team
in Finland, although the Kings retain his NHL rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they really had any plans for him,'' said Rosa's
agent Jiri Chra. ``He only played three games for them last year
and if they really wanted him they would have offered him more than
they did. Still, he was very sad. He is such a likeable young
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 23, became an immediate fan favorite two seasons ago when
he scored two goals in his first NHL game. He played 29 games for
the Kings that year, scoring four goals and 16 points. But when new
coach Andy Murray arrived last season, Rosa was sent to
minor-league Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good player but needs to work on his quickness,''
Murray said. ``We've had a very competitive camp and I don't know
if he would have made it. A year over there might help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL scouting report on the 5-foot-11, 188-pound Rosa, who
will play for HPK Hameenlinna in Finland, was ``not skilled enough
to be a skill player and not physical enough to be a physical
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, a native of the Czech Republic, was the Kings' third pick
and 50th overall in the 1995 draft. He scored 46 and 63 goals
during seasons in junior hockey but never made the jump after his
early success.
</P>
<P>
   His NHL salary last year was $850,000, although he received
considerably less playing for Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kings want to bring back Rosa after this season, it
could be difficult. He would have to clear waivers, and with two
expansion teams this year, he might be taken.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Kings do not play until Friday, against the Mighty
Ducks in Anaheim. They have scheduled a scrimmage for today that
will mark the first appearance of Craig Johnson, who did not play
in the first three exhibition games because of an ankle injury. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Laperriere, who centered the third line with Johnson last
season, is a week away after undergoing reconstructive surgery on
his right knee last April. Laperriere played much of the second
half with a torn ACL. ``It's doing pretty well for just 4 months
after surgery,'' Laperriere said. ``There is no pain right now.
We're just waiting for clearance from the doctors.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who reassigned 14 players to minor-league or junior
affiliates after Sunday's game, will make the rest of their roster
moves this weekend in order to get down to 23. ``We want to get the
group we'll take into the season together for about two weeks,''
Murray said. ``This weekend won't be easy. There has been a lot of
great competition for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray will keep two goaltenders but would not confirm that
Steve Passmore, acquired from Chicago last spring, will be the one
to go.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ He looked about as comfortable as a fish
that had been flipped up on a riverbank. He wasn't where he
belonged and he was desperate to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night in the women's Olympic gymnastics team finals,
Bela Karolyi _ that Romanian born bear of a coach who is all
mustache, bombast and golden result _ was kept confined to the
media seats in the Super Dome.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the man who guided Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton
and The Magnificent Seven to Olympic gold _ the man brought in just
nine months ago to revive a surprisingly moribund U.S. women's
gymnastic program _ was a forced to stay 100 feet from the floor
and at least half a football field away from the vault and balance
beam, the two apparatuses where the U.S. gymnasts had their most
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   While other coaches were down near the action, Karolyi _ because
he was listed as team coordinator not coach and consequently his
access badge kept him off the floor _ was left to long-distance
lament. The emotional, hands-on-coach could not pat athletes on the
back, bellow encouragement, whisper consolation or give them that
big Bela hug.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded you of Kevin Dyson, that Tennessee Titans receiver,
who caught what should have been the game-winning touchdown at the
end of January's Super Bowl. But with one final stride to the
score, he was tackled and left _ football in the fingertips of his
outstretched hand _ groping helplessly for the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Face contorted, pacing, pounding the table, pawing at the air
and pleading frustratingly to ears that did not hear, Karolyi was
stuck in the grandstands for more than two hours as the U.S.
gymnasts _ a team that lacked a dynamic presence and until Tuesday
night, some said, a common bond _ tried to find their way to a
medal.
</P>
<P>
   His team was just out of reach and he was out of sorts: ``Never
have I stood on my butt through the whole competition which is now
bleeding,'' said the master of tangled malaprop. ``I yelled to my
team to go for it, to give it their all. If they want to laugh, to
jump, to hug, do it. You've got to take the people with you. Do it
now. Now is (sic) never ... Now is never.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Now was never.
</P>
<P>
   In the end ,the U.S. women, like the Titans, came up short.
After floundering soullessly in sixth place after Sunday's
preliminaries, they improved enough to finish fourth behind the
gold medal Romanians, Russia and finally China.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years makes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Olympics, Karolyi literally held the U.S. women's
gymnasts in his arms. In one of the most indelible moments of
American Olympic history, Karolyi scooped Kerri Strug, his injured
golden girl, into his arms at the team finals and carried her to
the winners podium. The Magnificent Seven, as the United States
gymnasts were called, had just won the nation's first team gold
medal in Olympics history.
</P>
<P>
   Strug _ after a Karolyi pep talk _ had gritted her way through
the pain of two torn tendons in her left ankle, bolted down the
runway, caromed across the vault and landed with perfect authority
on both feet. With the medal secure, she quietly curled her one leg
upward until she looked like a flamingo, then collapsed in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Strug's uncompromising grit, America had its greatest
Olympics team victory since the U.S. hockey team upset the Soviet
Union at Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   But what many thought would be a watershed moment in women's
gymnastics, ended up a glorious one-night stand. After Atlanta,
Shannon Miller, Strug and Amanda Border hustled off to college,
marriage, or, for Miller, both. Dominique Dawes eventually retired,
as did Karolyi once again.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new talent that rose through the ranks filled in
perfectly, but some never lived up to its billing. And last
October, the depth of the problem was made crystal clear when the
United States finished sixth in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, USA Gymnastics officials convinced Karolyi to leave
his Houston ranch and return to right the ship. The SOS call was
met with resentment by many top gymnastic coaches, each of whom was
mentoring Olympic hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them consider Karolyi a self promoter, a grandstander.
They are right, but the bottom line is he gets results.
</P>
<P>
   As he sifted through the candidates for this Olympic Team, he
noticed some differences from '96: ``That team had a very strong
backbone. There was an intensity, a work ethic, a way to produce.
This generation does not have the backbone of before. There wasn't
the goal setting. They had to learn to take coaching. They had to
learn to work as a team, to act as a team, to think as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   After the team trials, Karolyi and the two coaches of record
picked a team that few could quibble over. It had a new star in
Elise Ray and two Mag Seven veterans in Amy Chow and Dawes, who
came back from retirement to make her third straight Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi though was listed as a team coordinator, not a coach and
a USA Gymnastics rule states that only coaches with an athlete on
the team can be on the floor during competition. To his surprise,
Karolyi was made to sit in the media area. While USA gymnastics
president Bob Colarossi defended the decision _ ``We hired Bela to
coach the coaches, not the kids,'' _ the decision was criticized in
some circles.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi had been brought in to help, then handcuffed just when
he was needed most. After the athletes gave an uninspired
performance Sunday, Karolyi, minced no words:. ``I told them, `Hey,
let's get some attitude. High five if you want to, show your
emotion, but get out of your shell. Don't play it safe.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the athletes responded some _ at least they
acknowledged each other Tuesday _ Karolyi felt he should have been
on the floor with them.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, team coach Kelli Hill _ coach of Dawes and Ray _ was
miffed at Karolyi's insinuations: ``This is Bela. He is a knee jerk
reactor. At this point, we're just learning to roll with (his)
punches. I don't think it would have made a difference if he was
out there or not ... I know how to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawes admitted Karolyi is the fire behind the team, but said she
didn't think his presence on the floor would have been enough to
inch the team up to the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think we did fine tonight and I wanted the others
to know it,'' the 23-year-old Dawes said. ``Before we left the
floor, I told them we didn't have to have a medal to remember how
good this experience was. I said, 'Believe me, we don't need a
medal to feel good.'''
</P>
<P>
   How things have changed in four years.

COMMENTARY: GENDER GYRATIONS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ad is anything but subtle or subliminable.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's hand, representing Hillary Clinton's, reaches out with
an electric prod, digs into the most sensitive part of the male
anatomy, and _ bzzzzz!!
</P>
<P>
   The New York Conservative Party attack ad, which has been
running since Sunday, including twice during ``Meet the Press,''
depicts Hillary as a castrating rhymes-with-rich.
</P>
<P>
   The text is about how she got her hands on her (henpecked)
husband's health care plan and messed it up. The visual is an old
children's game, ``Operation,'' which has a flat figure of an
alarmed-looking naked male patient, with an electric
tweezer/scalpel attached to let you play doctor and extract bones
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Except, in this case, Hillary is ominously portrayed doing the
``operating'' with a pulsating instrument of torture. (Bzzzz!!)
</P>
<P>
   Little Ricky is desperately trying to prove he's manly enough
for the New York Senate job by painting Hillary as not womanly
enough _ i.e., a cold, bitter, biting harpy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, female candidates have to prove they're tough enough.
Hillary Clinton is in the odd position of having to prove she's
tender enough.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone failed to get the Medusa message, the New York
GOP chairman, William Powers, has sent out a new fund-raising
letter that reads, ``I have high hopes that you'll help us ... stop
this ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman
from fooling voters.'' He ends: ``Hillary Clinton is an angry
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has American politics been so fraught with gender
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   The national race may be decided by a kiss. Al Gore's convention
smooch won the hearts of all those female voters who had been
playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday W., who was nicknamed ``Lip'' in high school but only
for his smart mouth, played hardball on lip lock. Wooing the
women's vote on ``Oprah,'' he came out and gave the surprised talk
show host a buss on the cheek _ one-upping Al Gore, who merely gave
Oprah a half-hug last week, prompting her flirtatious request, ``No
kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   W. also replied ``Kiss to my wife,'' when asked to name the best
gift he had ever given.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential race may turn on a lingering kiss, the
Senate race may turn on a wagging finger.
</P>
<P>
   The debate last week left Hillary and Ricky both trying to
portray themselves as victims of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who had liked the glowing Long Island
congressman recoiled from his glowering performance in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a women's lunch on Monday, Clinton mocked Lazio's
alpha bits: ``I knew I was going to share a stage. I didn't think I
was going to share a podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent Tuesday defending himself for acting like a bully at
the pulpit. ``The idea that somehow that there's a double standard
because you're a man or a woman, and you can't make a point
forcefully if you're a man, and the person you're making the point
with is a woman, I just think that's sexist,'' he said, adding, ``I
don't think people in the Senate worry about whether you're a man
or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, of course, it is conservatives who make the case
that men and women have to be viewed differently, and liberals who
make the case that men and women should be treated the same.
</P>
<P>
   Most pathetically, the Lazio campaign sent reporters an old
picture of Hillary, from her days as Arkansas first lady, wagging a
finger at a political opponent to show that she, too, could be a
space invader.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio Just Doesn't Get It. His race is charged with gender, but
his problem at the debate was more a matter of sense and manners.
</P>
<P>
   Once Tim Russert had made Clinton uncomfortable by showing an
old tape of her defending her feckless husband, the smart thing for
Lazio to do was be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A man who felt confident of his own masculinity, of course,
would never have marched over to bluster at the first lady. It's
impossible to imagine Ronald Reagan trying to cow a female opponent
with such muscular histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should stop worrying about Hillary as the angry
women, and start worrying about Ricky as the angry man.

JUDGE ORDERS FEDERAL OVERSIGHT FOR NEW YORK CITY AIDS SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT 28 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal district judge in Brooklyn ruled Tuesday
that a New York City agency had failed to provide adequate services
for thousands of people with AIDS and ordered the agency placed
under federal oversight for three years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson ruled that the
agency, the city's Division of AIDS Services and Income Support,
had ``chronically and systematically'' delayed or terminated
subsistence benefits, emergency housing, rent assistance, food
stamps, Medicaid and other services that it administers for about
25,000 people who have AIDS or who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson found that the failures of the agency, an arm of the
city Human Resources Administration, had ``devastating
consequences.'' He wrote that in many instances the agency had
terminated benefits like food stamps with no notice. His ruling
came after a bench trial ended in June in a civil lawsuit brought
in 1995 by Housing Works Inc., an advocacy group that has long
sparred with the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in court
over city AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched every day as our clients have suffered under this
callous, awful administration,'' said Armen Merjian, staff lawyer
for Housing Works. ``This is the medication they depend upon to
live, the food upon which they depend to feed themselves and their
families, the housing they need to find shelter and fight off this
mortal illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Delilah Howard was typical, Merjian said. Howard,
47, a Housing Works client unable to work because of her illness,
said in an interview Tuesday that she had found an apartment she
could afford with her housing subsidy, but which she was unable to
rent because the city agency took more than a month to provide
assistance. On another occasion, Howard said she found out from a
grocery story checkout clerk that her food stamps had been
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   In the future under Johnson's ruling, Howard would be able to
take her complaints to the federal monitor. Johnson appointed
Cheryl L. Pollak, the U.S. Magistrate Court judge for the Eastern
District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak will not monitor day to day activities or polices of the
city agency. But she will receive complaints and may recommend
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Merjian said, ``the way we hope it works is it
won't be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Housing Works and other advocates would have to devise a
system for reporting complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's attorney, said Tuesday night that the
city would appeal the decision. The opinion, Hess said, ``is very
flawed, with all kinds of mistakes,'' and is based on facts from
the mid-1990s that have little to do with how the agency now
operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City provides more money and more services for
AIDS-related people than any other city in the nation,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   But Merjian called the ruling a ``gigantic victory'' and said it
could affect people with other disabilities because the case was
brought under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and the
Rehabilitation Act.

   NET OUTAGE: UCLA is closing football practice to everyone but
the media after trick plays the team was practicing for its game
against Michigan turned up on an Internet site's message board last
week. Coach Bob Toledo was miffed to learn that there had been a
posting of a play in which quarterback Ryan McCann threw a lateral
to split end Brian Poli-Dixon, who threw a long pass to receiver
Jon Dubravac. The Bruins ran the play successfully against Michigan
for a 32-yard gain, setting up a first-half field goal. At Georgia
Tech, reporters are given complete access to practice with the
understanding that they not write in detail about trick plays.
Georgia closes practices to everyone after 15 minutes.

RICHARD HOLMAN, 77, FOUNDER OF WALL STREET TRANSCRIPT

 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard A. Holman, an inventive publisher and editor
who foresaw the market for specialized business information
services and was involved in an important legal test case to
distinguish true business journalism from tout sheets, died Sept.
18 at New York University Hospital. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Holman was being treated for acute myelogenous leukemia, said
his daughter, Beth Holman.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief career in investment banking, Holman in 1963
founded The Wall Street Transcript, a tabloid-sized weekly
newspaper filled with business interviews, stock recommendations,
transcripts of business round-table discussions and information
from government regulators. He believed that investment
professionals and casual investors were willing to pay dearly for
information that would help them pick stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most newspapers sold for less than a quarter, he
charged $5 a copy and $180 for a one-year subscription. The
specialized and sometimes technical information presented in the
newspaper, which is still available on paper and online, presaged
the many detailed financial services available today.
</P>
<P>
   But Holman also was engaged in a series of skirmishes with
government regulators that acted like a catalyst on his
iconoclastic spirit. In 1962, before The Transcript was founded,
the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended his
registration as a broker for violating fair-practice rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, The Transcript started an editorial campaign
critical of the SEC. After one of The Transcript editorials was
inserted in the Congressional Record, the SEC began an
investigation to determine whether The Wall Street Transcript was a
legitimate news publication or was actually giving investment
advice, which would require registration under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   When the agency subpoenaed the paper's records, including
reporters' notes, Holman, a lawyer, dug in his heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't believe any bureaucrat has the right to haul up a
reporter or publisher and grill him about how he got a news
story,'' Holman told an interviewer in 1968. ``We're fighting this
thing all the way down the pike.''

<P>
   The case dragged on for a decade, and certain constitutional
aspects were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, in 1978, a
federal court judge ruled in Holman's behalf. The judge found the
SEC's approach was overly broad and that as defined by regulations,
The Transcript was not an investment adviser. Legal scholars
consider it an important case and an issue that has resurfaced with
current Web sites that make stock recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Holman was born in Manhattan, the son of a former New York state
assemblyman, Abraham Goodman, and Daisy Mintz Goodman Holman. He
graduated from Cornell University and served as an Army
intelligence officer in Japan and the Philippines during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   He remained publisher of The Wall Street Transcript until
selling the publication in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Holman is survived by his wife, Mary, and three children, Beth,
Jonathan and Jeffrey, from his first marriage, to Eleanor Mae
Margolis. &QL;

EX-IRS LAWYER FACES TAX-EVASION CHARGE IN STOCK CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Calif., Utah, Fla., N.J.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former IRS lawyer and four other men were indicted Tuesday on
charges of tax evasion and other crimes stemming from what
prosecutors described as a stock swindle in which the profits were
funneled through offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A 37-count indictment, unsealed in Las Vegas, charged Max C.
Tanner, a securities lawyer who had worked for the IRS, with tax
evasion, money laundering, mail fraud and failing to report $4
million of income in 1996 and 1997. Half of that was gains from
selling shares of Maid Aide Inc., a tiny cleaning service in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contends that in September 1996 Tanner began a
scheme to defraud investors by manipulating the price of Maid Aide
shares. The stock jumped to $9.37 a share in 1998 after a meritless
news release was issued earlier that year that Maid Aide was near a
deal to acquire a Florida trucking company, the indictment said.
The trucking deal never went through, and the shares fell to 13
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner's lawyer, Brian Sun of O'Neill, Lysaght &AMP; Sun in Santa
Monica, Calif., said he had not seen the indictment but that his
client would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Tanner created a company in
Vancouver, British Columbia, and sent money and documents through
FedEx to Canada and then to the Cayman Islands to circumvent tax
and mail fraud laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner paid a kickback of 5 percent of his profits to Kevin J.
Ruggiero, a securities broker from Lyndhurst, N.J., who ran the
Empire State Building office of Baxter, Banks &AMP; Smith, a Florida
securities dealer, the indictment said. Ruggiero used unlicensed
agents to sell Maid Aide shares through the Baxter, Banks brokerage
firm, according to the indictment. No one answered the telephone
Tuesday night at the St. Petersburg, Fla., office of the brokerage
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted on conspiracy charges were three stock promoters:
Dennis D. Evans of Las Vegas; Kenneth W. Kurtz of Sandy, Utah; and
Mark A. Taylor of Brooksville, Fla. Evans declined to comment
Tuesday night. The other two men could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   After paying the unlicensed sales agents commissions of up to 70
percent of the price of each share of Maid Aide sold, the
indictment said, the five men pocketed about $3 million in profits.

FEDERAL JUDGES OPPOSE BILL LIMITING REIMBURSEMENTS FOR SOME SEMINAR
EXPENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judges who set policy for the federal court
system voted Tuesday to oppose a bill setting new limits on the
ability of judges to attend privately sponsored seminars and
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the Judicial Conference of the United States, a
27-member group that held its semi-annual meeting at the Supreme
Court Tuesday, came in response to a bill recently introduced in
the Senate to prohibit federal judges from accepting ``anything of
value'' _ meaning reimbursement of expenses _ ``in connection with
a seminar.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban was ``overly broad'' and raised ``potential
constitutional issues,'' including the prospect of government
censorship, the Judicial Conference said in a resolution adopted
during its regular closed-door session. The resolution said the
bill, sponsored by two Democratic senators, John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, could have the
unintended effect of deterring judges' participation at bar
association and law school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators introduced the bill on July 27 in response to a
report by a public interest law firm here, Community Rights
Counsel, that criticized federal judges for attending expense-paid
seminars on economic and environmental issues sponsored by private
groups that oppose government regulation. The bill would increase
funding for the Federal Judicial Center, an arm of the court system
that conducts research and training, to cover direct reimbursement
of judges' expenses for attending ``seminars that are conducted in
a manner so as to maintain the public's confidence in an unbiased
and fair-minded judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference at the Supreme Court Tuesday,
Chief Judge Ralph Winter Jr. of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York, said the bill would oblige the judicial center
to assume an unwanted role as a potential censor of the content of
programs. He said that the bill would require the center to examine
not only the content and source of money for all seminars, but also
the ``litigation activities'' of the sponsor and of anyone making a
presentation as part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, the chairman of the Judicial Conference's executive
committee, said the proposal appeared to call for ``explicit
content regulation'' that would ``very much alter the institutional
role of the Federal Judicial Center'' and would impose ``a very
draconian ban in one of the most sensitive areas of our public
life, the marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report accompanying the resolution, the executive committee
said the bill was a hasty and ``inappropriate response to a highly
complex question'' that Congress should not address without first
holding hearings and inviting public participation. ``This is not a
time for hasty legislation that may well be more dangerous than the
concerns it is designed to allay,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Winter said the Judicial Conference
would not necessarily oppose all congressional intervention, but
that the judges could not respond to narrower proposals that had
not yet been put forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Conference concluded two years ago that judges
should not participate in seminars if the sponsors were involved or
likely to be involved in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are required to report reimbursements as a gift on their
annual financial disclosure forms.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ He has broken two global standards already
in these Olympics with a freestyle stroke so supple and silky it
makes swimming fans swoon. Pieter van den Hoogenband is raiding Ian
Thorpe's house of its records and its gold and doing it none too
stealthily.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, van den Hoogenband took Thorpe's world record away in
the 200-meter freestyle and stole the Olympic gold medal, too.
Twenty-four hours later, he was back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   With 17,500 people watching, the 22-year-old Dutchman made off
with Aussie Michael Klim's three-day-old world record in the
100-meter freestyle. Swimming in the semifinals, van den Hoogenband
was timed in 47.84 to set the ninth world record of this meet (the
Australian 800- meter freestyle relay team ended Tuesday's session
by producing the 10th global standard with a five-and-a-half second
win over the U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   When Klim posted a 48.18 in the two-lap sprint while leading off
Australia's victorious 400-meter freestyle relay, people gaped.
They gasped inside the Sydney International Aquatic Centre when van
den Hoogenband plundered the 48-second barrier.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder why. Between June of 1986 and July of 2000,
the world record in the 100 dropped .53 seconds. In the past three
days, it has been lowered .37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fathom how fast that is,'' said American Neil Walker,
who finished third in van den Hoogenband's heat at 49.04.
</P>
<P>
   Said van den Hoogenband, who finished fourth in the 100
freestyle at the 1996 Summer Games with a time of 49.13, ``Breaking
48 seconds, that's making history. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other top performers on the fourth of eight days of the
competition were American Tom Malchow, who won the gold medal in
the 200 butterfly (1:55.35 to break his day-old Olympic record);
Susie O'Neill, who gave Australia its first gold medal on the
women's side, in the 200 freestyle, and Yana Klochkova of Ukraine,
who won the 200 individual medley to complete her sweep of the I.M.
events.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, 17, is the first Australian male swimmer to win three
gold medals in a single Olympics. He will go for a fourth gold
Saturday in the 400 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, swimming clearly has merged onto
technology's superhighway and gotten up to speed on equipment
(bodysuits; wave-less, chlorine-less pools), nutrition
(supplements; protein-rich diets) and cross-training (better
results through tae-bo).
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband has been leaving his fingerprints all over
the scene of international meets for a few years now. He was a
bronze medalist in the 200 freestyle at the 1998 World
Championships and won six gold medals last summer at the European
Championships, beating Russian sprint ace Alex Popov in the 50 and
100 freestyles in the process.
</P>
<P>
   As if beating Thorpe on one night and Klim's record the next
wasn't enough of a caper, van den Hoogenband anchored the
Netherlands' bronze-medal-winning 800 freestyle relay in 1:44.88,
the fastest split ever recorded by over a half-a-second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very strong,'' said van den Hoogenbrand, whose mother
Astrid competed (but did not advance to the final) in the 800
freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympics. ``So I knew I could do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves just one question: Can anyone else?

having written one of the most entertaining and influential sports
books ever published, entitled ``Ball Four.'' ``Ball Four,'' an
astonishingly candid look at ballplayers' lives, has just been
updated for it's 30th anniversary under a new title ``Ball Four:
The Final Pitch''. If the original edition was about wins, losses,
and life on the road, groupies and all, then ``Final Pitch'' is
very much about wounds, losses, and lessons that far transcend the

KAISER, UNIONS IN ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After five months of negotiations, Kaiser
Permanente and a coalition of health care unions Tuesday released
the details of the largest-ever contract agreement in the health
care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the five-year tentative agreement, which is
being voted on by 64,000 union members nationwide this week,
workers will receive annual 4 percent across-the-board wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Registered nurses, nurse practitioners and physician assistants
will receive 4 percent to 6 percent annual increases, said Tom
O'Conner, a spokesman with the Service Employees International
Union in Los Angeles, the nation's largest health care union.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes a number of improvements to employee
health benefits, including new or improved coverage for dependents
and domestic partners, prescription drugs, and durable medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely happy that we have reached the tentative
agreement with the unions,'' said Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson.
``Since this is a national agreement, we want union members to have
had a chance to analyze the contracts before we comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Kaiser officials anticipate that the tentative
agreement will be ratified by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 28-person negotiating committee is conducting the contract
vote at facilities throughout Southern California,'' said Dave
Bullock, president of Local 399. ``They are telling members to look
at it closely and hopefully they will see it as beneficial to
Kaiser workers and patients as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting is expected to be completed by Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone is pleased with the outcome of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerns me is that agreements reached in the past seem
to have quieted the ability of the union to complain about
quality-of-care problems at Kaiser,'' said Jamie Court, director of
the Santa Monica-based Consumers for Quality Care.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the tentative agreement also includes the
structure for joint management decision-making throughout the
organization, covering areas such as staffing, quality, service,
finance and budget, education and training, health and safety, and
pension investments.
</P>
<P>
   O'Conner said the new pact will cover Kaiser Permanente
employees in California, Oregon, Colorado, Ohio, Missouri, Kansas,
Texas, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Service Employees International Union Local 399 represents
13,000 Kaiser employees in Los Angeles and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also sets a new standard for staffing, he said.
Joint labor-management staffing teams will create an annual
staffing plan for each department covered by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will cover mutually acceptable numbers, mix and
qualifications of staff in each area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Performance-sharing program: The agreement recognizes that as
workers have an increased ability _ through joint decision making _
to impact organizational success they should share in performance
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The payouts from the program are set at 1 percent for year three
of the contract, 2 percent for year four and 3 percent for year
five. The actual amount of the payouts will depend on the
achievement of targets, by region, that will be mutually set by
unions and management.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health benefit eligibility will be set at 20-plus hours per
week. Health care spending accounts will allow all employees to set
aside pretax dollars to pay out-of pocket health expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ A joint labor-management committee will consider pension
improvements for members covered under a defined benefit plan. They
will study an improved pension multiplier, and an improved early
retirement option. The preretirement survivor benefit will be
expanded to include domestic partners and qualified dependents,
which will benefit many women and single parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dependent care spending accounts will be set up effective Jan.
1, 2001, allowing employees to set aside up to $5,000 per year in
pretax dollars to pay for eligible dependent care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the economic benefits, we are elated over the $1.8
million to be set aside to train our workers to upgrade their
skills,'' Bullock said. ``The money will allow our members to
become better workers at Kaiser and to be promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Court said agreements like these ``buy the complicity of the
union with a little cash and some rhetoric about partnership.
Patients need to know that their caregivers will go public when
there is a quality-of-care problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Oakland, Kaiser Permanente is a not-for-profit,
group-practice repayment program serving 8.5 million members in 17
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of unions included the International Federal of
Professional and Technical Engineers, Kaiser Permanente Nurse
Anesthetists Association, SEIU, AFSCME, UFCW and the Steelworkers,
among others.

<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ A Westlake Village firm with star
power behind it launched a service Tuesday that lets women get a
second opinion on their breast images electronically.
</P>
<P>
   With Whoopi Goldberg among its spokespeople, iMammogram.com will
offer, for a $75 fee, computer analysis of breast images taken by
radiologists. Danna Campbell, president and chief executive Officer
of iMammogram.com, hopes that the service known as CloserLook will
catch some of the estimated 21 percent of breast cancer not
detected by the physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It marks specific areas that might need a closer look,''
Campbell said. ``It's almost like a second look for the
radiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said she hopes that insurance coverage and economy of
scale will eventually drive down the price of CloserLook, though
radiologists say they are already drastically under-reimbursed for
the costs of the mammograms themselves. Dr. Lawrence Bassett, Iris
Cantor Professor of Breast Imaging at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center,
said CloserLook's technology could have long-term benefits, but she
harbors some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has some advantage in that the computer doesn't tend to get
tired,'' Bassett said. ``However, we have to understand it doesn't
replace an experienced radiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   CloserLook uses computer-aided detection to find potential
malignancies in breast tissue. Women who want the service can
request that their radiologists send their mammograms to iMammogram
for analysis. The company then sends the original film and
notations of possible areas of concern back to the radiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said iMammogram is in the midst of setting up meetings
with insurers to consider covering the service. In 1998, 175,000
new cases of breast cancer were detected in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk to anybody who doesn't know somebody who's
affected so it seems like every woman would support this,''
Campbell said.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Marion Jones might win her five gold medals.
Michael Johnson might establish a new world record in the 400
meters. Maurice Greene might turn out to be the earth's fastest
human being. And Pieter van den Hoogenband and Ian Thorpe might
already have pushed each other to dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   But I saw the most dominant athlete in the XXVII Olympics on
Tuesday night when I observed Venus Williams make Slovakia's
Henrieta Nagyova her 27th consecutive victim, 6-2, 6-2 at the New
South Wales Tennis Centre.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt she's the best women's tennis player in the world, as
she proved last summer by beating Lindsay Davenport for the
Wimbledon title and proved again a couple of weeks ago by beating
Davenport for the U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   And she'll continue to prove her mastery of the game in her
first Olympics _ I'll brazenly pick her to win the gold medal _
because she's now playing at a level unmatched in sports with the
notable exception of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   She is a mere 20 years old and she has a sweet voice and a soft
smile, when she isn't on the tennis court dismantling opponents
with a methodical efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   She is 6-foot-2 and 160 pounds, but the weight is distributed so
tightly on her muscled anatomy that she elicited whistles from the
crowd when she took off her warm-up jacket and revealed her
cardinal-and-gold, tight-fitting, two-piece outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess they thought I was good-looking,'' said Williams
with a smile after her 53-minute demolition of Nagyova.
</P>
<P>
   She was in a glad mood even though she was forced to play her
match at the ungodly time of 10:15 p.m., not exactly a start
befitting one of her exalted status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once played a match that late before at the Australian
Open,'' she said. ``It's no big thing. I had no trouble being
focused because I've made a commitment to be here, so mentally I
was ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, did Venus Williams compete, bounding around the court
making extraordinary returns with her incredibly quick reflexes and
long arms, slamming her powerful serves by her bewildered foe,
converting her backhand and forehand shots with almost a cloying
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``How have you gotten so good?'' a reporter wanted to know
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's my attitude,'' answered the native of Compton.
``I was always a great player and a great athlete and a good
person. But it was just my attitude that has improved more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much better can you become?'' another journalist wanted to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis and the others will cringe
when they hear Venus Williams' answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of room for improvement,'' she said. ``I
think because I'm so athletic I can just keep on improving
throughout my whole career. I think a good example of that was
Martina Navratilova. She just transcended tennis as far as coming
into one era and going into another and just getting better.
Martina was a great athlete and so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams is staying at a suburban hotel here with her
mother, sisster Serena and another sister _ her father is absent _
but she hasn't ventured out of it because of her burgeoning fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of afraid to go into the city, because there might be
a lot of people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the Olympic opening ceremonies last Friday night, she
was mobbed by many of the different nations' athletes seeking her
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with success, there has come the inevitable criticism.
The one-time enfant terrible of the sport, John McEnroe, of all
people, recently chided her and Serena in an article in a London
newspaper, claiming they had no respect for anyone in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't know John McEnroe,'' she said when someone
brought up the subject. ``So I find it difficult to form an opinion
on someone that I don't know and I find it difficult that he has
formed an opinion on myself and my sister seeing he doesn't even
know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter wondered if Venus Williams' outspokenness _
she's not bashful about reciting her athletic virtues _ was the
problem. It was nearing midnight and it would have been
understandable if Venus Williams had ignored the question, or
answered angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she smiled and said, ``I think because I'm honest all
the time in my answers that some people can't handle it. I guess
you can't always tell the truth. People don't like to hear the
truth. I think I've always been a nice person and pretty positive
on everything and everyone. It just seems people are always
knocking me and my sister and my dad, for one reason or another. So
in a world full of negatives, sometimes it's nice to have something
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   And a huge positive for Venus Williams these days is playing
tennis and being a part of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Olympic gold to me is just as big as winning a
Grand Slam tournament,'' she said. ``When you see all these
athletes trying their best and then breaking out in tears when they
win gold medals, it makes you want to win a gold medal yourself.
And that's what I plan to do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The finger-pointing has begun in the failed case against Wen Ho
Lee, and there is plenty of blame to go around.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, strangely positioning himself as an outsider,
said he was troubled by the actions of the Justice Department and
FBI in detaining Lee without bail prior to trial. Clinton has
called for an inquiry of unspecified dimensions by unspecified
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, many of whom denounced Attorney General
Janet Reno for insufficient zeal in going after Lee, now want to
find out how things could have gone so wrong in prosecuting him.
</P>
<P>
   The press, notably The New York Times, played an active role in
stirring the investigative pot.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, who deserves blame? Only one entity had the power to
launch a criminal investigation, to prosecute and deprive someone
of liberty before trial: the executive branch. Accountability for
what went wrong must be placed squarely at the feet of the FBI and
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the FBI and prosecutors are partners in
investigation and prosecution. But this relationship has been
impaired in recent years by the bureau's proclivity in high-profile
cases to air differences in public, seeking political gain at the
Justice Department's expense.
</P>
<P>
   This was the case when Louis Freeh, the FBI director,
embarrassed Reno by urging her to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate possible violations of political fund-raising laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wen Ho Lee case, the bureau went public early and often,
most notably over the attorney general's decision in 1997 not to
approve FBI requests to seek authority for placing a national
security wiretap on Lee's phones. Reno took enormous heat for that
decision. In retrospect, her ruling _ that the evidence was too
fragmentary and dated _ seems to have been correct.
</P>
<P>
   Even though FBI officials discovered in 1999 that Lee had
mysteriously downloaded sensitive information, it is not clear why
they chose to press ahead with its 59-count indictment against him,
accusing him of gathering, retaining and receiving restricted
information.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to imagine that such unprecedented
charges _ the first-ever criminal charges under the Atomic Energy
Act _ would have been made if Lee had not been previously targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The government's claim that it wanted to solve the mystery of
what happened to the information is not compelling: Criminal
charges are rarely brought to solve mysteries and, as the judge
pointed out, the government has yet to explain why Lee's offers,
before his arrest, to explain the missing tapes were not sufficient
to meet the government's legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's unflagging commitment to prove Lee guilty of something
made it extremely difficult for the Justice Department to resist
throwing the book at him. In the end, it was the department's job
to resist, despite the intense pressure. That is the crucible in
which a prosecutor proves himself, asking tough questions, pointing
out weaknesses to aggressive investigators and, if necessary,
saying ``no'' to prosecuting a case that shouldn't be brought. That
is where prosecutors in the Wen Ho Lee case appear to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The experience proves that an aggressive FBI and compliant
prosecutors are a risky combination. We can only hope that the
self-scrutiny and investigations to come yield meaningful warnings
to the next generation of agents, prosecutors and others in pursuit
of a hot case. &QL;

Justice Department from 1994 to 1999.)

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON __ ``There ought to be a law.'' That's what many
people are saying as the Firestone-Ford tire debacle unfolds. But
what kind of law would help?
</P>
<P>
   After hearings in both the House and the Senate, Congress is now
searching for ways to make sure something like this never happens
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee is scheduled to consider a bill
this week that would, among other things, make it a federal crime
``knowingly and willfully to introduce a motor vehicle or motor
vehicle equipment into interstate commerce with a safety-related
defect'' that harms or kills someone. The measure, introduced by
Sen. John McCain, the committee chairman, would carry a 10-year
maximum jail term.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter has introduced an even broader bill that
would make it a federal crime to knowingly manufacture and sell any
product ``dangerous to human life and limb beyond the reasonable
and accepted risk with such or similar products lacking such a
flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, these bills may seem perfectly reasonable. In
fact, you may wonder why no such law already exists. A closer look,
however, reveals that they could have troubling repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are vague and overly broad _ so much so that they
may be impossible to enforce. What precisely does it mean to
``knowingly'' introduce a product that has a safety defect? What
exactly constitutes a ``reasonable and accepted risk''?
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives seem to be the target, but as the measures are
written, almost anyone in a manufacturing plant, from design
engineers to assembly workers, could fall into the liability net.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Specter's bill becomes law, one can imagine a deluge
of criminal trials. It is difficult to name a product that could
not harm someone in some manner. Cars kill. Airplanes crash. Power
tools maim. And tires blow, as when drivers leave them on their
vehicles long beyond their normal life.
</P>
<P>
   All business decisions involve trade-offs. Car manufacturers
could make a vehicle far safer than those now on the road. But it
would be more like a tank and cost millions of dollars. Almost no
consumer would buy it or be able to drive it.
</P>
<P>
   Subjecting every engineer or corporate executive to criminal
penalties could threaten the ability of companies to deliver
products that American consumers demand.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly impossible task of pinning down whether a company or
employee intended harm is one reason why this country has strict
civil liability. Civil liability, unlike criminal liability, does
not depend on actual negligence or intent.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, if you make a defective product, you are liable for
any harm it causes. This works. Every producer is kept on notice of
its duty to make safe products.
</P>
<P>
   There is another good reason why civil law is more effective
than criminal law in this area. In a criminal case, the standard of
proof is very high _ beyond a reasonable doubt. In civil cases, the
standard is preponderance of the evidence. Thus it's easier to get
results with civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   The clear distinction between civil and criminal law provides
invaluable clarity in setting priorities and guarding public
safety. Civil law focuses on correcting wrongs and satisfying the
demands of aggrieved parties. Criminal law focuses almost
exclusively on punishment. Tilting toward criminalization in areas
traditionally covered by civil law leaves little room for
compromise, restitution and correction of past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation, for example, would trigger an entirely
different response from corporations than a civil suit or
regulatory investigation does. With so much at stake, voluntary
cooperation would likely grind to a halt, and the industry would
probably stop exchanging information with government regulators.
This lack of communication would help no one, especially not
consumers, who would likely be left in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   With an election looming, members of Congress are surely looking
for some way to do something about the Firestone-Ford problem.
Criminalizing civil law is certainly ``something,'' but it's
definitely not the right thing.

administrations.)

 WASHINGTON: Baucus, D-Mont. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of Tuesday's vote was never in doubt. The fierce
lobbying that pitted corporate America against organized labor and
religious groups in the run-up to the House's approval of the
measure in May, by a vote of 237-197, never materialized in the
upper chamber because all sides knew the question in the pro-trade
Senate was never if the measure would pass, only when and by how
much.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters still faced a delicate procedural and political
balancing act in the Senate, where lawmakers zealously guard their
prerogatives and a lone senator has the power to delay the most
popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation said it was essential to press for a
measure free of amendments because, they said, there was not enough
time to reconcile an amended Senate bill with the House version
before Congress adjourned for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had the votes, but what was difficult was that
there was no margin for error in the Senate,'' said Steve
Ricchetti, a deputy White House chief of staff who was Clinton's
point man for the bill in the Senate. ``It had to pass exactly as
it passed out of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   So supporters adopted a low-key strategy aimed at leaching from
Senate consideration all of the volatile politics that enmeshed the
House vote. Tactically, that meant having Clinton project enough
support to show he still cared deeply about the bill, but not
raising the rhetoric high enough to prompt some foe to take the
bill hostage to delay it.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's original point man on the bill, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, left the Cabinet in June to head Gore's
presidential election campaign, some supporters fretted that
momentum was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., balked at scheduling a vote
before the July 4 recess, arguing that the Senate had more pressing
business in wrapping up many of the 13 must-pass spending bills
that keep the government running. ``If we go into September, our
chances for passage drop preciptiously,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
the minority leader, warned in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, critics seemed to have a point. Just as the
vote in the House created unusual political alliances between
liberal labor groups and conservative religious organizations in
opposition to the bill, the Senate battle produced odd political
couplings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., perhaps the Senate's most liberal
member, teamed up with Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the chamber's
staunchest conservatives, to back amendments on human rights,
religious freedom and prison labor in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the gloomy predictions proved wrong. Lott and Democrats
agreed in late July to bring the bill up for a final vote after the
five-week summer recess. Despite its long-simmering tensions with
Taiwan, Beijing heeded private warnings from administration
officials to avoid any diplomatic or military provocations that
could fuel opposition to the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill never became the political issue that some
expected, partly because pro-trade Republicans were loath to
antagonize their corporate benefactors in a tight election year,
and labor leaders never believed they could win enough Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, 20 different amendments to improve human
rights, religious freedom and labor standards in China fell by
lopsided votes, not because senators opposed them on merit but
because of their potential harm to the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate awaited the most popular amendment, sponsored by
Thompson and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to penalize Chinese
companies that trafficked in nuclear, chemical, biological weapons
and long-range missiles. The measure struck an especially strong
chord with lawmakers who had grown increasingly alarmed by
intelligence reports of Chinese arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's final vote, all but seven Democrats and eight
Republicans supported the trade bill. Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., who is Gore's running mate, was campaigning in California
and Ohio, and did not vote. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, also did
not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement would benefit American business
and values. ``The Senate has cast an epic and overwhelming vote,''
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``By so doing, we bring
China back into the trading system that it helped to establish out
of the ashes of the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents criticized the measure as one that would undercut
America's moral authority in the world, and reward a government
that threatens its neighbors, persecutes its own citizens and sells
advanced weaponry to America's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety and security of the American people come first,''
Helms said. ``That safety and security will be ensured ultimately
not by appeasement, not by the hope of trade at any cost, but by
dealing with communist China without selling out the very moral and
spiritual principles that made America great in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   This year has been the most productive for trade legislation in
nearly a quarter century. In addition to the China bill, lawmakers
approved bills to expand trade ties with more than 70 nations in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration's last major trade victories were
passage of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which created the World Trade
Organization, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993,
which established duty-free commerce among the United States,
Mexico and Canada.

NOMINATION OF JUDGE TO EUROPEAN BANK MIRES DUBLIN IN CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The details were sordid: A leading judge on
the Irish Supreme Court, a 40-year veteran of the bench and a
onetime candidate for chief justice, was accused of arranging the
early parole hearing and eventual release of a family acquaintance
who had been convicted of killing a young mother while driving
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied doing anything improper but refused to
cooperate with a parliamentary investigation. In April 1999,
threatened with impeachment, he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But one year later, he found himself nominated by the government
for a job with the European Investment Bank, complete with a
$161,000 salary. The former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, 61, might not
have had the financial experience typical for most top officials at
the bank, but he accepted the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish people, however, did not. The nomination, made in May
by the finance minister, was widely perceived as a case of the
dominant political party, Fianna Fail, looking after one of its
own. The resulting wave of public anger eventually forced
O'Flaherty to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government nominated a replacement, a lifelong
civil servant from the finance ministry. But the affair has
undermined confidence in the government, which is drawing more
criticism than at any other time during its three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bank position is one of more than 2,000 jobs that the
government distributes each time a new administration takes office.
According to Dermot Keogh, professor of history at University
College Cork, such appointments have little to do with
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   O'Flaherty's nomination failed when the public reaction made its
way to the bank's headquarters in Luxembourg, prompting officials
there to notify the government that for the first time, they would
reject a government's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the nomination became known, an editorial in The
Irish Times declared that ``the public's confidence in the
institutions of the state is at rock bottom,'' and that the
nomination ``betrays the whole concept of accountability in a
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In June opposition parties offered a no-confidence motion in the
parliament, which the government survived by a handful of votes. In
July, a legal challenge to the nomination by a teacher from
Limerick reached the Supreme Court before it was rejected. But it
succeeded in stalling the process for months, and encouraged more
than a dozen Irish citizens to apply for the job directly with the
bank, and countless more to send letters of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a tide of angry voters, the government simply stuck to
its guns, although Prime Minister Bertie Ahern called on O'Flaherty
to explain the 1998 scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government was doggedly and persistently insisting on
ignoring public opinion,'' said Tom O'Malley, a law lecturer at the
National University of Ireland in Galway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrogance'' became the most common term used to describe the
man initially behind the nomination, Finance Minister Charlie
McCreevy. McCreevy refused to acknowledge any problems with the
appointment until after O'Flaherty withdrew, when he held a rare
news conference to admit that he had ``got it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Keogh said he hoped the affair would fuel cries for government
reform. One such change could see the introduction of parliamentary
hearings to approve political appointments. ``It won't go away,''
he said. ``It's one of these issues that has deeper public
ramifications.''

LUGAR'S UNDERDOG CHALLENGER BATTLES AS IF HE'S IN A RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Trailing badly in statewide polls and outspent
3-to-1, David Johnson, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate
here, figured the odds against his longshot campaign could not get
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before his Republican opponent, the
incumbent Richard Lugar, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in
August for his work to help reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of underdog Senate races, Johnson's challenge is
bobbing near the top. He picked his first political race to take on
Lugar, a four-term senator, former presidential candidate and
perhaps the most popular politician in Indiana history. An
Indianapolis Star poll in early September had Lugar up by 50
points, with even Democrats narrowly favoring him.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this seems to faze Johnson, 48, a smart, affable
corporate lawyer and political adviser, who dismisses talk that he
has been offered up as a sacrificial lamb by party leaders to keep
Lugar from spending too much time and money helping other
Republican candidates here.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is running a spirited, if somewhat anonymous, campaign
on the theme that Lugar, 68, has lost touch with what ordinary
Hoosiers care about: education, health care and Social Security.
With crop prices dropping, Johnson has also attacked the Freedom to
Farm Act that Lugar championed to overhaul farm programs.
</P>
<P>
   Poring over his rival's record since 1994, Johnson found that
Lugar voted 83 percent of the time with Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, the staunch conservative Republican, and repeatedly voted
against new school financing and prescription-drug coverage for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who has just been missing in action, and at
every opportunity has voted with the Jesse Helms wing in the
Senate,'' Johnson said. ``This is not that kind of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar scoffs at the criticism, first noting that he has visited
all 92 counties in the state this campaign and then dismissing
attacks on his record as selective procedural votes cooked up by
Democrats to embarrass Republicans. Lugar, for instance, has
proposed a plan for Medicare recipients to join a drug-buying club
that would offer steep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to argue about being in touch, you have to
offer some visible evidence that you've been to the communities,
that you've met the leaders, that you know anybody,'' Lugar said.
``I've been there. He has not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar, despite his commanding lead, seems to be nervously
peeking over his shoulder at his upstart's challenge, and says he
is not taking the outcome for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar has raised just over $4 million _ compared with $1.5
million for Johnson _ and has scheduled several fund-raisers
through October. Lugar skipped the Republican National Convention
this summer to stay home and campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent almost the entire month of August in Indiana to make
absolutely sure that each of these counties was as secure and
strong for our candidacy and other Republicans as possible,'' Lugar
said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his television ads, Lugar is running away from his own
party, taking credit for his defense of the popular federal school
lunch program against efforts by House Republicans to slash it.
</P>
<P>
   In the candidates' first televised debate in August, Johnson's
attacks flustered the normally soft-spoken, unflappable senator.
``The thought that Senator Helms and I are somehow in bed together
there in the Senate is just ludicrous on the face of it,'' said
Lugar, clearly agitated.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's big problem is that he is not well known. On paper and
in person, he is an attractive candidate: son of a Presbyterian
minister, Harvard Law School graduate, former Africa specialist on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Lugar, a Rhodes
Scholar.
</P>
<P>
   But with Election Day fast approaching, Johnson is trying to
accomplish in less than two months what Lugar has done over a
quarter-century of public service: build a statewide name and
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently did Johnson air his campaign's first television
ad. The Democratic National Committee spent $250,000 on a
television ad criticizing Lugar's record on education and health
care, but it never mentions Johnson by name.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's struggle was evident when he recently attended
services at the Eastern Star Baptist Church, the state's largest
African-American congregation. As more than 500 parishioners
filtered into an elementary school that served as a makeshift
sanctuary, Johnson shook hands and drew blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of him,'' said Crystal Crumes, a 34-year-old
Internet recruiting specialist who considers herself a staunch
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts are skeptical that there are enough
compelling issues to give Johnson's campaign the boost it needs.
The state's economy is booming and the unemployment rate is around
3 percent, below the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any whiff of scandal to taint Lugar's respected
record as a foreign policy expert, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee and one-time mayor and school board member in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any other state, David Johnson would be an A-list
challenger,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a media consultant who produced
the Democratic Party ad. ``But here, David's got to do everything
right, and then have a lot of good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johnson is clinging to the coattails of the state's
popular incumbent Democratic governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, who is
expected to be easily re-elected. While no Democratic presidential
candidate has carried Indiana since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964,
Democrats have controlled the governor's mansion here since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The only advantage to a 50-point deficit in the polls, Johnson
says cheerily, is that there is nowhere to go but up. If he can
close that gap and generate momentum, Johnson said, a large
Democratic turnout could propel him to an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into this race, people thought I was delusional,''
Johnson said. ``But it's entirely a question of being able to have
a sufficiently amplified voice to get the message out that people
have a choice this year.''

GORE MISSPEAKS AND FABRICATES, CHENEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif. Fla., Mass.)   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif._ Dick Cheney issued some of his harshest attacks
yet on Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday, saying that he ``simply
makes some things up out of whole cloth and repeats them over and
over and over again until he's called on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, was referring
to news accounts that cast doubt on an anecdote Gore used last
month when he told a group of elderly people in Florida that the
arthritis medicine his mother-in-law took cost three times as much
as the animal version of the same medicine taken by his dog,
Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported Monday that Gore made the claim based
on figures from a congressional report, not on his family's actual
drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Republican misspeaks, that's big news,'' Cheney told
reporters, referring obliquely to the malapropisms of his running
mate, Gov. George W. Bush. ``But it's equally important to go out
and spend some time and ask questions about the vice president, a
candidate for the president of the United States, who simply makes
some things up out of whole cloth and repeats them over and over
and over again until he's called on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after enduring barbs on the issue from the Bush
campaign for a day and a half, Gore's aides sharply disputed the
accusation that he had fabricated the story.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Gore's mother-in-law, Margaret Ann Aitcheson,
and Shiloh were taking the drugs, and released what they said were
the actual costs of the pills, showing that Aitcheson's pills cost
231.5 percent of what Shiloh's pills cost. The congressional report
that Gore had relied on last month said that Lodine costs 285.7
percent of the cost of Etogesic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they're desperate to get a hold of anything they can
and make something out of nothing,'' said Kym Spell, a spokeswoman
for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said Tuesday that Aitcheson's Lodine costs
$2.13 per capsule, while Shiloh's Etogesic cost 92 cents per
capsule.
</P>
<P>
   A check of prices for the two drugs at Web sites showed that the
cost per milligram of Lodine was lower in many cases than the price
per milligram of Etopsic, suggesting that the disparity was
actually generated by the difference in dosages.
</P>
<P>
   After the Gore campaign released the updated drug costs, Cheney
told reporters here: ``Clearly Al Gore is going around the country,
making up stories about his family, citing costs that may or may
not have been paid in order to try to win a political argument. I
think the vice president of the United States has an obligation to
be as accurate as possible during the course of the debate. And
it's pretty clear here that the issue isn't that drugs cost a lot _
they clearly do; we need to find ways to make sure our seniors have
them _ but rather that he's once again, as he's done previously in
claiming to have invented the Internet and claiming to have been
the source of inspiration for `Love Story,' once again playing fast
and loose with the facts in terms of trying to win an argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter of drug costs and Gore's mother-in-law and his
Labrador were only one front on which Cheney attacked Gore.
Speaking to reporters at the Mather Airport in Rancho Cordova,
while waiting for a flat tire on his campaign plane to be repaired,
Cheney continued to criticize Gore for continuing to raise money
from the entertainment industry at large fund-raisers after
criticizing the industry for marketing adult entertainment to
children.

NO MEDALS YET FOR NBC'S OLYMPICS RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Four days into the coverage of the Olympics from Sydney, NBC is
posting ratings that are by far the worst in television history for
the Olympics. If the poor ratings continue, NBC could face a
serious problem with advertisers, who were promised an average
rating that already may be impossible for the network to attain.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing NBC seems to be attracting in abundance is
reasons why the games are proving so uncompelling for American
viewers. Among the reasons cited from television executives,
viewers and even from NBC are the schedule, which set this Olympics
in late September, when the network is forced to face sports events
like National Football League games and pennant-race games in
baseball, all on nights when school is in session. There is also
the time difference, which leads NBC to delay broadcasting all
events until many hours after they actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the flood of information available all day about
the games on the Internet and on sports cable channels and sports
talk radio stations, some of which did not exist four and eight
years ago. And there is the lack of exposure caused by the
disappearance of regular, off-year coverage of many Olympic sports
from network sports programs like the old ``Wide World of Sports''
on ABC. If sports like the triathlon and swimming are seen anywhere
these days, it is on the less-important cable sports channels.
</P>
<P>
   Some former Olympic producers even cited the end of the Cold War
and the us-vs.-them feelings that prevailed in the Olympics when
the Soviet Union faced off against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, looking for answers itself, is citing the subpar
performances by members of the American gymnastics teams, which
failed to win any medals.
</P>
<P>
   But neither team was considered a realistic medal contender
going into the Games and Olympics in the past have done far better
when American teams did not even qualify for the medal rounds in
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988, American gymnasts
were no factor in the medals and yet NBC averaged a 16.4 rating for
the first four nights, 13 percent higher than this year's number,
which fell to a 14.3 average through Monday night. (Each rating
point represents a bit more than 1 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   NBC had announced publicly that it was hoping to average a 17.5
rating for the entire run of the Games, the same number it achieved
in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. No one at NBC ever believed the
network would be able to approach the 21.5 rating NBC hit during
the Atlanta Olympics four years ago because those games were held
on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the executive vice president of Walt Disney Co.,
who for years played a role in ABC's coverage of Olympics, said he
had one overall theory: ``For whatever reason, this Olympics had
zero buzz. There was just no buzz at all. And four days in you
still don't hear people talking about them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One viewer, Gary Meltzer, a junior high social studies teacher
from Flushing, N.Y., said: ``I go to the Internet and find out
what's going on. To watch heats when you know who won the finals,
it's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are surely troubling for NBC. Monday's rating, which
the network had pointed to as one of its key nights because of the
men's team gymnastics event, fell to only a 13.8. The Olympics
barely beat ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' for the night, which
had a 13.2 rating. (The Olympics had a 14.9 in the hours when they
went head to head.)
</P>
<P>
   Again, during the Seoul Games, the Olympics proved far more
potent against football, beating the two games on Monday nights by
4 rating points one week and 6 the next.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the ratings undergo an large and unprecedented revival,
it is extremely unlikely that NBC will be able to reach the rating
the network guaranteed to advertisers, a 16.1. NBC may be forced to
give advertisers free commercials in the second week of the Games,
though the network said it had built in enough extra time for
advertisers that it did not face the prospect of a glut of
commercials the second week.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also arguing that it is attracting more than 100 million
viewers to some portions of the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous for NBC is what might happen to future
advertising sales for the Olympics. The network, which paid $705
million for the rights to the Sydney Games, has already committed
more than $3 billion more to the next five summer and winter
Olympics. NBC will now have to sell those games based on the lower
ratings from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Iger said he sympathized with NBC's problems especially in
trying to attract young viewers who today are being offered endless
choices for entertainment, from computer chat rooms to video games
to hundreds of cable channels. It has made marketing the Olympics
much harder than ever before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `'And it doesn't help that the kids are back in school,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC could not control the scheduling because to stage them in
the traditional months of July and August would have put them in
the middle of the Australian winter.
</P>
<P>
   So the Olympics cannot avoid the NFL. On Monday night local fans
of the two teams involved let no doubt of their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys playing the Redskins, the game drew a 35.8
rating in Dallas and a 33.3 rating in Washington. The Olympic
numbers for the same cities: 16.1 in Dallas and 11.8 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The games also took a beating Monday night in Atlanta, getting a
12.5 rating. That was good enough to nose out ``Monday Night
Football'' but not good enough to beat the Mets-Braves baseball
game, which was on WTBS in Atlanta and scored a 13 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer, the viewer from Flushing, N.Y., had a similar rooting
interest. He said he and his son Max, 10, did not watch the
Olympics at all Monday. ``We watched the Mets game,'' he said.
``That certainly meant more to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many sports and television executives blamed the long delays
between the results, which are now widely reported on every news
media outlet and the Internet, and the coverage. ``Even the morning
papers are giving results,'' said Barry Frank, the senior group
vice president of the International Management Group, and a
longtime negotiator of television rights for the Olympics. ``We
know what's happening. The United States is a country of winners
and we don't necessarily want to tune in when he United States
isn't winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But through five days of competition, the United States was
winning, more than any other country in terms of both total medals
and gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC has repeatedly argued that the network does not
broadcast the games for the hard-core sports fan but for casual
fans, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McAfee of Fort Salonga, N.Y., said she is indeed enjoying
the coverage. ``I love all the sports,'' she said. ``It's not quite
the same, knowing the outcome, but I still appreciate and enjoy the
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   What may be most absent, at least for viewers who have been
caught up in the games before, is one standout athlete or a
compelling ongoing story line of the kind the Olympics have seen
before, from athletes as varied as Olga Korbut to Dan Jansen.
</P>
<P>
   The network hopes that track and field will offer new
possibilities especially in the figure of Marion Jones, the
American star who could win as many as five medals. But track does
not have the immense female following of gymnastics and football
and baseball games will still beckon next week.

MORE DEATHS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO FAULTY FIRESTONE TIRES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., La.)  By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Federal regulators announced Tuesday evening that
since Aug. 31 they had received complaints of 15 more deaths
attributed to Firestone tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks, raising to 103 the number of deaths under review.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the regulatory agency, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, cautioned that they had not determined how
many of the complaints involved tires that had actually failed. The
agency accepts complaints from consumers, lawyers, manufacturers
and law enforcement agencies, and has not had time to investigate
each complaint, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the release of the data was delayed as the safety agency
sifted through the 2,226 complaints it had received to determine
how many were duplicates of deaths previously reported to
investigators. While the agency concluded, after eliminating
duplicates, that there were complaints about 103 deaths, it simply
estimated the number of injuries as ``more than 400 reported
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone recalled 14.4 million light truck tires on Aug. 9, of
which 6.5 million are still believed to be in use. Two-thirds of
the tires were mounted on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles as
factory equipment, while the rest were either installed on other
Ford light truck models or were sold in the replacement tire
market. Most of the deaths cited in complaints to regulators have
occurred in Explorers, and almost all of them involved a rollover
after a tire shed its tread during high-speed driving.
</P>
<P>
   As the inquiry continued, Continental AG, Germany's leading tire
maker, announced Tuesday that it would replace 160,000 tires
mounted mostly on Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicles, but
would do so as part of a ``customer satisfaction program'' and not
a safety recall.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Frangenberg, the chief executive and president of
Continental General Tire Inc., the American unit of Continental AG,
said that the company had received only one report of a
tire-related injury, which he described as a ``minor injury'' in
Florida two weeks ago that was still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Continental announced the tire replacement program after meeting
with regulators Tuesday morning at the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation
Department. Tim Hurd, an agency spokesman, confirmed that the
agency had not required Continental to replace the tires as part of
a safety recall.
</P>
<P>
   Frangenberg said that regulators had not actually ruled against
a safety recall, however, and that regulators ``reserved the right
to ask for more information.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety recalls tend to hurt a company's legal standing if it is
sued, although Continental said it was not in litigation as a
result of the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Continental is replacing the first 160,000 ContiTrac AS tires it
produced of the P245/75R16 size. About 20,000 of these tires were
sold in the replacement market, while the Ford Motor Co. installed
the rest on 1998 and 1999 Navigators, Frangenberg said. A problem
in some tires can cause the vehicles to vibrate and sometimes cause
pieces of the tread to break off, but the entire tread does not
peel off, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Treads that peel off entirely and without warning during highway
driving have been blamed for dozens of deaths in Ford Explorers
equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is leading a House
Commerce Committee inquiry on the Firestone problem, accused
Firestone on Tuesday of having known since 1996 about quality
problems with the tires now being recalled. The spokesman, Ken
Johnson, said that investigators poring through tire test data
submitted by Firestone had found a high rate of test failures
during routine quality control tests conducted in 1996, and a
notation that a tire manufacturing process was changed in 1997 as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Sutherland, a Firestone spokeswoman, said the company had
found in 1996 that the sidewalls of some tires had failed in tests.
But the sidewall problem was unrelated to the tread separations now
blamed for many accidents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone was not aware of the occurrence of sidewall problems
on tires actually out on the streets, but still made changes so
that the sidewall problem stopped showing up in the company's
tests, Sutherland said, adding, ``It is not a failure we saw in the
real world, but we saw it in the test and we corrected the
problem.''  &QL;

WHITMAN URGES CORZINE TO DISCLOSE MORE TAX RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman weighed in on the U.S.
Senate race in New Jersey on Tuesday, urging Jon S. Corzine, the
Democratic candidate, to remove any lingering ``shadow of doubt''
about his finances and release his personal income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, who is supporting Rep. Bob Franks, the
Republican in the race, praised Corzine for disclosing his
charitable donations on Monday but chided him for not following her
own example and making his tax returns public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Corzine, half disclosure is no disclosure at all,'' the
governor began in a letter to Corzine that was given to reporters
Tuesday night by the Republican State Committee. It was her second
letter to Corzine on the subject in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman neglected to mention, however, that she resisted similar
demands for months during her first-term election campaign in 1993.
She eventually released returns for 1989 through 1992, holding one
of them back until less than three weeks before the election, in
which she defeated Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has been equally adamant about withholding his tax
returns. He has released one-page abstracts of his earnings and
taxes paid for 1996 through 1999. But he has refused to go further,
saying he is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality agreement
with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the investment bank he headed until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's spokesman, Tom Shea, brushed off the governor's letter
Tuesday night, noting that she had sent a similar one several weeks
ago on official state stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christie Whitman and Bob Franks have been politicians so long
that they don't understand straight talk when they hear it,'' Shea
said. ``Jon has said he has a contract. He intends to honor that
contract, and he intends to keep his word to the voters of New
Jersey when he gives it.''
</P>
<P>
   The back and forth came a day after Corzine, who has been
repeatedly accused by Franks and others of trying to buy a Senate
seat, disclosed records of his charitable giving for 1999 and 2000.
Included among $10 million in gifts were more than $100,000 in
donations to four groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed
Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, he gave $25,000 to St. Matthews AME
Church in Orange, whose pastor, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, is
the head of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. But in
April, when Jackson and 19 other pastors endorsed him, Corzine
stood by silently as another minister denied that any of them had
received donations from Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, state Sen. Louis F. Kosco, a Republican from Paramus
who is chairman of the law and public safety committee, called on
the IRS to investigate the tax returns of Corzine's charitable
foundation, through which he made most of his donations. Corzine
indicated in the return that he did not give more than $100 ``for
political purposes.'' Kosco said he believed Corzine had violated
federal tax law but based his allegation solely on news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Shea responded Tuesday night by demanding to know ``the specific
contributions they claim are political.'' He added, ``If the Bob
Franks campaign is trying to imply that the votes of
African-Americans in New Jersey can be bought, then he should have
the courage to step out from behind his surrogates and make the
accusation himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Franks, Peter DeMarco, responded: ``Why is no
one coming to Jon Corzine's defense? The silence is deafening.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Corzine came under attack from a fellow Democrat on
Tuesday, albeit one with little party loyalty, in the form of Bruce
Afran, a civil rights lawyer, who announced his own candidacy for
the Senate under the Green Party heading. He remains a registered
Democrat, he said, because voters are unable to register as members
of third parties under New Jersey law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the corruption of the entire Democratic Party
through the influence of Jon Corzine,'' Afran said, referring to
Corzine's previously disclosed contributions to Democratic groups
and candidates, and to the $35 million he spent winning the party's
primary in June. ``Now the Corzine campaign is effectively
corrupting churches.''
</P>
<P>
   He even suggested that Franks could be the lesser of two
major-party evils. ``I think it would be far healthier to elect an
honest conservative, who has a long history behind his opinions,
than to elect a man who is using his fortune to create a false
image of himself as a liberal,'' Afran said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea dismissed Afran's assertions as efforts by an obscure
third-party candidate to attract attention.

EXCITE'S CEO RESIGNS, BUT REMAINS AS CHAIRMAN THROUGH 2001 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Bell, one of the first executives to leave a traditional
media company to seek his fortune on the Internet, said Tuesday
that he would step down as chief executive of Excite(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the company, which operates one of the most
frequented Web sites and offers high-speed Internet service through
cable television systems, said Bell would remain its chairman
through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is the latest of a series of changes in management or
strategy at Excite(at)Home since it was formed in May 1999 through
the merger of Excite, one of the first Internet search engines and
portals, and At Home, which offers high-speed Internet access
through cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   At first Tom Jermoluk, the chief executive of At Home, served as
chief executive for the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who had been chief executive at Excite since 1996, became
president. In January of this year, Bell became chief executive,
leaving Jermoluk the role of chairman, a position he held until
May, when he left the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company has wrestled to work out a
comfortable relationship with AT&AMP;T, its largest shareholder, and
the other cable companies it works with, many of whom own minority
stakes. Late last year, the company proposed splitting into two
separately traded divisions, a plan it abandoned when AT&AMP;T agreed
to increase its ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a former Times Mirror Co. magazine executive, said in a
statement that Tuesday's move was ``a natural evolution of the
executive management team as a company grows,'' adding, ``I look
forward to assisting the company in its growth as full-time
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst III, a partner in Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, the venture capital firm that was instrumental in
creating both Excite and At Home, said Bell had personal reasons
for stepping down. He had moved his family to Boston last year and
spent two weeks a month at company headquarters in Redwood City,
south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was trying to live in Boston and be CEO of this
company,'' Hearst said. ``That's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst added that the board hoped to recruit a new chief with
experience running a large company. He noted that with 2,700
employees, Excite(at)Home is a far different company from the tiny
start-up that Bell joined.
</P>
<P>
   On the Instinet electronic trading system, Excite(at)Home
dropped after hours Tuesday to $15.52 from its regular-session
close of $16.19, soon after it said it would search for a
replacement for Bell.

PRICE IS SET FOR ELECTRONIC BOOK READER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of speculation in the book publishing business,
Thomson Multimedia has set the prices of its new hand-held devices
for reading electronic books. Beginning at about $300, the prices
are higher than publishers had hoped, at a level unlikely to speed
the adoption of electronic books by the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's devices, which will be displayed on Sunday at the New
York Is Book Country fair, are the only hand-held devices available
for reading electronic books in a secure software format. The
devices use software from Gemstar-TV Guide International to prevent
piracy and to ease reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Gemstar format is one of three leading contenders to become
the dominant platform for electronic publishing. The other two
require a personal computer and are distributed free over the
Internet, one by Adobe Systems and the other by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are hoping that Thomson will make the new devices
affordable enough to become popular. ``We want to see how consumers
are going to react,'' said Richard Sarnoff, president of Random
House's new-media group. ``The second question is, will Thomson
price it anywhere near where it could become a mass-market
phenomenon, or will it stay within the early adopters, the upscale
road-warrior types?''
</P>
<P>
   At $300, the cheapest of the new appliances is slightly more
expensive than previous versions, sold under the name Rocket eBook.
To reach a mass market, the appliances will need to fall in price
below $200, people in the industry say.
</P>
<P>
   David Arland, a spokesman for Thomson, which is based in Paris,
said the price would fall as the market grows. ``In 1977, a VCR
cost $1,000. Today you can get one for less than $100.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``big news,'' Arland said, is that for the first time
devices for reading electronic books will be sold in electronics
stores. Previous versions were available only over the Internet or
through certain catalogs. Thomson, which makes appliances under the
RCA brand, sells through 15,000 electronics stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arland said the cheaper version of its reading device displays
text on a black-and-white screen about the size of a paperback
book. A version with a suggested retail price about $700 includes a
multicolor screen about the size of a magazine. Unlike previous
versions, both devices include modems to download books. Both are
far easier on the eyes than typical hand-held computers, Arland
said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Peru's Fujimori vows to remain in power despite calls for his
resignation
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOHN OTIS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori rejected calls for his
resignation on Tuesday night and defiantly declared that he would
remain in power until next year despite a bribery scandal that has
rocked his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to govern. I'm the president of the republic. I
have not resigned,'' Fujimori said at a news conference at the
National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have insisted that Peru's political crisis, which was
sparked last week by a bribery scandal involving the president's
top aide, Vladimiro Montesinos, is so dire that Fujimori should
step down immediately and make way for a transition government that
would rule until a new vote can be held.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Fujimori shocked the nation by calling for new
elections and announcing that he would not run. He also announced
that he would disband the National Intelligence Service, which is
run by Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance since making that bombshell
announcement, Fujimori emerged from the National Palace Tuesday
night and waved to thousands of cheering supporters, whom critics
claimed were bused in by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his daughter, Keiko Sofia, who waved a Peruvian
flag, the president stood atop the palace's immense concrete gate.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos stayed out of sight Tuesday following a swirl of
rumors that he had been placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Fujimori and Cabinet officials said that
they did not know the whereabouts of Montesinos but added that he
would face justice for allegedly paying an opposition congressman
$15,000 to join Fujimori's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know where he is,'' said Prime Minister Alberto
Bustamante. ``We know he is in Lima and that he hasn't left the
country. We know he's not detained.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he made his decision to call early elections after
talking with his daughter in the wake of the scandal. He denied
that the United States had pressured him to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not one call (from Washington). There was not one
suggestion. Zero,'' the president said. ``I have excellent
relations with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He also outlined a timetable for congressional and presidential
elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said that before an election date can be set, Congress
will have to approve a constitutional amendment reducing his
five-year term to one year. The amendment would have to be approved
in two consecutive legislative periods, a process that would last
into January.
</P>
<P>
   Balloting would likely take place in March, Bustamante said, and
the new president would take office on July 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Ernesto Gamarra, an opposition lawmaker, called
for new presidential and congressional elections to be held ``as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this uncertainty lasts any longer, it will cause many
problems for the country, and nobody wants that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Olivera, the opposition lawmaker who released the video
that appeared to show Montesinos offering the bribe to TV stations
last week, said Tuesday that the spy chief had threatened to
instigate a military coup if more tapes were made public.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera, who claims to possess several more compromising
videotapes, said a Montesinos aide approached legislators last week
and demanded that they absolve the spy chief of any blame in the
bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Montesinos emissary ``proposed a kind of immunity pact under
the threat of terror,'' Olivera said. ``If we released one more
video, he would go forward with the threat, which was that there
would be a bloody military coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts speculated that Montesinos may be negotiating
the terms of his exit from the government with top military
officers, most of whom are believed to be loyal to the spy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military has yet to offer public backing for
Fujimori's plan to call elections and disband the intelligence
service, the president said Tuesday that he enjoys full backing
from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces have expressed their recognition. This
recognition is permanent. It is institutional,'' Fujimori said.
``What we have here is total stability, a government with
difficulties but one that is stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, a former army captain, was thrown out of the
military in 1977 for passing secrets about Peruvian arms purchases
to the CIA. As Fujimori's top intelligence officer, however, he has
exercised great influence over the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has allowed Montesinos special treatment. They
continue to meet with him in secret,'' said opposition politician
Carlos Ferrero. ``Everyone knows that many of the military chiefs
are his personal friends, because they were put in their posts by
Montesinos,''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of Peru's May 28 presidential
runoff vote after claiming it was rigged, said Fujimori cannot be
trusted to run clean elections. He said Fujimori should hand over
power to a transition government and that the new vote should take
place within four months.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians have suggested that Jorge Santistevan, the
respected government ombudsman, should serve as interim president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Toledo's high profile, a survey released Tuesday by the
Apoyo polling firm showed that there is no clear front-runner for
president among the opposition. According to the poll, public
opinion is divided among Toledo, Olivera, Lima Mayor Alberto
Andrade and a handful of other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo called on government foes to remain united.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is not the time to speak of candidates. Let's not divide
ourselves,'' he said.

JUDGE ORDERS FEDERAL OVERSIGHT FOR NEW YORK CITY AIDS SERVICES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal district judge in Brooklyn ruled Tuesday
that a New York City agency had failed to provide adequate services
for thousands of people with AIDS and ordered the agency placed
under federal oversight for three years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Sterling Johnson ruled that the
agency, the city's Division of AIDS Services and Income Support,
had ``chronically and systematically'' delayed or terminated
subsistence benefits, emergency housing, rent assistance, food
stamps, Medicaid and other services that it administers for about
25,000 people who have AIDS or who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson found that the failures of the agency, an arm of the
city Human Resources Administration, had ``devastating
consequences.'' He wrote that in many instances the agency had
terminated benefits like food stamps with no notice. His ruling
came after a bench trial ended in June in a civil lawsuit brought
in 1995 by Housing Works Inc., an advocacy group that has long
sparred with the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over city
AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched every day as our clients have suffered under this
callous, awful administration,'' said Armen Merjian, a staff lawyer
for Housing Works. ``This is the medication they depend upon to
live, the food upon which they depend to feed themselves and their
families, the housing they need to find shelter and fight off this
mortal illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Delilah Howard was typical, Merjian said. Howard,
47, a Housing Works client unable to work because of her illness,
said in an interview Tuesday that she had found an apartment she
could afford with her housing subsidy, but which she was unable to
rent because the city agency took more than a month to provide
assistance. On another occasion, Howard said she found out from a
grocery story checkout clerk that her food stamps had been
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Under Johnson's ruling, which was immediately effective, people
with complaints will be able to report them to the federal
magistrate judge appointed to monitor the agency, Cheryl L. Pollak,
who has been managing the case by overseeing the exchange of
documents and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak will not monitor day to day activities or polices of the
city agency. But she will receive complaints, she may recommend
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Merjian said Housing Works and other advocates will devise a
system for reporting complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's attorney, said Tuesday that the city
would appeal the decision. The opinion, Hess said, ``is very
flawed, with all kinds of mistakes,'' and is based on facts from
the mid-1990s that have little to do with how the agency now
operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City provides more money and more services for
AIDS-related people than any other city in the nation,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   But Merjian called the ruling a ``gigantic victory'' and said it
could affect people with other disabilities because the case was
brought under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and the
Rehabilitation Act.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, Henrietta D. v. Giuliani, was one of several that
Housing Works has brought against the Giuliani administration. Last
October, the group won a unanimous ruling from the State Court of
Appeals that the city was improperly requiring eligibility reviews
of welfare clients who had already been accepted by the AIDS
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In November, in another case brought by Housing Works, Justice
Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found the
Division of AIDS Services in violation of a city law requiring
medically appropriate housing for AIDS patients and ordered it to
make emergency placements within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit decided Tuesday was filed in response
to the Giuliani administrations cutbacks in the Division of AIDS
Services and Income Support, which was established in 1985 during
the administration of Mayor Ed Koch. Merjian said that while city
caseworkers had an average of 34 clients before the cutbacks, the
caseloads soon reached 60 per caseworker at some of the division's
10 centers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision cited findings that in one-third of its
cases, the city took more than 30 days to provide emergency
benefits that were required within 72 hours. Among applicants for
housing at one location, the agency failed to meet its own
deadlines on more than three-quarters of the cases. It failed to
pay rent on newly rented apartments in 32 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Merjian said that when the class action was filed, about 16,000
people were eligible for assistance; now, he estimated, 25,000
clients and 10,000 dependents relied on the city services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're living with AIDS, chances are you're going to be a
class member,'' he said. ``They have no choice but to be on the
dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Torres, a plaintiff who testified at the trial, said
Tuesday that the decision would have ``a great effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 46, testified that after he was forced from his
apartment by water damage in 1995, his caseworker did not help him
find a new apartment or secure emergency housing. He was homeless
until finding a Veterans Administration shelter.

FISHER SURGERY LEAVES LAKERS EVEN THINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The gradual dismembering of the Los Angeles
Lakers' championship roster will continue today, as Derek Fisher
undergoes foot surgery that probably will wipe out his season.
</P>
<P>
   After seeking a second medical opinion last week, Fisher has
chosen surgery rather than therapy to repair a stress fracture in
his right foot. Dr. Phillip Kwong will perform the procedure this
morning at the Kerlan-Jobe Healthsouth Surgery Center, and Fisher
will need a minimum of four to six months to recover.
</P>
<P>
   That places his return in perhaps March or April, just before
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And it leaves the Lakers with a precariously thin backcourt
rotation. Kobe Bryant is penciled in at small forward to replace
Glen Rice. The only other guards on the roster are Ron Harper,
Isaiah Rider and Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   With training camp opening in two weeks, the Lakers will
accelerate efforts to re-sign free agent Brian Shaw, hope for
progress with Lue and scour the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we may rely on Kobe more in the backcourt, and that
certainly hurts our depth and is something we'll have to address,''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``I think at this point in
time, even though we're optimistic he'll (Fisher) return sooner, we
have to plan as if he'll be out the majority of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw wants to return and could be re-signed at any time, but the
Lakers and his agent have yet to agree on contract terms. The team
has been offering a slight raise over the $1 million they paid him
last season, but Shaw has been holding out for the $2.25 million
salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe we can work something out,'' Kupchak
said.
</P>
<P>
   The team hopes Lue, out with a knee injury last season, might
fill Fisher's role as designated defender against smaller guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look to him to do that,'' Kupchak said. ``With the
abbreviated (lockout) season and then with the injury, he hasn't
had a chance to show us what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talks aimed at a sign-and-trade involving Rice are
ongoing despite reports that had him signing outright with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Rice is expected to be an ex-Laker soon, joining
A.C. Green, who was waived a week after the Lakers won the
championship. With the loss of Fisher and the free agency of Shaw
and John Salley, the Lakers could turn over nearly half the active
roster.

<P>
   If they awarded Olympic medals for graffiti, Australia's Darren
Grech would give L.A.'s taggers a run for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Grech, a 31-year-old machinist, painted his initials near the
top of the Olympic cauldron, thereby assuring himself a dubious
place in Olympic history. His ``DG'' was clearly visible in
photographs shot during the opening ceremonies from behind cauldron
lighter Cathy Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Grech was so proud of his effort, he posed at his workplace with
one such photograph. He might have to start putting in a lot of
overtime; Ric Birch, the man behind the opening-ceremonies
extravaganza, called Grech's act ``extremely thoughtless'' and
``disgraceful'' and said he plans to have the initials removed once
the Games are over and send Grich the bill for it.

FEARING NUCLEAR RESEARCH, WASHINGTON WANTS RUSSIAN LASER SALE TO
IRAN STOPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House said Tuesday that Russia had suspended a
contract to sell Iran laser technology that can be used to make
fuel for nuclear weapons, but the Russian institute involved said
it's still planning the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail response Tuesday to questions from The New York
Times, Boris Yatsenko, director of the Science and Technology
Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the Russian government's D.V.
Efremov Institute of St. Petersburg, said his institute was
planning to sell Iran the equipment, which he said was solely for
``medical, industrial, and scientific purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we believe, Iran will use lasers and some electrophysical
equipment deliverable by us for the scientific, industrial and
medical purposes,'' Yatsenko said in the e-mail. ``Our scientists
and technicians will execute maintenance and guarantee support of
the deliverable equipment during agreed periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the equipment was for nonmilitary purposes, the e-mail
stated, ``We do not need the government's approval.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council,
said: ``We will continue to work with the government of Russia to
ensure that no Russian entities provide support to the Iranian
nuclear weapons program. We're moving in the right direction, but
clearly this remains a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said they have been trying
for three months to persuade Russia to cancel the sale. They said
Tuesday that Russia had agreed at a meeting in New York earlier
this month to suspend, but not cancel, the sale, just before
President Clinton met with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were assured at the United Nations summit in New York two
weeks ago that the Russian government had ordered a suspension of
this sale pending a joint investigation into whether the laser
technology could help Iran acquire a nuclear capability,'' a White
House official said. ``I think the institute's e-mail indicates
some of the problems that the Russian government may be having in
trying to rein in some of the more cash-strapped scientific
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the Russian government is negotiating in good
faith,'' the official said. The official said he was convinced that
the ``Russian government has the authority to stop the sale if it
chooses to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, informed that
the institute believed that the sale was proceeding, said he could
not comment on that issue since ``the dialogue between the White
House and the Kremlin is confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration nuclear expert said he believed that
the American team of experts had made a ``very persuasive technical
case'' that the equipment the institute is trying to sell Iran
could not be used other than for military purposes: ``I cannot
conceive of this type of equipment being used for any other purpose
other than the one we are concerned about.''.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail message, the Russian institute director said the
laser equipment they're selling Iran has an average power of 15
watts to - 20 watts.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Clinton administration's expert in nuclear
technology said that while the institute's lasers may be less
powerful than the lasers normally used in nuclear weapons
development, ``they can still be of concern. It depends on how Iran
is planning to use them, on what other equipment Russia is selling,
and what the entire system looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have long believed that Iran is trying to
acquire nuclear technology for a weapons program. Iran denies that,
and asserts that it has forsworn nuclear weapons and is under
international safeguards.

U.S. INVESTIGATES PRISON VISIT TO TORRICELLI DONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and TIM GOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a Friday afternoon in December, FBI agents arrested one of
the Democratic Party's most generous contributors as he picked up
his Mercedes from a garage in suburban New Jersey. Within hours,
the man was locked in a nearby jail, charged with making illegal
donations to Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   The donor, David Chang, spent only that weekend in the Hudson
County Correctional Center. But while he lay alone in his cell, he
was visited by several men he had never seen before, he later told
prosecutors. One of the men warned him not to cooperate with the
authorities, he said. Another simply put a finger to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as part of a widening inquiry in which Chang has become a
crucial witness, federal investigators are examining the
possibility that the men were sent by political allies of Sen.
Torricelli as part of an attempt to pressure Chang into not
cooperating with the authorities, people familiar with the
investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, three guards who were in the jail that weekend
have been called before a federal grand jury, and FBI agents have
seized log books, personnel files, videotapes and other records.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also preparing to question the man who
supervises the three guards, a senior prison official who is a
longtime friend of Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County
executive. Janiszewski is one of Torricelli's most steadfast
supporters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The senior prison official, Martin Budnick, did nothing
improper, his lawyer, Peter R. Willis, said. But Budnick, who
generally works Monday through Friday, has told associates that he
came to the jail over the weekend of Dec. 11 at the behest of one
of Janiszewski's top aides. Budnick insisted to the associates that
he merely ordered that Chang be given an extra blanket and some
food.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, the best fund-raiser among the Democrats in the
Senate, said through a spokesman that any suggestion that he was
part of an effort to threaten Chang was ``wrong, ridiculous and
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Janiszewski denied intervening in Chang's behalf. A lawyer for
Chang, Bradley D. Simon, declined to comment, citing the continuing
federal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest last year, Chang, 56, was one of the more
prized donors in American politics. He visited with senators and
congressmen and had a particularly close relationship with
Torricelli, who had been his congressman before being elected to
the Senate. Chang had met with President Clinton half a dozen
times, at both casual get-togethers and White House galas.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 2, Chang pleaded guilty to organizing more than
$53,000 in illegal donations to Torricelli's 1996 campaign. In
return, the government dropped other, more serious charges,
including conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   After his weekend in the jail, Chang appeared in court on
Monday, Dec. 13, and his lawyer at the time, Michael Critchley,
suggested that his client had no intention of cooperating with the
authorities. Critchley said his client had no incriminating
information about any of the politicians with whom he had dealt _
not Torricelli, not President Clinton, nor anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after being moved out of the Hudson jail to the
Union County jail in Elizabeth, N.J., Chang hired a new lawyer,
David Schertler, and began to distance himself from Critchley.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with Chang's account of his time in
the Hudson jail, the first of several visitors appeared at the door
of his cell on Saturday night, Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   One man, whom Chang described as tall and burly with a tattoo on
his arm, warned him not to cooperate with the authorities, telling
him, ``You know what you are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Chang told investigators, he was awakened in his cell by
another man who put a finger to his lips, motioning him to keep
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Chang reported at least one more visit, this one from a man who
brought him a blanket and food. Lawyers for Chang have said that he
complained of being cold and ill-fed during his stay in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to two prison employees who spoke on the condition
that they not be named, Budnick and the three corrections officers
came to the jail on the Saturday night of Chang's stay and were
logged in as visiting other prisoners in his cell block.
</P>
<P>
   Budnick, who is also responsible for the administration of the
roughly 300 federal prisoners usually held at the jail, told county
officials that he and the three officers were there to investigate
a dispute between two prisoners earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Budnick told lawyers and others that he had sent
the blanket to Chang after receiving a telephone call from William
Northgrave, the county counsel. Budnick told an associate that
Northgrave telephoned him a second time and warned him not to
disclose their dealings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Northgrave declined to comment on that accusation and said he
could not discuss what happened during Chang's detention until the
federal inquiry is over.
</P>
<P>
   Northgrave has ties to several people who figure in the inquiry.
He once served as Janiszewski's chief of staff and was an associate
at the law firm of Michael Critchley, the lawyer who first
represented Chang when he was jailed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Budnick, 49, has already survived some legal difficulties in his
work for Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   After only several years as a police officer, Budnick was named
a county undersheriff in 1987, and kept the post for a decade with
Janiszewski's support. Starting in 1993, however, Budnick was one
of two lead defendants in sexual-harassment lawsuits that were
filed by seven women working in the Sheriff's Department and
eventually settled for a total more than $1.4 million, not
including legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Budnick resigned his post under pressure from the
sheriff, Joseph Cassidy, officials in the office said. Nonetheless,
he remained on the county payroll with Janiszewski's backing,
moving to a job as ``confidential aide'' to the warden of the jail.

RECOUNT IN LONG ISLAND PRIMARY CONFIRMS AN UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Regina Seltzer, a political outsider who
challenged Rep. Michael P. Forbes after he switched parties from
Republican to Democrat, will be the Democratic Congressional
nominee for the East End of Long Island, a recount confirmed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, 71, who works without pay as an environmental lawyer
from her home in Bellport, defeated Forbes in the Democratic
primary last week by 35 votes, with 6,077 votes, or 50.14 percent.
Forbes had 6,042, or 49.86 percent. After the primary on Sept. 12,
Seltzer was initially thought to have won by 39 votes.
</P>
<P>
   She now becomes a decided underdog in the First Congressional
District race against the Republican candidate, Felix J. Grucci
Jr., who is the town supervisor of Brookhaven.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer thanked primary voters on Tuesday, saying: ``Contrary to
all the political pundits who said I was not going to win, who said
you can't fight against someone with $1.2 million, a third-term
incumbent. They believed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and Forbes disagreed on gun control, campaign
finance reform and improvements to the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position and Felix Grucci's positions are
indistinguishable,'' she said. ``We won against Forbes, and I think
we're going to win against Felix.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to campaign the way she did for the primary, ``friend
to friend, neighbor to neighbor,'' she said. ``We're going to get
people to come out because they know every one of their votes is
indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from his Washington office, Forbes, 48, wished

   ``I think it's clear that this race and the Democratic nominee
were selected by the Republicans,'' he said, noting the mailings
and polls Republicans conducted against him and in support of his
opponent. ``I think they're going to be surprised by a feisty,
issue-oriented, grass-roots Democrat like Reggie Seltzer.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes added that he still believed leaving the Republican party
was the right decision for him and that he was ``honored to be a
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   The office of Grucci said he was not available for comment
Tuesday, but Howard C. DeMartini, the senior strategist for his
campaign, said Grucci looked forward to discussing the issues with
Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as no surprise to us that Forbes lost the primary
because we have said from the very beginning that if he was
challenged by a real Democrat, he would lose the primary,'' he
said. ``Now people have a choice between a mainstream Republican
and a liberal Democrat in the general election.''

MILLER DROPS OUT OF 100 WITH INJURY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Inger Miller, the only real sprinting threat
to Marion Jones and her fastest teammate on the American
4x100-meter relay team, has withdrawn from the 100 and may not be
able to run the 200 or the relay at the Olympics because of a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Miller strained her left hamstring while training on Sept. 7 in
Los Angeles and has not ben able to sprint at top speed for nearly
two weeks. Her absence could both markedly help and hurt Jones'
chances of becoming the first female track and field athlete to win
five gold medals at the same Games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Wednesday she hoped to be able to run the 200 and
the relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult decision for me, but I didn't want to
jeopardize my other events,'' Miller said at a news conference.
``I'm hoping a few more days will help me heal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Miller is the only sprinter to have pushed Jones
this season, losing by a hundredth of a second to her on Aug. 11 in
Zurich; she ran 10.96 seconds to 10.95 for Jones. Miller also
finished second to Jones in the 100 at the 1999 world championships
in Seville, Spain, posting a career best of 10.79 seconds. She will
be replaced in the event by her training partner Torri Edwards, who
finished fourth at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I won't be there to give her great competition, but
I wish her good luck,'' Miller said of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 28, also won the world championship in the 200 in
Seville after Jones had withdrawn because of back spasms. Miller's
winning time of 21.77 seconds was faster than Jones ran all of last
season. That 200 was the only sprint Jones did not win in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a one-woman show,'' Miller said in an interview
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rounds of the 100 begin Friday (Thursday, Eastern time), with
the semifinals and final scheduled for Saturday. Miller would have
more time to heal her leg before the 200 rounds, which do not begin
until next Wednesday, with the semifinals and final scheduled for
Sept. 28. The 4x100 relay final is scheduled for Sept. 30. If she
is healthy, Miller could run the final without having to run the
relay's preliminary rounds, as is often the case with top
sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her chances of running the 200 and the relay, Miller
said she was unsure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's day to day,'' she said. ``Come Wednesday, I think I
should be all right. I have been able to do some training but not
at the level I want to be at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miller's absence from the sprints would remove the most
searing threat to Jones, her withdrawal from the relay would make a
gold medal more uncertain for the Americans. Without an injured
Jones, for instance, the Americans finished fourth in the 4x100
relay behind the Bahamas, France and Jamaica at the 1999 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The other three members of the American relay final will most
likely be Jones; Gail Devers, the two-time Olympic champion at 100
meters; and Chryste Gaines. Miller finished second to Jones in both
the 100 and 200 at the Olympic trials in July, while Gaines was
third in the 100. If Miller cannot run the relay, she will be
replaced by Edwards, Nanceen Perry, Carlette Guidry or Passion
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate Inger can't compete in the 100; I know how
hard she's worked and how she wanted to win a medal,'' Edwards
said. ``But I've been training hard and I'm prepared to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Miller finished fourth in the 200
but won a gold medal on the American 4x100 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lennox Miller, now a dentist in Pasadena, Calif.,
won a silver medal in the 100 for Jamaica at the 1968 Mexico City
Olympics and a bronze in 1972 at the Munich Games. He and Inger are
the only father and daughter to have won Olympic medals in track
and field. Both attended the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was formerly coached by her father. Last year, however,
she began training at UCLA with the Hudson Smith International
training group, known as HSI. The group is coached by John Smith
and includes Maurice Greene, the world record-holder at 100 meters,
and Ato Boldon, a bronze medalist in the 100 and 200 at the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of my hands,'' Miller said of the injury. ``Last
year, when I was very success in the 100 and 200, I didn't ask the
Lord why he chose me. I can't say now: `Why me? Why am I injured?'
I can't be upset if I'm not 100 percent and if I don't achieve the
goals in my plan. I'm disappointed, but I've got to go with the
flow. It's not the end of the world. I'm young; I've got many other
aspirations. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't. I hope by
Wednesday, things will look a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller becomes the latest American track and filed athlete to
withdraw because of an injury or illness. The men's world champion
shot-putter C.J. Hunter had knee surgery and a gold medal favorite
in the women's 1,500, Regina Jacobs, has a respiratory viral
infection. &QL;

DEFENDING HIS TACTICS, LAZIO CALLS DEBATE CRITICS SEXIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio on Tuesday issued his strongest
rebuke yet to critics of his debate tactics, saying it was
``sexist'' to suggest he should not have walked over to Hillary
Rodham Clinton's lectern in a challenging manner.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, said the criticism of his
tactic during last Wednesday's debate in Buffalo suggested that
``you can't make a point forcefully if you're a man and the person
you are making a point with is a woman.'' He said, ``I just think
that that's sexist.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, responding to suggestions from Clinton and her aides that
he was overbearing, said a ``double standard'' was at play when he
was criticized for physically confronting Clinton, bringing talk
about the role of gender in the campaign to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Lazio suggested that he would not have faced
such criticism if his opponent were a man; Clinton's advisers have
argued that he would not have tried such an unusual televised
confrontation if he were running against a man.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Lazio walked over to Clinton's lectern,
waving a sheet of paper, gesturing at her and demanding that she
sign a pledge abstaining from using unregulated campaign
contributions known as soft money. She declined. Clinton's advisers
have portrayed his actions as bullying and likely to alienate
women.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton and her campaign have sought to encourage that
reaction among women. In a speech Monday before supporters, Clinton
portrayed Lazio as yelling, pointing his finger and invading her
space. ``I knew I was going to share a stage,'' Clinton said, ``I
didn't think I was going to have to share a podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers moved Tuesday to take advantage of what they
saw as a misstep by Lazio at the debate, releasing a new
advertisement that portrayed Clinton as something of a victim,
fighting against forces that had tried to defeat her on issues like
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the political world was rocked by the bizarre accusation
that Rick Lazio has been the victim of sexism,'' said Clinton's
campaign communications director, Howard Wolfson. ``Poor Rick. Let
me be the first to offer him my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, as he has traveled across the state in the last several
days, has repeatedly been questioned about his actions by
journalists and occasionally by some of the people he has visited,
like schoolchildren. On Tuesday, after touring a Buffalo
information technology firm, he was asked by a reporter to respond
to Clinton's remarks on Monday, and in doing so went beyond his
usual reply that he had done nothing wrong during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea that somehow, you know, men and women have
different standards in contemporary life is wrong,'' Lazio said.
``I don't think people in the Senate worry about whether you're a
man or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, questioned again, he did not use the word ``sexist'' but
reiterated: ``I think there ought to be a fair, level playing
field, that we should have the same expectations whether you're a
male or female, that we ought to be held to the same standard. And
that's what I tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said his tactic was necessary to force Clinton to
address his pledge to ask all independent groups to cease
supporting his candidacy by such means as advertising and mailings
if Clinton agrees to give up her soft money.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lazio said he had disbanded a state political action
committee, Friends of Rick, and returned the $75,000 in donations
it had received. Clinton's camp had classified the group as a soft
money PAC, though Lazio said none of the money went toward
supporting his Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides, apparently concerned that news of his remarks
would overtake his plan to use Tuesday's upstate visit to emphasize
high technology as a route to statewide prosperity, sought to
portray Clinton as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, his campaign office had sent an e-mail message
pointing reporters to an article in the September 1999 issue of
Brill's Content magazine on how Clinton dealt with the press as the
first lady of Arkansas. The article includes a 1990 photograph of
Clinton pointing her finger at the Republican candidate for
governor, Tim McRae. She had interrupted his news conference to
castigate his criticism of Bill Clinton, then governor, for
extensive out-of-state travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously feels that the first candidate debate
was a little too New York for her,'' said Bill Dal Col, Lazio's
campaign manager. ``But she should realize that what's good for the
goose is good for the gander, and she can't give a spirited
performance in Arkansas and then play the victim when things don't
go her way in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign declined to comment on the article.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio went on to a celebration of the opening of his Syracuse
campaign headquarters and a reception here by the New York State
Aftermarket Association, a trade group of auto parts dealers that
his father had belonged to.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not discuss the debate on Tuesday as she campaigned
in the Bronx. She attended the opening of the children's emergency
ward at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, delivering a
detailed speech about the deficiencies of pediatric health care and
restating her pledge not to give up on health care reform for both
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quit,'' Clinton said. ``I don't think any of us can
afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised to pursue legislation that would allow imports
from Canada of pharmaceuticals that are sold cheaper there and to
``keep working across party lines'' to make everyday health care
more affordable in other ways. She said the United States should
not only be the richest country in the world, but the healthiest.

KNIVES TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE TRUE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kyocera knives have all the cachet needed to persuade home cooks
to plunk down $100: the endorsement of Ming Tsai, a celebrity chef;
great press; a novel material (ceramic in the blades); and a
beautiful design.
</P>
<P>
   Just one thing is missing: quality.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary ceramic blade, which is not supposed to need
sharpening, has a decent edge. But it has almost no flexibility, so
it will not bend as you work around the bones when carving a
chicken, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The largest knife, which is just six inches long, is also
extremely light, which is not good when you're chopping. The
problems were the same with all sizes of the knives, from a
three-inch parer to a six-inch serrated bread knife.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, these knives are fragile. The documentation
that comes with them instructs you not to cut anything too hard and
not to bang the knives or they may chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasts many months or years without sharpening,'' the pamphlet
states, but then it offers no information about how to sharpen
them.
</P>
<P>
   My stainless steel knives need sharpening _ a pleasurable skill
worth learning. But they can also be banged against a cutting board
to flatten a clove of garlic and can survive a fall to the floor
without breaking my bank account.

OREGON IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL RESIGNS AMID FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a wave of complaints about abusive treatment of
foreigners by immigration agents that gave Oregon's largest city
the unwanted nickname of ``Deportland'' in some Asian countries,
the top immigration official in Portland said Tuesday that he was
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, David Beebe, followed calls for his
resignation by the city's mayor, the state's governor and several
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were incensed about some highly publicized
incidents of mistreatment of foreigners arriving from Japan at the
Portland airport, and over continuing reports that Portland
immigration agents detained or deported foreign travelers at much
higher rates than at other West Coast airports.
</P>
<P>
   A furor erupted last month over a report in The Oregonian, the
state's biggest newspaper, that agents had strip-searched and
jailed a Chinese businesswoman for two nights before concluding
that her passport was legitimate and sending her on her way to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's mayor, Vera Katz, described the incident as
``monstrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the official wrath fell on Beebe, 55, a 25-year veteran
of the immigration agency, whose defenders said that he operated
his district ``by the book'' and that there were several reasons to
explain why Portland's deportation rates might be higher than those
in other big West Coast cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some defenders said he was being used as a scapegoat for doing
his job too well.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, citing low ridership and saying the immigration
agency situation was a factor, said earlier this month that it was
discontinuing all nonstop flights from Asia to Portland, beginning
next April.

HEIR APPARENT LEAVES POST AT BIG INSURER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After building the most powerful insurance company in America
over three decades, Maurice R. Greenberg apparently wanted nothing
more than to leave one of his sons in charge when he died.
</P>
<P>
   But that dream seemed to evaporate Tuesday with the abrupt
announcement that Evan Greenberg, his 45-year-old son, was leaving
American International Group. Maurice R. Greenberg had designated
Evan, the president and chief operating officer, as the crown
prince and had repeatedly defended him as the best choice for the
job, even amid lingering speculation that his eldest son, Jeffrey,
might have been the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement stunned Wall Street and set off a torrent of
speculation about whether Evan had, in fact, quit or been fired,
and whether Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of AIG,
might now be maneuvering to buy the big brokerage and investment
firm Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos. as a way of bringing Jeffrey back into
the fold. Jeffrey Greenberg, 48, now chief executive of Marsh &AMP;
McLennan, resigned from AIG in 1995, at a time when many were
regarding him as a likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that succession is imminent. Greenberg, at 75, is in robust
health, remaining a fierce skier and tennis player. He adamantly
insists he has no intention of retiring soon. While most
shareholders back Greenberg's choices because of his strong track
record, some have rebelled at the choice of a family member as
successor. And analysts said they detected some uneasiness among
board members.
</P>
<P>
   The tone at AIG on Tuesday was subdued. John Wooster, the chief
spokesman, said pointedly that Evan Greenberg, who had been with
the company 25 years, ``resigned and was not fired.'' But he would
not discuss the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Through the spokesman, the senior Greenberg said he was ``busy
with meetings'' and could not return a reporter's call.
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Greenberg did return a call. There had been no blow-up,
he said, no effort to push him off the track of succeeding to
arguably the most important insurance job in the country. There had
been no big problems in the company and no particular tensions with
his father. And what of the criticism about his lack of a college
degree, the talk that he might not be up to the top job? These, he
said, had not been factors either.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with admiration and respect for his father. Rather than
being sad, he seemed in high spirits, relieved, perhaps, that after
a quarter of a century of climbing the rungs in a company that in a
way was an extension of his home, he was striking out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone leaves home some time,'' he said. ``This is my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he plan to do next? ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I
haven't figured that out yet. But I will.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had come to the decision ``over a period of time, but
recently concluded my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   His last day in the office was Monday. ``I told the CEO I was
leaving,'' Greenberg said, referring to his father. ``And we
discussed it. And that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say how long the men talked and whether his father
tried to change his mind. How did his father take the announcement?
``I don't think we want to get into that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Greenberg had struck a similar note when he resigned as
an executive vice president in 1995, just weeks after Evan was
awarded the same title, giving the appearance of a possible
rivalry. He also said it was the right time to pursue an
independent career, and also did not know what he would do next.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance analysts generally dismissed the idea that the senior
Greenberg would try to haul Jeffrey back by buying his company. For
one thing, a conflict of interest _ or at least the suggestion of
it _ would arise from a giant insurer's owning a big brokerage
firm. After all, a broker's reputation and profit rests on its
ability to buy insurance independently for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wooster nor Barbara Perlmutter, a spokesman for Marsh,
would comment. Analysts said it also seemed unlikely that Jeffrey
Greenberg would want to give up the independence he reportedly
craved to return to AIG while his father was still clearly in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than swooning at the news of Evan Greenberg's departure,
AIG's stock rose 13 cents Tuesday, to $88.50. But some analysts
said that its uptick, along with Marsh's, was probably less a
comment on the departure and the speculation of a deal than a
reflection of an upturn in many property-casualty and financial
services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   From a strategic standpoint, no one had any doubt that AIG, a
company with more than $268 billion in assets and revenue last year
of $40.6 billion, would continue to dominate commercial coverage in
the United States and much of the world and that its push into life
insurance, investments, and car insurance would continue to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as a disaster,'' said Michael Frinquelli, a
principal in the Renaissance Fund Advisers, an investment fund that
specializes in insurance, who has been following AIG for more than
20 years. On the other hand, he said, ``I don't see this as a big
positive for AIG, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern involving Evan has been that this empire was
always going to be in the Greenberg family,'' Frinquelli said.
``Now, if a non-Greenberg takes over next, I suppose people could
see that as good. But Evan has been there in AIG operations a long
time and presumably some of the Greenberg touch rubs off on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance experts said that several key AIG executives had left
in the last 18 months, creating tension between father and son. But
several analysts and some former employees said they doubted the
loss of the executives would have undermined the senior Greenberg's
confidence in his son. That confidence, they said, had seemed
unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   Tobey J. Russ, an executive who left AIG in June to join the
Chubb Group, said he felt the two had ``not only an excellent
relationship,'' but that Evan had his father's ``private and very
public support.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other insurance experts talked of the senior Greenberg's
reputation as a taskmaster and said the two Greenberg sons had been
under even more pressure to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Greenberg joined AIG when he was 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He had been out of prep school three years and had been
hitchhiking around the country, picking up jobs as a short-order
cook and bartender. Through another AIG executive, Greenberg's
father offered him a job. The younger man agreed to start as an
underwriter in the Denver office on condition that no one there be
told he was the boss' son.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the higher reaches of AIG, the younger Greenberg
directed the company's operations in Japan and Korea and its
international property-casualty business.
</P>
<P>
   While in the New York office he attended New York University and
the College of Insurance, though he never earned a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the senior Greenberg's dynastic approach to
succession have said that when a chief executive picks a relative
as heir apparent well before he is expected to step down, some
top-quality people _ seeing no chance to become boss _ go
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, analysts said there appeared to be something of a
gulf in leadership between a handful of top AIG executives in their
60's and most of the operational executives who are in their 30's
and 40's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of obvious successors,'' said one analyst,
who, like most others with anything mildly critical to say, spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are clearly capable,'' he said, ``but
there is not one person who stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   In its entire history, AIG has had two chief executives: C.V.
Starr, who founded the company in Shanghai in 1919, and Greenberg,
who took over in 1967, after seven years with the company.
Greenberg took AIG public two years later. Under his direction it
has been one of the most successful American companies, with its
earnings and stock price growing at about 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   At AIG's annual meeting in May, a handful of shareholder groups
protested Greenberg's rule and his anointing of Evan during a joint
trip to China in January. But as Greenberg reeled off another year
of stellar achievements and announced another stock split, most
shareholders at the meeting stared coldly at the complainers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was pressed about the choice of his son, Greenberg said
curtly: ``We're not going to go into that again. That's been
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard to get a good, independent sense of how Evan
Greenberg might have performed as chief executive. Subordinates
have described his thoroughness and command of the nuances of the
business. Some said he was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company considered him to be a talented insurance
executive,'' said Weston Hicks, an insurance analyst at J.P.
Morgan. ``He certainly commanded the respect of the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   In the phone conversation, the younger Greenberg said that while
he had no idea whether he would stay in insurance, such a choice
would be ``fairly natural.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my craft,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After listening to designers relay their contrived
references season after season _ Julie Christie in ``Darling,''
Petula Clark in ``The Runaway Bus,'' Golda Meir meets ``Sabrina'' _
there's nothing quite as refreshing as handing the microphone over
to Hussein Chalayan. A few days before he showed his spring 2001
line for Tse New York at the Roseland Ballroom on Monday, Chalayan
offered these words: ``I don't refer to anything really, anything
historical, anything about clothes from the '60s, anything at all.
It's based on the idea of a circle, a square and a triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the clothes flowing from the sewing machines of most
young designers, Chalayan's never seem a result of a trip to a
vintage-dress dealer or a few nights at the Film Forum. It is
perhaps because he refuses to follow the pack that fashion editors,
the most egregious pack followers of all, have had little use for
him.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a shame. Chalayan, who shows his own line in London,
speaks of his work for Tse almost dismissively: ``It's not the
collection I'd do for myself. I work on Tse more than I need to.''
Yet many ideas he explores in London _ architectural lines, the
notion that the meaning of anything is never on the surface _ play
out just as compellingly in the work he produces here.
</P>
<P>
   At his show, Chalayan displayed beautifully patterned sweaters
and skirts, many of which looked as though they might unfold or
unwrap. Some sweaters were layered in front; a skirt might tie
overtly on the side or be draped in semicircular petals.
</P>
<P>
   Chalayan's greatest trick, though, may be his ability to use
colors and graphic prints so dramatically, and yet allow the woman
wearing them to seem elusive, even chilly. Women who buy his
clothes pay dearly for that image. He is the rare designer whose
commercial line is priced higher than his own, more rarefied one.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Tse show, a few hours after a group of
editors discussed the ``shoe anxiety'' that accompanies attending
Fashion Week, another designer who seems nostalgic for no other
decade than the one she is living in showed her sportswear for the
first time in a gallery in Tribeca. Deborah Hampton spent years
working as a designer for Michael Kors before moving with her
husband to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's clothes are the kind a woman addicted to Jil Sander
would appreciate: rich fabrics and lines as clean as on a Georg
Jensen pitcher. Hampton displayed her clothes on a garment rack,
and also on a wide video screen with models digitally imposed
against background pictures her husband, Paul Moore, a
photographer, took in the Arizona desert. She offered a smart khaki
windowpane-pattern skirt suit, among other looks, and a rodeo shirt
that looked not nearly as costumey as it sounds, in navy silk with
beige patch pockets. She also showed what seems to be turning up on
every runway: the shirtdress. Hers came belted, in a sleek
above-the-knee white satin.
</P>
<P>
   The shirtdress, as something to go to a benefit in rather than
as something to pretend you serve chicken on Lufthansa in, turned
up repeatedly at the Badgley Mischka show, also on Monday. There
were versions in full sequins and one in sequins with a silk panel
in back. Going to see the evening dresses of Mark Badgley and James
Mischka is like picking up a copy of In Style: you know you're
supposed to be above the airbrushed glamour of it all, but the
effort in both cases is completely unironic. The desire to make the
Kirstie Alleys of the world look good is so utterly pure, you can't
help taking it in with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cole, who is now producing women's clothes, held his
first runway show at Grand Central Terminal on Monday morning.
There was little worth commenting upon _ white cotton shorts here;
a patterned, pleated skirt that looked like last season's Marni
there _ and one wished that Cole's clothes were as clever as his ad
campaigns. Or as clever as his opener: before the show, Jon Stewart
offered some political comedy on a video screen and encouraged the
fashion crowd to vote.

   NEW YORK _ E.B. White, that great chronicler of life in New
York, once said of the city's mood-altering powers, ``You always
feel that either by shifting your location 10 blocks or by reducing
your fortune by $5 you can experience rejuvenation.'' White
probably wasn't thinking of models whisking themselves down a
catwalk, but the line rings true for fashion, too.
</P>
<P>
   Shift the action from the tents in Bryant Park, where Oscar de
la Renta presented a girly spring collection before a familiar
society crowd on Tuesday, to a street corner in Greenwich Village,
where Marc Jacobs played to a front row of hip celebrities and
aging rockers on Monday night, and you instantly get a different
picture of fashion and New York.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta, having spent some years in Paris and lived a little
as well, must know that there is a club in that city named after
him, Oscar de la Disco. Certainly, there were moments in his
up-and-down show when one wondered if, by proposing tangerine
spangled pants and enormous bubble skirts, he wasn't suggesting to
his well-heeled customers that they roll back the good Aubussons
and hold Watusi parties.
</P>
<P>
   This side of de la Renta, admittedly the fun side of a man who
has probably never shirked a dance partner, took over the
collection, sending it veering from a shredded organza pouf dress
(a thank you to Karl Lagerfeld) to a lovely, almost pared-down
version of the Madame X dress of the Sargent portrait. De la Renta
evidently picked up the girly vibe rumbling through fashion, but
it's not his style, and when a model came out wearing a clingy
black sweater with what looked like a pink satin inner tube blown
up around her hips, you had to wonder if it was something concocted
at the last minute. Just to compete.
</P>
<P>
   He fared much better with day clothes, particularly beaded
sweaters in powder blue or melon over crystal pleated skirts, and
some snappy mackintoshes in mellow candy stripes over short skirts.
He can do short and sexy, all right, but it has to look as natural
as Carmen Kass swinging out in her Baby Jane Holzer bouffant in a
navy cashmere polo over flirty tennis skirt.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jacobs, his shows are so loaded with references to
fashion's fabulous past that it sometimes seems as if he is
administering a pop quiz, and that if you don't get the answer
right _ indeed, if you don't get it period _ you will be sent to
the corner with a dunce cap. Except it will say ``geek.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the arbitrary power that designers have to change their
style each season, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Jacobs
abandoned the classic suits and town coats he showed for fall, with
their boxy shapes and neat luggage trims, which evoked an era in
New York when young women, perhaps down from Vassar or Smith, still
dressed up. In a tented playground on Monday night, the image that
Jacobs' chaotic spring clothes conjured up was completely different
_ Madonna in her wild-child, CBGB period or maybe ``Valley Girl,''
the 1983 movie, seen through the eyes of a designer who now spends
most of his time in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   This meant deliberate clashes of color, but loud, campy colors
like aqua and pink or yellow and royal blue. Jacobs opened with
slinky T-shirts in cotton jersey that slipped off a shoulder or
were crunched in folds at the elbow, and were a little like the
style of Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga, but looser, more disco.
These, and bustiers, were generally shown with cotton skirts that
flared away from the hips or fell in tiers of ruffles to the knee.
It's hard to remember when Jacobs last showed a piece of jewelry,
but pinned on many of the clothes _ peplum jackets and taffeta
knicker suits _ were plastic brooches flocked with rhinestones. And
there were hair clips with tulle rosettes and more ornaments on the
vividly colored stilettos.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a follower of fashion, if you consider yourself
reasonably astute and not too slow or shabby, you are probably at
this moment choking on one word: ``peplum.'' You are wondering,
What gives? And the answer is wrapped in the camp style of a
fashion that is constantly being revived. Many of Jacobs' new
clothes are cute and adorable, and one can imagine hordes of young
women, who gag on the word ``ladylike,'' trampling toward the
Village next spring in girly skirts and drooping T-shirts in lurid
candy-color hues.
</P>
<P>
   But the trouble with revivalism in an era of instant Internet
recall is that it's harder now to get the distance one needs to
view a former style ironically. Thirty years ago, Yves Saint
Laurent could shock timid souls, as he did when he presented his
landmark 1940s-inspired haute couture collection, a show that sent
the columnist Eugenia Sheppard running to the teletype machine, or
wherever editors ran to in those days, to declare that the clothes
were ``truly hideous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few times in Sheppard's career when she did
not get it. Saint Laurent's clothes were, in fact, pure camp, but
he had the advantage of distance and the meandering pace of change.
Outrage was still possible.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee Teng put on a good show in the tents Tuesday ,
displaying a much lighter hand than she did last season. She opened
with fluid sarong skirts and cotton tank tops and advanced to some
sweet sundresses in a white grid-pattern eyelet or a brown and
maroon tattersall check. The clothes had a slight vintage feel,
with seersucker and cotton pique and a little knit shirt bursting
with tropical flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs returned to the stage Tuesday with his new, lower-priced
Marc line, which seemed to be designed for people with the
attention span of puppies. But it was cute and tauntingly slutty,
with the models stepping out in glitter hot pants, striped cotton
playsuits with woven rainbow belts and anklets, and one blue ruched
jumpsuit with slightly kinky overtones.

 FRANKLIN RESOURCES A TAKEOVER TARGET  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Franklin Resources, the San Mateo, Calif.,
mutual fund company, may be an acquisition target of a giant German
insurance firm, according to European press reports.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz AG, Europe's No. 2 insurer, is holding preliminary
takeover talks with Franklin and three smaller U.S. money
management firms, the Reuters news agency reported Tuesday, citing
a German banking source. A Franklin spokeswoman declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which offers stock and bond funds under the
Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series names, is the sixth-largest
U.S. fund company, with $236 billion in assets. It's known for its
international stock funds, bond funds and ``value'' investing
style, which focuses on stocks that are cheap relative to a
company's assets and expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Franklin has responded positively to
Allianz's overture.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters characterized the German insurer's contact as
``exploratory.'' The German newspaper Handelsblatt, without
identifying Franklin as the target, reported Tuesday that an
Allianz deal to buy a U.S. asset management company is not expected
to be concluded in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The reported overture to Franklin comes amid a wave of takeovers
of U.S. money-management firms by European financial institutions.
Companies in Europe believe that demand will rise there for
American-style mutual funds and other investment vehicles, and they
are looking to U.S. firms for products and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Allianz paid $3.3 billion for a 70 percent
stake in Pimco Advisors, based in Newport Beach, Calif., one of the
world's largest managers of bond funds for institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   While Franklin is publicly owned, members of the founding
Johnson family hold top management positions and control more than
a third of the firm's shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been pretty adamant for a long time that they are
not going to sell,'' said Neil Epstein, an analyst at Putnam Lovell
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe the lofty prices money management
firms are commanding could tempt the Johnsons to relinquish their
grip.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Guy Moszkowski issued a
report estimating that the possibility of a Franklin sale in the
next year had risen to 35 percent from 20 percent. He calculated
the company could fetch $70 per share in a takeover, roughly $17
billion, 60 percent above Tuesday's closing price of $43.66.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franklin would be a particularly attractive candidate for some
acquirers given its strong brand names, large scale in active
international management (and) diverse product line,'' Moszkowski
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms reported to be in Allianz's sights are Waddell &AMP;
Reed, Gabelli Asset Management and Nicholas Applegate, all much
smaller than Franklin. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday
that Allianz was one of several bidders for Nicholas Applegate.
</P>
<P>
   The four firms vary sharply in their investment styles and the
customers they serve. Nicholas Applegate, for example, favors an
aggressive ``growth'' style of investing that is very different
from Franklin's value approach.

 SUN MICROSYSTEMS TO BUY COBALT NETWORKS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Moving down-market isn't always cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, which has made billions marketing servers that
cost tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars, Tuesday agreed to
spend $2 billion to acquire Cobalt Networks, a money-losing venture
that sells ``server appliances'' that start at only $800.
</P>
<P>
   Server appliances are generally small, low-cost devices
preconfigured to handle a specific task, such as serving up Web
pages, running e-mail software or providing extra data storage for
networked users. The devices are also usually much easier to
install and administer than the larger servers Sun has
traditionally offered.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, server-appliance sales will total about $1.7 billion
this year, but by 2004 they're expected to increase to $15.5
billion, according to Mark Melenovsky, research manager for the
appliance server market at International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt, Melenovsky said, is the unit leader in Web-server
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been effective in penetrating the retail hosting
environment, the bargain-basement market,'' said Jonathan Schwartz,
senior vice president for corporate strategy at Palo Alto, Calif.'s
Sun. Noting that Sun originally bought its way into the high end of
the server market, he added that ``the appliance market is going to
be a large one, and the best path for us is to acquire our way into
it.`
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Sun will offer a half-share, valued at $57.63, for
each share of Cobalt. That's a 40-percent premium compared with
Cobalt's Monday closing price. Cobalt, in Mountain View, Calif.,
jumped $16.07, or 39 percent, to $57.19 after the buyout was
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12.2 million of the shares changed hands, more than 18
times the company's average trading volume. Sun shares rose $2.44
to $117.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun is acquiring not just a business, but also a business
model,'' said Jean Bozman, research director for IDC's server
group. ``Cobalt has figured out a way to make servers for less than
$1,000, which is something Sun has never been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt hasn't yet, however, figured out how to sell such
products at a profit. For the quarter ended June 30, the 4-year-old
company recorded a net loss of $6 million on revenues of $16.2
million. Revenue, though, was up 223 percent compared with the same
quarter in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, Cobalt shares had fallen 68 percent from their
closing price of $128.13 on their first day of trading, last Nov.
5. The company had sold 5 million shares at $22 each.
</P>
<P>
   IDC's Bozman noted that the acquisition represents ``quite a
step'' for Sun because the Cobalt servers are built around the
Linux operating system and Advanced Micro Devices' Intel-compatible
processors. Sun's own machines use the company's Solaris operating
system and its Sparc processor family.
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt is noted for its distinctive Qube2, a blue, cube-shaped
server appliance pitched to small businesses and schools, but the
company derives the bulk of its business from selling rack-mounted
servers to Internet service providers and Web-hosting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will begin selling Cobalt products immediately and add the
entire Cobalt management team to its payroll, Sun said. Cobalt's
chairman is veteran Intel Corp. engineer Gordon Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, Sun's sixth this year, is expected to be
completed by year's end, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sun's rivals in the server market, including Compaq,
Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, have already introduced
server-appliance products. IBM last year acquired Whistle
Communications, a Foster City pioneer in the category. Intel has
also entered the market with a series of products under the
NetStructure rubric.

GROW A BUSINESS: LESSER-KNOWN FIRMS WORK HARD FOR VENTURE CAPITAL  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Having a big name and track record may be an
unfair advantage for entrepreneurs as well as athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the publicity The Chronicle and other news
organizations have given former San Francisco 49ers Joe Montana,
Harris Barton and Ronnie Lott for their venture-capital endeavors
and Internet wunderkind Marc Andreessen for his various high-tech
involvements and investments.

<P>
   The Andreessen aura helped Loudcloud Inc., the Sunnyvale,
Calif., provider of Internet infrastructure services that he
co-founded last September, quickly attract nearly $190 million in
venture-capital financing.
</P>
<P>
   Competing firms headed by lesser-known executives have a tougher
time raising money. Just ask Catherine Chiu, chief executive
officer of Certainty Solutions, a Redwood City, Calif., competitor
to Loudcloud and other Internet plumbing services providers,
including SiteSmith, LogicTier, MimEcom and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to overcome the noise from all the other
companies saying they do the same thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu took over the 4-year-old company, then known as Global
Networking and Computing, early this year. One of her first acts
was to rename the company Certainty Solutions to give it a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu, who has electrical engineering and MBA degrees and has
worked as an engineer, chief financial officer, investment banker
and venture capitalist, also is focusing on raising money and
improving marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's first outside financing, Chiu raised $4 million
in angel capital in April. Now she is approaching venture-capital
firms for $20 million more and would like to spend about a third of
it on marketing, including billboards, radio spots, and
advertisements in the trade press. To compete with the Loudclouds
of the world, she said it is not enough to rely on customer
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGBOARD 2001: The Springboard 2000 forum for female
entrepreneurs was so successful that another one is scheduled for
February at the Oracle Conference Center at Redwood Shores, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of all other
business beginners, but their access to capital has not caught up
with demand. For example, 1998 statistics from VentureOne, the San
Francisco VC research firm, show that only 4 percent of information
technology companies that received venture capital had a female
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum for Woman Entrepreneurs, which sponsors the
Springboard series along with National Women's Business Council and
the Center for Women &AMP; Enterprise, hopes to change that.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Silicon Valley forum in January, 26 women were
chosen from more than 350 applicants to pitch their companies to
more than 300 accredited investors. Their startups subsequently
raised more than $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   Applications to present at the February 2001 event are now being
accepted online at www.springboard2001.org. Thirty promising
women-led technology and life-sciences startups seeking from $1
million to $25 million each will be selected to present their
business plans.
</P>
<P>
   SOME BIG FISH: There is no Olympic event for entrepreneurs to
show off their earning power, speed to market or ability to slam
dunk the competition. But the September issue of Red Herring
magazine picks the top 10 entrepreneurs of 2000, including six from
the Bay Area. (Like NBC's home-country bias in its coverage from
Sydney, San Francisco's Red Herring shows a preference for
entrepreneurs from its own backyard.)
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring's local heroes are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Steve Kirsch, CEO of Propel, a Santa Clara, Calif., company
that wants to standardize Web applications for online commerce and
committed 1 percent of its equity to charity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Judy Estrin and Bill Carrico, the husband-and-wife founders
of Packet Design, a Menlo Park, Calif., developer of new Internet
and networking technologies.
</P>
<P>
   -- K.B. Chandrasekhar, CEO of Firecracker, a Sunnyvale, Calif.,
provider of e-mail, conferencing, sales automation and other
Web-based applications for midsize companies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wu-Fu Chen, who launched 11 networking companies during the
past 15 years and is now acting CEO of four startups, including
OptiMight Communications, a Mountain View, Calif., optical
transport technology company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Martin Cooper, credited as the father of wireless
communications, whose new company, ArrayComm in San Jose, Calif.,
is trying to bring broadband networking to mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mory Ejabat and Jeanette Symons, who co-founded Zhone
Technologies, an Oakland, Calif., developer of network delivery
equipment that integrates voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring's other top entrepreneurs are Edward Tian, who is
bringing the Internet to billions as CEO of AsiaInfo in Beijing;
Kevin Wendle, CEO of the IFilm portal for movie fans and
professionals in Los Angeles; Brian Sullivan, CEO of
SimonDelivers.com, a Minneapolis Internet grocery store; and Daniel
Aegerter, CEO of Armada Venture Group, an Atlanta venture capital
firm.

 ENTREPRENEURS CREATE NEW PUBLIC RELATIONS NICHE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The ``digital divide'' has become more than a
political talking point. It is also spawning businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To help universities and other nonprofits deliver news to the
media and Web sites quickly, efficiently and cheaply, former San
Jose Mercury News business writer Ron Wolf and former University of
California at Berkeley business school spokesman David Irons
started a public interest news wire called AScribe
(www.ascribe.org).
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few decades, Business Wire in San Francisco and PR
Newswire in New York have carved out a lucrative business
delivering corporate financial news and features electronically to
the media. They typically charge corporations $525 to $550 for the
first 400 words of a release.
</P>
<P>
   That is out of the price range of many colleges, universities,
medical centers, foundations and other nonprofits. Not only do they
have smaller public relations budgets than big businesses, but they
also are not obliged by government ``prompt and full disclosure''
rules to spread the news _ regardless of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   AScribe is addressing what Wolf calls the ``digital divide'' in
the news release business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Securities and Exchange Commission says public companies
must release news that might move the market in a timely manner,
and the duopoly of PR Newswire and Business Wire charge about $500
to get through their turnstile,'' he said. ``That means many higher
education and nonprofit organizations get left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, colleges and others can mail press releases. But Wolf
knows from personal experience that reporters and editors tend to
throw out most of their mail unopened. ``Today, you're either in
the digital stream or you're in the recycling bin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irons, meanwhile, was frustrated that universities often had a
difficult time getting noticed and discussed establishing a Bay
Area college news wire. However, it quickly became clear that it
would be difficult to agree on who would organize, govern and pay
for such a service.
</P>
<P>
   So in early 1998, Wolf and Irons started what they call ``a news
wire with a social conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, we've let corporate commercial interests pump
sludge into our newsrooms,'' said Wolf. ``We want to make AScribe
the PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public
Radio) of the news release business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Irons went to a consultant to find a name for the
company but balked at the $25,000 fee. Friends and associates came
up with AScribe, a name that could be copyrighted and had a meaning
that tied in with the business. (An unrelated site,
www.ascribe.com, offers information on software for the
pharmaceuticals industry.)
</P>
<P>
   AScribe first set up shop in rent-free UC Berkeley Incubator
space in the basement of the Bancroft Hotel. UC Riverside signed on
as its first client, and AScribe has since added seven other UC
campuses and universities from Hawaii to Harvard. Its approximately
300 clients also include nonprofits such as the American Dental
Association, the American Library Association, the Sierra Club and
national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   AScribe also has signed up more than 50 media outlets, including
The Chronicle, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal and
USA Today. It offers its services through the Associated Press
wire, Dow Jones Interactive, Lexis Nexis and various other Web
services.
</P>
<P>
   On top of their initial $141,000 investment from ``friends and
family,'' Wolf and Irons raised about $650,000 from angel investors
and are now looking for more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But AScribe still subscribes to frugality. The company sublets
space in the former Breuner's Furniture headquarters building from
the Oakland Redevelopment Agency for $1.75 per square foot per
month. Like many startups, it has bought used furniture to conserve
cash, and it relies on 5-year-old Sun Microsystems Sparc servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our burn rate is less than the average UC campus bar bill,''
joked Irons.
</P>
<P>
   AScribe is also modest in the way it bills clients. It charges a
$90 annual membership fee and $12.50 to $17.50 per release,
regardless of length.
</P>
<P>
   The rates may soon rise, but Wolf said they will still be only a
small fraction of what Business Wire and PR Newswire charge.
Eventually, AScribe plans to make as much as 80 percent of its
money not from university and other content providers but from the
thousands of Web sites that are hungry for university and nonprofit
news.
</P>
<P>
   The company is sending out about 30 news releases per day on
education, science, medicine, public policy and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recent releases include news of a UC Berkeley business school
class on philanthropy and an Institute of Medicine report that
causes of the Gulf War Syndrome remain unclear. But the
effectiveness of AScribe in getting stories in the press remains
unclear. That's because it is difficult to determine whether
reporters were tipped off by AScribe or the original news source.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, early clients of AScribe seem pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities and other nonprofits must find ways to aggregate
news so that it stands out in newsrooms and is easy to use for the
builders of Web portals and other online services,'' said Harvard
Medical School Associate Dean Don Gibbons. ``AScribe offers just
such tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorry Lokey, who started Business Wire in 1961, said, ``There is
room for a company like AScribe that provides service to a niche
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lokey, 73, is content to concentrate on the booming business of
delivering corporate news. After attending Stanford University,
where he was editor of the campus newspaper, Lokey went to work as
a wire editor for United Press before going into public relations.
In 1959, he became intrigued by a Los Angeles wire service that
transmitted news for restaurants and cemeteries, and two years
later, he started Business Wire to deliver business news.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he charged companies $15 per release and had 16 media
clients in the Bay Area. Today, Business Wire has 500 employees in
26 domestic bureaus and Belgium and serves 17,000 clients and 4,500
media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey has done well with his $2,000 investment. He figures the
number of Business Wire press releases will top 275,000 this year
and total revenues will exceed $150 million, compared with $110
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Business Wire's profit margins exceed 20 percent, according to
Lokey. But he is not the only one doing well. Three years ago,
Lokey decided to give half the company to his employees. He also
has pledged $80 million to his alma mater and $1 million more to
other nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said he controls 54 percent of the U.S. business
press-release market. But on the global stage, PR Newswire is the
oldest and largest.
</P>
<P>
   It was started in 1954 by TV Guide founder Herbert Muschel at a
time when Federal Communications Commission regulations allowed
only AT&AMP;T and Western Union to send a printed message to another
person. PR Newswire was set up as a membership association, and all
copy became the property of the news wire for the purpose of
transmitting news releases to multiple media destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, PR Newswire has 30 domestic and nine foreign bureaus and
is still based in New York, although it has changed hands several
times. It was bought by Western Union in 1971, which held it for 11
years before selling it to British media conglomerate United News &AMP;
Media.
</P>
<P>
   AScribe is not the only startup to enter the news wire industry
fray.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Wire of Los Angeles is using the Internet to deliver
press releases as well as graphics, audio and video files across a
dozen industry-specific channels such as business/finance,
entertainment, health and sports.
</P>
<P>
   In February, it raised $17.5 million in venture capital from
Sequoia Capital, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and other
investors. But it has been in the news most recently for falling
victim to a hoax allegedly perpetrated by a former employee who
sent out bogus negative news about a publicly traded Los Angeles
network equipment company.
</P>
<P>
   The fake news release last month temporarily drove down the
shares of Emulex Corp. by 62 percent before the news was corrected
and the stock recovered. An SEC and FBI investigation quickly led
to the arrest of a former Internet Wire employee.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the embarrassing mistake, Internet Wire CEO and
former PR agency boss Michael Terpin said the company has added new
layers of verification procedures and supervisors to make sure it
doesn't fall victim again to fraudulent market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   Terpin said the biggest benefit Internet Wire has over
established competitors such as Business Wire and PR Newswire is
that it is so much less expensive. The 2,500 companies and 300 PR
firms that use Internet Wire to send about 120 releases a day pay a
flat rate of $275 per release regardless of length.

 LEVI'S REPORTS BETTER MARGINS BUT SALES DROP  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a sign that troubled Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is
putting its financial house in order, the San Francisco company
Tuesday reported improved margins, lower debt and stronger cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, however, continued to skid, declining 8 percent in the
quarter ending Aug. 27 to $1.13 billion. After adjusting for
currency fluctuations, the drop totaled 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, by contrast, sales plummeted 20 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings results were mixed, with net income declining 32
percent from the third quarter of 1999 to $37.8 million. However,
factoring in one-time charges and accruals related to employee
compensation, net income actually rose 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gross margins for the quarter rose to 41.2 percent of sales, up
from 39 percent in 1999's third quarter as savings from U.S. plant
closures kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   The company also paid down $100 million in debt in the quarter _
twice as much as required under its credit agreements. Levi's has
repaid $465 million in debt in the first nine months of 2000.
Still, Philip Marineau, Levi's chief executive officer, said he
doesn't expect Levi's corporate bonds to return to ``investment
grade'' from their current high-risk status this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report comes as Marineau celebrates his one-year
anniversary at the helm of the company. Marineau replaced Robert
Haas, great-great-grandnephew of company founder Levi Strauss, last
September.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Chronicle on Tuesday, Marineau said his
three-year turnaround plan for Levi's continues to run ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at mid-single-digit sales declines at this point is way
ahead of where we expected to be,'' Marineau said. ``Next year will
be the stabilization year and that will give us an opportunity to
profitably grow the business in the years beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Tuesday's report paints a complicated picture of a
company that is mired in long-standing problems but slowly
progressing toward fiscal health, said Mary Chapman, vice president
of credit analysis for Aflac Inc., a health insurer that owns
Levi's bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them a lot of credit,'' Chapmans said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is ``doing what they need to be doing, which is getting
costs down, getting awareness of the product up, focusing on new
product in appropriate fashion areas and (improving) relationships
with retailers,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid worldwide softness in apparel sales, Levi's sales dropped
6.5 percent in the Americas and 18.6 percent in Europe, where an
anemic euro weakened consumer buying power. The Europe division's
turnaround is lagging four to five months behind the U.S.
division's, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   Asia was the bright spot, posting a sales jump of 14.7 percent
as trendy Japanese consumers took to Levi's space-age looking
``engineered'' jeans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sales were hurt by a shortage of 501s, Levi's flagship
product.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with bond analysts, Levi's executives said
the company had filled orders for the jeans on time and in the
right quantities _ an unusual accomplishment for Levi's, which has
been plagued by tardy deliveries for years. But retailers had
underestimated demand for 501s based on weakness in last year's
back-to-school season.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's was caught with its pants down, so to speak, because it
had dramatically reduced inventory levels as part of Marineau's
restructuring. Now the company is importing 501s from its European
plants to try to meet demand here. Retailers ``are unhappy,
clearly'' about the lack of 501s, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   To address its order-fulfillment problems, Levi's is conducting
a pilot project with a major retail customer using sales data from
individual stores.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly a new idea in retailing, and in fact, Levi's
spent hundreds of millions of dollars earlier this decade to
develop such a system. But it was never successful.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau, who declined to name the retail partner involved, said
he expects results from the initial test in 90 to 120 days. The
next step will be to re-engineer Levi's inventory tracking systems
and eventually the whole supply chain, which has been the most
troubled part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to start to remedy our operational issues,
but that's a multiple-year process,'' Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of Levi's secondary line, Dockers khakis, rose
about 2 percent in the United States and grew in double digits in
international markets as consumers respond to updated silhouettes
and stretchy fabrics, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Levi's is pushing 569s, a basic jean it believes will
appeal to 15-to-30 year olds. Sales of 569s have grown dramatically
since advertising began Aug. 23, although that was too late to have
much impact on third-quarter results, Marineau said.

PALMDALE GYMNAST SHINES, THEN RIPS KAROLYI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Jamie Dantzscher nailed the final three
routines of her elite gymnastics career. Then she hammered
gymnastics icon Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bela gets way too much credit,'' Dantzscher said late Tuesday
after helping the U.S. women to a solid, and surprising,
fourth-place finish in the Sydney Olympics team competition.
``Basically, he takes the credit when we do good and blames
everyone else when we do bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi has been national team coordinator since November,
called in to revive U.S. fortunes after a shaky, sixth-place
performance in the 1999 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-place finish here, where the Americans had a shot at
a medal until nearly the final routine, should have been a
feel-good event in women's gymnastics. Instead, it turned into a
vent-on-Bela session, led by the outspoken Dantzscher.
</P>
<P>
   She said Karolyi usurped the authority of individual coaches and
installed a standardized training regimen that did not suit all
athletes. She said the Romanian emigre treated people badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so much control, entirely too much control over the
U.S. team,'' said Dantzscher, a native of Palmdale who now trains
in San Dimas. `I think the individual coaches should have more
control, because they know best what we need. . . . It's really
sad, because he knows so much about the sport of gymnastics, but he
doesn't know how to treat people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher was angered Sunday when she did not learn until
moments before competition began that she would be competing in
only t on Karolyi's orders _ the vault and floor exercise. She
conceded she wanted to be in all four events so she could attempt
to qualify for the all-around competition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 15-year-old Tasha Schwikert competed in two events
because, Dantzscher said, Karolyi ``decided to play favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher said ``a majority'' of women on the team were unhappy
with Karolyi, who is known for developing Nadia Comaneci and
leading the 1996 U.S. team to a team gold at Atlanta. ``I'm not the
only one,'' she said. ``I'm just not afraid to speak my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Karolyi, watching from a seat in the media
area, expressed satisfaction at getting the U.S. women ``united as
a team, looking like a team and working like a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Romania won the gold medal. Russia was second and China third.
The U.S., led by Amy Chow and Elise Ray, missed a bronze medal by
1.75 points. Dantzscher was the No. 3 U.S. scorer despite competing
in only three of the four disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher's personal coach, Steve Rybacki, said crediting
Karolyi with the near-medal performance would be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people involved in the success of these
athletes, you can't pinpoint one person and say you're the hero,
you're the savior,'' Rybacki said. ``It doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes fantastic, it's because of the six, seven
years of hard work the athletes and coaches put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rybacki said there were ``communication problems'' between
Karolyi and the coaches. ``We wish there had been more
(communication),'' Rybacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Other gymnasts expressed at least mild unhappiness with the
come-or-else camps Karolyi held in Houston during the past nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America,'' Kristin Maloney said. ``We should be able
to train where we want, whether it's Pennsylvania or Texas. We
really wanted (a medal), and we went after it really hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That came from us, from deep down inside. It didn't come from
anybody else, and I speak for every gymnast.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chow: ``I think we all would prefer to train with our own
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi conceded the past nine months were ``a very, very hard
period''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy dealing with the fact that it is a team still
divided into so many splinters, with so many different ways to
coach. It was hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   American gymnasts might have to get used to Karolyi, for good or
ill. Robert Colarossi, president of USA Gymnastics, said Tuesday he
hopes to keep Karolyi in his current position and plans to
negotiate a deal after the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi, whose English is at times quirky, said it was difficult
not to be on the floor during the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I sat on my butt so long, for a whole competition,
which is now bleeding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rybacki doubted Karolyi on the floor would have made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had connected with all the girls, maybe it would have
helped,'' Rybacki said. ``But there were some girls he never
connected with during this entire process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Dawes, a veteran of the 1996 team, said Dantzscher
``has balls'' for criticizing Karolyi, but she also noted, ``We
definitely moved up since the worlds in 1999. We were sixth there
and now we're fourth, and that is definite improvement. More than
most people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Karolyi ``has proved himself since 1976 with a
multitude of gymnasts.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dantzscher, Jamie's father, was one of a dozen friends and
relatives attending Tuesday's competition wearing ``Team
Dantzscher'' jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing,'' John Dantzscher said, ``Jamie
Dantzscher's thoughts are not just Jamie Dantzscher's thoughts.
Coaches feel that way. Gymnasts. Parents. He also asked ``what
gymnast has he trained up from when she was a little kid, except
for Comaneci?''
</P>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's three-year battle to prevent the
use of marijuana as medicine as allowed under California law got a
well-deserved rebuke this month. A federal judge wisely ruled that
the administration could not punish doctors who recommend the
benefits of marijuana to their patients. Such a policy, wrote Judge
William Alsup, raises ``severe First Amendment doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215, approved by voters in California in 1996, made
it legal for seriously ill patients to obtain and use marijuana
when that therapy is recommended by a doctor. Seven other states
have since enacted similar measures. Marijuana possession remains
illegal under federal drug laws. But the federal government seldom
prosecutes medical marijuana users because the quantities are small
and juries tend to sympathize with seriously ill individuals.
Instead the administration has tried to circumvent the California
law by threatening doctors who recommend marijuana with the loss of
their federal licenses to prescribe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A class action was brought by California doctors and AIDS and
cancer patients who want to use marijuana to curb nausea and weight
loss. The suit charged the federal government with interfering with
patient-doctor communications and violating free speech rights.
Alsup ruled that the federal government could not revoke drug
licenses merely because a doctor makes a legitimate medical
judgment, even if the doctor's recommendation could then be used by
a patient to obtain marijuana under Proposition 215 in violation of
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   As the judge sensibly noted, a doctor may well make a
recommendation for marijuana without leading anyone to commit a
federal crime. A patient armed with that recommendation might lobby
for a change in federal drug laws, or enroll in a federally
approved experimental marijuana therapy program, or even travel to
a country where medical marijuana use is legal. Besides, it is the
patient and not the doctor who procures the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a report by the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the
National Academy of Sciences, found that ingredients in marijuana
can be effective for treating some symptoms associated with AIDS.
It recommended development of better delivery systems, such as
inhalers or patches. In the interim, it said that people who do not
respond to other therapies should be allowed to smoke marijuana in
controlled situations. The Clinton administration should stop
threatening doctors and make marijuana available to sick
individuals who need relief.

REV. ELLWOOD KIESER, PRIEST AND FILM PRODUCER, DIES AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ The Rev. Ellwood Kieser, an Emmy
Award-winning Roman Catholic priest who blended religious
commitment with a passion for making socially aware film and
television, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 71 and lived in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said the Rev. Frank Desiderio, his
associate and successor in his production company.
</P>
<P>
   Kieser (pronounced KY-zerr) was a well-known figure in the
entertainment industry, an imposing, burly 6-foot-7 clergyman who
spoke the lingo of the Hollywood producer with the same fervor he
used to cite his faith in social activism, nonviolence and the
human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other Catholic priest has made such a lasting contribution,
both as a producer and a pastor to the entertainment community,''
Father Desiderio said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Kieser founded the nonprofit Paulist Productions, named
for his order of priests. The company produced ``Insight,'' a
public service television series that won six Emmys during a
23-year run that ended in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Kieser was executive producer of the feature film ``Romero''
(1989), starring Raul Julia, about the assassination of Archbishop
Oscar Romero of El Salvador, who campaigned against the landowner-
and military-supported death squads.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced the film ``Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day
Story'' (1996), about the Roman Catholic activist, and was
executive producer of ``We Are the Children,'' an ABC drama set in
famine-stricken Ethiopia, starring Ted Danson, Judith Ivey and Ally
Sheedy.
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, the television writer and producer who helped create
``ER'' and other shows and who wrote scripts for Kieser, said on
Tuesday: ``The message he wanted to convey was secular. He
encouraged writers to show and glorify the way individuals can make
a difference. He was interested in showing the best parts of human
nature rather than what's often portrayed on films and
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kieser was best-known for establishing the annual
Humanitas Prize in 1974 to exemplify ``human values and bring the
insights of the Judeo-Christian vision of man to bear on our
contemporary situation.'' The prizes, ranging from $10,000 to
$25,000, were financed by the entertainment industry. At the most
recent awards ceremony in July, awards went to, among others, the
screenwriters of the films ``Love and Basketball'' and ``The
Insider,'' and the television adaptation of the book ``Tuesdays
With Morrie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These shows tackle the big questions _ the ones that keep us
awake in the middle of the night _ and they challenge us to seek
out our own answers,'' Kieser said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Kieser grew up in Philadelphia and graduated from La Salle
College in 1950. That year he joined the Paulist Fathers, who are
dedicated to the service of those outside their church. He earned a
doctorate in theology of communications from the Graduate
Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif., in 1973, writing his
dissertation on ``Cinema as a Religious Experience.'' He also
received two honorary doctor of letters degrees, one from Catholic
University, the other from La Salle.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by an older sister, Shirley Hoberg of Atherton,
Calif., and two younger brothers, Bill and Don, both of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides producing films, Father Kieser said he viewed himself,
almost in a secular way, as the conscience of the film and
television business, often criticizing the violence he saw on the
screen. But he deplored the idea of censorship and said he believed
movies and television were ideal vehicles for conveying spiritual
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus was a storyteller,'' he once said. ``He told stories in
order to challenge people and illumine the meaning of their lives
and motivate them to love. I would like to think I make movies for
the same purpose.''

MARY COLQUHOUN, 61, CASTING DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Colquhoun, a versatile, award-winning casting
director, died on Sept. 10 in Manhattan. She was 61 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was ovarian cancer, said Carol Fineman, general press
representative of the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York
Shakespeare Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Colquhoun (pronounced cull-HOON) received many honors, including
the Casting Society of America's Hoyt Bowers Award for lifetime
achievement. She was involved in more than 80 films, television
productions and Broadway and Off Broadway plays.
</P>
<P>
   Her work won Emmy awards for two HBO television films: ``Citizen
Cohn,'' about Roy Cohn, in 1993, and ``Truman'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Colquhoun and Irene Lamb assembled what Variety called a ``top
drawer'' cast for the film ``The Man who Cried,'' about a displaced
Jewish girl from Russia. It was directed and written by Sally
Potter and shown at the Venice Film Festival this month.
</P>
<P>
   Colquhoun, who was born in London, also handled casting for the
movies ``Glory,'' ``Sea of Love'' and ``A Shock to the System.''
Among the Broadway plays in which she was involved were `` 'Night,
Mother'' and ``Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Christina Burke; a brother, Patrick
Burke; a niece, Tawny Wagner; and three nephews, Toby Wagner,
Matthew Burke and Laurence Burke. All live in England.

CITY COUNCIL OKS LAPD DECREE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles City Council, bowing to the threat
of a Justice Department lawsuit, agreed in principle Tuesday to a
federal court consent decree over the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-2 vote came after a second consecutive day of lengthy
debate over the impact of the consent decree, which is expected to
come back to the council for final approval next week if it is
accepted by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good package, with broad consensus and now
we'll see what the Justice Department does,'' said City Attorney
James Hahn, who headed the city's negotiation team on the
agreement, which will include a federal monitor to audit the LAPD
and report to a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will agree to the changes we want and then we
will get on with reforming the Los Angeles Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the consent decree to the city is estimated at $25
million in start-up costs and as much as $45 million a year after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-page document detailing procedures the LAPD must comply
with is to be in effect for a minimum of five years and will be
lifted only after the city proves it is in compliance for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin, who represented Mayor Richard Riordan
on the negotiating team, said she believes the mayor will sign off
on the package if the Justice Department agrees to the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have done the best we can and I believe everyone
will be satisfied with this,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials last week indicated they would
support modifications sought by Riordan to limit the role of the
federal monitor _ to oversee the LAPD, not operate the department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal suggested by Riordan, council President John
Ferraro and Councilman Alex Padilla, the role of the federal
monitor would be limited to reviewing audits and the progress of
the LAPD in achieving the goals of the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This monitor will not be running the Police Department,''
Councilman Mike Feuer said. ``We are not giving up local control.
The Police Commission will continue to oversee the Police
Department along with the mayor and council.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the concessions being sought is that the monitor would
report on any problems in complying with the consent decree to the
Justice Department rather than to the federal court to allow
corrections to be made before the city is held in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there will be an effort to cap the amount to be
spent for the monitor and any staff the person has, as well as
allowing for the city and Justice Department to agree on who is
selected as monitor.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all officials were pleased with the proposal, and
council members Hal Bernson and Nate Holden voted against the
consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need this,'' Holden said. ``I am telling you that
this will come back to haunt the city. We are capable of doing
these reforms ourselves and I wonder why the Justice Department is
seeking this now, under this chief of police who has done more to
discipline officers than any chief we have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernson said he resented having to vote for the decree under
intense pressure from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before the Justice Department tells us how to run our
department, they ought to clean up the departments under them,''
Bernson said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that argument, the council approved a proposal from
its three Latino members _ Mike Hernandez, Nick Pacheco and Padilla
_ asking the Justice Department to work with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the FBI so those federal agencies would
be held to the same civil rights standards as the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The three council members who did not vote on the consent decree
Tuesday were Pacheco, who was away on city business in Washington,
D.C.; Rudy Svorinich Jr., who had an excused absence; and Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who had left the council meeting when the vote was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree came out of a four-year Justice Department
investigation into a ``pattern and practice'' of discrimination by
the LAPD. However, the Justice Department's civil rights division
did not press forward until after the Rampart scandal, which
included accusations that members of the LAPD Rampart Division's
anti-gang unit assaulted and planted evidence on individuals and
lied in court to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other main features of the agreement include development of a
computerized tracking system of officers based on their records and
complaints filed against them, and increased independence and scope
of work for the Inspector General's Office, which the council
agreed will continue to report to the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's debate, Councilman Joel Wachs won a short-lived
victory in his efforts to require the LAPD to restore the senior
lead officer program as part of the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Because of objections from the Police Department, however, the
council reversed itself after receiving assurances that the Police
Commission was close to a decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter Wachs, who along with Hahn is a candidate for mayor
next year, said he will continue to press the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it works around here,'' Wachs said. ``You put
in something the people want but the department doesn't, and the
department wins. That's why it was so important to get this into
the consent decree to force the department to return one of the
more important parts of community-based policing.''

FIRM GIVES 2ND OPINIONS ON BREAST EXAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ A Westlake Village firm with star
power behind it launched a service Tuesday that lets women get a
second opinion on their breast images electronically.
</P>
<P>
   With Whoopi Goldberg among its spokespeople, iMammogram.com will
offer, for a $75 fee, computer analysis of breast images taken by
radiologists. Danna Campbell, president and chief executive Officer
of iMammogram.com, hopes that the service known as CloserLook will
catch some of the estimated 21 percent of breast cancer not
detected by the physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It marks specific areas that might need a closer look,''
Campbell said. ``It's almost like a second look for the
radiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said she hopes that insurance coverage and economy of
scale will eventually drive down the price of CloserLook, though
radiologists say they are already drastically under-reimbursed for
the costs of the mammograms themselves. Dr. Lawrence Bassett, Iris
Cantor Professor of Breast Imaging at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center,
said CloserLook's technology could have long-term benefits, but she
harbors some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has some advantage in that the computer doesn't tend to get
tired,'' Bassett said. ``However, we have to understand it doesn't
replace an experienced radiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   CloserLook uses computer-aided detection to find potential
malignancies in breast tissue. Women who want the service can
request that their radiologists send their mammograms to iMammogram
for analysis. The company then sends the original film and
notations of possible areas of concern back to the radiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said iMammogram is in the midst of setting up meetings
with insurers to consider covering the service. In 1998, 175,000
new cases of breast cancer were detected in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk to anybody who doesn't know somebody who's
affected so it seems like every woman would support this,''
Campbell said.

   The ad is anything but subtle or subliminable.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's hand, representing Hillary Clinton's, reaches out with
an electric prod, digs into the most sensitive part of the male
anatomy, and _ bzzzzz!!
</P>
<P>
   The New York Conservative Party attack ad, which has been
running since Sunday, including twice during ``Meet the Press,''
depicts Hillary as a castrating rhymes-with-rich.
</P>
<P>
   The text is about how she got her hands on her (henpecked)
husband's health care plan and messed it up. The visual is an old
children's game, ``Operation,'' which has a flat figure of an
alarmed-looking naked male patient, with an electric
tweezer/scalpel attached to let you play doctor and extract bones
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Except, in this case, Hillary is ominously portrayed doing the
``operating'' with a pulsating instrument of torture. (Bzzzz!!)
</P>
<P>
   Little Ricky is desperately trying to prove he's manly enough
for the New York Senate job by painting Hillary as not womanly
enough _ i.e., a cold, bitter, biting harpy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, female candidates have to prove they're tough enough.
Hillary Clinton is in the odd position of having to prove she's
tender enough.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone failed to get the Medusa message, the New York
GOP chairman, William Powers, has sent out a new fund-raising
letter that reads, ``I have high hopes that you'll help us ... stop
this ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman
from fooling voters.'' He ends: ``Hillary Clinton is an angry
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has American politics been so fraught with gender
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   The national race may be decided by a kiss. Al Gore's convention
smooch won the hearts of all those female voters who had been
playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday W., who was nicknamed ``Lip'' in high school but only
for his smart mouth, played hardball on lip lock. Wooing the
women's vote on ``Oprah,'' he came out and gave the surprised talk
show host a buss on the cheek _ one-upping Al Gore, who merely gave
Oprah a half-hug last week, prompting her flirtatious request, ``No
kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   W. also replied ``Kiss to my wife,'' when asked to name the best
gift he had ever given.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential race may turn on a lingering kiss, the
Senate race may turn on a wagging finger.
</P>
<P>
   The debate last week left Hillary and Ricky both trying to
portray themselves as victims of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who had liked the glowing Long Island
congressman recoiled from his glowering performance in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a women's lunch on Monday, Clinton mocked Lazio's
alpha bits: ``I knew I was going to have to share a stage. I didn't
think I was going to share a podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent Tuesday defending himself for acting like a bully at
the pulpit. ``The idea that somehow that there's a double standard
because you're a man or a woman, and you can't make a point
forcefully if you're a man, and the person you're making the point
with is a woman, I just think that's sexist,'' he said, adding, ``I
don't think people in the Senate worry about whether you're a man
or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, of course, it is conservatives who make the case
that men and women have to be viewed differently, and liberals who
make the case that men and women should be treated the same.
</P>
<P>
   Most pathetically, the Lazio campaign sent reporters an old
picture of Hillary, from her days as Arkansas first lady, wagging a
finger at a political opponent to show that she, too, could be a
space invader.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio Just Doesn't Get It. His race is charged with gender, but
his problem at the debate was more a matter of sense and manners.
</P>
<P>
   Once Tim Russert had made Clinton uncomfortable by showing an
old tape of her defending her feckless husband, the smart thing for
Lazio to do was be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A man who felt confident of his own masculinity, of course,
would never have marched over to bluster at the first lady. It's
impossible to imagine Ronald Reagan trying to cow a female opponent
with such muscular histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should stop worrying about Hillary as the angry
women, and start worrying about Ricky as the angry man.

   The national race may be decided by a kiss. Al Gore's convention
smooch won the hearts of all those female voters who had been
playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday W., who was nicknamed ``Lip'' in high school but only
for his smart mouth, played hardball on lip lock. Wooing the
women's vote on ``Oprah,'' he came out and gave the surprised talk
show host a buss on the cheek _ one-upping Al Gore, who merely gave
Oprah a half-hug last week, prompting her flirtatious request, ``No
kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   W. also replied ``Kiss to my wife,'' when asked to name the best
gift he had ever given.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential race may turn on a lingering kiss, the
Senate race may turn on a wagging finger.
</P>
<P>
   The debate last week left Hillary and Ricky both trying to
portray themselves as victims of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who had liked the glowing Long Island
congressman recoiled from his glowering performance in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a women's lunch on Monday, Clinton mocked Lazio's
alpha bits: ``I knew I was going to have to share a stage. I didn't
think I was going to share a podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent Tuesday defending himself for acting like a bully at
the pulpit. ``The idea that somehow that there's a double standard
because you're a man or a woman, and you can't make a point
forcefully if you're a man, and the person you're making the point
with is a woman, I just think that's sexist,'' he said, adding, ``I
don't think people in the Senate worry about whether you're a man
or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, of course, it is conservatives who make the case
that men and women have to be viewed differently, and liberals who
make the case that men and women should be treated the same.
</P>
<P>
   Most pathetically, the Lazio campaign sent reporters an old
picture of Hillary, from her days as Arkansas first lady, wagging a
finger at a political opponent to show that she, too, could be a
space invader.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio Just Doesn't Get It. His race is charged with gender, but
his problem at the debate was more a matter of sense and manners.
</P>
<P>
   Once Tim Russert had made Clinton uncomfortable by showing an
old tape of her defending her feckless husband, the smart thing for
Lazio to do was be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A man who felt confident of his own masculinity, of course,
would never have marched over to bluster at the first lady. It's
impossible to imagine Ronald Reagan trying to cow a female opponent
with such muscular histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should stop worrying about Hillary as the angry
women, and start worrying about Ricky as the angry man.

COMMENTARY: GENDER GYRATIONS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (Subs 16th graf starting: Speaking at a women's, etc., to fix
quote) 
By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ad is anything but subtle or subliminable.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's hand, representing Hillary Clinton's, reaches out with
an electric prod, digs into the most sensitive part of the male
anatomy, and _ bzzzzz!!
</P>
<P>
   The New York Conservative Party attack ad, which has been
running since Sunday, including twice during ``Meet the Press,''
depicts Hillary as a castrating rhymes-with-rich.
</P>
<P>
   The text is about how she got her hands on her (henpecked)
husband's health care plan and messed it up. The visual is an old
children's game, ``Operation,'' which has a flat figure of an
alarmed-looking naked male patient, with an electric
tweezer/scalpel attached to let you play doctor and extract bones
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Except, in this case, Hillary is ominously portrayed doing the
``operating'' with a pulsating instrument of torture. (Bzzzz!!)
</P>
<P>
   Little Ricky is desperately trying to prove he's manly enough
for the New York Senate job by painting Hillary as not womanly
enough _ i.e., a cold, bitter, biting harpy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, female candidates have to prove they're tough enough.
Hillary Clinton is in the odd position of having to prove she's
tender enough.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone failed to get the Medusa message, the New York
GOP chairman, William Powers, has sent out a new fund-raising
letter that reads, ``I have high hopes that you'll help us ... stop
this ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman
from fooling voters.'' He ends: ``Hillary Clinton is an angry
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has American politics been so fraught with gender
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   The national race may be decided by a kiss. Al Gore's convention
smooch won the hearts of all those female voters who had been
playing hard to get.

GALAXY TO FACE AN ANGRY MUTINY
</HEADLINE>

By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Galaxy expects to see anger
and desperation in the Tampa Bay Mutiny when the teams'
first-round, best-of-three MLS playoff series resumes tonight at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At least those were two of the words used by Mutiny coach Tim
Hankinson after the Galaxy's 1-0 victory last week in Florida,
giving L.A. a 1-0 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anger is the right reaction for us,'' said Hankinson. ``We
can't feel sorry for each other or look for a pat on the back.
Those wrong reactions. That's looking for sympathy. I don't want
any sympathy. What I want is an angry reaction to a job that didn't
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid is fully aware that his team is facing
a wounded animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a team that's a little feistier and maybe
a little nastier on their tackles,'' said Schmid. ``They may come
out in the first 20 minutes and really put a stamp on the game. We
have to make sure we match that effort, the same one we gave in
Tampa.''

COLEMAN HAS SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA defensive end Kenyon Coleman is expected to
be out four to six weeks after undergoing surgery to remove torn
cartilage from his left knee Tuesday at UCLA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was released from the hospital, also had two screws
from a previous surgery removed from his tibia. The screws remained
from surgery he had when he was 15 years old, said Dr. Gerald
Finerman, the team physician who performed the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Finerman said that the recovery from such a surgery varies, but
he hinted that it might take longer than four weeks because of
Coleman's size and the position he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 280 pounds,'' Finerman said. ``He's going to lock up with
someone who's 300 pounds. Imagine what kind of biomechanical forces
go into play. He'll make the decision when he wants to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the best-case scenario, Coleman would return Oct. 21
against Oregon State and miss just three games because UCLA has a
bye week in early October. However, since Coleman has played in no
more than three games, he could use the redshirt year he has
available.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said it was too early to speculate whether
Coleman, who was projected as a possible first-round NFL draft
pick, will return this season. If the Bruins continue to win,
Coleman could face a decision whether to contribute to a
national-title contender at the expense of his NFL stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season,'' Toledo said. ``We're not counting on him
right now. I think it's important to see how he recovers. I had a
chat with his dad. There's no reason to make any decisions right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Against the odds: UCLA impressed the pollsters with victories
over Alabama and Michigan, but the Bruins aren't getting any love
from Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   They opened as 1-point underdogs against Oregon and the line
moved Tuesday to 2.
</P>
<P>
   Said linebacker Robert Thomas: ``I guess it doesn't take a
genius to (set the odds). They beat Nevada and Idaho, and we've
beaten Michigan and Alabama. I think people will figure it out. It
surprises me, but it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And Howry: Oregon receiver Keenan Howry, a 5-foot-10,
165-pound sophomore from Los Alamitos High, was impressive at
UCLA's summer camp in 1998. But with only two scholarships slotted
for receivers, the Bruins took Jerry Owens and Ryan Smith, both of
whom are 6-3 and close to 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   They redshirted last year and have combined for one catch this
season. Howry, meanwhile, caught 29 passes and five touchdowns as a
true freshman and hasn't let down this season with 13 catches, two
touchdowns and a 17.3-yard average in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we missed,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Losman shines: Former UCLA quarterback J.P. Losman, filling
in for injured Patrick Ramsey, had an impressive debut Saturday for
Tulane in the Green Wave's 37-17 loss to East Carolina. Losman, a
redshirt freshman, was 20 for 35 with 299 yards, two touchdown
passes and no interceptions. He also rushed 19 times for 100 yards,
though he lost 60 yards and one fumble on six sacks. Tulane, a
21-point underdog, led 17-14 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Said East Carolina coach Steve Logan: ``I think they may have
found their quarterback for the next four years.''

 NET WORTH: FALLING EURO, RISING OIL PRICES A BAD COMBINATION  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Falling leaves. Falling rain. Falling
temperatures. And falling stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. On average, September and October are the worst
months for stocks, according to Ned Davis Research.
</P>
<P>
   And this fall, investors have plenty to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the euro, which has fallen 10.5 percent against
the dollar since the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   When the euro slides, American companies show losses when they
translate their European profits into dollars. Many U.S. firms,
even those that have been hedging _ or trying to protect themselves
against a drop in the euro _ have warned that they'll post
third-quarter currency losses. More companies are expected to
follow suit when ``earnings confession'' season begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are rising oil prices, which hurt corporate profits
three ways. They immediately increase costs. They reduce revenues
if consumers, who make up two-thirds of the economy, cut back on
other spending.
</P>
<P>
   And, if higher oil prices spark widespread inflation, the Fed
may raise interest rates, which reduces profits even more.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices hit Europe especially hard, and if European
economies falter, the euro could continue to tank, worsening
currency losses for U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices are up 43 percent this year and are hovering
near a 10-year peak. Gasoline prices hit a record high in the Bay
Area this month and now top $2 per gallon in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas and heating oil futures have more than doubled this
year, and if there's a cold winter in the Northeast, energy prices
could surge.
</P>
<P>
   Euro and energy fears have already taken a toll on the market,
and September is living up to its reputation as a lousy month.
</P>
<P>
   After surging in August, the Nasdaq composite index is down 8
percent this month, and the S&AMP;P 500 is down 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think things could get even worse during the next
few weeks, when companies preannounce and then finally report
earnings for the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus (earnings) estimates for the S&AMP;P 500 are too
high,'' says John Skeen, director of portfolio strategy with Banc
of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   He says the consensus calls for a 16 percent year-over-year gain
in third-quarter earnings, followed by a 14 percent gain in the
fourth quarter and a 9 to 10 percent gain for the first quarter of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's quite likely that earnings will be more like like
14 percent for the third quarter, 7 or 8 percent for the fourth and
zero for the first,'' Skeen says.
</P>
<P>
   He says the market is predicting a ``perfect, pillow-soft
landing'' that is unlikely to pan out given the slumping euro,
rising oil prices, an increase in unemployment claims and a
slowdown in ``buying intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter worries actually started surfacing in mid-July,
when some big-name companies reported mostly robust second-quarter
earnings but warned that third-quarter estimates were too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard from Microsoft, Sprint, Lucent, Ericsson, Nokia,
Wal-Mart. Investors had never heard anything negative from these
companies before,'' says Anthony Crook, a research analyst with
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the fray were a slew of consumer-cyclical and retail
companies such as Procter &AMP; Gamble, Gap, Lands End, Saks,
Whirlpool, Target, J.C. Penny, Circuit City, Hertz, Target and
Whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Gillette, Alcoa, McDonald's, Eaton, Dana,
Ingersoll Rand, Sherwin Williams and Maytag have all warned analyst
to lower their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Because these companies are so large, their announcements got a
lot of publicity. But earnings trackers say that on the whole, the
numbers don't look so bad.
</P>
<P>
   According to IBES, so far only 66.8 percent of third-quarter
earnings preannouncements have been negative. That's below the
average for the past four years, when 81.4 percent of
preannouncements were on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, research director with First Call, predicts
third-quarter earnings will be up ``a damn good'' 19 percent over
last year. But he also thinks ``you're going to see bigger problems
in the fourth quarter,'' when oil problems come home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, capital spending remains strong, as
companies continue to scarf up any equipment that will increase
productivity. This is good for the tech sector, and Hill sees no
immediate slowdown in tech earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thinks third-quarter tech earnings will be up 36
percent this year, even better than last year's 31 percent increase
over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``if the U.S. economic slowdown gets deep enough, it'll
spill over into the techs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the BofA Securities conference, which is taking place at the
Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco this week, ``everyone is worried
about capital spending,'' says Skeen. ``What if it slows next year?
That's the big question that's being bandied about in the
hallways.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to capital spending is a recession, which
could be triggered if oil prices spill over into the rest of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management,
doesn't see that happening, at least not right away.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, he says oil prices still aren't as high
as they were during previous spikes in 1974 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Saudi crude is $31.33 per barrel. Adjusted for
inflation, it would take a price of $43 per barrel to equal the
price in January 1974 and $69.75 equal the price in October 1981,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil in the past has triggered a recession,'' Schlossberg says.
``As oil prices rise, the Fed tightens monetary policy'' to rein in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, the rise in oil prices has been fairly well
contained. We're not getting the same kind of spillover we've had
in the past. So there's less risk of a run-up in inflation and
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that scenario, Schlossberg sees stock prices rising, but
not by much. ``Historically, the S&AMP;P has returned to 10 to 11
percent a year,'' he says. Over the next 12 months, ``chances are
we'll see them in the mid-single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeen predicts that, ``in 12 months, stocks will be
approximately 10 percent higher'' than they are today, ``but they
could have problems in the next couple weeks as these earnings
estimates get ratcheted down.''

WHY KNOCK OCTOBER? SEPTEMBER IS THE REAL TROUBLEMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Does the recent stock-price swoon mean the market is
trying to get an early start on October?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong question. October may have the reputation as the stock
market's most perilous month for investors, but in the past
half-century it's really been September that has visited the worst
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, according to Yale Hirsch's Stock Trader's Almanac,
September ranks last when measured by the performance of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. It is the only month, in fact, with a
losing monthly record. Its average monthly loss has been 0.2
percent, while August, the second-worst performer, has been a
break-even month. Overall, September's cumulative loss was 10.5
percent, according to the almanac's calculations.
</P>
<P>
   If you've heard of October 1929, or still have vivid memories of
the '87 and '97 October crashes, news that September is the
cruelest month may come as a surprise. October, however, hasn't
been all that bad a month, relatively speaking. It's the
seventh-best month, with an average monthly S&AMP;P 500 gain of 0.5
percent. (December, incidentally, is the best month, followed by
January and November.)
</P>
<P>
   As for September, it's currently in character, despite a
promising start and Tuesday's strong bounce by the Nasdaq. The
Nasdaq stood at 4,234 on Sept. 1 and appeared on its way to a
sustained gain. But it reversed course dramatically. The Dow Jones
industrial average and S&AMP;P 500 have been floundering as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's wrong with the stock market? Other than the fact that
it's September, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In short, lots of things.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official inflation numbers still look reasonably
good, many are concerned about how rising energy prices will affect
the price level later this year and early next. This concern, along
with a recent surge in corporate borrowing, is serving to boost
interest rates, and rising rates are always a problem for stocks.
The 30-year bellwether Treasury bond is heading back toward a 6
percent yield, and analysts are worried that higher mortgage rates
will be the next big problem for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Profits, meanwhile, are not only under pressure, but the current
earnings news emphasis also is on the negative. The third quarter
ends in less than a fortnight, and companies not expecting to
deliver on previous earnings promises are busy announcing their bad
news so as not to surprise Wall Street and be unduly punished next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason for cheer? Not particularly from a
fundamental standpoint, but Hirsch's almanac offers some reason for
optimism in a cyclical context. From a historical standpoint, Oct.
31 marks the end of the worst six months of the year for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, the rewards of investing from May to October
compared with November to April show humongous differentials. A
November-April investment in the S&AMP;P 500, according to the almanac,
would have outperformed a May-October investment by nearly 3,000
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hirsch's research ends with 1998, recent experience
seems to validate this historical perspective, as the heady gains
of late last year and early 2000 have given way to the disastrous
