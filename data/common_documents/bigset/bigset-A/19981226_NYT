   SAYREVILLE, N.J. _ The driver of the bus that crashed here
Thursday morning on its way to Atlantic City said he was trying to
avoid what looked like a patch of ice when he lost control of the
vehicle and it plunged down an embankment, killing eight people and
injuring 15, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of the wreckage of the bus at a garage near
the crash site, officials from the National Transportation Safety
Board and the New Jersey State Police said they would begin a full
investigation on Monday of what they called one of the worst
highway accidents in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will completely reconstruct this incident,'' said George W.
Black Jr., a member of the safety board. The inquiry could take six
months or more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Daniel Cosgrove of the state police said investigators had
interviewed the bus driver, Valentin Viner, 52, for several hours
on Thursday. He said Viner, a Russian immigrant who spoke to them
through an interpreter, said he had been changing lanes to get
around a ``shiny'' spot on the road ahead. They said he touched his
brakes to move behind another car, and the bus suddenly spun around
and off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrove and Black would not say how fast Viner told the
authorities he was traveling when the bus, which was carrying 22
passengers from Brooklyn, slid off the road at mile marker 123.8,
rolling at least once and throwing some people through the windows.
Another bus driver, who was following about a quarter-mile behind,
Lamar Jenkins, said that Viner's bus was moving faster than the
speed limit of 65 miles per hour. The authorities said only that
Viner's account of the crash was consistent with witnesses'
reports.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger who survived the crash, Murray Hollander,
interviewed by telephone from his hospital bed, described Viner as
a habitual tailgater who used a radar detector to avoid speed traps
and who had narrowly escaped a crash two months ago in Staten
Island, when his bus spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander, 72, who remained in critical condition Friday at
Memorial Medical Center in South Amboy, said he visited Atlantic
City three or four times a week and frequently rode on Viner's bus.
He and other passengers liked Viner because he drove fast,
Hollander said, shortening the trip of two-and-a-half to three
hours. ``People on the bus always say, `Let's get there in a
hurry,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said he was riding on Viner's bus two months ago when
it spun out of control on a highway in Staten Island, approaching
the Verrazano Bridge on its way back from Atlantic City. The bus
did not hit anything and was able to resume the trip, Hollander
said.
</P>
<P>
   Viner, who was treated at Memorial Medical Center for several
broken bones and released on Thursday, could not be reached for
comment Friday. Cosgrove said that investigators would examine
Viner's driving history, including reports of any such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles,
Viner's license has been suspended twice, most recently in March
after convictions for speeding and failing to stop for a school
bus. His license was reinstated in June after he took a retraining
course.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Black said the agency had taken an interest in the crash both
because of the number of injuries and because it is studying
intercity and school bus crashes nationwide. The study is focusing
on the ``crashworthiness'' of buses and on such ``human factors''
as drivers' sleep patterns and work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find out where the passengers were seated, we'll try
to match their injuries to the bus, and find out what caused them
to be injured or ejected,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   One complication in that effort is that there were no seat belts
for passengers, so they could have been walking around inside the
bus when the accident happened, Black said. Federal guidelines do
not require passenger seat belts in buses, he said _ another
subject that the safety board is examining.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that the owner of Viner's bus, Bruins Transportation,
of 300 Liberty Ave. Brooklyn, had last been examined by the Federal
Office of Motor Carrier Safety on June 21, 1996, and classified as
well above average. ``There was no suggestion of any endemic
difficulties with the carrier,'' he said.

<P>
   SAYREVILLE, N.J. _ The three firefighters were crawling on their
hands and knees, using shovels and a rake to clear away three feet
of debris that would soon yield the scorched bodies of a mother and
her 12-year-old son. Then one of them said it: ``Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Thursday morning at about 8:30 a.m., eight hours before
the sun would set on Christmas Eve, and the three men _ all
volunteers from this borough of 38,000 _ were in the neighboring
town of Perth Amboy, crouched in the remains of a third-floor
apartment that had been gutted by a predawn fire, a fire that
several building residents had survived only by jumping to safety.
</P>
<P>
   As he was helping gather up his company's hoses, Jim Aleski, 23,
who had never before seen a body burned in a fire, figured his day
had gotten about as bad as it was going to get. But then the fire
truck radio crackled with word of an overturned bus on the Garden
State Parkway here in Sayreville, about seven miles south, and soon
Aleski and four other members of his company were speeding to the
scene, so quickly that they left their hoses behind.
</P>
<P>
   They would spend the next six hours on that frozen roadside,
assisting in the removal of eight more bodies and in the treatment
of more than a dozen others, all still alive but many critically
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Aleski recalled Friday, on Christmas morning, ``just
a typical day in the life of a volunteer firefighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Aleski knew that wasn't really true. For no official here
in central New Jersey could ever recall two such disasters
occurring only hours apart and within such close proximity. And
perhaps the only common denominator threading the two together were
the five members of Melrose Hose Company No. 1 out of Sayreville
who responded to both.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of times, serving as a volunteer firefighter is
no job for the faint-hearted. In Sayreville, each prospective
volunteer must devote 120 hours to training over a two-year period,
and then spend the equivalent of more than a week each year
thereafter on refresher courses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the alarms, which seem to come invariably in the
middle of the night and are heralded by the ear-shattering blare of
an air-raid siren. For the three dozen volunteers in Aleski's
company _ one of four serving this borough of 16 square miles, all
of which dispatched trucks to the bus accident _ that siren has
gone off nearly 400 times this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   And every time it does blow, it's invariably on a holiday or
someone's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only our birthdays, because that you can live with,'' said
Tony Jacowski, 40, a 17-year veteran of the department, who was
driving a second truck from Company No. 1 to Perth Amboy Thursday
when he was rerouted to the bus accident. ``It's our kids'
birthdays. And our wives'.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at least, Company No. 1 got to salvage part of the
day: the five men who responded to Perth Amboy _ and the 11 others
who joined them later that day on the Garden State _ were home by
early evening. But though they were present in body, many conceded
that they were miles away in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in church at 5:30 on Christmas Eve, breathing a sigh
of relief that he had made it in time to hear his 7-year-old
daughter sing in the choir, Antonio D'Arpa realized that his
fingers still smelled of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought me back to that apartment, and that family,'' said
D'Arpa, 37, who works full time as a packer in an industrial supply
company.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke to a visitor in a police department conference room
Friday morning, D'Arpa doodled, apparently mindlessly, on a pad of
white legal paper. Asked a moment later to describe how he and
Aleski had helped unearth the bodies burned in the fire, D'Arpa
suddenly spun the pad around to reveal the clearly drawn forms of a
mother huddled close to her son, with the son's foot sticking up.
``It was kind of like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For those three firefighters, and a fourth, Sean Farrell, a
24-year-old Rutgers student, the day had actually begun just after
midnight on Wednesday, when they were summoned by their captain,
Dan Martin, to sleep at the firehouse. With snow beginning to fall,
the captain's action was a precautionary one, so that if a call
came in, they would not have to contend with slick roads to get to
their truck.
</P>
<P>
   He and his men had been sleeping only a few hours when the call
came in at about 6 a.m., summoning them to Perth Amboy to assist
companies from other nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they were not the only emergency volunteers
getting such an early start. George Gawron, 35, a sanitation worker
here, and John Scanlon, 34, who works for the Middlesex County
Roads Department, spent Wednesday night and Thursday morning
plowing the three inches or so of snow that fell overnight.
</P>
<P>
   And they were still plowing at about 10:40 a.m. Thursday when
Gawron, the president of Company 1, and Scanlon, a volunteer
emergency medical technician, were alerted by their pagers of the
bus accident. By the time Scanlon, an expert in extrication who had
helped pry open the bus and cut away some seats, and Gawron, who
removed the last two bodies, got to sleep Christmas Eve, they had
been awake nearly 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Jacowski, the driver of one of the company trucks, the image
that he focused on as he finally tried to go to sleep that night
was of a man who refused attention for his broken right arm as he
paced outside the bus. At his feet was his wife's covered body.
``He kept saying, `Take care of mama,' '' Jacowski said, though the
man knew his wife was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the midst of such horror, there was the occasional ray of
light. Martin and Jacowski said that when they threaded through the
victims and reached the bus, which was rolled on its side, they
were stunned to discover a woman inside with no protective gear,
calmly counseling and tending to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   She told them that she had been a driver who had been passing
by, a tourist from California with some emergency training who had
been among the first on the scene and had somehow navigated the
shards of broken glass and metal.
</P>
<P>
   After perhaps four hours inside, the woman slipped through the
back of the bus after it had been cut open. As she did, Martin and
Jacowski went around to meet her. But she was nowhere to be found.
They never even learned her name. ``If she reads this,'' Jacowski
said, ``we'd like to thank her.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a day for the firefighters to pay tribute to, and
make amends to, their families as well. D'Arpa, whose daughter sang
so beautifully in the choir, gave her a Furby Friday morning; he
gave his son, age 2, a Hot Wheels fire truck.
</P>
<P>
   The boy played with it, uninterrupted, for the better part of an
hour, his father said, beaming.

KENTUCKY PASSER LOOKS TO THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Ohio)  (js) 
 By SAMANTHA STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Tim Couch came in fourth in the Heisman Trophy
balloting. But that was then, and this is now. And right now, the
University of Kentucky quarterback is trying to position himself as
the No. 1 selection in the 1999 National Football League draft, the
player whom the restored Cleveland Browns _ who pick first _ will
build themselves around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't be the No. 1 pick,'' said Couch, a 21-year-old
junior preparing to take on Penn State in the Outback Bowl on Jan.
1, ``then I won't come out. I'll stay in school. I'd like to play
in Cleveland. It's close to home, and my friends and family can see
me play. Cleveland can't guarantee me anything before the draft,
but they have told me I'm a top candidate. It's a lot like picking
colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, deciding what to do about the draft is the second big
decision Couch has had to make in recent years. His first came when
he chose to stay home and play college football when he could have
gone just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound Couch, a classic
drop-back passer, came out of Leslie County High School in Hyden,
Ky., he had broken every state high school football record ever
recorded. He was the Gatorade high school player of the year, and
became everybody's all-American. Heavily recruited, especially by
Tennessee, Couch, a self-described ``mountain boy,'' ended up
choosing Kentucky. The home fans have never forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people around here who say he's bigger than Elvis,''
said Couch's father, Elbert, who will retire this year after 27
years as the director of transportation for the Leslie County Board
of Education in Hyden, a mountain town on the Cumberland Plateau
with a population of 450.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine rides around with me in my pickup truck,''
Elbert Couch said, ``and we look at each other and say, `Can you
believe this happened to a boy from Hyden?' The No. 1 draft pick,
that's all we want for Tim. It would be nice, real nice. I've never
had $1 million. That's a lot of money for Tim. We'll make a
decision as a family on Jan. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch must decide to declare or stay in school on Jan. 8.
Initially, he directed Kentucky to request special dispensation to
prolong his decision. Because of National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules, the request was turned down. Unlike in college
basketball, once Couch decides to come out, he can't return to
college football.
</P>
<P>
   If Couch chooses to come out, he has the blessing of Kentucky's
head coach, Hal Mumme. ``Coach Mumme has told me without question,
I am ready physically and mentally,'' Couch said. ``He told me it's
where my heart is, what will make me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme was hired after Couch's freshman year at Kentucky, about
the time Couch threatened to transfer to Tennessee after a dismal
season under Bill Curry. Since then, Mumme has enjoyed success with
his star quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything,'' Mumme said, ``Tim has a great passion
for the game. Tim just loves football. If there were not such a
thing as college football, he'd be the guy calling everybody after
class to go play on the intramural field. He was even happy to hear
that we'll be practicing on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfishly, I'd like Tim to stay for the people of Kentucky and
for the benefit of the team next year. It would be a lot easier to
coach him than a new quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this past season, Couch had broken seven
Southeastern Conference records, including total offensive yards
(4,151), pass completions (400), completion percentage (72.3) and
passing yards (4,275) while leading Kentucky to a 7-4 record and
its first bowl appearance since 1993. For his college career, Couch
has had 1,184 pass attempts, 795 completions, 8,435 passing yards,
74 touchdown passes, and a 67.1 completion percentage. He holds
four NCAA records, 14 SEC records and 26 school records.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Couch turns professional, his brother, Greg, 25, plans
to manage his NFL career. Greg Couch was a backup quarterback for
Edmonton in the Canadian Football League for part of this season,
before returning to Eastern Kentucky University to graduate last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch out for things during the transition from college
to the NFL,'' Greg Couch said. ``It's a tremendous jump, and he
needs to focus on things as a player. We're biased, but so are a
lot of other people. Tim is a No. 1 pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Couch really ready for the NFL? ``Yes,'' the quarterback
said. ``I've always had high goals regarding playing at the next
level. If it's there, I will work hard. The biggest difference will
be learning new offenses. I like Denver's offense, and Green Bay's
and Minnesota's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that's happened for me this year is reading
defenses. You gain that with age. I think I see so many more
coverages now, the blitzes, how the coverages change, the
protection at the line of scrimmage. It's all a mental part of the
game, and I think I've really grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rival agents agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this year or next year,'' said Leigh Steinberg, agent
to 27 NFL quarterbacks, ``Tim Couch will be the first pick in the
NFL draft. He projects as a franchise quarterback. He's someone a
team can be built around. A team can win because of him rather than
with him. The market for NFL stars is expanding exponentially right
now. Steve Young is the highest paid at a package of over $7.5
million a year. Later this year, we may have a $10 million
quarterback and at the end of the TV contract, a $15 million
quarterback. This market is ready to break loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Policy, the president of the Cleveland Browns, said in an
interview last Tuesday that he was unable to directly comment on
Couch because Couch was still an underclassman. But a source close
to Policy said that he was trying to hire an offensive-minded head
coach who would be able to handle a young quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a deep and abiding interest in the selection of a head
coach and quarterback who will serve as building blocks for this
organization going into the next decade,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one in the Couch family is admitting that he is
making himself available for the next NFL draft, there are already
hints that the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a humble, good-looking boy,'' said Janice Couch, Tim's
mother. ``I think he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's ready,'' said Elbert Couch, who put a football in
his son's crib when he was born. ``He's going to lose most of his
offensive line to graduation. He has a strong head for a
21-year-old. I don't think he's done anybody wrong. Cleveland can
build their first-round pick around a quarterback or Ricky
Williams. If I went out, I would want to be the No.player, but we
know there are no guarantees.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Couch learned that particular lesson quite painfully last month
when his childhood friend, 21-year-old Scott Brock, and a Kentucky
defensive tackle, Artie Steinmetz, were killed and Kentucky's
starting center, Jason Watts, was injured in a car crash. The
pickup truck driven by Watts flipped over as the three were on
their way to a deer-hunting trip _ an outing that Couch had turned
down. Watts has since been charged with manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was especially crushing for Couch. Brock had caught
Couch's passes from nursery school through high school and it was
Brock, Couch says, and all of his boyhood friends in Hyden, who
``defined me as who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a mountain boy,'' Couch said. ``Just like me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against Penn State in the Outback Bowl, Couch and his teammates
will wear a patch on their uniforms in honor of three friends who
should have been there. The game will be played in Tampa, Fla., and
already Kentucky fans have scooped up 27,000 tickets, perhaps
figuring this will be the last time they will see Couch play for
the school.
</P>
<P>
   They could be right. And they could be in for a memorable
goodbye. &QL;

BASEBALL FREE-AGENT SIGNINGS CREATE WIDE CHASMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a frenzied six weeks after the World Series, the gully
separating professional baseball's haves from the have-nots became
a canyon, prompting some owners and general managers to voice
concern about the future of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have spent more than $1 billion on free agents this
offseason. And just six _ the Dodgers, Angels, Mets, Yankees,
Orioles and Diamondbacks _ have shelled out $718 million of that
total.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the capper came Dec.12, when the Dodgers signed
pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105-million, seven-year contract, making
him baseball's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   There were others:
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn was signed by the Angels to an
$80-million, six-year deal. The Yankees re-signed Bernie Williams
and gave him $87.5 million for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Randy Johnson got a four-year, $52.4 million deal with
the Arizona Diamondbacks; Albert Belle signed a $65-million,
five-year deal with Baltimore; former Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza
picked up $91 million to hang with the Mets through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   At least one baseball executive, Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone, defended his signing as a required response to an alarming
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of quality players,'' said Malone, ``so you
have to overpay for quality. There's a premium on quality. When
there's a lack of talent, it drives the price up on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: The average professional baseball player earned
$1.4 million in 1998. And how about this? The average American
earned $38,000 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Brown signing is great for the Dodgers. After a dismal
1998, the team is now a serious contender for the National League
pennant in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As Malone put it during a recent Dodgers press conference,
``Kevin Brown is one of those special, unique players that can
elevate a team and make them that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to experts such as former Dodgers vice president
and general manager Fred Claire, there's a considerable downside
when teams begin paying astronomical amounts to some players and
peanuts to others. In fact, Brown, with his guaranteed $105
million, will make more than the cumulative payrolls of Cincinnati,
Florida, Minnesota, Montreal, Oakland and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The escalation has been so great over a relatively short
period of time that the biggest concern for baseball should be the
disparity of payrolls,'' Claire said. ``These are the things that
are not good for the game. The leaders better be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem lies in the very key element of competitive
balance. Baseball is so far off course that it's not even pretty to
look at the tremendous disparity in team payrolls. The result is a
tremendous amount of disparity in the abilities of teams to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   In Malone's eyes, nothing is quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about money,'' he said. ``Money might be a part
of the problem, but a lot of the problem with some of these teams
is they haven't put the right personnel together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying it's the money that creates the disparity _ that's an
easy out. A lot of people can claim that. I had the lowest payroll
(as general manager) in Montreal in 1994 and I had the best team in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's not the answer to all the questions or solution to all
the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, higher salaries mean more costly tickets. In fact, both
the Dodgers and Angels have raised ticket prices for the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, who will next month begin teaching a class at USC on
sports business and the media, said he is also worried about how
fans will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more important than the fan base,'' Claire
said. ``The last thing you want to do is have the fan in a position
where he cannot afford the game and he's turned off by the salaries
of the star players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of balance right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, Malone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system we work with has no structure or guidelines,'' he
said. ``A general manager is asked to make the best team possible
and do it in a way that doesn't have a bad effect on the industry.
You try to do what's in the best interest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, my primary responsibility is to make the Dodgers
the best team possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball as much as anybody in the game; I care about
it as much or more than anybody. If we don't sign Kevin Brown, does
that rectify the problems in the industry? No. I'm here to win.
Fortunately we have the resources to make the financial commitments
to do that.''

   DICKENS-CAROL (Undated) _ Charles Dickens dashed off ``A
Christmas Carol'' in six weeks in the fall of 1843. He needed money

COMMENTARY: TALK LANG SYNE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to New Year's Eve, I am firmly in the
camp of pink champagne and black cha-cha heels.
</P>
<P>
   I can't fathom the phenomenon of trekking off to resorts to
attend a lot of earnest panels and hang out with all the same
people we are sick of seeing on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In their only point of bipartisan agreement, Democrats and
Republicans have conspired to ruin New Year's Eve by turning it
into a tiresome gabfest. Clintonites have their annual Renaissance
Weekend at Hilton Head, S.C., and conservatives aped them with
their own version, held this year at the Arizona Biltmore. (By the
time they get to Phoenix, I'll be here.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard call which New Year's Eve festivity is more
irresistible _ getting wasted with Strobe Talbott and Norm Ornstein
jawing about ``Y2K Internet Hazards and Other Geek Tragedies'' or
boogying down with C. Boyden Gray and Grover Norquist to debate
``Can the Republican Party Be Fixed?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will again toast the New Year at their elitist,
wonkish schmooze, immortalized as ``the saturnalia of
soul-searching by the sea,'' by The New York Times' Todd Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the Clinton era, the First Couple arrived in
South Carolina to talk about personal and national renewal, bearing
overflowing boxes of work papers monogrammed ``BC'' and ``HRC.''
</P>
<P>
   It always seemed a bit self-consciously high-minded and
exhibitionistically introspective _ sharing vulnerabilities and
building an inner life with 1,500 other people. I recall one panel
during the health-care debate called ``The Mind of Ira Magaziner,''
moderated by Mrs. Ira Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   But in this year of infidelity and impeachment, the whole
enterprise seems even more like parody. Will the president dare to
let loose at the panels entitled ``Something That's Been Bugging Me
Lately'' or ``Whoops! Mistakes: Their Lessons and Consequences'' or
``Character _ What Is It? Does It Count? Has Its Meaning Changed?
How Do We Teach It?''
</P>
<P>
   Will Hillary take a connubial hint from the panel ``Dropping
Life's Baggage Can Lighten the Load''?
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives at first dubbed their imitation Renaissance
Weekend ``The Dark Ages,'' when they were flying high in 1994. It
was a sly dig at the Clintonites' pretension to world historical
progressivism. But now Republicans call it ``The Weekend, the event
formerly known as Dark Ages,'' to disguise the uncomfortable fact
that Republicans have, in fact, brought about the Dark Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Toning down the GOP image as an army of wing-tipped Huns, the
Event Formerly Known as Dark Ages has a panel called ``America's
Ethnic Future, and How We Need to Address It.'' They'll need to
address it very gingerly, given that Trent Lott and Bob Barr have
both been exposed for speaking to a white supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party has updated panels in light of the astonishing
events of this past year. So, it falls to others to do their work
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons could use that assembled brain-power to ramp up to
the Senate impeachment trial. Useful preparatory panels might
include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty and Slutty: What the Sliming of Anita Hill Can Teach
About the Sliming of Monica Lewinsky.'' Panelists: Greg Craig,
David Talbot, Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ontology in the Oval Office: The Many Splendored Meanings of
`Is.''' Panelists: Bill Clinton, David Kendall and Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``R-E-S-P-E-C-T: How Many Times, O Lord, Do I Have to Save His
...?'' A conversation with Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Cheated on Him Because He Cheated on Me: Loyalty in the
Clinton Years.'' Panelists: George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry and
Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should use their discussion time to ponder
whether they really want to wreck the country and their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Larry Flynted: Why the Heck Is What's Good for the
Goose Good for the Gander?'' Panelists: Bob Livingston, Henry Hyde
and Dan Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impossible Dream: Digging Up Dirt on Al Gore and Bill
Bradley.'' A conversation with Lucianne Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blondes Leading the Blind: Leggy Punditry in the 21st
Century.'' Panelists: Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, Kellyanne
Fitzpatrick and Barbara Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mind of Ken Starr,'' moderated by Mrs. Ken Starr. (No
children under 17 permitted.)

COMMENTARY: THE JETS ARE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bananas were 11 cents a pound. A set of 15 Christmas tree lights
was 69 cents. The New York Times was a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas comes every 29 or 30 years for New York Jets fans.
This is one of the rare good years, a phenomenon that for the
faithful is as sweet and as difficult to grasp as a winning lottery
ticket. To get a sense of what it's usually like to be a Jets fan,
imagine a gambler in a lifelong craps game who is destined always
to roll snake eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked my assistant to pull the clips on the last time the
Jets were champions of their division, as they are now, she had to
hunt (electronically) through newspaper stacks that are older than
she is.
</P>
<P>
   Return with us now to Dec. 7, 1969. Vietnam was raging. Richard
Nixon was wrapping up his first year as president. ``Man of La
Mancha'' was on Broadway and you could get seats in the balcony for
$3.75.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s loomed but no one realized how different they would be
from the astonishing and tumultuous '60s. And no one could possibly
have known that a president would be chased from office under the
threat of impeachment and another would actually be impeached
before the Jets would win another championship.
</P>
<P>
   The headline that day in the sports section of The New York
Times said, ``Jets Top Oilers, 34-26, and Take Title.'' On the same
page was a story about Bill Bradley leading the Knicks to a victory
over the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was 26. While the Jets were wandering like sad sacks
through the fields of football futility, he would complete his Hall
of Fame basketball career, complete a distinguished career in the
Senate and put together plans for his own possible run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Jets fans during that same period were growing up, having
children, and some of those children were having children. And yet
most fans remained true to the woeful team that came to be known as
Gang Green, a team that spent most of the '70s, '80s and '90s
nurturing masters in the fine art of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone root for such a terrible team for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Emerson comes to mind. He once said: ``There are people who have
an appetite for grief. Pleasure is not strong enough and they crave
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times' Gerald Eskenazi, in his book ``Gang Green,'' quotes
Rabbi Myron Fenster, former head of the New York Board of Rabbis.
``It's good for the soul,'' the rabbi said. ``It teaches you about
striving and redemption, although I must admit I'm waiting for the
redemption a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Redemption came in the form of a snarling, superstitious devil
named Bill Parcells. This coach is not like anything the Jets or
their fans have ever experienced. To Parcells, losing is as
acceptable as self-immolation. He is not like Weeb Ewbank, a nice
man who, while coaching the Jets in the Super Bowl in January 1969,
forgot himself and said of the opposing quarterback, Johnny Unitas,
who had once played for Ewbank: ``Come on, John, don't throw any
interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has decreed that the foolishness will cease. He is a
tyrant, a ruthless enforcer who has wrought a miraculous change in
one of the worst franchises in sports. He shoves his players around
and is quick to belittle people. He once sidled up to the gifted
wide receiver Wayne Chrebet and deliberately kicked him in his
injured ankle. He is nasty to reporters and won't let his assistant
coaches talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows football. He has won everywhere he's been and is
winning with the Jets. Desperation can lead to odd embraces and
Jets fans have embraced Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which won just one of 16 games two years ago, is 11-4
this year. It can win its 12th game Sunday afternoon, which would
be the highest regular-season victory total in team history. If the
Jets win two games in the playoffs they will go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope is all Jets fans have ever wanted,'' said Eskenazi in
``Gang Green.''
</P>
<P>
   The longtime fans are older, wider and grayer now and giddy at
the prospect of more wins to come. Instead of snake eyes, they are
rolling consistent sevens and elevens.
</P>
<P>
   Sainthood never occasioned such glee. For the moment, it's
high-fives all around. Jets fans have learned there is nothing like
a pact with the devil, and you go with it until the devil demands
his due.

</P>
<P>
   YEAREND-UNKNOWN-LEGENDS (Undated) _ The fact remains that for
every Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, there are dozens of sports
heroes whose names aren't quite big enough for the sports pages,
who never get a minute on television or radio, whose talents will
not command multimillion-dollar contracts. So here's to those

   BBO-PARITY (Undated) _ With each astonishing signing by a

   NY-BOATSHOW (New York) _ The New York National Boat Show, now in
its 87th year, looks more like a stage production than a sales
arena each season. Complete with an indoor small boat pond, Twiggy
the water-skiing squirrel, and cooking classes on a two-burner
stove, there will be entertainment galore at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center from Jan. 2-10. But the organizers take the sale

   PEYRON-SAILING (Paris) _ Bruno Peyron, part of a famous sailing
family, is working the phones and the angles in an attempt to
organize a grand, mad dash beginning Dec. 31, 2000. It will be
called, quite simply, ``The Race.'' And while it is far from clear
that it will be the success that Peyron imagines, his is an
ambitious and enticingly straightforward concept: a non-stop race
around the world open to crews of any nationality and boats of any
design, which must first pass muster over shorter qualifying
distances. By Christopher Clarey.

<P>
   Anyone just tuning in might imagine that a horrible new epidemic
is sweeping over Congress, sidelining people with the dread virus
of adultery. But this bug has been around for ages, and no one has
yet devised a cure.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, legal diagnosticians don't even agree on what
adultery is. As usual, the laws vary from state to state _ some
insist that the husband must be unfaithful, others the wife, still
others allow both this option, while a few even demand that both
lovers be married to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of what's been written about adultery has been
written by men, though history suggests that women have also played
a role.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this uncertainty, many in Washington seem to favor an
uncompromising Old Testament stance developed in the desert, long
before the more sophisticated days in Jerusalem and Babylon, not to
mention the advent of Christian forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   However it's defined, adultery and its lies have generated a
vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in many cultures, an almost
universal body of common law. Herewith a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alexander Gross
</P>
<P>
   It shall be considered adultery to offer presents to a married
woman, to romp with her, to touch her dress or ornaments, or to sit
with her on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Code of Manu,'' Hindu law scripture (dated 600 B.C.-300
A.D.)
</P>
<P>
   I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, let
us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves
with loves. For the good man is not at home, he is gone a long
journey.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Book of Proverbs'' (circa 500 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   When cheated, wife or husband feels the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Euripides, ``Andromache'' (c. 426 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   A man may commit adultery with a woman knowing well who she is,
but not of free choice, because he is under the influence of
passion. In that case he is not an unjust man, though he acts
unjustly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aristotle, ``The Nicomachean Ethics'' (c. 340 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   Venus likes her thefts to be concealed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tibullus, Roman poet, ``Elegiae'' (c. 25 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   One should reflect deeply before having relations with married
women. If it works, what do I risk? Is success possible without
taking too many risks? When I have possessed her, what are the
risks for the reputation of either of us?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Jayamangala,'' a 12th-century commentary on the Kama Sutra
by Yashodhara of India.
</P>
<P>
   Aroma had no intention of passively bowing to her fate. She
simply could not accept the idea that her precious romance of the
last 10 nights was all over just because her husband had come home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Li Yu, ``The Prayer Mat of Flesh,'' a Ming Dynasty novel
(1634). (The title refers to the Taoist and Buddhist belief that
sexual indulgence may lead to divine union.)
</P>
<P>
   What was thy cause? Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for
adultery! No, the wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly. Does
lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shakespeare, ``King Lear'' (1605-6). (Lear speaking to the
blinded Gloucester.)
</P>
<P>
   He that is robb'd, not knowing what is stolen, Let him not know
it, and he's not robbed at all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shakespeare, ``Othello'' (1604). (Othello responding to rumors
of his wife's infidelity.)
</P>
<P>
   A mistress should be like a little country retreat near the
town, not to dwell in constantly, but only for a night and away.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Wycherley, ``The Country Wife'' (1675)
</P>
<P>
   Love ceases to be a pleasure, when it ceases to be a secret.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Aphra Behn, British playwright, ``The Lover's Watch''
(1686)
</P>
<P>
   No man worth having is true to his wife, or can be true to his
wife, or ever was, or ever will be so.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Vanbrugh, British playwright, ``The Relapse'' (1708)
</P>
<P>
   No, I shall have mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   _ George II of England, responding to Queen Caroline's
suggestion on her deathbed that he remarry (1737).
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is an evil only inasmuch as it is a theft; but we do
not steal that which is given to us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voltaire, ``Philosophical Dictionary'' (1764)
</P>
<P>
   Where there's marriage without love, there will be love without
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Benjamin Franklin, ``Poor Richard's Almanac'' (c. 1790)
</P>
<P>
   It is better to have a prosaic husband and to take a romantic
lover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stendhal, ``De L'Amour'' (1822)
</P>
<P>
   What we call adultery, like what we call heresy, comes as a
natural right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Victor Hugo (1802-1885), ``Pierres''
</P>
<P>
   What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,/Is much more common
where the climate's sultry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lord Byron (1788-1824), ``Don Juan''
</P>
<P>
   To console ourselves for all those things, happily we still have
adultery! Maryland tobacco! And Spanish cigarette paper!
</P>
<P>
   _ Petrus Borel, a French writer, ``Rhapsodies'' (c. 1850)
</P>
<P>
   Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be
faithless, and cannot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oscar Wilde, ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891)
</P>
<P>
   To permit oneself the joys of adultery, one must be a pious
person.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anatole France, ``Le lys rouge'' (1894)
</P>
<P>
   When one loves in a certain way, even betrayal becomes
unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colette, ```The Innocent Wife'' (1903)
</P>
<P>
   One man's folly is often another man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helen Rowland, ``Reflections of a Bachelor Girl'' (1909)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is the application of democracy to love.
</P>
<P>
   _ H.L. Mencken, ``A Book of Burlesques'' (1920)
</P>
<P>
   The psychology of adultery has been falsified by conventional
morals, which assume, in monogamous countries, that attraction to
one person cannot coexist with a serious affection for another.
Everyone knows that this is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bertrand Russell, ``Marriage and Morals'' (1929)
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy is the most difficult and nerve-racking vice that any
man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and a rare
detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, be
practised at spare moments; it is a whole-time job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Somerset Maugham, ``Cakes and Ale'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery, sometimes necessary plot material, must not be
explicitly treated, or justified, or presented attractively.
</P>
<P>
   _ An early code to ``govern the making of motion and talking
pictures by the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of
America, Inc.'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   The Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, are now extinct.
</P>
<P>
   _ Somerset Maugham, ``The Breadwinner'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   The aura of the theocratic death penalty for adultery still
clings to America, even outside New England, and multiple divorce,
which looks to the European like serial polygamy, is the moral
solution to the problem of the itch. Love comes into it too, of
course, but in Europe we tend to see marital love as an eternity
which encompasses hate and also indifference: when we promise to
love we really mean that we promise to honour a contract.
Americans, seeming to take marriage with not enough seriousness,
are really taking love and sex with too much.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anthony Burgess, ``You've Had Your Time'' (1990)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is hard on a small town because it can cause sudden
population loss, and usually it's the wrong people who get run out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garrison Keillor, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times
(1994)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a media-driven age when image so often defines
power, Chief Justice William Rehnquist is an anomaly: a powerful
man whose public image is so fuzzy he can walk the halls and
grounds of the Supreme Court, where he has served for 27 years,
without attracting a tourist's second glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are many imponderables about the impeachment trial
scheduled to start in the Senate in early January, but at least one
predictable result: If the trial of President Clinton indeed goes
forward as something more than a brief formality on the way to a
negotiated resolution, if it becomes the century's final televised
sensation, Rehnquist will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight
existence of a Supreme Court justice into the glare of the public
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fascinating prospect, not only because this 74-year-old
amateur historian has written a book about two famous Senate
impeachment trials. ``Grand Inquests'' (William Morrow, 1992),
about the trials of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 and
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 _ both of which ended in
acquittals _ is belatedly in demand from people scanning for clues
to how the chief justice would conduct the trial of the president.
The book, largely anecdotal in approach, contains no such clues,
although it does display a decided skepticism about politically
driven impeachment, a category that indisputably fits both those
19th-century episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the coincidental fact of the chief justice as impeachment
specialist, or the novel fact of the chief justice on display in
every living room, is the intriguing prospect of watching a man
accustomed to being very much in charge of a very controllable
environment navigate in a realm where normal expectations don't
apply. When Rehnquist announces, as he often does when the red
light at the lawyers' podium comes on, ``Counsel, your time has
expired,'' the lawyer stops speaking, sometimes in mid-syllable,
and sits down. The chief justice, presiding over an impeachment
trial, can be overruled on any point, trivial or profound, by a
vote of 51 senators.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution gives the Senate ``the sole power to try
all impeachments,'' the trial is an odd amalgam of law and politics
that would feel distinctly unfamiliar to any federal judge. The 100
jurors, far from being a disinterested panel subject to challenge
for connections to parties in the case, have in many instances
broken bread with the defendant; some are his allies and other have
made their disapproval clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Rules of Evidence, under which much of the material
the House considered during its impeachment debate would be
excluded as hearsay, do not apply. The standard of proof _ ``beyond
a reasonable doubt'' in any real criminal trial _ is not specified.
The chief justice may rule on questions of evidence and procedure,
but at the end of the day a majority of the Senate has the final
word.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial itself is a curiosity, so is the role the
Constitution gives the chief justice. It is not really judicial at
all. The chief justice serves as presiding officer of the Senate, a
surrogate for the vice president, who presides over any
non-presidential impeachment trial but would have a conflict of
interest when the president is on trial. There is no expectation
that a vice president is even a lawyer, let alone a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the language of law permeates the proceeding, it may
be impossible to separate William Rehnquist the chief justice from
William Rehnquist the surrogate presiding officer. In any event,
this is a man accustomed to command, and it is hard to imagine him
in the role of potted plant if the Senate overrides a procedural
ruling that he thinks is necessary or important for consistency or
regularity. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, who presided over the
only other presidential impeachment trial, that of Andrew Johnson,
threatened more than once to walk out if the Senate did not accept
an evidentiary ruling, and the Senate blinked; the trial could not
go on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is which William Rehnquist will be on display.
There is a segment of the public that will forever see him as a
one-dimensional, law-and-order Nixonian (he served as an assistant
attorney general before his Supreme Court appointment by President
Richard Nixon in 1971) who embodies many of their concerns about
the direction of the court. He is a polarizing figure who drew 33
negative votes in the Senate after a testy confirmation hearing in
1986, when President Ronald Reagan elevated him from associate
justice to chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Rehnquist has not so much modulated his conservative
views as he has stood fast while the entire spectrum, political as
well as judicial, shifted to the right. It is not easy to portray
him as an extremist when Clinton signed a habeas corpus bill in
1996 that adopted Rehnquist's long-held position in favor of
reducing state prisoners' access to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the courtroom, Rehnquist can often appear the stern
task master, he has a dry wit and avid outside interests ranging
from poker to art (he absented himself from one of Reagan's State
of the Union speeches because it conflicted with a painting class
he was taking) to Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he remodeled his basic black robe, adding four
gold stripes on each sleeve to copy the Lord Chancellor's costume
in a local production of ``Iolanthe.'' In addition to three
published books of history, he is the author of an unpublished
mystery novel.
</P>
<P>
   If his presence is indeed required in the Capitol, a few hundred
yards across First Street from the Supreme Court building, it is a
near certainty that the work of the court will go on with little
disruption. The chief justice is a fast writer and highly efficient
manager of his time and others'. Not one to agonize over hard
decisions, he takes the view that a second or third try rarely adds
much of value to the initial assessment of a question or a case.
The justices' weekly closed-door conferences, to discuss new and
pending cases, move along with dispatch, with conversation cut
quite short and details and disagreements left to be expressed
later in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the chief justice had back surgery and
missed a conference, the job of presiding fell to John Paul
Stevens, the senior associate justice. It was the first time in
recent memory that the conference lasted through lunch.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a media-driven age when image so often defines
power, Chief Justice William Rehnquist is an anomaly: a powerful
man whose public image is so fuzzy he can walk the halls and
grounds of the Supreme Court, where he has served for 27 years,
without attracting a tourist's second glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are many imponderables about the impeachment trial
scheduled to start in the Senate in early January, but at least one
predictable result: If the trial of President Clinton indeed goes
forward as something more than a brief formality on the way to a
negotiated resolution, if it becomes the century's final televised
sensation, Rehnquist will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight
existence of a Supreme Court justice into the glare of the public
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fascinating prospect, not only because this 74-year-old
amateur historian has written a book about two famous Senate
impeachment trials. ``Grand Inquests'' (William Morrow, 1992),
about the trials of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 and
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 _ both of which ended in
acquittals _ is belatedly in demand from people scanning for clues
to how the chief justice would conduct the trial of the president.
The book, largely anecdotal in approach, contains no such clues,
although it does display a decided skepticism about politically
driven impeachment, a category that indisputably fits both those
19th-century episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the coincidental fact of the chief justice as impeachment
specialist, or the novel fact of the chief justice on display in
every living room, is the intriguing prospect of watching a man
accustomed to being very much in charge of a very controllable
environment navigate in a realm where normal expectations don't
apply. When Rehnquist announces, as he often does when the red
light at the lawyers' podium comes on, ``Counsel, your time has
expired,'' the lawyer stops speaking, sometimes in mid-syllable,
and sits down. The chief justice, presiding over an impeachment
trial, can be overruled on any point, trivial or profound, by a
vote of 51 senators.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution gives the Senate ``the sole power to try
all impeachments,'' the trial is an odd amalgam of law and politics
that would feel distinctly unfamiliar to any federal judge. The 100
jurors, far from being a disinterested panel subject to challenge
for connections to parties in the case, have in many instances
broken bread with the defendant; some are his allies and other have
made their disapproval clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Rules of Evidence, under which much of the material
the House considered during its impeachment debate would be
excluded as hearsay, do not apply. The standard of proof _ ``beyond
a reasonable doubt'' in any real criminal trial _ is not specified.
The chief justice may rule on questions of evidence and procedure,
but at the end of the day a majority of the Senate has the final
word.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial itself is a curiosity, so is the role the
Constitution gives the chief justice. It is not really judicial at
all. The chief justice serves as presiding officer of the Senate, a
surrogate for the vice president, who presides over any
non-presidential impeachment trial but would have a conflict of
interest when the president is on trial. There is no expectation
that a vice president is even a lawyer, let alone a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the language of law permeates the proceeding, it may
be impossible to separate William Rehnquist the chief justice from
William Rehnquist the surrogate presiding officer. In any event,
this is a man accustomed to command, and it is hard to imagine him
in the role of potted plant if the Senate overrides a procedural
ruling that he thinks is necessary or important for consistency or
regularity. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, who presided over the
only other presidential impeachment trial, that of Andrew Johnson,
threatened more than once to walk out if the Senate did not accept
an evidentiary ruling, and the Senate blinked; the trial could not
go on without him.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   High-school teachers are abuzz with reports that Latin, long
given up for dead, is actually showing a pulse. But the more
remarkable news in language circles may really be that millions of
American teen-agers continue to study French, despite _ and let's
be gentle about this _ the fading significance of France and the
French language.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that according to the most recent surveys, nearly 1 out
of every 4 American students who learn a foreign language in middle
school and high school still chooses French, a language spoken
fluently by only about 1 out of every 50 people on the planet. By
contrast, 1 percent of American teen-agers study Chinese or
Japanese, which combined are spoken by 20 percent of the world's
people.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as French has effectively ceded to English its
longtime standing as the first language of diplomacy, among other
crowns. So is French being taught out of proportion to its role in
the family of nations and the global economy?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brecht thinks so. He is the director of a group called
the National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught
Languages, which represents anyone teaching languages other than
English, French, Spanish and German. He comes down particularly
hard on French (studied by 22 percent of teen-agers) and German (6
percent), saying he can think of no good reason to push them on so
many American students at the expense of Russian or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer that makes sense, besides the fact that those
are the languages available, is that they are just so deeply
embedded in our cultural traditions,'' said Brecht. ``It becomes a
cultural argument, not a logical argument, and that's not an
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Brecht, a professor of Russian at the University of Maryland,
said it makes sense for Americans to know Spanish, which is ``our
second language'' and which two out of three teen-agers learn. So
too the languages of Asia and Russia because their actions have
social and economic consequences for the United States. Yet only
0.3 percent study Russian, 0.17 percent take Cantonese and Mandarin
and 0.77 percent Japanese, according to the American Council on the
Teaching of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's middle and high schools, the reasons for
offering French are often quite basic. One is tradition: America's
love affair with French can be traced to 18th-century Southern
colonists, whose classical education included the language. Though
the world may have changed since then, a school's attempt to
broaden its language palette can be difficult, with the teachers
and time needed to offer Russian or Chinese or Arabic _ harder and
longer to master than French or Spanish _ in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, Lake Forest High School in Felton, Del., a
small town near Dover, is offering Japanese to 10 students. But to
squeeze it into the curriculum _ to meet their language
requirement, roughly half the students take Spanish, the other half
French _ the class is given after school, via satellite from the
University of Georgia. The program costs $5,000, and the principal,
Michael Carr, said that the district could not have afforded it
without a federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, more than a few Francophiles who are
appalled at any suggestion that the importance of French is
declining. After all, French is necessary for translating the later
works of Voltaire, or even the earlier works of Celine Dion, a
French Canadian. And how would one know the difference between coq
au vin (chicken in wine sauce) and un joli coco (a stinker)?
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of French can be found even in traditionally
unfriendly places.
</P>
<P>
   A British official at the United Nations, who insisted on
anonymity so he would not be seen as a defender of the French, said
that French can occasionally be useful. ``If you want to impress
your girlfriend,'' he said, ``have a bit of French pillow talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding out another olive branch, he added, ``I don't think you
should necessarily be hard nosed, saying you should only learn a
language that is going to further your business interests. People
need an education to be enlightened, and French is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But French has limited practicality, he conceded. ``I have
enough trouble in a cab in New York,'' he said. ``There, Urdu might
be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for those traveling to Quebec, where French is a
necessity and the use of English is restricted on signs, or for
those interested in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Arenson, a ninth grader at the Fieldston School in the
Bronx, is in her third year of French, which she believes will help
her in becoming a ballerina. ``The steps that are done, they were
named in France, because that is sort of where ballet took hold,''
said Morgan, 14. ``We do little stories in French class. Someone
was throwing something and the book used the word jeter. I thought,
`Oh, I know what that is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Wilder, an 11th grader at the Kent School in Litchfield
County, Conn., could have chosen German, Spanish, Japanese or
Latin. While most of her classmates selected Spanish, she picked
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told that French was the language of the
diplomats,'' she said, ``and that all high-powered people, such as
Madeleine Albright, spoke it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in the area of diplomacy that French has suffered some
of its bitterest losses. While some in France continue to swat away
Americanized phrases like le stress and disque-jockey that have
slipped through their borders, delegates of former French colonies
from Africa and Southeast Asia are increasingly choosing to
communicate in English rather than French at official conclaves.
</P>
<P>
   And at the United Nations in 1996 the French lost a very public
battle to keep Kofi Annan of Ghana from succeeding Boutros
Boutros-Ghali as secretary-general. The French had objected because
Annan speaks French with an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who speaks
excellent French, is now secretary-general of La Francophonie in
Paris, which, he says, is seeking to ``promote solidarity'' among
52 nations that share French as a first, second or, in the case of
Egypt, third language.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother tongue is Arabic,'' Boutros-Ghali said, ``I write in
Arabic, dream in Arabic and have disputes with my wife in Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But among the different languages,'' he added, ``I believe
French has a certain weight.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In sports, 1998 was a scrapbook of snapshots, with baseball
demanding its own montage in what many devotees considered the most
monumental season ever:
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hitting home runs, a record 70 for
the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman and 66 for the Chicago Cubs
right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, best described by Manager Joe Torre as a ``team
team,'' enjoying their World Series sweep and a record 125
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander Kevin Brown raising the roof of the free-agent
market by signing a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Many other snapshots deserved to be enlarged:
</P>
<P>
   John Elway whirling through the air in running for a first down
as the Denver Broncos finally won the Super Bowl, the first
American Football Conference team to do it in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan stealing the ball from Utah's Karl Malone, then
hitting the winning shot to assure the Chicago Bulls their sixth
National Basketball Association championship.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Olympic female hockey players celebrating
their gold-medal victory at the XVIII Winter Games in Nagano,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, in only their second season with Bill Parcells as
coach, attaining the altitude of first place in the AFC East
division for the first time since the 1970 realignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, with a 5-8 record, wrecking the Broncos' bid for an
undefeated season on Kent Graham's last-minute 43-yard touchdown
pass to wide receiver Amani Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara raising his arms in triumph on the final green
after his winning putt fell, in both the Masters and the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks exploding on the Champs-Elysees in Paris after
France's soccer team stunned favored Brazil in the World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman skating with his Detroit Red Wings to hoist the
Stanley Cup, his eighth as a National Hockey League coach, as
Vladimir Konstantinov, severely injured in a limousine accident
following the Wings' cup victory a year earlier, rolls onto the ice
in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna, at Wimbledon, and Lindsay Davenport, at the United
States Open, each winning her first major tennis title.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy running back at Texas,
galloping to Division I-A career records for rushing yards and
all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw leading the University of Tennessee to its
third consecutive women's national college basketball title.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, in the Breeders' Cup Classic, preventing Skip
Away from becoming thoroughbred racing's career money winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Lipinski, 15, soaring and spinning as the youngest
figure-skating gold-medal winner in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin, with a rare circulatory ailment in his right leg,
obtaining a Federal court order allowing him to ride in a golf cart
between shots on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon roaring to another stock-car championship and Dale
Earnhardt, in his 20th start, finally winning his first Daytona
500.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, a 20-year-old rookie from South Korea, attaining a
rare golf double: the United States Women's Open and the Ladies
Professional Golfers Association Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson pleading for a Nevada boxer's license and getting it,
16 months after biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Nykesha Sales, with her torn Achilles' tendon in a cast, banking
in an uncontested layup for the UConn women's basketball scoring
record, as arranged by her coach, Geno Auriemma, and the opposing
coach, at the start of a game with Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   But some snapshots were smudged:
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's investigation of alleged
corruption in the choice of Salt Lake City as the site of the 2002
Winter Games, as well as alleged vote-buying in the choice of other
recent Olympic cities, including Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of four former Northwestern University football
players on perjury charges related to betting on their own games,
after two former Northwestern basketball players and two gamblers
were sentenced to prison terms for trying to fix three Northwestern
basketball games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu's court order of
protection from her father, Dumitru Moceanu.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France's expulsion of Festina, the world's top
cycling team, after its coach supplied illegal
performance-enhancing drugs to his riders; the investigation of
other teams by French authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths, within 33 days, of three college wrestlers while
trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   The paralysis of the Chinese gymnast Sang Lan in a fall during a
Goodwill Games warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Basketball Association club owners' lockout of
players that threatened to cancel the current season and the
playoffs unless a labor agreement is reached by Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For Baseball, Home Runs and Hugs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In baseball's best single snapshot, Mark McGwire hit his 62d
homer, touched all the bases (after initially missing first base)
and touched all the hearts. He hugged his 10-year-old son, Matthew.
With another hug, he lifted Sammy Sosa, who had 58 homers at the
time and had hurried in from right field to congratulate him. Then
he greeted the family of the late Roger Maris, whose 61 homers in
1961 broke Babe Ruth's record of 60 in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was voted the National League's most valuable player for
carrying the Cubs into the playoffs with a wild-card victory over
the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire stirred a debate over his use of androstenedione, a
testosterone-boosting hormone allowed by baseball but outlawed in
pro football and the Olympics.

   Consider that according to the most recent surveys, nearly 1 out
of every 4 American students who learn a foreign language in middle
school and high school still chooses French, a language spoken
fluently by only about 1 out of every 50 people on the planet. By
contrast, 1 percent of American teen-agers study Chinese or
Japanese, which combined are spoken by 20 percent of the world's
people.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as French has effectively ceded to English its
longtime standing as the first language of diplomacy, among other
crowns. So is French being taught out of proportion to its role in
the family of nations and the global economy?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brecht thinks so. He is the director of a group called
the National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught
Languages, which represents anyone teaching languages other than
English, French, Spanish and German. He comes down particularly
hard on French (studied by 22 percent of teen-agers) and German (6
percent), saying he can think of no good reason to push them on so
many American students at the expense of Russian or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer that makes sense, besides the fact that those
are the languages available, is that they are just so deeply
embedded in our cultural traditions,'' said Brecht. ``It becomes a
cultural argument, not a logical argument, and that's not an
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Brecht, a professor of Russian at the University of Maryland,
said it makes sense for Americans to know Spanish, which is ``our
second language'' and which two out of three teen-agers learn. So
too the languages of Asia and Russia because their actions have
social and economic consequences for the United States. Yet only
0.3 percent study Russian, 0.17 percent take Cantonese and Mandarin
and 0.77 percent Japanese, according to the American Council on the
Teaching of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's middle and high schools, the reasons for
offering French are often quite basic. One is tradition: America's
love affair with French can be traced to 18th-century Southern
colonists, whose classical education included the language. Though
the world may have changed since then, a school's attempt to
broaden its language palette can be difficult, with the teachers
and time needed to offer Russian or Chinese or Arabic _ harder and
longer to master than French or Spanish _ in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, Lake Forest High School in Felton, Del., a
small town near Dover, is offering Japanese to 10 students. But to
squeeze it into the curriculum _ to meet their language
requirement, roughly half the students take Spanish, the other half
French _ the class is given after school, via satellite from the
University of Georgia. The program costs $5,000, and the principal,
Michael Carr, said that the district could not have afforded it
without a federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, more than a few Francophiles who are
appalled at any suggestion that the importance of French is
declining. After all, French is necessary for translating the later
works of Voltaire, or even the earlier works of Celine Dion, a
French Canadian. And how would one know the difference between coq
au vin (chicken in wine sauce) and un joli coco (a stinker)?
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of French can be found even in traditionally
unfriendly places.
</P>
<P>
   A British official at the United Nations, who insisted on
anonymity so he would not be seen as a defender of the French, said
that French can occasionally be useful. ``If you want to impress
your girlfriend,'' he said, ``have a bit of French pillow talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding out another olive branch, he added, ``I don't think you
should necessarily be hard nosed, saying you should only learn a
language that is going to further your business interests. People
need an education to be enlightened, and French is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But French has limited practicality, he conceded. ``I have
enough trouble in a cab in New York,'' he said. ``There, Urdu might
be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for those traveling to Quebec, where French is a
necessity and the use of English is restricted on signs, or for
those interested in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Arenson, a ninth grader at the Fieldston School in the
Bronx, is in her third year of French, which she believes will help
her in becoming a ballerina. ``The steps that are done, they were
named in France, because that is sort of where ballet took hold,''
said Morgan, 14. ``We do little stories in French class. Someone
was throwing something and the book used the word jeter. I thought,
`Oh, I know what that is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Wilder, an 11th grader at the Kent School in Litchfield
County, Conn., could have chosen German, Spanish, Japanese or
Latin. While most of her classmates selected Spanish, she picked
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told that French was the language of the
diplomats,'' she said, ``and that all high-powered people, such as
Madeleine Albright, spoke it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in the area of diplomacy that French has suffered some
of its bitterest losses. While some in France continue to swat away
Americanized phrases like le stress and disque-jockey that have
slipped through their borders, delegates of former French colonies
from Africa and Southeast Asia are increasingly choosing to
communicate in English rather than French at official conclaves.
</P>
<P>
   And at the United Nations in 1996 the French lost a very public
battle to keep Kofi Annan of Ghana from succeeding Boutros
Boutros-Ghali as secretary-general. The French had objected because
Annan speaks French with an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who speaks
excellent French, is now secretary-general of La Francophonie in
Paris, which, he says, is seeking to ``promote solidarity'' among
52 nations that share French as a first, second or, in the case of
Egypt, third language.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother tongue is Arabic,'' Boutros-Ghali said, ``I write in
Arabic, dream in Arabic and have disputes with my wife in Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But among the different languages,'' he added, ``I believe
French has a certain weight.''

   The Yankees also created a debate: Was this the best baseball
team ever? They rolled to a 114-48 record during the season; swept
the Texas Rangers in the division playoff, 3-0; eliminated the
Cleveland Indians in the American League Championship Series, 4-2,
and dominated the San Diego Padres in the World Series, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander David Wells pitched a perfect game during his
18-4 season, the right-hander David Cone was 20-7, Derek Jeter
sparkled at shortstop, the Cuban refugee Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez was 12-4, center fielder Bernie Williams hit .339 for the
AL batting title. Darryl Strawberry underwent colon cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner was close to selling the Yankees to
Cablevision for a reported $600 million until he bragged about how
he would still control the operation of the team (and maybe the
Knicks and the Rangers too), prompting Charles Dolan to put the
negotiations on hold. The Los Angeles Dodgers were sold to Rupert
Murdoch for $311 million.
</P>
<P>
   When a 500-pound beam fell in Yankee Stadium, the Yankees had to
play one game at Shea in April. But Steinbrenner, although often
declaring that he would address the future of Yankee Stadium once
the season ended, has yet to discuss his plans publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In the National League, the Padres, relying on Brown, Tony Gwynn
and the slugger Greg Vaughn (who hit 50 homers), ousted Houston and
Atlanta in the playoffs. The Mets, who obtained the slugger Mike
Piazza in June, stayed in the wild-card race until the final
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza signed a seven-year, $91 million contract with the Mets
even before the frantic free-agent auctions. In addition to Brown's
$105 million deal, Williams returned to the Yankees for $87.5
million over seven years, Mo Vaughn moved to Anaheim for $80
million over six years, Albert Belle joined Baltimore for $65
million over five years and Randy Johnson went to Arizona for $52.4
million over four years.

   Kerry Wood, the Cubs' 20-year-old rookie right-hander, struck

   &UR; Denver Is Undone While Jets Fly to Top &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the first season of the National Football League's
eight-year, $17.6 billion television contracts, the Broncos arrived
in Giants Stadium at 13-0 with a chance to go 19-0 if they could
repeat as Super Bowl champions. But the Broncos were upset, 20-16,
and the Giants celebrated one of the most memorable victories in
their history. The 1972 Dolphins also celebrated; their 17-0 season
was still unique.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, with quarterback Vinny Testaverde throwing 25
touchdown passes going into Sunday's finale, soared into the
playoffs as a divisional champion. Curtis Martin, signed to a
six-year, $36 million deal, rushed for more than 1,000 yards; wide
receivers Wayne Chrebet and Keyshawn Johnson each caught passes for
more than 1,000 yards; Testaverde, Johnson, Mo Lewis and Aaron
Glenn made the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, weakened by the preseason loss of cornerback Jason
Sehorn to knee surgery, struggled until Coach Jim Fassel benched
quarterback Danny Kanell and used Kent Graham. With a 7-8 record
before Sunday's season finale, the Giants still had a playoff
chance, but they needed to win in Philadelphia while both Tampa Bay
and Arizona lost. Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead made the Pro
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings, bolstered by the rookie wide receiver
Randy Moss and the comeback of quarterback Randall Cunningham,
jumped to a 14-1 record and the Atlanta Falcons were 13-2 as the
National Conference's best. Dan Reeves, the Falcons' coach, needed
heart-bypass surgery on Dec. 14, and returned to the hospital on
Dec. 20, but hoped to be on the sideline in the playoffs.
Controversial calls provoked a campaign to return instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut legislators voted to build a $375 million stadium in
Hartford that the New England Patriots plan to occupy in 2001, and
Al Lerner, a credit-card magnate, was chosen as owner of the
expansion Cleveland Browns franchise for $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under college football's new Bowl Championship Series format,
the University of Tennessee (12-0) and Florida State (11-1) were
selected for the Fiesta Bowl title game Jan. 4 that will determine
the successor to the mythical co-champions, Michigan and Nebraska.
But the worthiness of Ohio State (10-1), Kansas State (11-1) and
UCLA (10-1) had BCS critics demanding a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Not Surprisingly, It's All About Michael &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls did what they have done six straight times when
Michael Jordan played a full season _ win the NBA title. In the
final, they muted the Utah Jazz in six games. But with the labor
dispute, Jordan has yet to announce if he will resume his career or
retire. Phil Jackson resigned as the Bulls' coach; Tim Floyd, from
Iowa State, succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, with Patrick Ewing out with a damaged shooting wrist
for most of their inconsistent 43-39 season, happily got past Miami
and the former Knick coach Pat Riley in the first round of the
playoffs. Larry Johnson and Heat center Alonzo Mourning were
suspended for the decisive fifth game after a fight that had Jeff
Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, hanging onto one of Mourning's legs
on the Garden court.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, more rusty than ready, returned for the second game of
the series with Indiana, but the Pacers won in six, then forced the
Bulls to a Game 7 in the conference finals, enough to elect Larry
Bird as the coach of the year. The Nets, with Jayson Williams
averaging 14 rebounds, also had a 43-39 record in Coach John
Calipari's second season but drew the Bulls in the first round of
the playoffs, and were swept.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Latrell Sprewell, who had choked his Golden State
coach, P.J. Carlesimo, early in the season, appealed his one-year
NBA suspension and the Warriors' termination of his $28 million
contract. John Feerick, the NBA arbitrator, reduced the suspension
to seven months and restored the final three years of the contract.
Sprewell is expected to be traded after the lockout ends.

Republic, with goaltender Dominik Hasek dominating a 1-0 final over
Russia, won the men's tournament, which used National Hockey League
players for the first time. The United States team failed to
qualify for the medal round; some players then embarrassed
themselves by trashing a dorm room and declining to identify the

   Picabo Street, skiing on a surgically rebuilt knee, won the gold

The Islanders, who finished 2 points ahead of the Rangers,

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long after Americans stopped husbanding gasoline
and keeping the speedometer at 55, policy-makers here clung to a
national maximum speed limit, arguing that it saved lives. But that
limit, an artifact of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that was very
unpopular after the price of gasoline dropped, was eliminated three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Hawaii has since raised its highway speed
limit in what has become an unofficial test of the long-held belief
that speed kills. Three years into the test, the answer is still
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents is about the
same; 41,967 in 1997, 41,907 in 1996 and 41,798 in 1995. When
expressed as the number of deaths per million miles driven, the
death rate is actually down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The data offer a Rohrshach test that is open to interpretation.
A recent opinion article in The Wall Street Journal by a journalist
and muscle-car enthusiast, Eric Peters, suggested that federal
officials liked the 55 mph limit because it gave the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration power over the states. Roads,
Peters supposed, were safer at faster speeds because a higher limit
reduced variations in speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But several traffic safety experts said they knew of no data
that would support Peters' argument. In fact, there is a dearth of
data on how posted limits affect speeds.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a few of the uncertainties of federal
traffic-safety statistics. For example, some statistics measure the
deaths on roads posted at 55 or 60 mph against those posted at 65
or higher. Others measure whether the overall number of miles of
road posted at 65 is growing and whether the overall number of
miles posted at 55 or 60 is declining. The agency does not keep
track of casualty figures for a single stretch of road when its
limit rose to 70 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tried to keep track of a single stretch of road, starting
in January 1996, when highway speeds reverted to a daytime 70 mph
and 60 at night. A study produced by the Texas Transportation
Institute, a state agency, found that by March 1997 there were 9
percent more crashes on rural, multi-lane undivided highways; 33
percent more on rural, two-lane state highways and U.S.-numbered
routes. But the report failed to find a significant increase in
fatalities on these and most Interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The finding runs counter to the predictions of most traffic
engineers, who say crashes at higher speeds are likely to be more
severe. The study's researchers said the sample size might be too
small to capture an increase in deaths, which are less common than
accidents that involve non-fatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA told Congress in a report in February that states that
increased their limits in 1996 recorded about 350 more Interstate
fatalities than before, a jump of about 9 percent. The agency said
the increase in fatalities was smaller than the estimated change
after 1987, when Congress enabled states to raise the limit on
rural Interstates to 65 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have done even better in terms of the overall numbers
had the speed-limit increases not been as pervasive,'' said Philip
Recht, deputy administrator of the NHTSA, referring to the
reduction in fatalities. ``The simple fact that the total number of
fatalities remained the same or even dipped in any year does not
tell you what the impact of the speed limit increases is.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the deadliest roads _ rural two-lane blacktops with
sharp curves and no shoulders _ were not affected by the end of the
national speed limit, in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Another data point, which could yield a variety of
interpretations, comes from Canada. Speed limits there, which are
set by the individual provinces, are essentially unchanged,
although vehicle registrations and drivers have approximately
doubled in 20 years, according to Derek Sweet, director of road
safety at Transport Canada, a government agency. But deaths
declined by about half, he said. Last year they were 3,064, down
from 3,082 in 1996 and 3,347 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex business,'' Sweet said. ``It's really difficult
to attribute it to any single element, with the exception of
seat-belt wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Transport Canada sponsored a study that said ``it cannot be
decisively concluded that changing the posted speed limit will
result in a change in collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, experts say drunken driving is declining, more
cars have air bags and the use of seat belts is rising, although it
still lags Canada's level. George Black, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, added another reason for fewer deaths:
an increase in the number of ambulances with advanced life-support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Black was a highway safety official in
Georgia, he said, ``they put you in a former hearse driven by a
person who liked to drive fast; he took you to the hospital and
hung around waiting to see if you died or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But changes in the limits can have unexpected effects, he said.
In 1974, when the 55 mph limit started, Georgia took some roads
that were posted for 60 miles an hour in daytime and 50 at night,
and converted them to 55 at all times. Most fatal accidents happen
at night, he said, and raising the night-time limit to 55 should
have produced more deaths, but it led to fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason may not have been the limit at all, he said, but
related changes. ``During this period of time, gas lines were out,
gas prices were up and sometimes you had a choice of whether you're
going to buy gas or buy a case of beer and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question is enforcement. A vigorously enforced 65-mile
limit could cut speeds more than an indifferently enforced 55-mile
limit, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, which in May became the 48th state to raise the
speed limit, the penalty for exceeding the 65-mile limit by 5 miles
an hour is $154 _ if you are caught.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long after Americans stopped husbanding gasoline
and keeping the speedometer at 55, policy-makers here clung to a
national maximum speed limit, arguing that it saved lives. But that
limit, an artifact of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that was very
unpopular after the price of gasoline dropped, was eliminated three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Hawaii has since raised its highway speed
limit in what has become an unofficial test of the long-held belief
that speed kills. Three years into the test, the answer is still
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents is about the
same; 41,967 in 1997, 41,907 in 1996 and 41,798 in 1995. When
expressed as the number of deaths per million miles driven, the
death rate is actually down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The data offer a Rohrshach test that is open to interpretation.
A recent opinion article in The Wall Street Journal by a journalist
and muscle-car enthusiast, Eric Peters, suggested that federal
officials liked the 55 mph limit because it gave the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration power over the states. Roads,
Peters supposed, were safer at faster speeds because a higher limit
reduced variations in speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But several traffic safety experts said they knew of no data
that would support Peters' argument. In fact, there is a dearth of
data on how posted limits affect speeds.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a few of the uncertainties of federal
traffic-safety statistics. For example, some statistics measure the
deaths on roads posted at 55 or 60 mph against those posted at 65
or higher. Others measure whether the overall number of miles of
road posted at 65 is growing and whether the overall number of
miles posted at 55 or 60 is declining. The agency does not keep
track of casualty figures for a single stretch of road when its
limit rose to 70 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tried to keep track of a single stretch of road, starting
in January 1996, when highway speeds reverted to a daytime 70 mph
and 60 at night. A study produced by the Texas Transportation
Institute, a state agency, found that by March 1997 there were 9
percent more crashes on rural, multi-lane undivided highways; 33
percent more on rural, two-lane state highways and U.S.-numbered
routes. But the report failed to find a significant increase in
fatalities on these and most Interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The finding runs counter to the predictions of most traffic
engineers, who say crashes at higher speeds are likely to be more
severe. The study's researchers said the sample size might be too
small to capture an increase in deaths, which are less common than
accidents that involve non-fatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA told Congress in a report in February that states that
increased their limits in 1996 recorded about 350 more Interstate
fatalities than before, a jump of about 9 percent. The agency said
the increase in fatalities was smaller than the estimated change
after 1987, when Congress enabled states to raise the limit on
rural Interstates to 65 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have done even better in terms of the overall numbers
had the speed-limit increases not been as pervasive,'' said Philip
Recht, deputy administrator of the NHTSA, referring to the
reduction in fatalities. ``The simple fact that the total number of
fatalities remained the same or even dipped in any year does not
tell you what the impact of the speed limit increases is.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the deadliest roads _ rural two-lane blacktops with
sharp curves and no shoulders _ were not affected by the end of the
national speed limit, in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Another data point, which could yield a variety of
interpretations, comes from Canada. Speed limits there, which are
set by the individual provinces, are essentially unchanged,
although vehicle registrations and drivers have approximately
doubled in 20 years, according to Derek Sweet, director of road
safety at Transport Canada, a government agency. But deaths
declined by about half, he said. Last year they were 3,064, down
from 3,082 in 1996 and 3,347 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex business,'' Sweet said. ``It's really difficult
to attribute it to any single element, with the exception of
seat-belt wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Transport Canada sponsored a study that said ``it cannot be
decisively concluded that changing the posted speed limit will
result in a change in collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, experts say drunken driving is declining, more
cars have air bags and the use of seat belts is rising, although it
still lags Canada's level. George Black, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, added another reason for fewer deaths:
an increase in the number of ambulances with advanced life-support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Black was a highway safety official in
Georgia, he said, ``they put you in a former hearse driven by a
person who liked to drive fast; he took you to the hospital and
hung around waiting to see if you died or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But changes in the limits can have unexpected effects, he said.
In 1974, when the 55 mph limit started, Georgia took some roads
that were posted for 60 miles an hour in daytime and 50 at night,
and converted them to 55 at all times. Most fatal accidents happen
at night, he said, and raising the night-time limit to 55 should
have produced more deaths, but it led to fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason may not have been the limit at all, he said, but
related changes. ``During this period of time, gas lines were out,
gas prices were up and sometimes you had a choice of whether you're
going to buy gas or buy a case of beer and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question is enforcement. A vigorously enforced 65-mile
limit could cut speeds more than an indifferently enforced 55-mile
limit, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, which in May became the 48th state to raise the
speed limit, the penalty for exceeding the 65-mile limit by 5 miles
an hour is $154 _ if you are caught.

<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BELARUS-LUKASHENKO (Minsk, Belarus) _ For four long years,
President Alexander Lukashenko has pursued an unlikely obsession:
to raise tiny Belarus from the shards of the sundered Soviet Union
and remake it into a model socialist state. Lately, it seems he has
succeeded all too well. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-AMERICANS (Baghdad, Iraq) _ Officials in Washington say
that they have no quarrel with the Iraqi people and that the recent
bombing of Iraqi targets are aimed solely at President Saddam
Hussein and his regime. That argument rings hollow to many Iraqis.
Nonetheless, they are remarkably friendly to Americans who venture
here. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-CONDOMS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Out of the depths
of the AIDS epidemic sweeping Africa, an ugly truth is emerging:
Some condom makers have been dumping their substandard wares here
and Africans have been risking their lives on brittle, leaky or
ill-fitting condoms. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-CONGO (Gisenyi, Rwanda) _ Here in Rwanda's turbulent
northwest, there is evidence everywhere of the unfinished business
of the attempt in 1994 to kill every Tutsi in the country. Here too
is the best place to see why Rwanda is fighting so furiously in
Congo, why Rwanda helped spur a rebellion there in August that has
now widened into a war involving at least six outside nations. By
Ian Fisher. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-MENDES (Xapuri, Brazil) _ In his life, Francisco
``Chico'' Mendes, the outspoken defender of rubber tappers and the
Amazon rain forest, cut a larger figure around the globe than he
did around the corner. His murder at the age of 44, 10 years ago
this month, brought even more international attention to his cause.
A decade later, Mendes' Workers' Party has won control of city hall
and of the governor's palace in the state capital. By Diana Jean
Schemo. (With a map.)

   SWISS-WOMAN-PRESIDENT (Bern, Switzerland) _ A profile of Ruth
Dreifuss, Switzerland's new president-elect _ the first woman and
first Jew to occupy the largely ceremonial top post. By Elizabeth
Olson.

   GEN-ZINNI-PROFILE (Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia) _ Gen.
Anthony C. Zinni, a square-jawed, square-shouldered Marine, has
been in the middle of some of the nation's least traditional
military campaigns. As commander in chief of the U.S. Central
Command, Zinni oversees all American forces in a troubled region
that stretches from the Sudan to Pakistan. By Steven Lee Myers.

</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-DEFECTORS (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ Two of the last
three longtime aides of the late Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, have
emerged from their jungle hideouts in the hope of becoming
``ordinary citizens,'' the government announced Saturday. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>

   CANADA-QUEEN (Toronto) _ Canada has its queen and, as some
politicians are discovering, God save those who would try to sever
the country from its monarch. By Anthony DePalma.

   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)

<P>
   Y2K-CODE-WARRIORS _ Tens of thousands of programmers throughout
the world are racing to head off the havoc that could ensue because
many of the computers that underpin today's wired society do not
understand that a year can begin with a number other than 19. By
Barnaby J. Feder and Andrew Pollack. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-SALARIES (Bedford, Mass.) _ The old rule _ that a
strong economy enables a strong military _ has twisted in the
current gale of prosperity. An economy this strong, with
unemployment this low, becomes an impediment to the military's
efforts to recruit and retain soldiers. In Defense Secretary
William Cohen's words, ``It's very hard to compete against a robust
economy such as we have.'' By Carey Goldberg. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   ALPHA-CHRISTIANS (Woonsocket, R.I.) _ A look at the Alpha
course, a novel approach to Christian education that seeks to
introduce newcomers to the Christian faith and to re-establish ties
with wayward parishioners through a 10-week videotaped crash course
in the basics of Christianity. By Tom Verde. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-ROSE-PARADE (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Here in the shaded glades
of live oaks and, yes, December roses, one of California's oldest
civic traditions lives on in these cold nights and crisp mornings.
This is the place where thousands of square feet of chicken wire,
hundreds of gallons of glue and acres of seeds, plants and flowers
somehow become the Tournament of Roses Parade each New Year's Day.
By Todd S. Purdum. (With a photo.)
</P>

   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-REALITIES (Washington) _ As the Clinton administration
finishes drawing up its tax and spending proposals for the next
fiscal year, it is confronting the perplexing but painful reality
that despite mounting federal budget surpluses there is little
money for new programs, and some areas could face cuts. By Richard
W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ When, as now seems likely, William
Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States, opens the
impeachment trial of President Clinton early next year, there will
be no time devoted to jury selection. Nor will the jury be
impartial. By Alison Mitchell. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Rarely has a new Congress had
its future shaped so firmly by its predecessor. With only a few
days left of its old life, the 105th Congress seems to have frozen
the early agenda and tone of the 106th. By Adam Clymer. (With a
photo.)
</P>

<P>
   The words, spoken by a Mississippi congressman during the peak
of the Reagan era, first to a gathering of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and later to a magazine that extols the virtues of the
Confederacy, hardly have the sound of mainstream politics:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of the fundamental principles that
Jefferson Davis believed in are very important to people across the
country, and they apply to the Republican Party,'' the congressman
told Southern Partisan magazine in 1984. He added that the
Republican agenda ``from tax policy, to foreign policy, from
individual rights to neighborhood security are things that
Jefferson Davis and his people believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the impeachment of President Clinton moves inexorably to
the Senate, those statements by Trent Lott, who is now the majority
leader of the Senate, serve as a reminder of a striking link
between the impeachment of Clinton and the only other presidential
impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both played out on a sharp regional fault line. For Johnson, the
divide reflected the aftermath of the Civil War. The issues
surrounding Clinton's statements under oath about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky have nothing to do with North and South, but
they come at a time when conservative Southerners hold virtually
all of the Republican leadership positions in Congress. Southerners
have also been the prime advocates of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The revulsion over Clinton's conduct crosses both sides of the
aisle, and Southerners have no monopoly on the sentiment that if
Clinton lied under oath, he should be removed from office. Still,
these two cases of presidential impeachment, 130 years apart, show
how potent the regional political divide can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when New York Gov. George Pataki decried the
``horrible blunders'' of Republicans in Washington, he was
referring, whether consciously or not, to a congressional
delegation as dominated by angry Southerners as the Republicans of
Johnson's era were dominated by vengeful Northerners intent on
punishing the defeated South through Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised that there's been so little discussion of
how much this whole process has been driven by the Southernization
of the Republican Party,'' said Dan Carter, a historian at Emory
University in Atlanta. ``Maybe it's like the purloined letter: It's
sitting there on the shelf right in front of you, so you don't see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southerner as Johnson was, has his harshest critics
in his native South, where the values that inflame conservatives
are most intense. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found
support for impeachment higher in the South than in any other part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the Congress that ended with the president's impeachment, the
Republicans in the House had a speaker, Newt Gingrich, from
Georgia; a majority leader, Dick Armey, from Texas, and a majority
whip, Tom DeLay, from Texas. The Senate's majority leader, Lott,
won his job by defeating the other senator from Mississippi, Thad
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich stepped down, Bob Livingston of Louisiana was
designated to succeed him. Impeachment's first and most vocal
proponent has been Bob Barr of Georgia, and the possibility of
censure was ruled out as an option by DeLay, who stepped into the
leadership vacuum left by Gingrich's decision to step down.
Livingston has since announced his own resignation after
acknowledging extramarital infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan, began his tenure
amid furious controversy when it was revealed that Sens. Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina met with David Sentelle
of North Carolina, Helms' protege and the conservative judge who
heads the appellate panel that appointed Starr, before Starr was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Southern Republican who has played a major role in
the House has been Henry Hyde of Ohio, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee. But Hyde has always voted like a Southerner,
with a 100 percent rating by the Christian Coalition and a
legislative career most identified with his support of a ban on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, though, tend to see more differences than
similarities between the two impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   Carter of Emory notes that Johnson's impeachment revolved around
profound national issues, with House Republicans bitterly opposing
the president's lenient approach to the South's re-entry to the
Union and his relative indifference to the rights of 3.5 million
newly emancipated blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate perjury as an issue,'' Carter said,
``but I think you have to keep your eye on the triviality of the
issues here compared to those of 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian, said
both efforts grew out of deeply held animus toward the president
with impeachment a vehicle for much broader divisions. But
Johnson's impeachment reflected profound political differences, he
said. Clinton has largely adopted many of the conservative
positions of those who detest him, Foner said. And he noted that
the regional divide now is less North and South and more the
burgeoning suburbs of the South and West versus the older areas of
the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a more revealing comparison than Johnson's
impeachment was the Democratic Party of the 1850s. ``It became so
totally dominated by Southerners, it led the South to disaster,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a risk for Republicans now as they fly in the
face of public opinion is something many politicians are pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners revel in the South's new-found Republicanism.
One T-shirt shows the Confederate battle flag in the form of a
Republican elephant with the words ``Lincoln's Worst Nightmare!''
The back features the flags of the Southern states and the words
``A States Rights Republican Majority From Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans worry about appearing too Southern. Some
see the likely election of Dennis Hastert of Illinois as the next
speaker as an attempt, at least in part, to provide more balance
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, regional passions need not be faulty ones. Historians
generally think that impeaching Johnson may have been a mistake,
but the so-called radical Republicans were correct in their outrage
over his policies. Today's Republicans may be proved right for
their outrage toward Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the current cast of Southern Republicans can lead
the GOP to long-term majority status is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can sell the Republicans as the party of
Jefferson Davis and have a viable national party,'' said Merle
Black, an Emory political scientist.

Republicans in the House had a speaker, Newt Gingrich, from
Georgia; a majority leader, Dick Armey, from Texas, and a majority
whip, Tom DeLay, from Texas. The Senate's majority leader, Lott,
won his job by defeating the other senator from Mississippi, Thad
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich stepped down, Bob Livingston of Louisiana was
designated to succeed him. Impeachment's first and most vocal
proponent has been Bob Barr of Georgia, and the possibility of
censure was ruled out as an option by DeLay, who stepped into the
leadership vacuum left by Gingrich's decision to step down.
Livingston has since announced his own resignation after
acknowledging extramarital infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan, began his tenure
amid furious controversy when it was revealed that Sens. Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina met with David Sentelle
of North Carolina, Helms' protege and the conservative judge who
heads the appellate panel that appointed Starr, before Starr was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Southern Republican who has played a major role in
the House has been Henry Hyde of Ohio, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee. But Hyde has always voted like a Southerner,
with a 100 percent rating by the Christian Coalition and a
legislative career most identified with his support of a ban on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, though, tend to see more differences than
similarities between the two impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   Carter of Emory notes that Johnson's impeachment revolved around
profound national issues, with House Republicans bitterly opposing
the president's lenient approach to the South's re-entry to the
Union and his relative indifference to the rights of 3.5 million
newly emancipated blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate perjury as an issue,'' Carter said,
``but I think you have to keep your eye on the triviality of the
issues here compared to those of 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian, said
both efforts grew out of deeply held animus toward the president
with impeachment a vehicle for much broader divisions. But
Johnson's impeachment reflected profound political differences, he
said. Clinton has largely adopted many of the conservative
positions of those who detest him, Foner said. And he noted that
the regional divide now is less North and South and more the
burgeoning suburbs of the South and West versus the older areas of
the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a more revealing comparison than Johnson's
impeachment was the Democratic Party of the 1850s. ``It became so
totally dominated by Southerners, it led the South to disaster,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a risk for Republicans now as they fly in the
face of public opinion is something many politicians are pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners revel in the South's new-found Republicanism.
One T-shirt shows the Confederate battle flag in the form of a
Republican elephant with the words ``Lincoln's Worst Nightmare!''
The back features the flags of the Southern states and the words
``A States Rights Republican Majority From Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans worry about appearing too Southern. Some
see the likely election of Dennis Hastert of Illinois as the next
speaker as an attempt, at least in part, to provide more balance
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, regional passions need not be faulty ones. Historians
generally think that impeaching Johnson may have been a mistake,
but the so-called radical Republicans were correct in their outrage
over his policies. Today's Republicans may be proved right for
their outrage toward Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the current cast of Southern Republicans can lead
the GOP to long-term majority status is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can sell the Republicans as the party of
Jefferson Davis and have a viable national party,'' said Merle
Black, an Emory political scientist.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The earliest confirmed case of
infection with HIV-1, the virus that causes most AIDS cases around
the world, is in a blood sample taken from an African man in 1959,
in what was then the Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, DNA analysts at the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York, comparing that sample with others and
calculating mutation rates, estimated that the killer virus came
into existence sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could
the virus, which is now threatening to kill a quarter of some
African countries, have gone virtually unnoticed for 20 years _ and
then emerged in America, decimating gay men and hemophiliacs in the
1980s and starting on a ruthless march of conquest around the
world?
</P>
<P>
   Was it a failure of medical detection? Racist indifference to
Africa by the West? Something in the rapidly mutating virus itself?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: No one knows for sure. But there are pretty
good theories.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the epidemic is a jigsaw puzzle of helpful and
unhelpful facts, disproven former ``facts'' and a lot of notions,
both scientific and paranoid. Each new fact sweeps big chunks of
the puzzle onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, it's probably the most geopolitically
touchy disease since porphyria drove England's 18th-century kings
mad. It makes the bubonic plague look politically correct. Everyone
hates rats and fleas, but AIDS can't be discussed without talking
about matters at the core of human nature, desire or habit: sex,
blood, homosexuality, heroin-shooting, walking skeletons, brain
viruses, even monkey-eating.
</P>
<P>
   The most paranoid theory _ that the disease was created in a
U.S. Army germ warfare lab built in Maryland in 1977 _ was exposed
as KGB propaganda first published in 1985. This latest DNA
analysis, performed last February, demonstrates that the disease
long predates the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have long thought that the HIV virus came from
African monkeys. Several varieties of SIV (simian immunodeficiency
virus) have existed harmlessly, probably for thousands of years, in
green monkeys, mangabeys and baboons, but not in Asian or South
American monkeys. Monkeys are eaten in the central African rain
forest, and raw monkey brain is said to be a delicacy in parts of
Zaire, just as it is in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that the virus jumped to humans who had eaten
or butchered monkeys, or had been bitten by monkeys. That could
have happened any time _ or many times _ in the last 10,000 years.
It probably happened at least three times, because HIV-2, the
weaker strain prevalent in Guinea-Bissau, is closely related to the
SIV in local mangabeys. The same is true for HIV-O, a rare strain
found in Cameroon. Neither is genetically close to HIV-1, the
virulent strain that has been killing people from central Africa to
San Francisco to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   But HIV-1 didn't necessarily jump to humans as a killer. Some
scientists believe a weak early form was caught by European
colonists as early as 1900, and one scientist blames it for an
outbreak of PCP pneumonia, which is associated with AIDS, in
Danzig, Germany, in 1939. Others are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, probably west of Lake Victoria, and sometime,
possibly in the 1940s, HIV-1 mutated inside a human host into an
attacker of T-cells and rapid destroyer of immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   It must have spread very slowly at first, in rural areas. It
certainly was not killing large numbers of Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the disease had been widespread in the 1950s and 1960s,
there were enough experienced clinicians in Africa to have noticed
something like that going on,'' said Dr. Anne Buve, an
epidemiologist with the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Some time in the 1960s or 1970s, said Dr. Peter Piot, a former
researcher in Zaire who is now the executive director of UNAIDS in
Geneva, the virus probably moved out of Zaire's rural areas to the
cities, and then spread from the continent.
</P>
<P>
   It may have gone to Haiti with the French-speaking Haitians who
filled up Zaire's civil service after the Belgians fled in 1960. It
may have gone straight to America, perhaps with the Peace Corps. It
may have gone to Cuba with soldiers returning from northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it ultimately came to public attention because it
somehow got into a population vastly different from central
Africa's. The gay communities in San Francisco and New York were
small and insular. Anal sex and promiscuity sped the virus through
them. Gay Americans were also well educated, well served by doctors
and well organized in a civil rights struggle. When mysterious
deaths began to hit, they noticed immediately and shouted loudly.
Within five years of the late 1970s, when fears focused on rumors
of ``gay cancer,'' the disease had a name and its virus had been
found. Books and TV movies followed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Africa, AIDS was making steady progress, but with
less public attention. As early as 1981, doctors in Paris and
Brussels diagnosed it among wealthy Zaireans treated in Europe. By
1983, doctors from the Institute for Tropical Medicine and the
Centers for Disease Control were hunting it in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As Mirko Grmek's ``History of AIDS'' (Princeton University
Press, 1990) describes a 1985 conference on African AIDS, only a
few cases had been confirmed in Africa. ``Belgian and French
physicians attending the meeting insisted a true epidemic was under
way,'' Grmek wrote. ``The representatives of affected countries
took offense and insisted on denying the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another quirk: most of the first hard-hit countries were
Francophone, to which the British and U.S. press pay less
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, more facts turned up. A Danish surgeon who died in 1977,
apparently of AIDS, had worked in rural Zaire from 1972 to 1975. An
increase in Kaposi's sarcoma dating to mid-century was recalled.
More aggressive Kaposi's hit Zambia and Uganda in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers traveled through remote western Uganda in 1985
to study ``slim disease,'' which appeared in the early 1980s, they
brought new AIDS-test kits, and all 29 ``slim'' victims proved
HIV-positive. A 1987 study by Piot of 454 blood samples frozen
after a 1976 Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire found five HIV-positive
ones.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS migrated out along truck routes, hitting hardest in border
towns where truckers wait for days to clear customs. It was also
still mutating; _ there are now 10 subgroups of HIV-1, all fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new question is stumping scientists: Why is AIDS hitting
eastern and southern Africa so much harder than it did the area
where it originated? Among pregnant women visiting clinics in
Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, and nearby Yaounde, Cameroon,
infection rates reached a plateau that was below 10 percent. But in
eastern and southern African cities from Kampala, Uganda, to
Richard's Bay, South Africa, they have hit 30 percent and are still
rising.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why. The virus may have mutated. Southern Africans
may have less resistant genes. There may be something in sexual
habits, venereal disease rates, circumcision practices.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out exactly where it all started, some scientists say,
is less important. ``People have become pretty pragmatic,'' Buve
said. ``They are asking, `Do we need to know? Let's rather look at
the future.' ''

SPORTS COLUMN: POSTCARDS FROM 1998  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a year. No space for a wordy introduction. Just look at the
places a wandering columnist visited in 1998:
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF., Jan. 1. After growing up in chilly New York
and listening to the Rose Bowl on the radio, I finally get to cover
one. Even get caught in traffic from the parade. After the glorious
sun goes down, Michigan holds off Washington State for an eventual
share of the unofficial national title.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 10. Michelle Kwan performs the skate of her
life, winning the national title over Tara Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, &UR;  &LR; Jan. 18. European skill players
abound as the National Hockey League holds its All-Star Game,
preparing for the Winter Games next month.
</P>
<P>
   NAGANO, JAPAN, Feb. 7. People attend opening ceremonies
bareheaded, wearing light jackets, in hazy sunshine. Japan and the
International Olympic Committee have defied Mother Nature by
holding Winter Games closer to the Equator than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   NAGANO, JAPAN, Feb. 13. Ross Rebagliati of Canada gets to keep
his gold medal for snowboarding after admitting he may indeed have
inhaled marijuana _ but only secondary smoke months earlier at a
party.
</P>
<P>
   NAGANO, JAPAN, Feb. 13. It is no disgrace for the United States
to lose to Sweden in the opener of the first mostly professional
men's hockey tournament in Olympic history. What will be a disgrace
are the trashed dorms and grim silence from the Americans. American
women will win their gold, and behave maturely.
</P>
<P>
   HAKUBA, JAPAN, Feb. 14. On a dismal, rainy day straight out of
``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' two Norwegians in red suits
materialize from the mist, as Thomas Alsgaard passes medal king
Bjorn Dahlie in the stretch in the 15-kilometer cross-country race.
</P>
<P>
   NAGANO, JAPAN, Feb. 20. Tara Lipinski made an adult decision at
15: She would live in the athletes' village, she would march in the
opening parade, she would have a blast. Tonight she skates
exuberantly, winning the gold medal over a serene but tentative
Michelle Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   NAGANO, JAPAN, Feb. 20. Taka Fukushima, the Buddhist priest at
the historic Zenkoji temple, suggests tearing down the expensive
buildings now that the Winter Games are over. The games are a
modified success because of soupy weather and a sense that the
Winter Games have grown too big.
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO, Feb. 23. The bullet train whisks us south from Almost
Heaven, West Nagano, into the big city, in spring weather. My old
neighbors from Long Island, the Usuzakas, take me for an exquisite
dinner and good talk, and I make a pledge to come back soon.
</P>
<P>
   QUEENS, N.Y., March 31. Baseball tempts Mother Nature by opening
earlier than ever before, but the temperature is 87 degrees for the
Mets' opener. Is this an omen that baseball will luck out this
season?
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND, CALIF., April 5. The Yankees finally win after losing
their first three. Back home in Knee-Jerk City, the tabloids are
already picking Joe Torre's successor.
</P>
<P>
   BRONX, N.Y., April 14. No game today because a beam fell in
empty Yankee Stadium yesterday. Reports of a beefy perpetrator in
blue blazer and gray slacks are unconfirmed.
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, KY., May 2. Marginalized by lotteries and the
gerontological makeup of its fan base, racing derives much of its
vestigial buzz from Derby Day. Real Quiet bursts to the front and
Bob Baffert shouts his nickname, ``The Fish! The Fish!''
</P>
<P>
   BRONX, N.Y., May 17. David Wells pitches the second perfect game
ever by a Yankee. By some weird circumstance, Wells and Don Larsen
both went to Point Loma High in San Diego. ``He'll think about it
every day of his life, just like I do,'' Larsen predicts from
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   QUEENS, N.Y., May 23. Even millionaire free agents can suffer
shock. His eyes baffled, Mike Piazza arrives at Shea Stadium,
joining his third club in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ST.-JEAN D'ARDIERES, FRANCE, &UR;  &LR; June 5. In the vineyards, the
Beaujolais grapes are growing, but here in the rented chateau,
there is nothing but sour whine as the American soccer team arrives
for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS, June 6. Wearing a black tennis outfit to honor her
father, who died on May 14, Monica Seles runs out of gas after a
gallant run, losing to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the French final.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS, June 15. Germany performs a professional mugging in the
first minutes, and commits a 2-0 massacre of the United States in
the Americans' World Cup opener.
</P>
<P>
   LYONS, FRANCE, &UR;  &LR; June 21. Affluent Iranian exiles wear T-shirts
taunting the current government, then gleefully celebrate a 2-1
victory over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NANTES, FRANCE, June 25. The United States is put out of its
misery, 1-0, by powerful Yugoslavia.
</P>

<P>
   President Clinton's predicament with Iraq is painfully familiar
to anyone who was ever a kid and tried the line, ``If you don't
stop that, I'm gonna hit you.'' Ideally, the adversary backed down.
But sometimes he didn't, leaving you no choice but to smack him.
And then, if he was still at it, you had a problem. Either you went
at him again, this time for keeps, or you backed down.
</P>
<P>
   These are games Middle Eastern leaders know exceedingly well,
and play with devilish effect.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that is not how the administration is painting its
predicament in the wake of the 70-hour bombing of Saddam Hussein's
Iraq. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger declared outright victory: ``For
Saddam, 1998 was the year to break out of the box he has been in,
the year to end containment. He has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's logic was that the policy of containment rested on four
pillars: economic sanctions, United Nations inspections, the
credible use of force and ``diplomacy to sustain an international
consensus in pursuit of this goal.'' When Saddam tried to shake one
pillar, the inspection system, he effectively challenged them all.
So if the United States failed to respond with force, ``there would
be no deterrence against future aggression, because the threat of
force would no longer be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berger declared, Saddam had been shown he could not shake
off containment. Therefore, the United States had achieved its
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Berger marshaled considerable arguments in support of this
contention, from a list of damage done by the bombing, to the
interesting claim that international sanctions have benefited the
Iraqi people, because under the policy of allowing Iraq to trade
oil directly for food, the people were getting food, and not tanks,
for their oil.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these arguments is that the threat of force _
like threatening to smack a pesky kid, or building a nuclear
deterrent _ works best so long as it remains a threat. If used, it
had best be used decisively, or the pest may prove far harder to
dislodge the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of damage to Saddam's military and civil
structures is not clear yet, and it is possible that the dictator
is reeling from a lucky punch, or that his opponents now see more
clearly the advantages of an Iraq without Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But the information from Washington and Baghdad suggests that
Saddam is still firmly in place. As a result, two other pillars of
the U.S. containment policy _ U.N. inspections and international
consensus _ are wobbling. Saddam has left no doubt that he will not
let U.N. arms inspectors back in easily, while the growing
resistance from Russia, China and, to a lesser degree, France will
make it harder for America to sustain the full range of economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we showed that we were prepared to use force, but we
didn't show that we figured out how to use force as part of a
larger strategy,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy
studies at the Brookings Institution. ``We haven't lost sanctions,
but the 70 hours of strikes clearly will lead to a further erosion
of support for sanctions. I think we can keep the bulk of sanctions
_ the ban on military imports, international control on revenues _
but increasingly Iraq can export whatever it wants, and import much
of what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we add it up, by using force without apparent purpose,
it's hard to argue that the U.S. has gained over the last two
weeks. We've lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake, Haass argued, was not in the use of force, in which
the United States had no choice, but in trying to play it safe in
choosing a strike limited in time and scope. The short-term
advantage was that by defining a limited goal, in this case
punishment, the administration was certain of success. The very
fact of launching a strike achieved the stated goal.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage is that the United States is now left with a
new range of problems, all of them unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam keeps the door closed to inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission, or Unscom, the United States will either have
to agree to a different and less intrusive form of inspections, or
it will have to bash Saddam again. Weakening Unscom would almost
certainly prompt Saddam to test his new limits. If the United
States does opt for force, the attack is certain to be even less
popular than the last one, and Washington will be under heavy
pressure to set more ambitious goals _ a palpable blow to Iraq's
arms program, or a firm agreement from Saddam to allow
unconditional inspections, or his fall.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Russia, China and France, supported by much of the Third
World, would be likely to generate pressure at the U.N. Security
Council for a loosening of sanctions, which Washington is not
likely to withstand. That, in turn, would tempt Saddam to seek ways
of creating more friction in the crumbling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Saddam also narrows his options every time he
challenges the United States. The fact that he did not immediately
take reporters to sites of U.S. bomb attacks suggest they must have
been effective. And if Unscom is not allowed to inspect suspicious
sites, the United States will have more incentive, and
justification, to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   As Berger put it, Saddam ``has learned that what cannot be
inspected can, in many cases, be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second consequence of the raids is that the United States has
finally begun talking openly of ousting Saddam. In the past, the
common wisdom was that toppling him in the absence of a viable
opposition would create a dangerous power vacuum in a pivotal part
of the Middle East, in which ethnic and religious factions and
neighboring states would inevitably fall at each others' throats.
But as Saddam resists every attempt to curb his ambitions,
overthrowing him may come to be seen as the lesser evil.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Berger conceded that air attacks weren't enough
to dislodge Saddam, and that the United States was not now prepared
to pay the high cost of the required military operation d, nor of
the occupation that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that Saddam can foment discord in the Security
Council and anti-U.S. sentiments in the Arab world has not meant
that he is making new friends or allies. Quite the contrary: All
the disputes over Saddam have been about how to make him behave,
not about the fact of his misbehavior, and the consensus among
experts on the Middle East is that leaders the world over, from
Europe to the Middle East, would now breathe a deep sigh of relief
if he were toppled.
</P>
<P>
   So the standoff continues, with the latest clash generating only
more unknowns. As a dictator, Saddam probably measures success in
terms of the confrontations he has withstood and the democratic
leaders he has outlasted.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he finds it heartening at times to tick off the names
and fates of Western leaders who have challenged him: George Bush,
defeated. Margaret Thatcher, defeated. Francois Mitterrand, dead.
Bill Clinton, impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States can also find solace in precedent. ``We
know from experience that when people struggling for freedom gain
the moral and material support of the American people, they usually
prevail in the end,'' Berger declared. ``Change will come to Iraq,
at a time and in a manner that we can influence but not predict.''

 TEAMS WITHOUT A FAINTEST CHANCE NOT EXACTLY A '90s FAD   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each astonishing signing by a high-revenue club this off
season, the lament has grown louder: the day the 1999 season begins
half, if not more than half, the teams will not have a chance to
win a spot in next October's playoffs. Gene Orza wonders when that
fact of major league life has not existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was it not true?'' asked the players association's No. 2
official.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory check supports Orza's point. Baseball history has
been filled with teams that didn't have a chance from the opening
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-year period from 1934 through 1968, the franchise now
known as the Oakland Athletics finished in the second division, the
lower half of the league standings, 33 times. The Washington
Senators (later the Minnesota Twins) finished in the second
division 24 times in a 28-year period from 1934 through 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 59 years of the franchise now known as the
Baltimore Orioles, the team finished in the second division 47
times. It finished first once, as the St. Louis Browns in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs played for 20 successive seasons, 1947 through
1966, without emerging from the second division. The Philadelphia
Phillies wound up in the lower half of the standings 45 times in
the 56 seasons from 1918 through 1973.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, the Yankees won 22 pennants in
29 years, from 1936 through 1964, and 29 pennants in 44 seasons,
from 1921 through 1964. In a shorter period, a 10-year stretch from
1947 through 1956, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished first six times.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals won nine pennants and finished in the
first division nine other times in the 21-season stretch from 1926
through 1946. In each of the next three years they finished second.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' dominance prompted their opponents to vote for the
implementation of the draft of amateur players, beginning in 1966,
but these days nonplaying baseball people view the predraft times
as the good old days. Salaries in those times were not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The players association, not unexpectedly, views recent
developments differently from Major League Baseball officials,
owners and general managers.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1976, Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, decried
the advent of free agency, warning that it would wreck competitive
balance. The fact that no team repeated as World Series champion
from 1978 until 1993 presumably did not alter Kuhn's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Four commissioners later, the people on the management side of
the competitive fence say growing payroll disparity is wrecking
competitive balance. Bud Selig, the current commissioner, has made
the issue his No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the players' representatives become uncomfortable when
owners start mentioning competitive balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive balance does not deserve to be uttered with a view
toward what it really means,'' Orza said. ``Competitive balance is
a code for restraining payroll levels. That's what it means
historically. They've been using that term for the last 20 years.
They don't mean competitive balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials and owners point to the 1998 experience to support
what they say they mean. None of the 17 teams with payrolls under
$48 million reached the playoffs. Only two of those teams, St.
Louis and Toronto, had winning records. Of the 13 teams above that
payroll plateau, only Baltimore had a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   And they see the trend becoming more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are payrolls going up, but they're also going down,''
Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's vice president for baseball
operations, warned last month. ``We lose sight of the fact that
there are some clubs that are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins last week became a case for Alderson's
point. Proclaiming they could not compete in the current economy,
the Twins said they would slash their payroll from a season-ending
$24.5 million to a figure between $10 million and $15 million. The
Montreal Expos had last season's lowest payroll, $8,317,500.
</P>
<P>
   Orza said no one should be surprised that payroll disparity
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who bought into a system that says New York and Los Angeles
shouldn't spend more than Montreal?'' he asked. ``This notion that
the goal of baseball should be to create a balance by which all the
teams, no matter what their population base, what fan support they
have, however well marketed and run they are, should have an equal
chance to win the World Series isn't realistic. It's just the way
it is. There always will be disparities.''
</P>
<P>
   When owners buy teams, he added, they understand the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't say at owners meetings, `Because I have only
400,000 people available for local TV and you have 7 million, I'm
going to want your money,''' Orza said. ``They say, `Let me in and
I'll compete with you and beat your brains out.' Then when they
don't win, they say: `It's not because I run a bad franchise or
made mistakes; it's the other guy has an unfair edge over me
because I'm in Montreal and they're in New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   The owners will continue to lament payroll disparity, but they
obviously should not expect a sympathetic ear from the players
association.

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A POX ON SEVERAL HOUSES
</P>
<P>
   The toughness that players show in games and that agents display
in contract negotiations evidently does not carry over to verbal
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Houston Astros recently had the audacity to
make some unflattering comments about the bargaining position of
Roger Clemens and his agent, Randy Hendricks, and Clemens and
Hendricks reacted as if they were going to take their bat and ball
and go home. Maybe age has thinned their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Clemens business has become a fiasco, for the Astros,
for the Toronto Blue Jays, for the five-time Cy Young award winner,
for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Blue Jays gave Clemens a double-edged sword by
agreeing to let him have the right to not only request a trade but
also veto a trade. He could dictate where the Blue Jays could trade
him while they were under the pressure of having to trade him if he
so wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Second, once Clemens asked to be traded, the Astros, his
hometown team, became the most likely team to get him. The only
trouble was that the Astros, in this instance, started to resemble
the Yankees: one hand, in this case Gerry Hunsicker, the general
manager, apparently didn't know what the other hand, Drayton McLane
Jr., the owner, was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker publicly expressed outrage over the terms Clemens
sought for a revised contract before he would approve a trade, only
to have McLane, who had been negotiating with Hendricks, apologize
to Clemens and Hendricks for Hunsicker's remarks. It's always good
for organizational unity when the owner panders to a player instead
of supporting his general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Clemens looks bad because of his effort to get an
additional $27.4 million for one year _ a $15 million salary for an
added third year, the rest as a signing bonus divided evenly over
the three years of the contract. It has prompted people to believe,
correctly or not, that his trade request had more to do with money
than with his desire to play with a contender or closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Major League Baseball looks bad because its president
and chief operating officer, Paul Beeston, was the Blue Jays'
president last winter who held out Toronto's deal-clinching carrot
to Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston now faces a hefty fine for not submitting the agreement
with Clemens' contract. Beeston, an upstanding and outstanding
official, has been forthright internally about his role and will
accept his punishment. But it is embarrassing for him and for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, the Blue Jays have compounded the matter by ignoring
established guidelines and allowing Clemens and his agent to speak
with other clubs before a trade was completed. Gord Ash, the Blue
Jays' general manager, has acknowledged that he did not ``follow
the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN'S BIG COUP
</P>
<P>
   Did the Los Angeles Dodgers really give Kevin Brown a seven-year
contract for $105 million? Information circulating in the upper
echelon of baseball has it that the next best offer Brown had was
$65 million for five years from the Colorado Rockies, even though
Scott Boras, the pitcher's agent, may say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out to secure the richest contract in baseball
history, Boras made much of Brown's effort in helping two different
teams reach the World Series in successive seasons. But he omitted
Brown's contribution in the World Series itself. In four starts for
Florida and San Diego, Brown had a 0-3 record _ his teams lost all
four games _ and a 6.04 earned run average, allowing 40 base
runners in 251/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   USING THE YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Belle was a free agent last month, he was talking
seriously with the Yankees, whose presence in a bidding war is
always beneficial to a player. How does Belle really feel about
playing for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   In the contract he signed with Baltimore, he was given a
complete no-trade provision for the first three years, and for the
last two years he was able to list eight teams he can be traded to:
Anaheim, Arizona, Atlanta, Colorado, San Diego, Seattle, St. Louis
and Texas. Somehow he left out the Yankees.

UNKNOWN CHAMPIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Here's to the heroes, those who move mountains. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the winners all of us can be.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Frank Sinatra wasn't crooning about the bathtub racing,
barrel jumping and Korfball champions of the world when he sang
``Winners.'' The fact remains that for every Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa, there are dozens of sports heroes whose names aren't quite
big enough for the sports pages, who never get a minute on
television or radio, whose talents will not command
multimillion-dollar contracts.
</P>
<P>
   So here's to those winners, those you probably haven't heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to David Cullinan, a 28-year-old professional mountain
biker who has, luckily, the heart of a champion. The world downhill
champion in 1992, Cullinan nearly died in 1993 when he crashed and
suffered a torn aorta.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing three open-heart surgeries over the next two
years, Cullinan began racing full time again in 1997. This past
year, he was among the top-ranked mountain bikers in the world, and
was crowned champion at several national and world cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling down is part of the job,'' Cullinan said.
``Unfortunately, I just happened to fall on the right spot, or
maybe the wrong spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Tony Roventini, who last month bowled a perfect 900
series. Bowling officials estimate that more than 10 billion
official three-game series have been bowled in the past century,
and the 28-year-old Roventini, a model engineer for a construction
company in Greendale, Wis., was just the second to bowl 900.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bowler's dream,'' Roventini said. ``But I never
thought it would happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Lynda Norry, who became the first amateur bowler in
eight years to win the Women's International Bowling Congress,
which is equivalent to an amateur tennis player winning the United
States Open.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the McCary clan. Patrick, 58, his wife, Dianne, 55,
and their two children, 29-year-old Kristen and 27-year-old
Michael, became the first family of four to compete in and finish
the Ironman Triathlon world championship in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Joe Zemaitis, an 18-year-old college freshman from
Scottsdale, Ariz., who was the youngest competitor at the Ironman
this year, setting a world record for his age by swimming 2.4
miles, cycling 112 miles and running 26.2 miles in 9 hours 57
minutes 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the softballer Kaci Clark, who helped the Orlando
Wahoos capture the championship of the Women's Pro Softball League
and was named the 1998 pitcher of the year. After a car accident in
1992 did severe damage to the right-hander's pitching arm, doctors
said she would never pitch again. This past year she won 23 games,
including seven shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Brian Foster, the Michael Jordan of BMX racing, whose
bike-riding skills earn him more than $100,000 per year. Foster,
who also has his own line of Schwinn bikes and sneakers, had a
colossal 1998 campaign capped off with a gold-medal performance at
the X Games, where he won the dirt jumping championship.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the brothers Hughes, the 1998 United States Croquet
Association national champions. Jim, who is 69 and lives in Kennett
Square, Pa., is a member of the Croquet Hall of Fame. His kid
brother, Tom, is 66 and lives in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good time playing together,'' said Jim, ``but
things do get a little heated at times _ hey, we're brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the ultra-marathoner Ann Trason of Kensington, Calif.,
who has won the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run a whopping 10
straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the 42-year-old fisherman Steve Rajeff of Battle
Ground, Wash., who won 21 straight all-distance, all-accuracy and
all-around casting titles from 1972-93, and is currently working on
a four-year streak in those events.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the Canadian barrel jumping champions Patrick and
Sylvain Leclerc, two brothers from St. Bruno, Quebec, who have
spent the better part of the last decade searching for potential
competitors, but have found no one who comes close to matching
their spectacular skating and leaping skills.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, here's to a champion from Nova Scotia, who, like it
or not, is out of a job when the new year rolls in. Stacey's Echo,
a 14-year-old pacer who has his own local fan club in his hometown
of Sidney Mines, has won 100 of his 600 starts on the harness
racing circuit, plus 92 seconds and 76 third-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   At his age, Stacey's Echo is facing mandatory retirement, so
here's hoping he was smart of enough to put away some of that
$45,751 of career earnings now that a steady paycheck is no longer
coming to the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to those champions, and so many more you probably haven't
heard of. &QL;

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf are vaccinated against deadly
germs. So are FBI agents who are probing a growing number of
biological incidents. So are some White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Protections against living weapons are new to the military and
security of the United States, and they raise troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this prudence or paranoia? Should everyone be vaccinated? How
real is the threat? Aren't deadly germs nearly impossible for
attackers to use without hurting themselves? Isn't this threat just
another bogeyman, like so many before?
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons, though around for centuries, have played no
significant role in modern warfare and terrorism. Skeptics point to
this history and say that biological strikes of any consequence are
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington from President Clinton on down are
taking the issue very seriously, with thousands of people and
billions of dollars in motion to address the germ threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, this is going to hurt us,'' said Robert Blitzer,
who recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic
terrorism. ``There's no question in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a yearlong inquiry by The New York Times revealed
trends that suggest the era of germ tranquility may indeed be
ending:
</P>
<P>
   _ Uprooted weapon scientists from Iraq, Russia and South Africa
are hunting for new jobs and spreading germ secrets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Radical states with reputations for supporting terror, such as
Iran and Libya, are seeking germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, are increasingly
interested in pestilential germs. Some boast openly of being able
to kill foes with deadly plagues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, officials in Washington stress that they know of no
imminent danger, even while acknowledging the limitations of
intelligence. Most agree that the threat, while low, is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The defenses that Washington is quietly erecting, officials say,
are akin to the insurance that homeowners take out against floods
and earthquakes. The odds may be small, this argument goes, but
precautions are warranted since conditions are changing and damage
could be great.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to
1995, is among the former officials who are worried. Germ
terrorism, he said in an interview, is ``the single most dangerous
threat to our national security in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons can be hard to make and use, contrary to myth and
claim. It took the United States decades to master the art before
renouncing such arms in 1969. In the early 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo, a
Japanese cult, launched at least nine germ attacks in Tokyo that
were meant to kill millions. But the strikes produced no known
injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous to the attacker as well as the attacked if successful,
germ weapons are considered most practical when used far from the
aggressor's homeland; intervening land and sea establish what
amounts to a quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The main appeal of such weapons is that they are incredibly
cheap compared to chemical and atomic arms. Yet pound for pound,
germ weapons rival nuclear ones for maiming and killing, and some
biological agents are considered superior in that regard; in theory
they can annihilate many millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they surpass their nuclear kin as an instrument of
fright and disruption: Once sown, infections can spread
unpredictably, since they are alive. Experts especially worry about
smallpox, which is highly contagious and seen as particularly
dangerous since few people are now immunized against its ravages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the threat is low is not to minimize its potential,''
said Neil Gallagher, assistant director for national security at
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the secrets of germ warfare are increasingly up for grabs
as weapon scientists from countries that made biological arsenals
hunt for new jobs. The nomads are from Iraq (starting in 1991 after
Persian Gulf war), Russia (starting in 1992 after the Soviet
collapse) and South Africa (starting in 1994 as apartheid fell
apart). Russia alone has many thousands of former germ warriors
increasingly cold, poor and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate science also heightens the risk. The global war
against infectious disease has produced more than 1,500 germ banks
that tend to trade freely in deadly microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Future strides could make matters even worse. Experts agree that
research into the genetic foundations of life, an approach that
promises to cure many diseases, might, in evil hands, one day
produce weapons that work against only certain races or ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult but not impossible,'' said Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises Washington on
germ warfare. More unsettling, he added, is that traditional
killers seem to be a growing danger right now; he called them ``a
monster in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least 17 nations are suspected of having or trying to
acquire germ weapons. Perhaps they want to deter foes. The wild
card is that some (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria) are
also considered architects of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Libya worked hard to join the germ club. In 1994, it sought to
hire scientists fleeing South Africa's crumbling program, including
its head, Dr. Wouter Basson. That move, officials say, was foiled
by diplomatic pressure from Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   However, Libya may have succeeded in hiring (or perhaps hiding
and employing for Baghdad) Dr. Amir Medidi, a top scientist of
Iraq's germ effort, U.N. inspectors revealed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists themselves seem increasingly drawn to germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire known for his
bitter hatred of America, is investigating them, U.S. officials
say. Whether his work has resulted in secret laboratories or usable
arms, no one in Washington seems to know or is willing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Asad al-Tamimi, an Islamic radical, has been vocal. Early
this year Al-Balad, a Jordanian newspaper, quoted him as saying
that ``jihad'' had at last discovered how to win the holy war _
lethal germs.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, growing interest abroad is shared by domestic
radicals and militia groups at home. Catalogs catering to them
carry ads for such books as ``Guide to Germ Warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohioan with a history of hate-group
affiliations, was arrested in 1995 for having bought plague
bacteria from a germ bank under false pretenses. A registered
microbiologist, he now says the microbes were strictly for
defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups all over the world after this kind of
stuff,'' Harris said, his blue eyes icy. ``You're not going to stop
germ warfare. The only thing to do is defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts say knowing the truth is hard. Spies and
satellites are only marginally helpful for ferreting out biological
gear as small as kitchen cookware that is easy to hide and whose
purpose can be peaceful (unlike the nuclear arms, bombers, ships,
missiles and factories that dominated the Cold War). Even hundreds
of arms inspectors in Iraq, who probed that nation for seven years,
ended up with as many questions as answers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the attention focused on germ warfare has already
helped give rise to germ hoaxes, and experts worry that serious
concern might give way to complacency. This year, the FBI is
fighting a wave of false anthrax threats in letters mailed to
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials note that Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, mastermind of
the 1993 New York World Trade Center blast, which killed six people
and injured more than 1,000, claimed that his goal was to have one
tower fall into the other and kill a quarter million people _ more
than died in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   A top former official disclosed that Yousef, when arrested in
1995, was found to have been studying not only chemical but
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John Gannon, chairman of the National Intelligence Council of
the CIA, last month told a Stanford University meeting that the
danger of germ and chemical devastation is rising.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that terrorists and foes with such weapons are growing
in number and that the increasingly lethal agents they are
developing ``have the potential to cause massive casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are struggling to tighten commerce in germs
both at home and abroad. President Clinton himself recently raised
the issue at Camp David with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who has begun a program to restrict germ sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Washington is expanding cooperative programs meant to
keep former germ warriors in place doing peaceful research.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO, Washington is arguing that the Atlantic alliance should
take the lead in a global fight to stop terrorists from getting or
using germ weaponry. .
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. military is vaccinating all troops against
anthrax, which causes high fevers and death, and has begun a $322
million program to build stockpiles of 18 other vaccines, including
one against smallpox. Recently, Congress approved $51 million to
start building domestic stockpiles of medicines and antibiotics,
especially for police, fire and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Physical security at key federal buildings is being enhanced to
foil terrorists who might try to spread deadly germs and chemicals
through the air. The steps include ventilation improvements so a
gentle breeze blows outward whenever a door or window is opened. In
theory, this so-called positive pressure will automatically sweep
away dangerous agents.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, federal officials are holding seminars in
the nation's top 120 cities to train emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, intelligence agencies are struggling to monitor
terrorists more closely. The FBI's nightmare is talented loners,
who are difficult to track.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is weighing whether to ask the president to
authorize appointment of a military commander who could plan and
direct operations to defend the continental United States in the
event of germ chaos, a step beyond the civil defenses of the early
Cold War. No such commander's post now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within minutes of an event, people are going to turn to us,''
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a meeting of military
officials in explaining the need for homeland defense. ``It could
get crazy very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been little public debate over the risks and
benefits of such actions, partly because the many responses to the
germ threat have been both quiet, to avoid frightening Americans,
and piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   But that may change as echoes of bomb shelters start to
reverberate and as Washington scans the horizon to better judge the
danger in the years and decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is sure to rise between the need for protection and
``rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen recently told the Council on Foreign
Relations. That kind of friction, he added, will force ``unpleasant
choices'' in the near future. ``We haven't really faced up to it
yet.''

   Protections against living weapons are new to the military and
security of the United States, and they raise troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this prudence or paranoia? Should everyone be vaccinated? How
real is the threat? Aren't deadly germs nearly impossible for
attackers to use without hurting themselves? Isn't this threat just
another bogeyman, like so many before?
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons, though around for centuries, have played no
significant role in modern warfare and terrorism. Skeptics point to
this history and say that biological strikes of any consequence are
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington from President Clinton on down are
taking the issue very seriously, with thousands of people and
billions of dollars in motion to address the germ threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, this is going to hurt us,'' said Robert Blitzer,
who recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic
terrorism. ``There's no question in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a yearlong inquiry by The New York Times revealed
trends that suggest the era of germ tranquility may indeed be
ending:
</P>
<P>
   _ Uprooted weapon scientists from Iraq, Russia and South Africa
are hunting for new jobs and spreading germ secrets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Radical states with reputations for supporting terror, such as
Iran and Libya, are seeking germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, are increasingly
interested in pestilential germs. Some boast openly of being able
to kill foes with deadly plagues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, officials in Washington stress that they know of no
imminent danger, even while acknowledging the limitations of
intelligence. Most agree that the threat, while low, is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The defenses that Washington is quietly erecting, officials say,
are akin to the insurance that homeowners take out against floods
and earthquakes. The odds may be small, this argument goes, but
precautions are warranted since conditions are changing and damage
could be great.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to
1995, is among the former officials who are worried. Germ
terrorism, he said in an interview, is ``the single most dangerous
threat to our national security in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons can be hard to make and use, contrary to myth and
claim. It took the United States decades to master the art before
renouncing such arms in 1969. In the early 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo, a
Japanese cult, launched at least nine germ attacks in Tokyo that
were meant to kill millions. But the strikes produced no known
injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous to the attacker as well as the attacked if successful,
germ weapons are considered most practical when used far from the
aggressor's homeland; intervening land and sea establish what
amounts to a quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The main appeal of such weapons is that they are incredibly
cheap compared to chemical and atomic arms. Yet pound for pound,
germ weapons rival nuclear ones for maiming and killing, and some
biological agents are considered superior in that regard; in theory
they can annihilate many millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they surpass their nuclear kin as an instrument of
fright and disruption: Once sown, infections can spread
unpredictably, since they are alive. Experts especially worry about
smallpox, which is highly contagious and seen as particularly
dangerous since few people are now immunized against its ravages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the threat is low is not to minimize its potential,''
said Neil Gallagher, assistant director for national security at
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the secrets of germ warfare are increasingly up for grabs
as weapon scientists from countries that made biological arsenals
hunt for new jobs. The nomads are from Iraq (starting in 1991 after
Persian Gulf war), Russia (starting in 1992 after the Soviet
collapse) and South Africa (starting in 1994 as apartheid fell
apart). Russia alone has many thousands of former germ warriors
increasingly cold, poor and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate science also heightens the risk. The global war
against infectious disease has produced more than 1,500 germ banks
that tend to trade freely in deadly microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Future strides could make matters even worse. Experts agree that
research into the genetic foundations of life, an approach that
promises to cure many diseases, might, in evil hands, one day
produce weapons that work against only certain races or ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult but not impossible,'' said Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises Washington on
germ warfare. More unsettling, he added, is that traditional
killers seem to be a growing danger right now; he called them ``a
monster in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least 17 nations are suspected of having or trying to
acquire germ weapons. Perhaps they want to deter foes. The wild
card is that some (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria) are
also considered architects of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Libya worked hard to join the germ club. In 1994, it sought to
hire scientists fleeing South Africa's crumbling program, including
its head, Dr. Wouter Basson. That move, officials say, was foiled
by diplomatic pressure from Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   However, Libya may have succeeded in hiring (or perhaps hiding
and employing for Baghdad) Dr. Amir Medidi, a top scientist of
Iraq's germ effort, U.N. inspectors revealed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists themselves seem increasingly drawn to germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire known for his
bitter hatred of America, is investigating them, U.S. officials
say. Whether his work has resulted in secret laboratories or usable
arms, no one in Washington seems to know or is willing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Asad al-Tamimi, an Islamic radical, has been vocal. Early
this year Al-Balad, a Jordanian newspaper, quoted him as saying
that ``jihad'' had at last discovered how to win the holy war _
lethal germs.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, growing interest abroad is shared by domestic
radicals and militia groups at home. Catalogs catering to them
carry ads for such books as ``Guide to Germ Warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohioan with a history of hate-group
affiliations, was arrested in 1995 for having bought plague
bacteria from a germ bank under false pretenses. A registered
microbiologist, he now says the microbes were strictly for
defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups all over the world after this kind of
stuff,'' Harris said, his blue eyes icy. ``You're not going to stop
germ warfare. The only thing to do is defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts say knowing the truth is hard. Spies and
satellites are only marginally helpful for ferreting out biological
gear as small as kitchen cookware that is easy to hide and whose
purpose can be peaceful (unlike the nuclear arms, bombers, ships,
missiles and factories that dominated the Cold War). Even hundreds
of arms inspectors in Iraq, who probed that nation for seven years,
ended up with as many questions as answers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the attention focused on germ warfare has already
helped give rise to germ hoaxes, and experts worry that serious
concern might give way to complacency. This year, the FBI is
fighting a wave of false anthrax threats in letters mailed to
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials note that Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, mastermind of
the 1993 New York World Trade Center blast, which killed six people
and injured more than 1,000, claimed that his goal was to have one
tower fall into the other and kill a quarter million people _ more
than died in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   A top former official disclosed that Yousef, when arrested in
1995, was found to have been studying not only chemical but
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John Gannon, chairman of the National Intelligence Council of
the CIA, last month told a Stanford University meeting that the
danger of germ and chemical devastation is rising.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that terrorists and foes with such weapons are growing
in number and that the increasingly lethal agents they are
developing ``have the potential to cause massive casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are struggling to tighten commerce in germs
both at home and abroad. President Clinton himself recently raised
the issue at Camp David with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who has begun a program to restrict germ sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Washington is expanding cooperative programs meant to
keep former germ warriors in place doing peaceful research.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO, Washington is arguing that the Atlantic alliance should
take the lead in a global fight to stop terrorists from getting or
using germ weaponry. .
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. military is vaccinating all troops against
anthrax, which causes high fevers and death, and has begun a $322
million program to build stockpiles of 18 other vaccines, including
one against smallpox. Recently, Congress approved $51 million to
start building domestic stockpiles of medicines and antibiotics,
especially for police, fire and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Physical security at key federal buildings is being enhanced to
foil terrorists who might try to spread deadly germs and chemicals
through the air. The steps include ventilation improvements so a
gentle breeze blows outward whenever a door or window is opened. In
theory, this so-called positive pressure will automatically sweep
away dangerous agents.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, federal officials are holding seminars in
the nation's top 120 cities to train emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, intelligence agencies are struggling to monitor
terrorists more closely. The FBI's nightmare is talented loners,
who are difficult to track.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is weighing whether to ask the president to
authorize appointment of a military commander who could plan and
direct operations to defend the continental United States in the
event of germ chaos, a step beyond the civil defenses of the early
Cold War. No such commander's post now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within minutes of an event, people are going to turn to us,''
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a meeting of military
officials in explaining the need for homeland defense. ``It could
get crazy very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been little public debate over the risks and
benefits of such actions, partly because the many responses to the
germ threat have been both quiet, to avoid frightening Americans,
and piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   But that may change as echoes of bomb shelters start to
reverberate and as Washington scans the horizon to better judge the
danger in the years and decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is sure to rise between the need for protection and
``rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen recently told the Council on Foreign
Relations. That kind of friction, he added, will force ``unpleasant
choices'' in the near future. ``We haven't really faced up to it
yet.''

WHITE HOUSE BUDGET QUANDARY: MOUNTING SURPLUSES, LITTLE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration finishes drawing up
its tax and spending proposals for the next fiscal year, it is
confronting the perplexing but painful reality that despite
mounting federal budget surpluses there is little money for new
programs, and some areas could face cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strict spending caps enacted at a time when the
deficit seemed to be a permanent fixture, administration officials
are reaching deep into their bag of budget tricks to find ways to
pay for the programs that President Clinton wants to propose when
he sets out his priorities to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they would have enough money
available in their budget plan to show that Clinton can still push
an activist agenda despite his impeachment and pending Senate
trial. Clinton is expected to propose some domestic programs that
went nowhere in Congress this year, like tax breaks for child care
expenses, school construction and anti-pollution efforts, as well
as to come up with some new initiatives like assistance for
disabled people returning to work.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also committed to providing more money for the
Pentagon, and has already announced his support for an increase in
pay and pensions for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told members of Congress that it will be all but
impossible to deal with all the issues facing the country, from
providing more military spending to dealing with Medicare's looming
troubles to meeting Democratic priorities for domestic programs,
unless there is agreement to use some of the surplus, a step that
Clinton continues to vow he will not even consider until the nation
settles on a plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying with the policy of reserving the surplus until we've
fixed Social Security has left us with a tight budget, but
balancing fiscal discipline with efforts to pass new investments in
education and other priorities has in one form or another been the
balancing act the president has succeeded in pulling off throughout
his tenure,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the administration is assembling a budget for
the year starting next Oct. 1 that does not rely on the surplus,
but stays in balance by offsetting the cost of new programs with
cuts in others and by creating new pots of money, at least on
paper. Administration officials declined to divulge any details,
but people with whom they have consulted said the ideas under
consideration included finding ways to squeeze more money out of
tobacco companies and cigarette sales, and closing a variety of
corporate tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, are chafing under the budget rules. Stymied by
the administration in their efforts to get a big tax cut this year,
Republicans are regrouping so they can try again.
</P>
<P>
   One plan being considered by Senate Republicans calls for a tax
cut to be financed out of budget surpluses over the next decade,
but in a way intended to deflect criticism from Democrats that it
would endanger Social Security. Under the plan, the government
would continue to set aside the portion of the surplus generated by
the payroll taxes that finance Social Security. Excess Social
Security taxes accounted for all of last year's $70 billion
surplus, and are expected to account for nearly all of the surplus
for the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   But with new, albeit tentative, analyses showing that the
non-Social Security portion of the surplus could grow more rapidly
than anticipated, Republicans are optimistic that they can pay for
a big tax cut and help pay for needed spending increases without
being accused of endangering the future of the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem for the coming ear centers on the
spending caps set out in the budget law. The caps, which have grown
increasingly tight in the last few years, effectively require a
freeze in spending on discretionary programs for the budget year
that will start next Oct. 1 _ meaning a cut in many cases once
inflation is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness of the caps was a jolt even to members of
Clinton's Cabinet, who in recent months proposed programs costing
tens of billions of dollars more than the administration has to
work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into this year's budget there were two forces at work
that make it a difficult year, and not just for us,'' said Jacob
Lew, director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
``The caps are essentially frozen, and the tightness is increasing
from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is that expectations are high, because of the
surplus and because of the very success we had in the negotiations
in September and October,'' Lew said, referring to the last-minute
agreement by Republicans during this year's budget negotiations to
finance some of Clinton's priorities, especially in education.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of Clinton's plans this year will be limited
or scaled back. On Wednesday, he unveiled his plan to provide more
money next year for assistance to the homeless. Under the plan, he
will ask for federal spending of $1.125 billion for the year
starting next Oct. 1, up from $975 million this year. But a year
ago he was pushing for a bigger increase, to $1.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for domestic programs is particularly clouded by a
change in the budget rules that takes effect in the coming year.
The change removes a ``fire wall'' between the money available for
domestic programs and the money available for military programs,
essentially allowing one area to be raided to finance the other.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pressing hard for a substantial increase in
Pentagon spending next year, adjusted for inflation, to begin
offsetting years of declines. The White House has already scaled
back a request from the Pentagon but seems likely to approve a
multibillion-dollar increase for next year, and will no doubt have
to negotiate a larger figure with Congress before the budget
process ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long and short of it is that the discretionary caps, even
if we kept defense at levels we had been projecting, would be
incredibly tight,'' said Thomas Kahn, staff director and chief
counsel for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. By increasing
military spending, he said, ``it's going to take a huge whack out
of nondefense discretionary, and shows even more clearly how
difficult it's going to be to live within the caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties say the spending caps remain a valuable
source of fiscal discipline for Washington and a source of
considerable reassurance to Wall Street, which remains wary of the
federal government's penchant for living beyond its means.
</P>
<P>
   But while the caps are almost certain to remain in place, both
parties are likely to search for ways around them, as they did in
the negotiations that concluded the current year's budget, when
Congress was racing to leave town for the midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the administration agreed to spend $20 billion
outside the caps by designating a wide range of programs as
``emergencies,'' including aid to farmers and efforts to deal with
the computer software problems associated with the year 2000. To
the degree that those programs continue to be financed next year,
they would come at least partly under the spending caps, reducing
money available elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Congress and the administration agreed to finance
$4.6 billion in this year's education spending out of next year's
budget, reducing available money for next year by that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unusually large share of the money has already been spoken
for by the get-out-of-town antics indulged in during September,''
said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition,
a fiscal watchdog group. ``I don't know whether I'm more concerned
that they will face up to the problem and say we can't live within
these limits anymore so let's increase them, or that they won't
face up to it and let the spending ooze out through a lot of budget
games.''

THE SURVIVORS: 18 JETS LEFT FROM THE 1-15 NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he first saw them last year, the newly arrived Pepper
Johnson thought: ``One and 15? What a bunch of misfits.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the veteran linebacker who was part of Bill Parcells'
ongoing overhaul of the Jets, was looking at the holdovers, the
players who had been around during the dismal 1-15 season the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Cascadden, who joined the Jets in 1995 _ when they went
3-13 _ was one of those misfits. ``When you go 3-13, and then 1-15,
right out of college, it makes you wonder: Is this what NFL life is
all about?'' Cascadden said. ``For me, it was a relief when the
season was over and I could go home and lick my wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Cascadden won't be going home so soon. And no
matter how the playoff-bound, 11-4, division champion Jets do
Sunday against New England in their final regular-season game, they
will have completed a remarkable turnaround, one unparalleled in
National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for that has gone to Parcells and to the new
coaches and players he brought in. But there remains a core of
players from the low point in Jets history, and they are proud of
what they have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In an upbeat Jets locker room the day before Christmas, the
rookie tackle Jason Fabini turned to tackle Jumbo Elliott, one of
18 Jets on the current roster who remain from the 1996 team. The
youngster was asking the veteran about the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You here when the team was 1-15, Jumbo?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was,'' replied Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``You played the whole year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed two games,'' said Elliott. ``But I played.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, that 1-15 record can be seen as a badge, rather than
a scarlet number of shame.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it was about the 18 players that has kept them on the
team amid all the changes, Parcells said: ``Any time there's a new
overhaul, it can work a couple of different ways. It can serve to
rejuvenate and refresh people who felt they were in a negative
situation. I don't mean the team or the organization, but
themselves. It can serve also to force a recommitment by everyone,
even the ones that were established, to proving themselves again.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells added: ``It's the oldie _ you're part of the problem or
part of the solution. When you're a coach coming in, you don't know
which it is; a guy who hasn't played much could be part of the
solution. The most common thing about the group that's left is the
majority of them are pretty good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who joined the club this year,
said: ``They're all good guys. There isn't one of them I wouldn't
take home to meet my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them were pretty good players, too. Three players from
that season made it to this year's Pro Bowl: linebacker Mo Lewis,
cornerback Aaron Glenn and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. There
was some talent there.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it that much harder to believe how bad things were
two season ago. When tight end Kyle Brady used to walk through the
doors at Weeb Ewbank Hall and enter the locker room, ``it was as if
a cloud was hanging over the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott used to wear his Super Bowl ring a lot more often in
those days. ``It made me think of better times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 24 months ago. The word laughingstock was applied
freely, and why not? The Jets were the worst team in the league, at
least by their record. They were the worst team in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   That season evoked in Don Maynard, one of two Hall of Fame
players who made it to Canton based on a Jets career, a longing to
bring back the old days. He was embarrassed, as were all the
members of the Super Bowl III champions, for what the Jets had
turned into. So Maynard wrote to the owner Leon Hess and offered
himself up as the new head coach. He would bring with him teammates
from that 1968 season as assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hess and the team president, Steve Gutman, figured out
how to get Parcells, whose disenchantment with the Patriots' front
office was complete. From 1-15 under Rich Kotite, the Jets went to
9-7 last year, and then to this year, the one that Testaverde calls
the magical season.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells arrived, he said, he understood that coaches ``all
basically say the same thing _ work hard and win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to give the players some evidence you're
committed to winning,'' he said. ``You've got to do everything
toward winning and you've got to do it all the time. It's not a
once-in-a-while thing. Not everyone is willing to do it _ not
coaches, not players.''
</P>
<P>
   What do the survivors believe has kept them around? To Glenn
Foley, who is one of them, a common denominator is ``smarts.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said: ``One thing Bill requires of you is a commitment. In
the off season he put up signs: `Blame nobody, expect nothing, do
something' and `Dumb players do dumb things. Smart players do smart
things.' The guys he brought in that he had coached before, they
knew these things. We had to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Anderson, the running back, knew that as a holdover, ``I
had to show him I had the qualities he was looking for, especially
coming from a team that was 1-15.''
</P>
<P>
   Players had to be tough to endure some of the indignities of the
1996 season. It is hard to believe, or even remember, in this
season in which six of seven home crowds have topped 70,000 fans,
that in one game alone the Jets had a record 55,000 no-shows that
season.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-15 record happened despite the club's $70 million
commitment in long-term contracts during the previous off season,
the greatest such splurge in league history.
</P>
<P>
   They had to pay that much money for the free agents because, as
one player's lawyer put it, ``No one wants to come to the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott recalled that not all players held up equally well under
the strain of that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what got me annoyed?'' he asked. ``Up until the last
five games of the season back then, we worked pretty hard. Then
there were slackers who took advantage of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who was the starting quarterback the last three games of
that season after Neil O'Donnell popped a hamstring while warming
up, said: ``What did I learn? You have to be strong. It's not easy
to lead a squad under those circumstances. It can never get worse,
never get tougher than to lead a team when you're 1-12 and there's
nothing to play for and you have pride in your profession. Down the
stretch, some guys didn't want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ray Mickens, then a rookie cornerback from Texas A&AMP;M, the
idea of losing was something new. Now he appreciates victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take winning for granted when you come from a winning
program,'' he said. ``At A&AMP;M my team was 9-3, and that was my worst
year. I lost five games in four years in college. I remember it
used to be so easy. Now I don't take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott concluded: ``The good thing about football is that it
teaches you not to dwell.''
</P>
<P>
   For Keyshawn Johnson, who was a rookie that year and wrote a
book about the season, there was never any doubt about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was only going to get better,'' he said. ``I'm the
same person I always was. I thought of myself as the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson chuckled as he contemplated some of the negative
comments he made in the book about other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people I learned about, and wrote about,'' he said,
``are no longer around right now.''

THE GIANTS' PLAYOFF PICTURE: OH, WHAT A TANGLED DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture Giants Coach Jim Fassel rising in his Philadelphia hotel
room Sunday morning, fumbling frantically for the television remote
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the Weather Channel,'' Fassel sputters. ``Got to know
how cold it is in Cincinnati. Show me the national map. No, no, not
another dew-point reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead rising in another part
of the same hotel, kneeling at the foot of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pray for a San Diego victory,'' Armstead
says. ``But could somebody up there clip Jake Plummer's wings
today?''
</P>
<P>
   Picture Giants quarterback Kent Graham still in a deep slumber
in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants play at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium at 4:15
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The way Graham figures it, the Giants can beat the Eagles in
their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In a most curious turn of events, the Giants will wake Sunday
morning with blurry playoff chances but with a very specific
blueprint for getting there _ even if it is a scenario that would
require an amazing confluence of events.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime after 8 p.m., the Giants will either be giddily on
their way to the Super Bowl tournament or driving home from the
City of Brotherly Love as beaten as a slaughterhouse steer hanging
in the path of a Rocky Balboa training run.
</P>
<P>
   There are three games Sunday that matter to the Giants, making
for anywhere from three to seven hours of climatic
end-of-the-season drama.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary for the 7-8 Giants to make the playoffs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning at 1 p.m., the Giants need the Cincinnati Bengals
(3-12) to embark on an upset of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8).
</P>
<P>
   _ At 4:15 p.m. in Arizona, the visiting San Diego Chargers
(5-10) must launch a defensive assault on the home Cardinals (8-7).
The Chargers have the top-rated defense in the National Football
League, but the Cards have Plummer, the scariest 185-pound guy
playing football in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants must defeat the Eagles (3-12) or spoil the whole
nutty package.
</P>
<P>
   By most estimations, the Giants' chief ally in the
Bengals-Buccaneers would be a cold day.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers have never won a game played in temperatures
below 40 degrees. There have been 16 unsuccessful attempts. Or one
whole regular season. If the Bucs come out at Riverfront Stadium
and see their breath, it is six more weeks without the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for the Cincinnati area calls for
temperatures in the low 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the Buccaneers: check for small white patches of exposed
skin. That's frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cardinals, the key to beating Plummer is never
asking him to make a comeback. Perhaps the best plan is to fall
behind and root for a forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Working in the Giants' favor is more than three-quarters of a
century of Cardinals franchise futility. Since 1920, the Cardinals
have won exactly one playoff game. That was in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Cards have never adjusted to face masks.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, beating the Eagles would not seem like asking
too much except that the Giants have had some of their most
demoralizing, vexing defeats at Veterans Stadium. George Washington
crossed the Delaware a few miles north of the Vet 222 years and two
days ago. If he had brought a few Giants with him, his boat would
have sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the Philly intrigue is Eagles Coach Ray Rhodes, who
has pulled a reverse Rocky, throwing in the towel because he is
trailing on all the judges' cards going into the final round. This
can't be helping to motivate the Eagles, but there is always the
Vet crowd factor.
</P>
<P>
   The most ornery and dissatisfied collection of ticket-holders
this side of the obstructed view seats at ``The Blue Room,'' they
always have the cunning to menace the home side into playing
better, or the menace to con the visitors into playing worse.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Giants' long day's journey into the football
unknown might not end until well after 7:30. After Tampa Bay
quarterback Trent Dilfer _ shivering uncontrollably _ fumbles five
times, and after the Giants crush the Eagles because Rhodes fires
himself at halftime and goes home, the Giants could be assembled in
a locker room watching the end of the Chargers-Cardinals game on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Fassel waving his arms frantically at the television,
trying to distract the Cardinals, who trail by 2 points, as they
line up for the game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Armstead on his knees. ``I'm not praying for the
Cardinals to lose,'' he says. ``But can't somebody move the goal
posts 20 yards to the right just after the kick is made?''
</P>
<P>
   Picture Graham in the corner of the room with his eyes closed.
It appears he is sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Graham is dreaming big.
</P>

HUNTING TRIP WHERE THE DEER CAN ROAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NELSON BRYANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECOND COLLEGE GRANT, N.H. _ Newly fallen snow greeted my sons
and me when we reached the White Mountains on our drive north from
the Massachusetts seacoast the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   We were on our annual deer-hunting trip, bound for this remote,
uninhabited 26,800-acre township in northeastern New Hampshire.
Owned by Dartmouth College, the Grant has a few camps and log
cabins scattered along the Dead and Swift Diamond Rivers, which may
be used by Dartmouth alumni, students, faculty, staff and their
families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Deer are not numerous in this rugged mountainous country, but my
sons Steve and Jeff, and I and the friends who join us aren't too
concerned about that. We are also in quest of tales of yesteryear,
told at night after the day's hunt is done, and we want to see wood
smoke rising from a cabin in a clearing, hardwood hillsides and
spruce swamps, tracks of deer, moose, bobcats, coyotes, fishers and
martens leading up steep ravines, ruffed grouse hurtling aloft from
hemlocks and ravens soaring above granite cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   We rejoiced at the snow not only because it would facilitate
tracking and seeing our quarry, but also because it fit in with our
feelings of how the Grant should look in late November. Joining up
with four friends in Errol, N.H. _ Henry Sanders of Hancock, N.H.;
his brother Richard of Peterborough, N.H.; David Taylor of
Littleton, N.H., and Roger Adams of Mansfield, Conn. _ we drove to
Merrill Brook cabin in the Grant after checking in at the Gate
Camp, where we learned that only 13 deer had been taken from the
Grant, down a half dozen or so from the previous year's total on
that date.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Brook cabin has gas lights, gas stove and gas
refrigerator, a wood-burning stove, a shed that is amply stocked
with split, dry logs, a two-seater outhouse and a splendid
collection of pots and pans. In mild weather, a hose that runs to a
pool a few hundred yards up the brook provides a gravity-fed source
of water to the kitchen sink. The hose was buried under about four
inches of snow when we arrived, and the water in it had frozen, so
we went to the brook with buckets.
</P>
<P>
   After we stowed our gear and food in the cabin, there were only
a few hours of daylight left, so we decided to hunt close by.
Fanning out along the north-south logging road that runs through
the Grant along the Dead Diamond River, we moved up the steep
slopes of Halfmoon Mountain east of the cabin. I encountered the
tracks of two deer early on, but they had been made the night
before and it wasn't until I was 500 feet higher that I found fresh
tracks. They headed almost straight up the mountain and it was too
late to try to catch up to their maker, so I circled back down
toward the cabin and got there ahead of the others, lit the lamps,
stoked the wood fire and had the spaghetti sauce for that evening's
meal prepared before anyone joined me.
</P>
<P>
   The others had similar experiences, finding old tracks early on,
but seeing no animals. Jeff came in after dark, having decided to
try to make the water line operative. Over the years he has always
regarded the cabin's ice-clogged line as a personal challenge. He
was successful, and we had running water in the kitchen sink the
remainder of our stay.
</P>
<P>
   All of us went west the following day, across the footbridge
over the Dead Diamond River, just below Monahan's Bathtub, that
leads to Stoddard cabin and Round and Black Mountains. Having
thought about it for the past few years, I elected to poke north
along the west side of the Dead Diamond upstream of the bridge, an
area that gets minimal hunting pressure because easy access is only
from the bridge or from another bridge several miles upstream at
Hellgate. I found fresh tracks of deer moving north and south along
the river's edge early on. At 9 o'clock I heard two distant shots,
but believed, correctly it turned out, that they were too far away
to have been fired by one of our group. Shortly before noon, while
standing on the edge of a grassy opening, the river only 100 yards
away, I saw my first deer, partially obscured and standing under
the wide-spreading branches of a spruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' I thought. ``I will shoot it, drag it to the river,
get a canoe from the Gate Camp, put in at Monahan's Bathtub, paddle
up to the deer with one of the lads this evening, take it aboard
and bring it back down to where we can load it in our vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not to be. Observed through my rifle's scope, the deer
had no horns, and only bucks were legal game.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched the doe move away into a clump of alders, a shot
rang out from less than a mile away. None followed. I looked at my
watch. It was nearly 1 o'clock. Being optimistic, I chose to think
that one of our group had made a clean kill rather than a clean
miss.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours and one more doe sighting later, I met my companions
at the bridge and learned that Jeff had tried to shoot the head off
a ruffed grouse with his deer rifle and had missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to miss the head than ruin the meat with a body shot,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the others had seen deer. David had a doe walk to within
30 feet of him. Steve had spotted two deer in thick cover about 130
yards away. His low-power rifle scope showed him no horns. When he
switched to binoculars he discovered that one was a little forkhorn
buck, but it drifted out of sight even as he was raising his rifle.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the next and final day of hunting, Jeff's shot
at the grouse was the only one the group had fired. That night, the
wood stove pouring out its seductive warmth beside me and vodka in
hand, I said to the others that although I was delighted with the
copious draughts of comradeship and North Country ambiance I had
quaffed, I would have experienced even greater fulfillment if at
least one deer was hanging in the dooryard.
</P>
<P>
   My companions protested that such thoughts should not be allowed
to tarnish enjoyment of the quest, and by midnight their merriment
had overwhelmed my reservations.

<P>
   The International Time Capsule Society has a few things it would
like you to know about your contribution to this millennium's
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have long held a canine enthusiasm for burying
objects of value for later discovery, they lack a sense of
``stewardship,'' according to one of the society's founders, Knute
Berger. Of the tens of thousands of time capsules already buried
across the United States, most will be lost, destroyed or otherwise
prevented from passing on their legacy, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   One rule is not to tell too many people _ or too few, for that
matter. In Westport, Fla., for example, the first headmaster of an
elementary school buried a commemorative capsule in 1947 and left a
note specifying its content and the year of its intended
disinterment, 1997. But the headmaster neglected to denote its
location.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilkinsburg, Pa., a church capsule was carefully concealed
from vandals and remains concealed from everyone else, too, after a
century. People have been known to uncover one container while
trying to bury another.
</P>
<P>
   A box meant to commemorate the 1960 opening of a general store
in Walnut Creek, Calif., was planted in a four-foot concrete
pedestal with a brass plaque announcing both its contents
(prognostications of the future by town citizens) and its opening
(November 2000). Last July the entire structure was removed by
vandals with sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   Time capsules must be interred with an eye to the distant
future, of course. Local scholars attended the 1995 excavation of a
century-old capsule in New Zealand with interest because it held
historical papers. But all they found was muddy water and a button.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even the rocket scientists at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology remain at a loss as to how to
disinter a capsule buried on campus in 1889 that somehow wound up
beneath their cyclotron (which was constructed in the 1930s).
</P>
<P>
   It's also dangerous to trust in the wisdom of future
generations. In Orlando, the opening of a hundred-year-old
courthouse cornerstone was so eagerly anticipated this year that
the city planned to raze the building and replace it with a museum
in which the contents of the capsule could be exhibited. When the
courthouse was demolished, though, the smallish copper box in the
cornerstone was apparently dumped in a landfill along with the rest
of the debris.
</P>
<P>
   At least now there's expert advice at the time capsule society
at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, which houses the enormous
``Crypt of Civilization.'' Its creator, Thornwell Jacobs,
considered 1940 as a midpoint in recorded history, so the crypt was
built then and will be opened in 8113. The society will register
anyone's capsule by location, date and contents.
</P>
<P>
   The Westinghouse Time Capsule from the 1939 World's Fair in
Flushing Meadows, N.Y., officially introduced the concept of a time
capsule. The actual term was coined by a publicist for Westinghouse
Electric (another possibility was ``Time Bomb''). The
torpedo-shaped cylinder measures some 7 feet in length and 8 inches
in diameter. Among the contents are microfilm (of newspapers and
books, including ``Gone With the Wind''), newsreels (including
Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose and a Miami fashion show), examples of
the day's technology (including coal and asbestos, the ``miracle
fabric'') and representations of daily life (photographs of a poker
game and a 1938 baseball rule book). They are all loaded by weight
and fragility and fashionably topped by a Lilly Dache hat.
</P>
<P>
   (An updated version was planted after the 1965 World's Fair:
Time Capsule II was buried exactly 10 feet north of the original
and contains such wonders as a transistor radio, a Polaroid camera
and a bikini.)
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, who planned its excavation for the year 6939,
distributed 3,650 copies of a ``Book of Record'' to sites around
the world, from the Library of Congress (which apparently can't
seem to locate its two copies) to the Great Monastery Library in
Tibet. The book aspires to preserve the English language with
pronunciation charts, diagrams and an updated Rosetta Stone, as
well as messages to the future from Albert Einstein and Thomas
Mann, among others. They protected the capsule with layers of
waterproof batting and built a 50-foot-deep ``Immortal Well'' to
contain it.
</P>
<P>
   The book's prologue refers humbly enough to the site of the
capsule's placement: ``New York will certainly be an attractive
place for archaeologists 5,000 years from now, as are the sites of
ancient Athens, Rome and Troy in our own time.''

AMERICANS IN IRAQ FIND THE POLITICAL IS NOT PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ An American in Baghdad is an odd and even
provocative sight, so it was perhaps not surprising when a group of
young Iraqis congregated around one who was wandering through a
poor neighborhood on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see an American or a Zionist, I want to hit him,'' one
man called out. But his comrades quickly shouted him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more civilized than to be angry at you,'' one of them,
Ahmed Jasim, a 21-year-old student, said in fluent English. ``This
war is not your fault. It is the fault of your government. But I
want to ask you: When will you take us off your agenda? When will
you start letting us live like human beings again?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington have a simple answer to that question.
They say they have no quarrel with the Iraqi people and that the
recent bombing of Iraqi targets _ like the economic sanctions
against this country that have been in place for eight years _ are
aimed solely at President Saddam Hussein and his regime.
</P>
<P>
   That argument rings hollow to many Iraqis. Their lives have
deteriorated steadily, and they have no way to affect the
government under which they live. Nonetheless, they are remarkably
friendly to Americans who venture here.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and others are allowed to wander freely as long as
they do not take photographs. A foreigner taking notes on a busy
street, even in the sight of police officers, does not arouse any
evident suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Several journalists have been expelled, however, for asking
Iraqis probing questions about what they think of Saddam. Others
have been denied return visas after showing what was judged to be
excessive curiosity about military installations or presidential
palaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have an astonishing capacity for friendship and
forgiveness,'' said Anne Montgomery, who is part of a Chicago-based
group campaigning for an end to sanctions. ``I'm not sure Americans
would respond the same way if we were the ones being bombed. I
personally have encountered no rancor or hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans who have made repeated visits here say they have
noticed one clear change in attitudes recently. They say that while
many Iraqis have been angry with the U.S. government for some time,
they now show special animosity toward President Clinton. They have
come to view him as the personification of forces that are bombing
and blockading them, just as they saw President Bush during the
Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not your fault, it's Clinton who is killing us,''
Barnoon al-Kadisia, an unemployed laborer, said as he sipped tea
with a visiting American on a recent afternoon. ``We love welcoming
you in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Lehman, a writer from New York who is working on a book
about the effect of sanctions on the Iraqi people, said he arrived
here at the beginning of December and ``got a lot more than I
bargained for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks after I arrived,'' he said, ``bombs started
falling near my hotel. My phone rang, and it was the reception desk
inviting me down into the basement shelter. They look at you a
little strangely because there are very few Americans here, but
they're unfailingly friendly and kind. I find their attitude a
little surprising, frankly, but pleasantly surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the poorest people in Iraq seem astonishingly
open to Americans, a prominent university professor, Latif
al-Jumali, chairman of the English department at Baghdad
University, did not feel cordial on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested in speaking to any American journalist,''
al-Jumali said as he stepped from his car at the university gate.
``When I had the opportunity, I was a regular reader of The New
York Times. But the Americans and British have severed all
possibility of dialogue here. I'm sorry, but I am emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician who grew up in Britain, Mohammed al-Kaisi, recalled
that when he was a teen-ager, his British friends would ask him
whether he would ever fight against them if their countries went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke back then, but now it's almost serious,''
al-Kaisi said. ``This wouldn't be happening if more people could
come here and see what the sanctions are doing to us. That's why
we're happy to see Americans or any other foreigners. We need them
to understand our situation. They are individuals, and wars are not
waged by individuals.''

   BEIJING _ Three months ago, Wang Youcai was feeling optimistic
about the prospects of the China Democratic Party, a fledgling
group he had helped to found and hoped to register as China's first
opposition party. ``I think the likelihood I'll be re-arrested is
very small,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, after swift trials, Wang, 32, and two other
organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yong, were sentenced to more than a
decade each in prison for ``subverting state power.'' And in a
speech, President Jiang Zemin proclaimed that challenges to
Communist rule would be ``annihilated in the early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising thing is that all this came at the end of a year
when China's rigid political system had seemed to be relaxing its
grip. So the verdicts sent ebullient hopes that China was poised
for change crashing to the ground _ and not just for the dissidents
but for the many Western leaders who have flocked to Beijing in the
past year, applauding China for progress on human rights and legal
reform.
</P>
<P>
   How had their optimism been so far off base? Where their
calculations overly simplistic, or terribly wrong?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many signs in 1998 suggested that China's leaders were
ready for a dose of political reform: Jiang discussed Tibet and the
Tiananmen massacre with President Clinton during an hour of live
television. China said it would sign the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. Chinese officials played host to Mary
Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in their optimism, many people overestimated the
significance of such events, overlooking the obvious: That China
remains a one-party state, with the rule of the Communist Party
written into its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were all important steps, but I think they were
misinterpreted by dissidents and by many in the outside world,''
said Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia
University in New York. ``They decided that initiations for change
could come from outside rather than inside the Communist Party. But
that was never true.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clinton visit in June seemed remarkably open, and
dissidents like Wang thought that the time was ripe to propose an
alternative party. A few months later, initial attempts to register
the party in two provinces were not immediately squashed. So the
members felt further emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the China Democratic Party never even came close to
registering _ no closer than hearing from a few local officials
that if its members could show things like an official meeting
place and a list of members, they were free to turn in an
application.
</P>
<P>
   But for activists who had previously landed in jail for their
democratic leanings, it seemed like progress, even though no one
knew for sure just why China's leaders had turned cordial. Was it
all a show for the West, and particularly for Ms. Robinson, whose
visit was just weeks away? Or was there genuine debate about
political reform among the top leadership? The optimists chose to
act on the chance that the opening was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially around August and September there seemed to be a
thaw,'' said Chen Zhonghe, a Democratic Party member in Wuhan.
``And some had the belief that Jiang Zemin might offer a different
approach. That turned out to be an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments and visiting dignitaries tuned in to the
liberalizing signals as well, and they too found their hopes
raised. Journalists proclaimed a Beijing spring. Lawyers from
England, Germany and the United States came to assist China's much
publicized quest for ``rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of these Westerners have little experience in China.
And they have not spent much time with the older generation of men
who run China. Following their own democratic interests, they have
focused instead on the younger, more progressive, often
Western-trained officials and academics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with homeowners. Hillary Rodham Clinton visited a
groundbreaking women's legal aid center. It was easy to leave with
optimistic impressions. Now the trials are reminders that, although
China is undoubtedly moving toward a bit more openness, the
direction is not necessarily toward Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Western lawyers who recently took part in freewheeling law
forums here said they were shocked that the dissidents were not
even accorded lawyers or open trials, as are guaranteed by Chinese
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot about China moving towards `rule of law,' which
we tend to conflate with democracy or a multi-party system,'' said
Sharon Hom, a law professor and expert on China at the City
University of New York. ``We assume they go hand in hand, but
that's not true in China. Rule of law in China is to promote
economic development and modernization. When push comes to shove,
it does not include political development.''
</P>
<P>
   Many China scholars say they hope, at best, for incremental
change. ``I think there's enough ferment that will cause boundaries
on political discourse to be slowly expanded outward,'' said
Stanley Lubman, a consulting professor at Stanford University Law
School. ``The Chinese leadership, however, has never indicated how
much loss of control it will tolerate.''

NFL OPENS A PATH FOR BLACK COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League is currently taking its most
drastic _ and some say productive _ steps ever to correct what is
viewed as one of the biggest problems facing professional football:
the lack of black head coaches and coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   The key part of the league's new attack on an old obstacle is a
pilot project in which an independent consulting company will
videotape interviews of selected assistant coaches, most of them
black, who have been recommended by teams as having high potential
to become head coaches and coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews will be conducted in the next several weeks.
Tapes of the interviews, along with accompanying resumes, will
serve as a sort of coaching database and be available to any team
in search of top coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, approved by the eight owners, general managers and
coaches of the league's competition committee, is to introduce
owners and team executives to new faces.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote this month to the presidents
of the NFL's 31 teams about the new initiatives. In the memo,
obtained by The New York Times from a team executive, Tagliabue
wrote that the league was simply trying to identify ``a deep and
diverse talent pool'' for head coaching and coordinator positions.
Tagliabue has also met with some owners to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the commissioner is trying to encourage teams to be
fair,'' said one team executive, who asked not to be identified.
``The league is taking some very good steps here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently three black head coaches in the NFL:
Philadelphia's Ray Rhodes, Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa Bay's
Tony Dungy. Rhodes, whose team can finish no better than 4-12, is
considered likely to be fired at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, there have been more than two dozen
head coaching vacancies, and none has been filled by an
African-American. Last year, the NFL was roundly criticized when
retread white coaches, like Dick Vermeil in St. Louis and Jim Mora
in Indianapolis, were hired instead of black coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NFL is taking new measures to try to change the
situation, with one owner saying the ideas have the potential to
``put fairness back in the NFL's hiring practices.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the pilot project, the NFL spent months speaking
to teams about potential candidates and recorded hundreds of names.
The league office then whittled down the group to some 20 to 30
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the program is for owners to become familiar with
candidates they might otherwise know little about, which is why
former NFL coaches and current college coaches are excluded from
this phase. Although the project is aimed at black coaches, white
coaches will also participate.
</P>
<P>
   Each interview will focus on the candidate's background,
experience and general philosophy, but will not involve more
detailed questions on the technical aspects of coaching or the
circumstances of particular NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   According to several owners and team executives, some coaches
who may take part in the program include the Giants' defensive
coordinator, John Fox, who is white; the Giants' defensive backs
coach, Johnnie Lynn; Oakland's defensive coordinator, Willie Shaw,
and the Jets' running backs coach, Maurice Carthon, all of whom are
black. There is also interest in Sam Clancy, the black defensive
line coach of NFL Europe's Barcelona Dragons, who has coached for
three different NFL teams under the league's internship program.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Reynolds Associates, a New York company that helps
corporations find candidates for top management jobs, will conduct
the hourlong interviews. Some black coaches under consideration in
the past have complained that they were poorly interviewed, and
teams have complained that some black coaches have interviewed
poorly, so the league hopes to standardize the process.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL does not expect a team to hire a coach based solely on
the video interview, but the tapes will serve to provide valuable
basic information and introduce people who otherwise might not have
been considered.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue wrote in his memo to the team presidents that he
believed the current initiative would provide ``a confidential and
reliable means of expanding the hiring process.'' But he said the
ultimate decision on hiring ``will and must remain with those clubs
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot project is considered successful, more coaches will
be asked to participate next year.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent face-to-face talks with some of the league's
owners, Tagliabue asked those who may be looking for a head coach
at the end of the year not to rush into a decision, according to
several owners.
</P>
<P>
   In his Dec. 21 memo, Tagliabue wrote: ``It is essential that the
league and all member clubs make every effort to have a process
that is credible with your coaching employees as well as fans, the
media and other interested observers. We must have a process that
is consistent with commonly accepted notions of proper business
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials, as they had done before, recently sought the
advice of black assistant coaches themselves on how to correct the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Will the latest attempts by the NFL help? There is optimism
among some black assistants that at least one of the 6 to 10 head
coaching positions that could open up after this season might be
filled by one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some things here that could finally begin to
solve this issue, which is complicated,'' said one assistant coach
in the National Football Conference. ``I finally see some hope. The
commissioner deserves a lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Upping the Ante &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills are rethinking how they provide security at
Ralph Wilson Stadium after a series of incidents during last week's
game against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Three fans ran onto the field during the game, and there were
some 20 arrests because of fights in the stands. The Bills already
have more security officials at games than almost any other team,
but a lawyer for the team, Vincent Tobia, told The Buffalo News
that even more may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sympathetic to fans who come to our games as a family
and have to put up with drunks, swearing and fighting in the
stands,'' Tobia said.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium security seems to pop up as an issue every few years. At
Giants Stadium on Dec. 23, 1995, fans threw rock-hard snowballs
onto the field at San Diego Chargers players, coaches and trainers.
That led to the announcement by the Giants that rowdy fans risked
losing their season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No Security &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Across the NFL, coaches _ and not just head coaches _ are
worrying about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, if Bears Coach Dave Wannstedt is fired, his 10
assistants will in all probability be fired too. Six of them are
signed only through this season, including the offensive line
coach, Tony Wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain situations where guys, if something happens,
are willing to go from one spot to the next,'' said Wise. ``I feel
very comfortable here. That has made it strenuous personally.''

BOAT SHOW TO OFFER A LOT (AND ENTERTAIN AS WELL) 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York National Boat Show, now in its 87th
year, looks more like a stage production than a sales arena each
season. Complete with an indoor small boat pond, Twiggy the
water-skiing squirrel and cooking classes on a two-burner stove,
there is entertainment galore at the Jacob K. Javits Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the organizers take the sale of boats and their
attendant marine products very seriously. Statistics from the
National Marine Manufacturers Association, the industry trade
group, recently estimated that consumers spent $19billion on boats
and marine products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The show in New York marks the beginning of the industry's new
year. With four football fields worth of powerboat and sailboat
merchandise on display from Jan. 2-10 at the Javits Center,
consumers will have plenty of choices. But only certain sectors of
the industry are very likely to reap the benefits of a public flush
with buying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that most of the small-boat end of
business is pretty lackluster,'' Greg Proteau, a spokesman for the
manufacturers association, said recently from Chicago. ``But if you
look at the big stuff, that's where all the action is. The number
of new inboard boats sold in 1998 increased by 9 percent to 13,900
from the previous year. Canoes, inflatable boats and water-ski
boats were up too. But bass boats were down. The market's very
segmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Proteau said that an overall decline of 10 percent in the number
of new boats sold in 1998 reflects a ``very discriminating public
in terms of products that fit their needs.'' Manufacturers are not
worried about spending; they are concerned about directing it their
way, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On display beginning next weekend will be a plethora of boat
designs _ more than 1,000 on site _ at the New York show. About 85
percent of the craft are powerboats, and the remaining 15 percent,
sail.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people traipsed through the 1997 show, a
substantial turnout spurred on by unseasonably mild weather.
Organizers hope for a similar influx next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, people who came to the show were buying at a rate
better than anything we had seen in the previous seven or eight
years,'' Michael Duffy, the boat show manager, said recently. ``But
no one in the industry likes to talk about it being the beginning
of a new boom. These guys hold their cards close to the chest. If
they compare sales to the high of 1988, they're afraid the bottom's
going to fall out.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers such as Crusader Engines, which has been exhibiting
its line of inboard gasoline engines at the New York show since
1954, is clearly cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has not made it easy for people,'' said Bill
Balsley, director of sales and marketing for Crusader. ``This
should be an industry where it's fun for people to buy. There
should be more boat rendezvous for owners, and more open houses to
help people stay involved, to encourage them to buy the next new
model the way the automotive industry sells its cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest boat exhibitor at the New York show is Chris-Craft,
the motorboat company that built its reputation at the
turn-of-the-century with mahogany runabouts. Now owned by Outboard
Marine Corp., Chris-Craft is reinventing itself for its 125th
anniversary this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris-Craft is definitely on the comeback trail,'' Andy
Larsen, a spokesman for OMC said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Its new models, which range from about 20-32 feet, are made of
fiberglass now. But the boats are built with attention to detail
such as rosewood dash panels and gold-trimmed gauges. On display in
New York will be the 320 Express, a 32-foot inboard that can be
purchased with twin 280-horsepower Volvo Penta engines for about
$127,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other boats being exhibited will be the 40-foot Super Sport, a
deep-water cruising and fishing boat by Ocean Yachts; the Pilot 30
Sedan, a trawler built for cruising by Mainship; the X-26 Tigercat,
a sport-fishing catamaran by Grady-White, and the Lxi Classic 206,
a runabout built by Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides merchandise displays, show customers can choose from
more than 35 seminars on boating, fishing and water skiing. Raffles
will give away numerous prizes, including a Hunter 170 daysailer
and an Armada B28 Marada, a futuristic-looking outboard. For
additional show information, telephone (212) 922-1212.

FROM A SAILOR'S MIND COMES, QUITE SIMPLY, THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bruno Peyron's sailing successes have made him a
national figure in France, a country that likes its sport with a
large helping of adventure. When he became the first winner of the
Jules Verne Trophy in April 1993, circumnavigating the globe with
his weather-beaten crew in the catamaran Commodore-Explorer in just
a few hours less than 80 days, the French found Peyron's mixture of
dark, handsome Breton looks and socio-ecological sensibility
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Now Peyron is working the phones and the angles in an attempt to
make sure an even grander, madder dash will begin on Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It will be called, quite simply, ``The Race.'' And while it is
far from clear that it will be the success that Peyron imagines,
his is an ambitious and straightforward concept: a non-stop race
around the world open to crews of any nationality and boats of any
design, which must first pass muster over shorter qualifying
distances.
</P>
<P>
   The Race will be the Whitbread not broken up into legs, and with
an extra hull or two on each boat. It will be the French solo
round-the-world race, the Vendee Globe, with a lot more hands on
deck and a lot more speed. But what the 43-year-old Peyron, a
self-described idealist, really wants is for The Race to be
something more than a race.
</P>
<P>
   He wants it to be a quest; a salt-sprayed, digital-video-relayed
ode to the human spirit, and a more internationally resonant
version of what he experienced when he won the Jules Verne Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back into the port where there were 50,000 or
60,000 people waiting, we did not hear lots of shouting or
screaming; it was more of a murmur,'' Peyron said. ``It was rather
calm, rather surprising. I've been across plenty of finish lines in
races, and usually there are the hurrahs and the bravos. But this
time, there were more `thank yous' than bravos. Later, I kept
asking myself why, and the answer I came up with is that the Jules
Verne was not just sport. It was a human adventure and it was
simple to understand for everyone, not just those who follow
sailing. And to be honest, that was the sort of recipe I felt the
desire to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the impression that there is a desire out there for a
grand opera, a great human adventure in which sport will have a
role to play, but not the only role.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyron concedes that the wired world is experiencing something
of an adventure glut, with glory-hungry, sponsor-backed intrepids
of all shapes and nationalities rowing, swimming, sailing or skiing
across oceans, Antarctic ice fields and other natural and
preferably telegenic obstacles. It is a niche-filling scramble that
is a by-product of an active, technologically empowered population
and an increasingly accessible planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets to the point where we're doing these things with
both eyes patched or our arms tied behind our backs, it doesn't
mean anything at all,'' Peyron said. ``We've seen some excesses,
but I think the important thing, if you have any power or influence
or credibility, is to try to have a positive influence on this
drift. When I had the idea for The Race, I told myself that this
trend, at least in sailing, was definitely going to continue
whether it was intelligent or constructive or not. So the best
thing was to push to the limit and control that limit so it has a
certain ethical integrity and a real value.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of an oil tanker captain who was often at sea for months
at a time, Peyron and his two younger brothers and two younger
sisters began sailing during their father's vacations. ``In the
merchant marine, you don't have great financial means,'' Peyron
said. ``My father had big boats at work and small boats at home. We
started out with one that was 5.5 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three sons would join the family business, but all
three would feel the pull of the ocean. Bruno and Loick would
become world-class racers with a particular affinity for
multi-hulls. Stephane, the youngest, would windsurf across the
Atlantic and now is the host a nature program on the French channel
Canal Plus, which requires him to travel even more widely than his
brothers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One might assume the Peyrons' parents were instrumental in
encouraging all this wanderlust. According to Bruno, one would be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a French generation whose parents were more
concerned with studies and social status; it was doctor, lawyer,
whatever,'' he said. ``We had no encouragement to follow the path
we followed. In fact, we were all encouraged to leave the house at
18 because we had not followed the classic path. I left first, then
Loick, then Stephane. The idea was that if you make an
unconventional choice, you have to assume the consequences of that
choice. I think that helped all of us later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peyron brothers attempted unsuccessfully to pool their
talents and resources in 1990, when they started but did not finish
a mutual bid to compete for the Jules Verne Trophy. Bruno ended up
going it alone, and it appears there will be only one Peyron in The
Race, as well. The surprise is that it will be Loick, not Bruno,
although Bruno and his crew established a new trans-Pacific record
on Explorer in August, covering the distance from Yokohama, Japan,
to San Francisco in 14 days 17 hours 22 minutes 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I thought this up, I was racing in it,'' Peyron said,
with a chuckle. ``But as the planning progressed, it became rather
clear that you can't wear both hats at the same time. If I had to
choose between having the best boat and having The Race be a
success, the choice would be easy. My place is not necessarily on
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   He may still change his mind, but for now Peyron is more
interested in marketing than manning sails; more interested in
announcing a third corporate sponsor and finalizing Barcelona as
the starting line (the finish line remains less certain). For the
moment, there are 10 official challengers, including Loick and the
Whitbread veterans Ross Field and Grant Dalton of New Zealand and
Lawrie Smith of Britain. The American tycoon Steve Fossett, whose
trans-Pacific record Bruno Peyron broke and whose latest attempt to
circumnavigate the world in a balloon ended halfway, in the Pacific
off Hawaii, on Friday, has also expressed an interest, as have
nearly 70 other groups. Most of them, Peyron knows, lack the
financial or tactical means to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   When those who do race in The Race finally finish sometime in
March 2001, Peyron hopes that the crowd that greets them does not
simply shout out its congratulations. He wants murmurs; communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine this giant catamaran 37 meters long with 15
aboard coming into port,'' he said. ``The guys' faces will look
like all of ours do after moments like this: ugly but pretty. They
are coming from another world. They have seen something different,
and it can be seen in their eyes that they have not just finished a
tennis match.''

   IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is a full-blown
Senate trial of President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight existence of the Supreme
Court into the glare of the public spotlight. This raises the the
intriguing prospect of watching a man accustomed to being very much
in charge of a very controllable environment navigate in a realm
where normal expectations don't apply. By Linda Greenhouse. WITH

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SOUTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ The impeachments of Presidents
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, 130 years apart, both show how
potent the North-South divide can be. With Johnson, it reflected
the aftermath of the Civil War. With Clinton, it comes at a time
when conservative Southerners hold virtually all of the Republican
leadership positions in Congress. Southerners have also been the
prime advocates of impeachment. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ However it's defined, adultery and
its lies have generated a vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in
many cultures, an almost universal body of common law. A look at
some examples.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Millions of American students
still study French, despite the fading significance of France and
its language. French has ceded to English its longtime standing as
the first language of diplomacy. It has fewer speakers worldwide
than many other languages. So is French being taught out of
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global
economy? By Jacques Steinber. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While Americans have long held
a canine enthusiasm for burying objects of value for later
discovery, they lack a sense of ``stewardship,'' according to the
International Time Capsule Society. Of the tens of thousands of
time capsules already buried across the United States, most will
probably be lost, destroyed or otherwise prevented from passing on
their legacy. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>

   SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Almost every state has raised
its highway speed limit in what has become an unofficial test of
the long-held belief that speed kills. Three years into the test,
the answer is still unclear. By Matthew Wald.

<P>
   AIDS-BEGINNINGS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Research indicates that
the AIDS virus came into existence in the 1940s or '50s in Africa.
If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could the
virus, which now threatens to kill a quarter of Africa, have gone
virtually unnoticed for decades _ and then emerged in America,
decimating gays and hemophiliacs in the 1980s and starting on a
ruthless march around the world? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. officials from President
Clinton on down are taking the threat of germ warfare very
seriously, with thousands of people and billions of dollars in
motion to address it. Is this prudence or paranoia? By William J.
Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the U.S. bombing of Iraq, the
stalemate continues. The U.S. has used one of the pillars of its
containment policy _ the threat of force _ but not used it
thoroughly. And the other pillars of U.S. policy toward Iraq are
now wobbling. By Serge Schmemann.

   CHINA-DISSIDENTS-REVIEW (Beijing) _ China's recent crackdowns on
dissidents came at the end of a year when China's rigid political
system had seemed to be relaxing its grip, and dashed hopes that
China was poised for change. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   History, the Polls Say, Is In the Eye of the Beholder
</P>
<P>
   Scholars called President Clinton's impeachment historic, but
judging by what people told pollsters, the public cared more about
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center sampled public opinion before, during
and after the House impeachment vote. About 34 percent of those
queried said they followed the impeachment drama ``very closely'' _
compared to 39 percent who cared that much about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptical journalists raised their eyebrows, noting that the
participants in the long-running Pew survey said they found the
1996 presidential election more compelling than the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales.

<P>
   Improved fertility treatments and a growing demand from
infertile couples has created a global surge in multiple births _
triplets or more _ from 1,034 in 1971 to 4,973 in 1995 in the
United States alone. The latest case was the birth last week of
octuplets to a Houston woman. It started doctors worrying anew
about the ethical issues raised.

   ``This is not a victory,'' said Dr. Benjamin Younger of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``A lot of these kids

   Lifting his hand in the air, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu voted to bring down his own government two years early,
sheepishly joining an overwhelming majority vote by a fed-up
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, had depended on a
right-wing coalition that fell apart after he signed the
land-for-security peace plan at the White House in October.
Although he won back some on the right by freezing compliance with
the plan due to what he called multiple Palestinian violations, his
government had become irreparably dysfunctional.

   Catching a Smuggler
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. pleaded guilty to
federal criminal charges and admitted that it had helped a
smuggling ring funnel millions of cigarettes into Canada in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea, by RJR's Northern Brands International unit,
marked the first time that a tobacco company had been convicted of
complicity in the shadowy world of international cigarette
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the smuggling helped the company get around
high Canadian taxes meant to discourage cigarette smoking, and
critics said the conviction could undercut the industry's efforts
to block an increase in cigarette taxes in the United States.

   Christmas found three of the world's greatest balloonists down

non-stop. In at least 22 previous attempts at global
circumnavigation, no balloonist had ever come this close to
success.

   The 160-foot-high ICO Global Challenge ended its voyage when it

avoid all the countries where hostile governments would have forced
them down but fought their way through storms, uncooperative winds

   Relief for Angina
</P>
<P>
   One injection of an experimental drug directly into the heart
through a small incision in the chest has greatly relieved, even
eliminated, the chest pain of angina that standard drugs and bypass
surgery had failed to control, according to preliminary findings
from two continuing studies in the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   One drug is gene therapy to produce a protein called vegF, for
vascular endothelial growth factor. The other drug is a protein
called FGF-1, for fibroblast growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts urged caution for a number of reasons. One
is the small numbers _ about 25 patients have been tested so far.
Another is uncertainty about the duration of benefit because the
first patient was treated only 10 months ago. A third is that for
ethical reasons no patient could receive a placebo as a scientific
control to allow more rigorous comparison.

the 1996 Olympics and handed out six-figure salaries to their
stars, it could not attract the corporate funds and television
deals necessary for survival. A third of the way through its third
season, it said it will file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV exposure is critical to sponsors, licensees and
investors,'' said ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that, although we had the best product, we
could not find enough people willing to confront the NBA and give
us the major sponsorships and TV contracts we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vaccine for Lyme Disease
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration cautiously approved the
marketing of a Lyme disease vaccine for the first time last week.
It is intended for those who live or work in grassy or wooded areas
where ticks infected with the Lyme bacteria abound.
</P>
<P>
   Optimal protection requires three injections spaced over a year,
but effectiveness is 78 percent and those vaccinated still must
guard against ticks. Approval was only for people 15 to 70 years
old.

   History, the Polls Say, Is In the Eye of the Beholder
</P>
<P>
   Scholars called President Clinton's impeachment historic, but
judging by what people told pollsters, the public cared more about
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center sampled public opinion before, during
and after the House impeachment vote. About 34 percent of those
queried said they followed the impeachment drama ``very closely'' _
compared to 39 percent who cared that much about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptical journalists raised their eyebrows, noting that the
participants in the long-running Pew survey said they found the
1996 presidential election more compelling than the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales.

   Babies, Texas Style  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Improved fertility treatments and a growing demand from
infertile couples has created a global surge in multiple births _
triplets or more _ from 1,034 in 1971 to 4,973 in 1995 in the
United States alone. The latest case was the birth last week of
octuplets to a Houston woman. It started doctors worrying anew
about the ethical issues raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory,'' said Dr. Benjamin Younger of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``A lot of these kids
survive but, unfortunately, they survive with major handicaps.''

   Feed Up in Israel  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lifting his hand in the air, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu voted to bring down his own government two years early,
sheepishly joining an overwhelming majority vote by a fed-up
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, had depended on a
right-wing coalition that fell apart after he signed the
land-for-security peace plan at the White House in October.
Although he won back some on the right by freezing compliance with
the plan due to what he called multiple Palestinian violations, his
government had become irreparably dysfunctional.

   Catching a Smuggler
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. pleaded guilty to
federal criminal charges and admitted that it had helped a
smuggling ring funnel millions of cigarettes into Canada in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea, by RJR's Northern Brands International unit,
marked the first time that a tobacco company had been convicted of
complicity in the shadowy world of international cigarette
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the smuggling helped the company get around
high Canadian taxes meant to discourage cigarette smoking, and
critics said the conviction could undercut the industry's efforts
to block an increase in cigarette taxes in the United States.

   Balloonists' Saga
</P>
<P>
   Christmas found three of the world's greatest balloonists down
in the Pacific Ocean, half way to their goal of circling the Earth
non-stop. In at least 22 previous attempts at global
circumnavigation, no balloonist had ever come this close to
success.
</P>
<P>
   The 160-foot-high ICO Global Challenge ended its voyage when it
hit a low-pressure system over the ocean. Still, its crew _ Richard
Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett _ will be accorded a
special place in ballooning archives. They managed not only to
avoid all the countries where hostile governments would have forced
them down but fought their way through storms, uncooperative winds
and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to have let people down,'' Branson said, speaking
to his London headquarters.

   Relief for Angina
</P>
<P>
   One injection of an experimental drug directly into the heart
through a small incision in the chest has greatly relieved, even
eliminated, the chest pain of angina that standard drugs and bypass
surgery had failed to control, according to preliminary findings
from two continuing studies in the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   One drug is gene therapy to produce a protein called vegF, for
vascular endothelial growth factor. The other drug is a protein
called FGF-1, for fibroblast growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts urged caution for a number of reasons. One
is the small numbers _ about 25 patients have been tested so far.
Another is uncertainty about the duration of benefit because the
first patient was treated only 10 months ago. A third is that for
ethical reasons no patient could receive a placebo as a scientific
control to allow more rigorous comparison.

   A League of Their Own
</P>
<P>
   As the National Basketball Association moves toward a January
deadline meant to jumpstart the season or cancel it, the American
Basketball League simply ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ABL, a rival of the NBA-backed Women's National
Basketball Association, had built up teams with gold medalists from
the 1996 Olympics and handed out six-figure salaries to their
stars, it could not attract the corporate funds and television

   Thousands of gas stations and thousands more school districts,
fire departments and trash collectors that store fuel in
potentially leaky underground tanks face fines of up to $11,000 a
day unless they shut them down.

   The deadline, set 10 years ago by the Environmental Protection

   A Standoff Over Bananas &QL;

<P>
   A tip to holiday party-givers: If you are planning on serving
pecorino Romano cheese, stock up now. Same thing goes for those who
just can't make it through the next few months without another
gold-nibbed Mont Blanc pen.
</P>
<P>
   Those goodies are on the Clinton administration hit list in the
latest move in the banana wars. When it comes to the rules for
importing and exporting bananas, Europeans can't seem to go along
to get along. It's gotten so nasty of late that President Clinton
told Europe that unless it complies with a World Trade Organization
ruling to open its banana market, he will slap 100 percent tariffs
on $500 million in European goods, perhaps as soon as February.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one of his economic aides put it the other day, ``You can
kiss that pecorino goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is to force the Europeans to comply with
the ruling, which makes the banana issue a test of the world's new
dispute settlement system for trade.
</P>
<P>
   But like most post-Cold War conflicts, this one is a lot more
complicated than it appears. Latin American and Carribbean nations
that produce bananas have enormous swaths of their economies at
stake. And it means a lot to Dole Food Co. and Chiquita Brands,
which insist that Washington must stand up for its overseas
interests. Only cynics would suggest that it helps that Carl
Lindner, who controls Chiquita, is known as a generous donor to
both parties. _ By DAVID E. SANGER

   Good Times Foil a Genre
</P>
<P>
   Oh, where have all the trench coats gone?
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, there were communists under every bed, and
America and the Soviet Union were always within one scrap of
microfilm _ hidden in, say, a priceless sculpture or the heel of
shoe _ of blowing each other to Technicolor smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   And writers of spy thrillers were whispering all the way to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War is deader than a double agent gunned down in a
frigid Moscow back alley, and while the world can still be a
decidedly treacherous place _ think of Iraq or Kosovo, or Capitol
Hill _ the espionage novel is whimpering out in the cold. Today's
conflicts, one publisher said, just aren't as sexy as ``the good
old Americans against the communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Tales by the likes of John le Carre, Frederick Forsyth and Ken
Follett, which once staked out the best-seller lists for months at
a time, now make, at best, fleeting appearances.
</P>
<P>
   What's a self-respecting spy author to do? Go into politics?
Start a talk show? No, they're just yanking off the trench coats
and slipping into something a little more, well, millennial. Or so
they hope.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth, noted for ``The Odessa File,'' has changed both
publishing house and agent (``literary,'' not ``secret,'' that is)
and written a sequel to the 1910 novel ``The Phantom of the Opera''
called ``The Phantom of Manhattan.'' It has something to do with
cleaning fish in Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   Follett's latest is ``The Hammer of Eden,'' populated by aging
hippie eco-terrorists. And le Carre's next book, ``Single &AMP;
Single,'' promises heavy breathing and sinister doings in the world
of international finance. (It begins with the execution of the
ultimate 1990s villain: a lawyer.)
</P>
<P>
   So is the Cold War literary history? Maybe someday it will come
back as nostalgia. ``You have to wait,'' said Charles McCarry, a
novelist and former officer of the CIA, ``for the Cold War to be
quaint as a little Napoleonic war.''

<P>
   The words, spoken by a Mississippi congressman during the peak
of the Reagan era, first to a gathering of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and later to a magazine that extols the virtues of the
Confederacy, hardly have the sound of mainstream politics:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of the fundamental principles that
Jefferson Davis believed in are very important to people across the
country, and they apply to the Republican Party,'' the congressman
told Southern Partisan magazine in 1984. He added that the
Republican agenda ``from tax policy, to foreign policy, from
individual rights to neighborhood security are things that
Jefferson Davis and his people believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the impeachment of President Clinton moves inexorably to
the Senate, those statements by Trent Lott, who is now the majority
leader of the Senate, serve as a reminder of a striking link
between the impeachment of Clinton and the only other presidential
impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both played out on a sharp regional fault line. For Johnson, the
divide reflected the aftermath of the Civil War. The issues
surrounding Clinton's statements under oath about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky have nothing to do with North and South, but
they come at a time when conservative Southerners hold virtually
all of the Republican leadership positions in Congress. Southerners
have also been the prime advocates of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The revulsion over Clinton's conduct crosses both sides of the
aisle, and Southerners have no monopoly on the sentiment that if
Clinton lied under oath, he should be removed from office. Still,
these two cases of presidential impeachment, 130 years apart, show
how potent the regional political divide can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when New York Gov. George Pataki decried the
``horrible blunders'' of Republicans in Washington, he was
referring, whether consciously or not, to a congressional
delegation as dominated by angry Southerners as the Republicans of
Johnson's era were dominated by vengeful Northerners intent on
punishing the defeated South through Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised that there's been so little discussion of
how much this whole process has been driven by the Southernization
of the Republican Party,'' said Dan Carter, a historian at Emory
University in Atlanta. ``Maybe it's like the purloined letter: It's
sitting there on the shelf right in front of you, so you don't see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southerner as Johnson was, has his harshest critics
in his native South, where the values that inflame conservatives
are most intense. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found
support for impeachment higher in the South than in any other part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the Congress that ended with the president's impeachment, the
Republicans in the House had a speaker, Newt Gingrich, from
Georgia; a majority leader, Dick Armey, from Texas, and a majority
whip, Tom DeLay, from Texas. The Senate's majority leader, Lott,
won his job by defeating the other senator from Mississippi, Thad
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich stepped down, Bob Livingston of Louisiana was
designated to succeed him. Impeachment's first and most vocal
proponent has been Bob Barr of Georgia, and the possibility of
censure was ruled out as an option by DeLay, who stepped into the
leadership vacuum left by Gingrich's decision to step down.
Livingston has since announced his own resignation after
acknowledging extramarital infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan, began his tenure
amid furious controversy when it was revealed that Sens. Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina met with David Sentelle
of North Carolina, Helms' protege and the conservative judge who
heads the appellate panel that appointed Starr, before Starr was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Southern Republican who has played a major role in
the House has been Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. But Hyde has always voted like a
Southerner, with a 100 percent rating by the Christian Coalition
and a legislative career most identified with his support of a ban
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, though, tend to see more differences than
similarities between the two impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   Carter of Emory notes that Johnson's impeachment revolved around
profound national issues, with House Republicans bitterly opposing
the president's lenient approach to the South's re-entry to the
Union and his relative indifference to the rights of 3.5 million
newly emancipated blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate perjury as an issue,'' Carter said,
``but I think you have to keep your eye on the triviality of the
issues here compared to those of 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian, said
both efforts grew out of deeply held animus toward the president
with impeachment a vehicle for much broader divisions. But
Johnson's impeachment reflected profound political differences, he
said. Clinton has largely adopted many of the conservative
positions of those who detest him, Foner said. And he noted that
the regional divide now is less North and South and more the
burgeoning suburbs of the South and West versus the older areas of
the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a more revealing comparison than Johnson's
impeachment was the Democratic Party of the 1850s. ``It became so
totally dominated by Southerners, it led the South to disaster,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a risk for Republicans now as they fly in the
face of public opinion is something many politicians are pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners revel in the South's new-found Republicanism.
One T-shirt shows the Confederate battle flag in the form of a
Republican elephant with the words ``Lincoln's Worst Nightmare!''
The back features the flags of the Southern states and the words
``A States Rights Republican Majority From Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans worry about appearing too Southern. Some
see the likely election of Dennis Hastert of Illinois as the next
speaker as an attempt, at least in part, to provide more balance
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, regional passions need not be faulty ones. Historians
generally think that impeaching Johnson may have been a mistake,
but the so-called radical Republicans were correct in their outrage
over his policies. Today's Republicans may be proved right for
their outrage toward Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the current cast of Southern Republicans can lead

Black, an Emory political scientist.

   The words, spoken by a Mississippi congressman during the peak
of the Reagan era, first to a gathering of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and later to a magazine that extols the virtues of the
Confederacy, hardly have the sound of mainstream politics:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of the fundamental principles that
Jefferson Davis believed in are very important to people across the
country, and they apply to the Republican Party,'' the congressman
told Southern Partisan magazine in 1984. He added that the
Republican agenda ``from tax policy, to foreign policy, from
individual rights to neighborhood security are things that
Jefferson Davis and his people believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the impeachment of President Clinton moves inexorably to
the Senate, those statements by Trent Lott, who is now the majority
leader of the Senate, serve as a reminder of a striking link
between the impeachment of Clinton and the only other presidential
impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both played out on a sharp regional fault line. For Johnson, the
divide reflected the aftermath of the Civil War. The issues
surrounding Clinton's statements under oath about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky have nothing to do with North and South, but
they come at a time when conservative Southerners hold virtually
all of the Republican leadership positions in Congress. Southerners
have also been the prime advocates of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The revulsion over Clinton's conduct crosses both sides of the
aisle, and Southerners have no monopoly on the sentiment that if
Clinton lied under oath, he should be removed from office. Still,
these two cases of presidential impeachment, 130 years apart, show
how potent the regional political divide can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when New York Gov. George Pataki decried the
``horrible blunders'' of Republicans in Washington, he was
referring, whether consciously or not, to a congressional
delegation as dominated by angry Southerners as the Republicans of
Johnson's era were dominated by vengeful Northerners intent on
punishing the defeated South through Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised that there's been so little discussion of
how much this whole process has been driven by the Southernization
of the Republican Party,'' said Dan Carter, a historian at Emory
University in Atlanta. ``Maybe it's like the purloined letter: It's
sitting there on the shelf right in front of you, so you don't see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southerner as Johnson was, has his harshest critics
in his native South, where the values that inflame conservatives
are most intense. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found
support for impeachment higher in the South than in any other part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the Congress that ended with the president's impeachment, the
Republicans in the House had a speaker, Newt Gingrich, from
Georgia; a majority leader, Dick Armey, from Texas, and a majority
whip, Tom DeLay, from Texas. The Senate's majority leader, Lott,
won his job by defeating the other senator from Mississippi, Thad
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich stepped down, Bob Livingston of Louisiana was
designated to succeed him. Impeachment's first and most vocal
proponent has been Bob Barr of Georgia, and the possibility of
censure was ruled out as an option by DeLay, who stepped into the
leadership vacuum left by Gingrich's decision to step down.
Livingston has since announced his own resignation after
acknowledging extramarital infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan, began his tenure
amid furious controversy when it was revealed that Sens. Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina met with David Sentelle
of North Carolina, Helms' protege and the conservative judge who
heads the appellate panel that appointed Starr, before Starr was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Southern Republican who has played a major role in
the House has been Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. But Hyde has always voted like a
Southerner, with a 100 percent rating by the Christian Coalition
and a legislative career most identified with his support of a ban
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, though, tend to see more differences than
similarities between the two impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   Carter of Emory notes that Johnson's impeachment revolved around
profound national issues, with House Republicans bitterly opposing
the president's lenient approach to the South's re-entry to the
Union and his relative indifference to the rights of 3.5 million
newly emancipated blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate perjury as an issue,'' Carter said,
``but I think you have to keep your eye on the triviality of the
issues here compared to those of 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian, said
both efforts grew out of deeply held animus toward the president
with impeachment a vehicle for much broader divisions. But
Johnson's impeachment reflected profound political differences, he
said. Clinton has largely adopted many of the conservative
positions of those who detest him, Foner said. And he noted that
the regional divide now is less North and South and more the
burgeoning suburbs of the South and West versus the older areas of
the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a more revealing comparison than Johnson's
impeachment was the Democratic Party of the 1850s. ``It became so
totally dominated by Southerners, it led the South to disaster,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a risk for Republicans now as they fly in the
face of public opinion is something many politicians are pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners revel in the South's new-found Republicanism.
One T-shirt shows the Confederate battle flag in the form of a
Republican elephant with the words ``Lincoln's Worst Nightmare!''
The back features the flags of the Southern states and the words
``A States Rights Republican Majority From Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans worry about appearing too Southern. Some
see the likely election of Dennis Hastert of Illinois as the next
speaker as an attempt, at least in part, to provide more balance
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, regional passions need not be faulty ones. Historians
generally think that impeaching Johnson may have been a mistake,
but the so-called radical Republicans were correct in their outrage
over his policies. Today's Republicans may be proved right for
their outrage toward Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the current cast of Southern Republicans can lead
the GOP to long-term majority status is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can sell the Republicans as the party of
Jefferson Davis and have a viable national party,'' said Merle
Black, an Emory political scientist.

<P>
   In a windowless room two stories below ground level, Lyudmila
Zavlyanova sits in what could be a scene from the Cold War. People
are hunched in front of computers in cramped cubicles, speaking to
one another in hushed tones in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   But they are in New Jersey and this is an entirely different
kind of global struggle: the code war.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zavlyanova and about 40 other immigrants from the former
Soviet Union are in the sub-basement of the Newark headquarters of
Public Service Electric and Gas Co., New Jersey's largest utility.
They are here not because they understand Russian but rather Cobol,
a computer language that runs many of the United States' mainframe
computers but is so old that relatively few American programmers
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zavlyanova, a 27-year-old from New York, is one of tens of
thousands of programmers throughout the world racing to head off
the havoc that could ensue because many of the computers that
underpin today's wired society do not understand that a year can
begin with a number other than 19.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues have spent the better part of this year
painstakingly sifting through a program consisting of 7 million
lines of code that, to the uninitiated, resembles gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just to fix one program. In all, Public Service has
728 programs with a total of 46 million lines written in 27
programming languages. How well they are fixed or replaced could
determine whether the lights and heat stay on in New Jersey come
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem far away. But the Y2K problem, as it is known in
computer jargon, is already draining hundreds of billions of
dollars from companies and governments struggling to tame what some
call the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The direst situations that are predicted _ financial chaos,
societal strife, food shortages and persistent, widespread
blackouts _ are highly improbable. But it is not hard to find
reputable alarmists _ computer experts who say they will not fly or
schedule surgery at the onset of the year 2000, or even an
economist who predicts that the computer bug could set off a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of disruptions has already hit, with 40 percent
of the largest U.S. and European companies experiencing at least
minor breakdowns because some software has already had to deal with
dates in 2000 and beyond. Many retailers have had difficulty
processing credit cards that expired in 2000 or later, for example.
At BankBoston, some ATM cards were seized because cash machines
responded as if the cards had expired in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Another spate of disruptions could begin on the first day of
1999, because a host of other computer programs _ like those used
to prepare budgets, schedule appointments and pay unemployment
benefits _ deal with dates up to one year in the future.
</P>
<P>
   All the threat stems from the fact, by now well known, that
computer programs frequently use two digits to represent years,
like 98 for 1998. So when 1999 ends, computers might appear baffled
about what comes next or might respond as if 00 means 1900 instead
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Afflicted machines could crash or, just as dangerously, spew out
erroneous data. With computers running everything from power grids
to bank machines to air traffic control, the range of services that
could be affected is vast.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has proved more intractable and expensive to fix
than most experts had expected. The Gartner Group, a consulting
firm, estimates that the Y2K problem will cost the world $1
trillion to $2 trillion, as much as $300 for every man, woman and
child on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest business problem in human history,'' said
Capers Jones, a software expert and year 2000 alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 activity swirls far beyond computer programmers like
Mrs. Zavlyanova, sweeping up lawyers, insurance companies,
government regulators and even many ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Other electronic equipment besides computers may also be
vulnerable. So engineers everywhere are clambering over pipes,
behind walls and into closets in a giant scavenger hunt for
computer chips that control factories, oil platforms, aircraft,
traffic lights and building-security systems.
</P>
<P>
   New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, for instance, is
determining whether 16,000 medical devices _ electrocardiographs,
infusion pumps, defibrillators and even beds _ will work correctly
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is also becoming a cultural phenomenon,
appearing in comic strips and Hollywood screenplays. For those
prone to believe that the apocalypse is coming with the start of
the new millennium, the millennium bug looks like the means to the
end, a digital echo of Noah's flood.
</P>
<P>
   For many more people the Y2K problem plays on a sense of unease
that society is growing dependent on a lattice of technology that
is now so far-reaching, interconnected and complex that no one
completely understands it, not even the priesthood that writes its
digital code.
</P>
<P>
   Many moves toward economic efficiency _ automation, just-in-time
delivery of parts to factories, globalization _ have been aided by
computers. Yet those same practices now make the economy more
vulnerable to computer malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Several potential Y2K problems have been discovered during
simulations. When Chrysler Corp. set the clocks on the electronic
equipment at one of its factories ahead to 2000, for example, the
security system locked all the doors. Such problems can be readily
fixed, one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The fear, though, is that the early days of 2000 could bring a
huge flood of them. Many experts say there is simply too much
software left to fix and too many microchips to check before the
immovable deadline. Still, they say, there is time to reduce the
impact by fixing what is possible and making contingency plans for
failures that cannot be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   The school board in Albuquerque, N.M., recently voted to keep
the city's public schools closed in the first week of January 2000
to make sure that the district has time to repair unexpected
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say caution is in order, but not panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of disaster is still fundamentally our choice,''
Howard Rubin, an information technology consultant, said.

   The year 2000 problem raises vexing questions for consumers.
Most home appliances and cars should work fine, manufacturers say,
though many people will have to test and fix personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But a few people have gone even further. Nervous residents in
more than 200 U.S. cities have formed community preparedness
groups, advising neighbors and urging local officials to make
contingency plans, like setting up emergency food banks, shelters
and neighborhood-based power generation. Many groups passed out
leaflets at shopping centers before Christmas with Y2K-inspired
shopping suggestions, like first-aid kits, firewood and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best chance I would have would be to be in a community
that is well prepared,'' said Jay Golter, 42, a financial analyst
at a federal agency who went to a PTA meeting at his son's school
in Springfield, Va., last January and invited the other parents to
a strategy session on the Y2K problem. When the day came, no one
showed up. But gradually concern took root, and the Northern
Virginia Year 2000 Community Action Group now boasts more than 200
members.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder, Colo., where people who are worried about the year
2000 problem are organizing neighborhood by neighborhood, some 70
residents of the 80304 zip code gathered in a school recently to
listen to Kathy Garcia, a specialist in group dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking people to prepare for four months, enough to get
you through the winter,'' Ms. Garcia said, detailing how her family
spent $600 setting aside a supply of rice, beans and other staples.
The group then discussed plans to ask grocers to stock foods that
would be needed in a crisis. They fretted about how to ask
neighbors, without seeming intrusive, about special medical needs,
so hospitals could be asked to prepare. Then they broke into pairs
to practice approaching strangers to discuss the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to foster more cooperation nationally
among the community groups, which are already loosely linked
through the Cassandra Project, a group in Louisville, Colo., that
operates a widely used Web site dedicated to Y2K concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Some alarmists scoff at the notion that such organizing will
stave off the societal breakdown they see coming from large-scale
computer failures. So in a throwback to the bomb-shelter mania of
decades past, they are moving to rural areas, drilling wells,
setting up generators and even buying guns to fend off the hordes
they fear will come from the broken cities in search of food.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs are catering to the survivalists, selling
everything from seeds to wooden ``survival domes,'' or even trying
to develop entire communities.
</P>
<P>
   God's Wilderness, in Finland, Minn., bills itself as a
relocation site for Christians, offering land complete with cabin,
well, pump, stove, greenhouse, shed and outhouse. David and Johanna
Hecker, who own the site, say on their Web page that they knew
nothing about Y2K worries until they tried to sell some land and
got inquiries from people looking for a place to escape.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say that preparations like stockpiling food and
withdrawing savings are unnecessary and will only invite burglars
and rats. In addition, business leaders and public officials have
already begun to worry that such hoarding could produce the very
chaos that some doomsayers had predicted from computer breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, for instance, recently suggested that
people fill the gas tanks of their cars just before Jan. 1, 2000.
But the gasoline distribution network may not be able to handle
such demand, as was proved by the 1979 oil crisis when millions of
Americans waited in lines, drove up prices and in some cases got
into fights in the mistaken belief that oil imports were drying up.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers are especially worried about possible major withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board has already said it will set aside an
extra $50 billion of currency reserves at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get down to 1999, the retail public is going to panic
and want cash, and we better have it for them,'' said David Iacino,
head of the year 2000 program at BankBoston.

   How a Money-Saver Became So Costly
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug is not really a bug at all, in the sense of a
coding error. Using two digits to represent the year was considered
a clever way in the 1950s and 1960s to save expensive computer
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Kappelman, co-chairman of the year 2000 working group for
the Society for Information Management, estimates that use of
two-digit years in a program written in the 1960s would have saved
more than $1 million per billion bytes of data stored over the
following 30 years. Those savings would more than offset the cost
of fixing the code now to handle the change to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But through force of habit, programmers continued to use
two-digit years well into the 1990s, even as data-storage costs
dropped to one-ten-thousandth of their 1960s level. Denver's $4.3
billion international airport, styled as the airport of the future
when it opened only three years ago, is spending millions to ensure
that its safety and flight information systems are free of Y2K
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, some programmers foresaw problems in 2000, but
the danger seemed theoretical. Computer technology was changing so
rapidly it was assumed that programs with two-digit years would be
retired long before 2000. Instead, it was the programmers, not the
programs, who retired first.
</P>
<P>
   Even when companies realized the problem, they procrastinated
about fixing it. Data-processing managers, constantly swamped by
demands for new programs, did not dare propose devoting resources
to a problem that would not hit for many years. Some assumed that a
quick fix would be invented as the deadline neared.
</P>
<P>
   The information-processing department at Bank of America awarded
a plaque in the late 1980s to the first manager with a program that
encountered a year 2000 problem. But the bank did not start fixing
its code until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even those who saw the trouble coming are finding how
deep-rooted two-digit coding is. Ronald Asala, director of
technology services at Zurich American Insurance Group in
Schaumburg, Ill., remembers ordering programmers who were writing
claims-processing software in 1986 and 1987 to use four-digit
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have sworn on a stack of Bibles that the system was
Y2K-compliant,'' Asala said. But a recent test found 18 two-digit
functions, two of which would have stopped the program cold.

<P>
   The Code War
</P>
<P>
   A Battle Fought Line by Line
</P>
<P>
   If writing a new program is software's equivalent of carpentry,
Y2K work is more like asbestos removal. It is a job as tedious as
replacing all the light bulbs in Las Vegas but not as easy, because
much of the software was written years ago by programmers who have
quit or retired.
</P>
<P>
   The repair project undertaken by Public Service Electric and Gas
is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zavlyanova works for Keane Inc., a contractor for the
utility. Because programmers are in short supply, Keane offered
$1,000 bonuses to employees who recruited their friends, and word
quickly spread through the Soviet immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   These programmers are fixing the software that keeps track of
bills and other data related to the utility's 2 million electricity
customers. An error in any one of the 7 million lines of this
program could cause problems in billing and service.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zavlyanova and her colleagues are the final backstop in a
search through every line of code for places that contain two-digit
years. Sometimes such work is straightforward because programmers
refer to dates using abbreviations like YR or DT. But in other
cases the designations are quirkier and not obvious, like the names
of movie characters or the programmer's acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   One day this summer, Mrs. Zavlyanova was inspecting a tiny
523-line segment. A special computer program had already quickly
scanned all 523 lines, picking out 18 with numbers that could be
dates.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lines contained the name of a 25-digit serial
number. Suspicious, Mrs. Zavlyanova zeroed in on this segment and
there it was: a millennium bug! Six of the digits in the serial
number referred to a date: two for the month, two for the day and
only two for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question was how to repair it. The utility wanted to
expand the serial number to 27 digits, adding two digits to
represent the year.
</P>
<P>
   But such an expansion was not as easy as it sounded, because it
would throw off the position of the other numbers. A number that
was in position 15, which might have stood for, say, a customer's
geographic location, would move to position 17, which the program
might react to as if it refers to the meter reader's route number.
So expanding the serial number could require changes to many other
lines in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Before she undertook this task, however, Mrs. Zavlyanova checked
and found that another programmer who had encountered the serial
number in another part of the program had already expanded it. But
that programmer apparently made an error, so more work would be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K work isn't as easy as a lot of people think,'' said Mrs.
Zavlyanova, who has on her desk a certificate praising her as a top
performer. ``There are all kinds of complications that come up.''
</P>
<P>
   PSE&AMP;G is not fixing all its software. About 125 programs are
being replaced by new software that is free of Y2K problems. One
program is being scrapped because the company cannot find any
programmers who know the language in which it was written. Another
25 percent to 30 percent of the programs are being retired because
the company found that no one was using them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff that would print out downstairs and it would go
to someone and that person would be gone,'' said Vincent Scatuccio
Jr., who is in charge of software repair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few silver linings of the Y2K problem, Scatuccio
noted, is the chance to clear the cobwebs from a company's
data-processing operations.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, PSE&AMP;G is not expanding years to four digits in
most programs, but is instead using a technique called windowing.
Years are left as two digits but the computer is instructed to
interpret 00 to 49 as being 2000 to 2049, and 50 to 99 as 1950 to
1999. Of course, if the program is still in use in 2050, it will
have to be fixed again.
</P>
<P>
   As for crucial software that helps balance electricity supply
and demand, the utility is saving millions of dollars by not fixing
it at all, because the company plans to buy new software
eventually. Until then, it is simply setting the clock back so that
the program will function as if it is 1972 instead of 2000; the
dates in 1972 fall on the same days of the week as in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, is this: Despite these shortcuts,
despite budgeting $91.6 million for Y2K work and despite starting
its cleanup more than two years ago _ earlier than most utilities _
PSE&AMP;G will not finish on time. So, like many companies, it is
resorting to triage, fixing the most important programs first and
worrying about minor ones later.

   `Trust Nothing, Test Everything'
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, when most of the executives and tellers of
AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, Ala., were relaxing with their
families, computer specialists from the bank gathered in a run-down
former auditorium they called the ``war room'' and traveled through
time.
</P>
<P>
   They set the date on a multistate network of computers ahead to
the year 2000 and put the powerful machines through their paces,
crunching fake loan applications and money transfers. In another
room, bank employees repeatedly inserted and withdrew colorful play
money from automated teller machines, watching the balances on
their receipts rise and fall.

<P>
   The elaborate process was part of a test to make sure AmSouth
bank's computers will work in 2000. Experts say that even after
software is fixed, it should be tested, because some dates might
have been missed. In addition, the correction of one problem often
introduces another. The Internal Revenue Service mistakenly sent
default notices to 1,000 taxpayers because of an error made in
fixing the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 consultants say that testing could take up more than
half of a Y2K budget. Yet many companies, pressed for time, are
skimping on testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take a `trust nothing, test everything'
attitude,'' said Asala of Zurich American, chastened by his
encounter with the faulty Zurich code he had assumed was clean.
</P>
<P>
   That warning extends to software from outside vendors, who can
never fully test their products for all the ways they are used by
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found 10 major Y2K problems with applications vendors
told us they had tested and found compliant,'' Asala said, adding
that Zurich American's problem programs included software from
giants like IBM and Computer Associates, companies that Asala
credits with doing a good job on Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Smart testing requires cooperation between business partners
because computers routinely interact with other machines outside
the company, but it is not always possible. Bell Atlantic, whose
wires carry billions of dollars in financial transactions, said it
had more banks wanting to test with it than it could accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   There is a human toll too. Because computers are usually in use
during the day, testing often must be done at odd hours, which is
why the computer specialists at AmSouth Bank did their work at
night and over a weekend for five days in October, with workers
subsisting on snacks and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lambert, a systems manager, said she considered herself
lucky if she could say yes when her 14-year-old daughter called
asking, ``Mama, will you be home before midnight tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 1, 2000, was not the only date tested. One day the
computers were made to believe it was Jan. 3, the first business
day of 2000. Another time it was Feb. 29, a leap day. Then it was
March 31, 2000, the day the books would close for the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While programmers worked in the war room, technicians in Chicago
were busy executing mock money transfers to AmSouth's big clients.
Employees at AmSouth's phone service center in Pensacola, Fla., at
a check-processing office in Atlanta and at a branch in a
Birmingham suburb were all participating.
</P>
<P>
   The far-flung electronic menagerie was also linked to a computer
center in North Bergen, N.J., that is usually rented to companies
whose own computers are disabled by a natural disaster. Comdisco,
the owner of this disaster recovery site, has found a sideline in
leasing such sites for Y2K testing.
</P>
<P>
   AmSouth's test went well. The only glitch found was one that
would have prevented AmSouth from signing up new bank-by-phone
customers on Feb. 29, 2000. Sara Simon, the technician who had
originally installed the program, identified the error within two
hours. It was quickly corrected, setting off a round of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But no testing program can cover all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I call it the year 2000 lottery,'' said Donald
Estes, a testing expert in Lexington, Mass. ``Some will do a lot
and still get hit. Some won't do enough and luck out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hidden Problem
</P>
<P>
   At the Mercy of Microchips
</P>
<P>
   If the year 2000 cleanup involved fixing only business software
it would be hard enough. But the potential for Y2K problems also
lurks in the tiny computers that have permeated all corners of
modern life. The flow of chemicals in a refinery, the injection of
fuel into automobile engines, even the flushing of some toilets is
controlled electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the controller is a single chip, like one in a factory
that merely opens or closes a valve based on readings from a
temperature sensor. In other cases, an entire computer with more
complex software is used.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that only a small percentage of such systems _
called embedded systems because the computer or chip is embedded in
some other piece of equipment _ will have date problems. But with
billions of such chips in use, even a small percentage is enough to
scare Y2K experts.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum's giant Grangemouth refinery complex
identified 2,132 embedded systems and found that 15 would fail in a
way that would shut down operations if they were not fixed, said
Ian Jenson, the project manager.
</P>
<P>
   The embedded-chip dimension of the Y2K problem surprised many
companies. International Paper Co. doubled its estimate of its year
2000 repair costs to $135 million, largely because it belatedly
identified vulnerable electronic controls in its mills.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations have turned up some good news. Despite
popular fears about airplanes falling from the sky, for instance,
Boeing Co. has concluded that there are only three embedded Y2K
defects in its aircraft, all easily dealt with and related to
navigation data.
</P>
<P>
   But medical equipment remains a major area of concern. The
Veterans Health Administration found a $150,000 machine used in
radiation therapy for cancer that could theoretically calculate
wrong dosages after 2000. The machine uses the date to calculate
the age of the patient and the strength of the radiation, which
decays over time. In the 1980s, several patients were killed
because of software errors in a different radiation machine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At New York Hospital, Louis Wetstein, a 31-year-old biomedical
engineer, is trying to determine the status of the hospital's
16,000 medical devices, about 2,500 of which contain
microprocessors. Robots and electronic machines perform tests on
vials of patients' blood without human intervention. Infusion pumps
deliver medication with a precision beyond human capability. Even
the beds contain microprocessors, which adjust the bed's position
and weigh the patient.
</P>
<P>
   To test an electrocardiograph machine, Wetstein and colleagues
first hooked it up to another electronic device that simulates a
heartbeat. Then they set the electrocardiograph's internal clock to
23:58 on 31-DEC-99 and waited two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The machine continued into 2000 without missing a beat, printing
the squiggly lines of an electrocardiogram on a strip of paper and
recording 00 as the year. A four-digit year would be ideal, but
this was not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clock was set back again to just before midnight for a
second test. But this time the machine was shut off. When it was
turned back on two minutes later, the printout still read 23:59.
The machine was stuck in the last century. The date on the printout
made no sense at all _ 03-MAR-A6, with A6 being an error code.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the machine was still able to record heart
rhythms, because it did not need to know the date to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Wetstein said he had found similar record-keeping problems with
some defibrillators and ventilators, but had never found a problem
that would cause the equipment to stop functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical equipment is not designed to stop working,'' Wetstein
said. ``It is designed to keep working. The failure is not to shut
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, incorrect date-stamping could pose legal problems or
contribute to incorrect diagnoses. At New York Hospital,
electrocardiograms are stored in a computer so doctors can log on
from their homes or offices. But if the dates were wrong, doctors
might conceivably not be able to find the EKG or might look at the
wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some experts say, even if a machine does not need to
have the date to perform its job, it might be built with
off-the-shelf components that do keep track of the date and might
shut themselves off if they cannot handle the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So to be safe, some companies are checking everything, and there
is disagreement on the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have surgery at midnight,'' Wetstein said confidently,
referring to the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the hospital's overall Y2K effort, Susan Auman,
whose background is in data processing, was more cautious, saying:
``I wouldn't schedule surgery. I wouldn't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Lawyers
</P>
<P>
   Efforts Stymied by Fear of Lawsuits
</P>
<P>
   One reason to test everything is to avoid being sued. The Y2K
problem has attracted armies of lawyers, who have done more than
anything else to elevate it from a concern of programmers to one of
top management.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are needed to deal with regulators like the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which are requiring companies to prepare Y2K plans and to disclose
their progress. In other cases, top management is worried about
being sued if computer malfunctions disrupt business enough to make
the stock plummet or hurt a customer.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem has led some law firms to set up
specialized Y2K practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bug that finally gives lawyers the opportunity to
rule the world,'' Evelyn Ashley, an Atlanta lawyer, said at one of
the several Y2K panels at this year's American Bar Association
meeting in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 lawsuits have been filed already, mainly focusing on
whether software companies like Intuit and Symantec are obligated
to provide free upgrades to programs that cannot handle the date
change. Other questions being raised in court include whether
insurance policies will cover damage caused by the year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But if legal fears have pushed companies to take the Y2K
situation more seriously, they have also made it harder to solve
the problem, because companies are afraid to disclose information
about problems they have.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' defensive instincts are generating volleys of
letters from companies to their suppliers, asking whether the
suppliers will be ready for 2000. Sometimes the letters come with a
threat to cut the supplier off if it is not moving fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The initial mailing from a group set up by five big automakers
surveyed 39,000 auto-parts manufacturers, because an entire
assembly line could be idled if even one crucial part were not
delivered. The airline industry has hired a consulting firm to
survey the air traffic control, fuel supply, luggage handling and
other systems at all 550 airports in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is sending letters to everyone,'' Iacino of
BankBoston said. ``We're like ants in an anthill. We're all
stepping on one another.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same lawyers who advise customers to query their
suppliers are advising the suppliers not to answer the queries, or
to answer them only vaguely. That is because statements about a
company's readiness can be used against it in court.
</P>
<P>
   The legal gridlock has caused alarm. ``We've got to get this
litigation monkey off our back so we can do our job,'' said Philip
Rock, who is supervising Y2K work at the Bell Atlantic operations
center in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Several medical groups and members of Congress have publicly
rebuked makers of medical devices for not disclosing information
about potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns, Congress hastily enacted a law in
October to shield companies from lawsuits based on wrong
information they provide, as long as the disclosure is neither
reckless nor fraudulent. But lawyers are advising that the law's
protections are limited, which has discouraged companies from
dropping their guard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K Economy
</P>
<P>
   New Strategies and New Jobs
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are only part of a whole new niche in the economy
created by vast spending on the Y2K problem. So many companies
offer fix-it services or software that stock indices have been
created to track them.
</P>
<P>
   Programmer shortages, though not as great as was initially
feared, have pushed salaries of Cobol experts to $75 an hour in
some cities. To retain its best programmers, Bank of America is
offering bonuses of up to $75,000, half not payable until May 2000.
Some of the work has been shifted to India and other countries
where programmers are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Retired or laid-off Cobol programmers are getting second
chances. Randall Bart, 41, of Torrance, Calif., who specializes in
Unisys mainframe software, could not get another programming job
after being laid off in 1988. ``I had dead-end experience,'' Bart
said. He worked as a poker dealer, among other odd jobs. But this
year, he found work as a programmer again, fixing millennium bugs
on the Unisys computer of a pen maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come 2001, I'll still have experience that people don't
want,'' he said. ``But at least I'll have made some money by
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are already moving away from some companies seen as
vulnerable to year 2000 problems. The stock of Executive Risk
Insurance of Hartford, Conn., dropped sharply in July after
Moody's, the credit-rating agency, said the company could face huge
claims from clients that experience business breakdowns in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, Global 2000, an international committee of
major banks, is planning to issue a report card on the readiness of
different countries in February, a move that politicians fear could
cause capital flight from lagging nations.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug is also helping reshape corporate strategies.
Corestates Financial Corp. of Philadelphia said the escalating cost
of technology, including year 2000 repair, was one reason it agreed
to be acquired this year by First Union Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 Massachusetts Medicaid patients were recently forced
out of the Tufts Health Plan because Tufts decided it could not
reprogram its computers to handle changes in Medicaid while also
fixing Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision for us because serving the
Medicaid population is part of our mission,'' said Richard Shoup,
Tufts' chief information officer. ``But this is about business
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 1, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Ready or Not, Deadline Nears
</P>
<P>
   As midnight approaches on Dec. 31, 1999, some people will be
happily participating in the greatest New Year's celebration of the
last 1,000 years. Others will be bracing for disaster. But the
final accounting will not necessarily come quickly. Indeed, Gartner
Group projects that less than 10 percent of the disruptions will
strike in the first two weeks of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities
in New York who built a strong following on Wall Street by
correctly forecasting the stock-market boom of the 1990s, has said
that there is a 70 percent probability that the millennium bug will
cause a worldwide recession equivalent to the one that followed the
1973 oil shock.
</P>
<P>
   Enough computers will fail, Yardeni argues, that economies will
not be able to maintain their current level of output. Many other
economists, however, think the economic impact will be more
transient, like that of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The clashing prognosticators agree that, like the weather
phenomenon El Nino, Y2K will be blamed for some problems in which
it has no role. But also like El Nino, Y2K problems are certain to
cause real disruptions. Many companies and government agencies are
simply too far behind to finish in time. And some that seem to be
on schedule will fall behind, because software projects are
notorious for missing deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Some big companies are confident that they will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be here that night because they'll probably want
me here, but I'll be here yawning,'' said Rock of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Green, Y2K manager for Public Service Electric and Gas,
had a similarly calm forecast. ``Hopefully on December 31, 1999,''
he said, ``the only ball dropping will be at Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini, the consulting firm, found in a survey of 1,680
multinational companies that spending on the year 2000 problem had
doubled in the six months ending in October, a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. companies had spent only 61 percent and
Europeans 48 percent of their year 2000 budgets, meaning that a
huge chunk of work still lies ahead. As of the end of the third
quarter, Chevron Corp. had spent only $40 million of its projected
$200 million to $300 million. And companies are finding the problem
more costly than they thought. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. raised its
budget in the last six months by $100 million, to $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost to fix the federal government systems has
almost tripled, to $6.4 billion from $2.3 billion in March 1997,
with numerous agencies, including the Defense Department, rated by
congressional overseers as hopelessly behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the big companies are ready in time and the federal
government catches up, surveys have shown that many small
businesses, as well as federal, state and local government
agencies, are way behind. So are many foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   A minister in Jamaica said it would take that Caribbean nation
until 2004 to be ready for the year 2000. Economic crises are
diverting attention in Russia and Asia, while European companies
must grapple not only with Y2K problems but also with the
reprogramming needed for the new currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, the Canadian consultant who is perhaps the
best-known year 2000 Paul Revere, now predicts that the world will
probably muddle through without the catastrophe he once foresaw. It
might not be a glorious goal, but many Y2K experts would be
delighted if it were attained. After all, the world is now so
dependent on computers that there is no going back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot go back, because the infrastructure that undergirded
our entire society 25 years ago has been dismantled,'' Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who is chairman of the special committee on the
year 2000 problem, said this summer. ``The skills are gone, the
people are gone, the equipment is gone. Like it or not, we have no
choice in this situation but to plow forward and, one way or the
other, make it work.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Out of the depths of the AIDS
epidemic sweeping Africa, an ugly truth is emerging: Some condom
makers have been dumping their substandard wares here and Africans
have been risking their lives on brittle, leaky or ill-fitting
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been particularly bad here in South Africa,
where, until last August, government officials were using a
procurement system that almost invited manufacturers to ship their
castoffs here.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that a scarcity of condoms and the refusal
of many men to use them are to blame for far more of Africa's 23
million HIV infections than faulty condoms are. And experts say
most condoms are perfectly good and that the influx of bad ones may
finally have been stemmed. But the deviousness or sloppiness of
some manufacturers and the failure of inspectors to catch them have
contributed to the disease's spread.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, couples who do practice safe sex have been left
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Chidonza, an AIDS-education worker in Cape Town, said
she has twice had condoms break during sex. Her boyfriend is not
infected with the AIDS virus, but she is. She is both afraid of
infecting him and afraid he would beat her if she did.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, condoms are not necessarily thought of as
life-saving medical devices. Here, however, infection with the
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, is rampant, and
virtually everyone infected will die of it because almost no one in
Africa can afford thousands of dollars for AIDS ``cocktails'' that
enable people to live with the disease. Condoms also prevent the
spread of venereal diseases and urinary tract infections, which can
produce sores that speed HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of condoms are handed out free on this
continent each year, paid for _ and tested _ by international aid
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, though, more than 4 million Kenzo brand condoms from
Polo Latex Co. of Calcutta are on their way back to India. They
were not tested before distribution, and complaints from Cape Town
prostitutes flooded in to SWEAT, the Sex Workers Education and
Advocacy Task Force, a community aid agency, which had handed
thousands out free.
</P>
<P>
   When they were checked, the results were shocking: As many as 48
out of 200 in some test batches broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them had sand inside the foil packets,'' said Andrew
Crichton, a national Health Department consultant. ``How do you
even do that? You practically have to have a guy inside the factory
throwing dirt into the machine. The cartons had water marks and
were disintegrating. They looked like they'd been around the world
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiru Moopen, assistant director of Inbeco, a Pretoria company
that imported the condoms, said her ``fingers were burnt'' in the
deal. Polo Latex ``claimed its factory was sabotaged,'' she said,
but it agreed to replace the goods.
</P>
<P>
   A consignment of Twin Lotus condoms from China is also being
recalled, and there have been problems with other brands.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no worldwide study of faulty condoms, said Bunmi
Makinwa, a distribution expert for UNAIDS in Geneva, but anecdotal
reports crop up. There have been occasional problems in Zimbabwe,
Cameroon, Rwanda, Zambia and Malawi. In 1993 in Zimbabwe, 24
million condoms made in Malaysia by Dongkuk Techo Rubber and paid
for by the British government failed tests. Fortunately, the
results came in before any were distributed, but fearing they would
be stolen and end up on the black market, Zimbabwe burned them.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where 25 percent of adults are now infected, it
took 18 months and $157,000 to replace them, even though Durex, a
London-based company making a high-quality, slightly more expensive
brand, sent ``emergency shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   Dongkuk later said its goods were rejected only because the
standards were raised after they were made. A British Embassy AIDS
educator denied that, calling it ``an excuse,'' but acknowledged
that Dongkuk now sells condoms elsewhere without problems.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was so embarrassing _ British aid officials were
``nearly court-martialed'' by Parliament, one expert joked _ that
the British aid agencies adopted far stricter testing rules, which
are now used in the many English-speaking countries for which they
buy condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms are made all over the world, but most factories are in
India, Malaysia, Thailand and China, where latex rubber and cheap
labor are available.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Blairman, a British condom-quality consultant, has toured
dozens of factories. ``The industry is a jungle,'' he said. ``Some
makers have very science-based companies with excellent
laboratories, and others are awful, staggering along with
broken-down machinery. Latex goes in one end, something comes out
at the other, and the buyer doesn't know the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``I don't think there's a plot to dump
substandard goods on Africa, but I'm sure there are individuals
planning to dump their bad merchandise anywhere they can get away
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, South Africa became a dumping ground because it
was rich enough to buy its own condoms. Its procurement officers
used an ineffective test regimen: Inspectors would visit a factory
once a year, test samples chosen by the factory and give it the
South African Bureau of Standards seal.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the Kenzo incident, the country met with a group of
consultants last August and then changed its regimen ``literally
within two weeks,'' said Margaret Usher, a World Health
Organization condom expert. Unfortunately, it had been importing
condoms for at least seven years, during which the epidemic here
grew from insignificance to 1,500 new infections a day, the fastest
rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has other problems. KwaZulu-Natal, the province
worst hit by HIV, ran out of condoms earlier this year because a
local Health Department official simply forgot to order more; a cry
for help went out to the country's other eight provinces, which
responded by shipping truckloads of expired condoms. A study of the
distribution chain found boxes of condoms that had been left for
months in overheated storerooms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, the same used by the British, American
and other big aid agencies, the purchaser collects about 1,000 test
samples at random, right at the factory, from each ``batch'' of
150,000 to 500,000. They are blown up with air or water until they
burst, or partly filled with water, tied and rolled on a blotter to
check for leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Only the batches that pass are shipped. Then, since condoms can
also deteriorate while stacked in the sun or crossing the equator
in freighters, more are tested on arrival. Testing can cost up to
10 percent of a contract.
</P>
<P>
   As an extra guarantee, manufacturers must post bonds, which
often exceed their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Many factories can pass one South African-style inspection,
experts said. But the toughest part of the business is consistency.
World Health Organization condom specifications are 13 pages long,
and modern condoms must be far less porous than those of 20 years
ago, because the size difference between a spermatozoon and the HIV
virus ``is like a Mack truck versus a Morris Mini,'' Crichton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because latex is tree sap and as unstable as milk, a condom
factory is more like an industrial cookie bakery than a bicycle
factory, where manufacturing errors are obvious. Small, invisible
problems can ruin whole batches.
</P>
<P>
   The latex is first vulcanized with sulfur and ammonia. Then
molds are repeatedly dipped and dried. The chemicals are leached
out, and the condoms are washed, tumble-dried and dusted with
cornstarch. Each is electrically tested for invisible holes,
visually inspected, then inflated by machine for a burst test. Then
each is rolled and sealed into a foil or plastic envelope into
which silicon lubricant is injected.
</P>
<P>
   Many things can go wrong: curdling latex, dust in the mix,
chemistry errors. Poor leaching can leave a rotten egg smell. With
too little lubricant, the condom can dry out; too much ruins the
packet's seal.
</P>
<P>
   Even when condoms are well made, there are problems with
promoting their use here. Because the danger of AIDS is so great,
there have been few religious objections, even in Catholic
countries. But there are other roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   All over Africa, everyone from health officers to women's rights
advocates to prostitutes complain that it is very difficult to get
men to use condoms. Besides the usual complaints about sensitivity
and lack of spontaneity, men argue that they are ``not part of
African culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The men dictate what will be done, and the women have very
little power to say no,'' said Dr. Neil Miller, an AIDS education
expert with the British Embassy in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   And, because the vast majority of condoms here are handed out
free, no choices of size are offered. The problem may sound silly,
but condom distributors say it is not. Too-large condoms slip off,
putting the user at risk of infection, while uncomfortably small
ones discourage men from using them.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, for example, 95 percent of the 190 million
condoms consumed each year are bought by the government. It only
buys the standard 53-millimeter-wide lubricated variety. But that
does not fit everyone, and some suppliers have sloppy quality
control.
</P>
<P>
   For example, youth counselors want the hard-to-find
47-millimeter ``adolescent size,'' Crichton said. Since a recent
survey of 18,000 South African teen-agers indicated that 24 percent
have sex before they are 14 years old, getting effective condoms to
the young is crucial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the government has its hands full with purchasing
and distribution problems and is barely considering these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that condoms offer this impoverished continent the
one slim hope it has of slowing the AIDS epidemic. ``But you need
systems for buying them,'' Ms. Usher said. ``Most countries don't
know much about these things, so they just go out and buy 6 million
condoms thinking they're all the same. They're not.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Next month, Television City and the Fashion Cafe, two
theme restaurants at Rockefeller Center whose owners once dreamed
of branches in major cities around the world, will close.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway at 49th Street, work stopped nearly a year ago on
David Copperfield's Magic Underground, a theme restaurant that was
supposed to combine magic, merchandise and good food. The owners
have spent nearly $30 million, but it may never open.
</P>
<P>
   The Official All Star Cafe in Times Square has quietly been
offered for sale, along with the nine other cafes in the chain. And
several troubled restaurants in its parent chain, Planet Hollywood,
are on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Theme restaurants, which exploded across the urban skyline three
or four years ago with promises of untold profits from a slickly
packaged blend of eating, shopping and entertainment, are
collapsing. Even former Wall Street favorites like Hard Rock Cafe,
Planet Hollywood and Rainforest Cafe have seen sales tumble as
diners go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and restaurant consultants cite various
reasons. Though the restaurants' themes ranged from movie or TV
memories to sports stars, supermodels and tropical rain forests,
the food was often dismissed as terrible. The elaborate decor _
rock-and-roll collectibles, racing cars, animatronic jungle
habitats _ was impressive but distracting, and the novelty soon
wore thin. Rapid expansion into smaller cities like Indianapolis
undercut the cachet of flagship restaurants in London and New York.
Landlords, who once welcomed theme restaurants, have turned their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life cycle of theme restaurants has been a lot shorter
than anyone expected,'' said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc.,
a restaurant consulting firm based in Chicago. ``Even in New York,
where there's a huge tourist population, the novelty's gone. It
turns out that the consumer had a lot more entertainment
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is not confined to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Cafe in London went into receivership in October.
Planet Hollywood closed its movie-theme restaurants in Aspen,
Colo., and Jakarta, Indonesia, and scratched plans to open an All
Star Cafe in Chicago. Copperfield's Magic Underground scrapped
plans to open restaurants in Chicago and Las Vegas, though it still
hopes to open one in Orlando, Fla. Many other themes never got
beyond the first press release.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant analysts and real estate executives say the concept
is not necessarily dead. They expect Hard Rock, the largest and
oldest theme chain, to survive and even prosper, because it has
done the best job of focusing on food and decor. Planet Hollywood
is working on a plan to reorganize as a leaner company, jettison
All Star Cafe and pull out of its tailspin. And newcomers like ESPN
Zone and Wrestlemania Cafe, with their tie-ins to television, may
catch on.
</P>
<P>
   But the carnage has been enormous in an industry where the
number of theme restaurant chains jumped from 6 to more than 30 in
six years, and revenues rose to more than $2 billion today from an
estimated $300 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Dive!, a theme chain backed by Steven Spielberg and based on
claustrophobic submarine spaces and submarine sandwiches, has not
gone beyond Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Billboard Live, featuring
live music from Billboard magazine charts, died in Los Angeles.
Vegas, which blended food and high-kicking chorus girls, announced
its debut at a news conference in Times Square in September 1996
and promptly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Three never got beyond the hype stage: RKO Pictures, which was
to combine food and old movies; Marvel Mania, which was based on
Marvel comic book heroes, and Chefs of the World, a theme chain
that would celebrate famous chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's going to constrict dramatically and somewhat
violently, either through bankruptcy or restaurant closings,'' said
James Berk, president and chief executive of Hard Rock Cafe
International, which operates 98 restaurants as well as hotels,
concert venues and a record company. ``There will be no additional
worldwide theme restaurant chains.'' Instead, he said, ``what will
be left will be either good restaurants'' or some single-site
themes called ``one-off'' operations _ restaurants located just
outside major tourist attractions that depend on the tourist stream
for survival.
</P>
<P>
   The present economic situation is a far cry from the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Earl, the impresario who had helped Hard Rock expand well
beyond its London roots, started Planet Hollywood in 1992 with
actors Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Arnold Schwarzenegger, adding
10 to 20 restaurants a year before going public in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, restaurateurs suddenly saw theme restaurants
as a bonanza. Food and beverage operations generated the 10 percent
profit typical of any successful restaurant, but the high-priced
merchandise _ T-shirts, sweatshirts, leather jackets _ accounted
for as much as 45 percent of the total revenues and as much as 70
percent of profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, eager developers created what was practically a
theme-restaurant district. The Jekyll &AMP; Hyde Club, the Motown Cafe
and the Harley-Davidson Cafe followed Hard Rock and Planet
Hollywood onto 57th Street and Avenue of the Americas. Comedy
Nation, the Fashion Cafe and Television City also opened outlets in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when investors and operators thought that
theme restaurants were a sure-fire formula for making lots of
money,'' said Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ``That's since
been disproven by the drop in same-store sales at chains like
Planet Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1998, Planet Hollywood lost $15.7
million, compared with a profit of $52.1 million during the same
period last year. Sales dropped 20 percent in the third quarter of
this year at restaurants open for more than 18 months, continuing a
two-year trend. Finally, shares of Planet Hollywood have plunged to
less than $3 today from a high of $32.13 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rainforest Cafe expects sales to drop by as much as 18 percent
this year at the six restaurants that have been open for more than
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   At Hard Rock, sales were down about 10.1 percent in the first
nine months of this year, while overall revenue and operating
profits rose more than 2 percent. Much of the decline came from a
drop in sales of Hard Rock T-shirts and caps, Berk said, not
because tourists and local residents were ignoring the restaurants.
Two years ago, Berk said, the company realized that it had to cut
prices and improve the food, while periodically changing the decor,
to keep customers interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came to see the stars; there weren't any,'' said Robert
Futterman, a retail real-estate broker based in New York who has
been to most theme restaurants. ``They came to eat the food, and it
was terrible. What do you need more than one T-shirt for? The
thrill is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At Planet Hollywood, Earl is betting that the public has not
lost its taste for theme restaurants. In January, the company is
scheduled to unveil a revitalization program called Planet 2000,
which is linked to the opening of the Planet Hollywood Hotel in
Times Square. The company has laid off more than 70 people
worldwide and has struggled with its lenders. Earl said the company
would introduce new menus, prices, logos and designs for the
restaurants and additional movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fixable,'' he said. ``After the narrower concepts
close, people will come back to Hard Rock and Planet Hollywood.
There is some carnage, and I think there's more coming. You'll end
up with the survival of the stronger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Planet Hollywood investors and real estate executives said
Planet Hollywood was planning to dismantle the All Star chain. They
said Planet Hollywood was quietly trying to sell the restaurants,
or to find a partner, like Wrestlemania Cafe, that would create a
new chain.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ESPN Zone, with its electronic games, constantly
changing array of sports stars and broadcasts for cable television,
is doing well in Baltimore and is set to open in Times Square next
year. Many analysts and real estate brokers expect it to knock what
life remains out of All Star Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Tullman, vice chairman of the company running Copperfield's
Magic Underground, said he expected to complete a new round of
fund-raising for the project in Times Square, but analysts and
restaurateurs say it will be almost impossible for the owners to
make money after having spent nearly $30 million on a single site.
</P>
<P>
   David Liederman, the founder of Television City, a theme
restaurant he opened in 1996 at Rockefeller Center and hoped to
bring to other cities, holds out little hope for most theme
restaurant chains. He said the time and money it took to develop an
elaborate theme forced him to charge prices that many people were
unwilling to pay. Next month, Liederman said, he will convert
Television City into Chez Louis, a restaurant specializing in roast
chicken cooked over wood fires, and focus on doing a few things
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leading the de-theming pack,'' Liederman said. ``I think
there's going to be a massive exodus out of this business.''

A FIRST FOR SWISS: A WOMAN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, SWITZERLAND _ At the age of 10, Switzerland's new
president-elect _the first woman and first Jew in the largely
ceremonial top post _ first put into practice her determined
approach to overcoming obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1950 when the new president-elect, Ruth Dreifuss,
encountered a teacher who made slighting comments about Jews. In a
notebook, she wrote down, in some detail, the history of the Jewish
people and their persecution. Taking it to the teacher, she said:
``I'm weak in spelling. Could you correct this?''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, she recounted, he returned the notebook without
a word. He made no anti-Semitic remarks after that, she recalled in
an interview in her office in the Swiss capital, Bern.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss, elected this month, is a symbol of success for
women in a country where women did not get to vote at the national
level until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected, by Parliament, to the one-year presidential
post _ which rotates among the seven-member Swiss Cabinet, largely
by seniority. There was little public commentary about her being
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   She will also represent a nation recently wrenched out of its
complacency by attacks on its most cherished myths about its
neutrality in World War II, and a country that is still struggling
to shape its future in Europe. The ferocious debate over national
identity is where Ms. Dreifuss, who will be 59 next month, is
determined to play an active role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty is to help bring Switzerland to the next century with
an open mind and open eyes,'' she said. ``We need to find a more
rational way to understand our history, not only in the Second
World War. We are seeing it as more complex and conflict loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss, who has been interior minister during the furor
over Swiss wartime actions, said she had not been more outspoken
earlier because she did not want to be ``exploited'' as a ``token
or alibi'' Jew.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, speaking out to an international audience is a new
experience for a woman who is known for being cautious and
understated. She described her new post, for example, as ``a
collective triumph'' for women, and ``in such a situation, one has
the duty to open doors for the next.''
</P>
<P>
   A left-leaning former union activist, she was elected to the
federal Cabinet six years ago, becoming its second woman and the
first member from the country's tiny Jewish population of 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Her election to the Cabinet was considered a breakthrough for
women in the traditional male Swiss political structure. Thousands
of women had rallied in the street in 1993 to protest after
Parliament rejected another woman whose personal style was
considered more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reassure people because I look a little plain,'' she
explained in a 1993 interview. She does not do especially well in
public-opinion polls, though, apparently because of her tough
stances on revising the nation's health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss has also drawn criticism for pushing Switzerland to
address its serious drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some Swiss may squirm at Ms. Dreifuss' efforts to have the
country come to terms with its troubled past, but her position has
not been adversarial. ``We will never accept a collective fault,''
she said firmly, upholding the government's position that banks but
not ``the Swiss men and women who lived in the dramatic years of
the war'' may be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss is thoroughly Swiss. Her family has been in
Switzerland for three centuries. But she was born in World War II,
and she said that her earliest memories included the constant fear
that Germany would invade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born when there was a continent-broad system aimed at
the extermination of the same people as I was,'' she said. ``Don't
think this isn't constitutive of a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family lived in the northeastern city of St. Gallen, but her
father, who volunteered with a group that helped Jewish refugees,
was caught helping falsify documents to protect those fleeing the
Holocaust. He lost his job in a textile importing company, and when
she was 5 years old, the family moved to Geneva. Ms. Dreifuss
earned a degree in economics from Geneva University.
</P>
<P>
   Her family's wartime experience left her well versed in Swiss
sensitivities to its refugee policy toward Jews in that era.
According to estimates, 60,000 Jews tried to enter the country
during the war, and half or more were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, an international panel of historians appointed by
the government will report on the wartime refugee policy. Last
August, Swiss banks agreed to a $1.25 billion settlement over money
that Holocaust victims deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is relief now that the banks made a settlement,'' she
said. ``But the government's work is not finished.''

TWO KEY AIDES OF POL POT SAID TO EMERGE FROM HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Two of the last three longtime aides of
the late Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, have emerged from their
jungle hideouts in the hope of becoming ``ordinary citizens,'' the
government announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It released copies of handwritten letters by the two men _ Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea _ pledging allegiance to the government as
well as a reply from Prime Minister Hun Sen welcoming them in from
the cold. The defections are the latest, and among the most
important, in a longtime Communist insurgency that began collapsing
more than two years ago. They leave just one widely hated man, Ta
Mok, at large from among the inner circle of Pol Pot, who died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the men are among the targets of a potential
international tribunal for crimes against humanity committed from
1975 to 1979, when the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of more than a
million people.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their defections, the two men are not yet in
government hands and the possibility of bringing them to trial
remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous defectors from among the leadership, officials
said, both men have relocated to the remote gem-mining town of
Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pailin is now formally under government control, it is
guarded by 2,000 armed former guerrillas and is on a border with
Thailand, which has been a safe haven for Khmer Rouge leaders for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The clear hope of the two elderly men is that they will be left
alone, as previous defectors have been, and that Cambodia will
choose not to stir up past demons with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only request is to return to society and live as an
ordinary citizen,'' said Nuon Chea, 71, who was sometimes counted
as ``Brother Number 2'' under Pol Pot. He is believed by
investigators to have been responsible for horrific purges that
resulted in the proliferation of Cambodia's ``killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   His words were echoed, in almost identical language, by Khieu
Samphan, 67, who was the official head of state and the friendly,
reasonable face of Pol Pot's brutal regime. His doctoral thesis,
written in France in the 1950s, is sometimes seen as the blueprint
for the movement's evacuation of cities and destruction of culture,
learning, religion and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rubric of ``national reconciliation,'' Cambodia has so
far preferred to try to forget, if not to forgive, the traumas of
its past. But even if forgotten, they continue to infect the
present.
</P>
<P>
   It was in part because of his negotiations with Khieu Samphan
that Prince Norodom Ranariddh was ousted in a coup last year by Hun
Sen. But following an election, Ranariddh is back, sharing a
coalition government as speaker of the National Assembly, and it is
Hun Sen who negotiated with Khieu Samphan.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Cambodians, weary and brutalized by years of war and
mass killings, say they prefer to let bygones be bygones, others
say they fear the lesson that may be sent if Khmer Rouge leaders
walk free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot forget the past like this,'' said Thun Saray, leader
of a human rights advocacy group called Adhoc. ``If we do not send
these people to a tribunal, future leaders might say, `Oh, I'm only
applying some new ideas for the good of the people; I'm only
killing 100,000 more people; why punish me, because I am only
acting in the interests of the Cambodian people.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Hun Sen chooses to cooperate with preparations by the United
Nations for a tribunal that would be held in Cambodia, both of the
defectors could be extricated from Pailin, said Stephen Heder, a
London-based expert on the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' Heder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a cut in Pailin's economic lifeline by the Cambodian
government on one side and the Thais on the other could persuade
the younger leaders, who now control the isolated enclave, to cut
loose these old revolutionary war horses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Hun Sen might find it in his political
interests to let the defectors live out their old age as the
``ordinary citizens'' they dream of being.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ta Mok is caught, the international outcry against this
lone remaining fugitive would be difficult to silence, Heder said.
A hot-tempered, one-legged peasant soldier who is believed to be in
his 70s, he has such a reputation for brutality that even among the
Khmer Rouge he is known as ``the butcher.''
</P>
<P>
   His status and whereabouts are unknown, but Heder said he could
imagine Ta Mok's state of mind as the last of the Khmer Rouge
leaders on the run. ``I presume he is sitting up there very lonely,
with nobody to talk to,'' he said.

<P>
   XAPURI, Brazil _ Handwritten signs hang from the ceiling in the
simple shack where Chico Mendes lived and died. ``These were the
clothes he wore the day he was killed,'' says one sign, swaying
over a pair of shorts and a checkered shirt that his widow,
Ilzamar, has laid out on their bed. ``In the hall, I held my
children and Ilzamar in my arms,'' said another. ``I fell here. I
realized that I didn't belong to this world any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In his life, Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, the outspoken defender
of rubber tappers and the Amazon rain forest, cut a larger figure
around the globe than he did around the corner. In his final days,
he told his family and friends about unrelenting death threats from
local ranchers. Despite his international contacts, he knew that
police officials in his home state of Acre would do little to
protect him.
</P>
<P>
   His murder at the age of 44, 10 years ago this month, brought
even more international attention to his cause. Now, Mendes'
Workers' Party has won control of City Hall and of the governor's
palace in the state capital. Both of the senators who represent the
state in the nation's capital are from the Workers' Party, and
millions of acres of rain forest have been reserved for the rubber
tappers and nut gatherers whom Chico Mendes defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years after his death, Chico Mendes has come to power,''
said Antonio Alves, a local journalist who followed his career.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of Chico Mendes, say those he left behind, was his
decision to reach out to the environmental movement abroad for
support for his rural labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   While land reform remains a violent battle between ranchers and
rural workers, the environmental ideals advanced by Mendes have
become common currency, at least rhetorically, among government
officials. And the reserves he envisioned to extract products from
the land without destroying it now exist for other products, from
hearts of palm to timber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all is not well. The lives of the tappers are as wretched
as ever, with the price of rubber and other commodities dragged
down by the deep recession in Asia, to a lower point than when
Mendes was buried.
</P>
<P>
   His widow, Ilzamar Gadelha Mendes, now 34, is in open warfare
with his party, and the two sides hurl bitter accusations about
exploiting, and betraying, Mendes' name. The men in jail for his
murder remain bitter and blame the rubber tapper for inviting his
own death.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the new political leaders of Xapuri and Acre will be
sworn into office. Many of them had stood together with Mendes when
he organized his famous ``empates,'' or stalemates, of rubber
tappers _ who formed human walls in the jungle to block the
tractors, chain saws and fires of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that's going on, it's all happening in his
spirit,'' said Francisco Ramalho de Souza, who holds Mendes' old
job as president of the Rural Workers Union of Xapuri.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Marina Silva, the daughter of a rubber tapper, said the
centrist parties have been discredited with assertions of
corruption and mismanagement. The Workers' Party had been building
a political base in Acre for more than two decades, but it appears
to have come in from the political margins only after Mendes'
killing.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Mendes, his story turned into a legend. Swarms
of foreign writers and filmmakers descended on Xapuri to chronicle
his fate and that of the rubber tappers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tappers came here at the turn of the century and
others during World War II, to supply a U.S. war effort deprived of
Malaysian rubber. The tappers hike through the forest, slitting
rubber tree trunks and fixing small rubber buckets to collect the
dripping latex.
</P>
<P>
   The governor-elect, Jorge Viana, and the new mayor of Xapuri,
Julio Barbosa Aquinor, have not issued concrete plans, but they
said they would build their administrations around the needs of the
tappers, a first for the region. Unlike ranchers, for example,
tappers have never had access to government credit and other forms
of assistance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber tapping generally provides income of less than half the
minimum wage of about $104 a month. The only future for the
workers, the new leaders contend, lies in broadening the range of
products gathered by these workers and building markets for fruits
and other products that can be found only in the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   The new leaders are inheriting a state with $13 million in debt,
a 34 percent illiteracy rate _ the highest in the country _ and 20
percent unemployment, said Viana, who worked on Mendes'
unsuccessful campaign for state assemblyman in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The governor-elect said he preferred not to dwell on the
problems, and he does not doubt the wisdom of Mendes' ideas despite
the desperation of forest dwellers today. The problem, he said, is
not their way of life. Rather, he said, it is the lack of
government programs to make their forest economy viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to use adversity as a reason for doing
nothing,'' said Silva. ``It just means we have to work that much
harder.''
</P>

<P>
   Mendes' widow was notably absent from memorial services this
month marking the 10th anniversary of his death. Though she never
had an active role in her husband's political activism, the
Workers' Party had called on her to lead the Chico Mendes
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendes' political heirs soon parted company with her,
bickering over leadership of the foundation and the use of
royalties and other proceeds from the activist's death. She joined
forces with the party in power at the time of her husband's death,
and she now says that her husband's crusade was little more than a
pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not realistic at all,'' she said, and blamed
environmental laws for preventing tappers from cutting down trees
to grow rice, beans and other subsistence crops to supplement their
incomes. ``Even though there is an extractive reserve named for
Chico,'' she said, ``what's the point of having a reserve if the
tappers have to abandon it to struggle as peddlers in the city?''
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,400 miles away, at a prison in Brasilia, the anniversary
only deepened the bitterness of the father and son jailed for
killing Mendes, and their families. Darci Alves admits to having
killed Mendes, but he denies that his father, Darli, 62, had
anything to do with it. At the time, environmentalists insisted
that other local ranchers paid the family to kill Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   Darci Alves contends that he received such pressure over Mendes'
complaints that he could not stand it, leading to the killing.
``You want to know if I regret it?'' Darci Alves said. ``Perhaps
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his denial that he was involved in the crime, Darli
Alves, too, blames Mendes for fueling the confrontation. ``If he
would have accepted peace, I would have called for it,'' Darli
Alves said. ``If he would have accepted it, everything would have
been fine.''

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ For four long years, President Alexander G.
Lukashenko has pursued an unlikely obsession: to raise tiny Belarus
from the shards of the sundered Soviet Union and remake it into a
model socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems he has succeeded all too well.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of Lukashenko's labors are evident daily outside the
aptly named Golden Egg, a downtown shop in this city of 1.7
million, where nearly 100 people lined up in foot-stamping cold on
a recent December morning.
</P>
<P>
   Their objective was to get inside the store and buy the allotted
maximum of 20 eggs each.
</P>
<P>
   Most had been waiting for three hours, since the store opened at
8 a.m. ``I can't feel my feet,'' a fur-swaddled woman said. ``This
is Lukashenko's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   She refused to give her name. ``The further away this is
published, the better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one _ the food rationing, the lines, the
ever-shrinking ruble, the undercurrent of fear _ Minsk in 1998
resembles Moscow in 1988, a few months before the last model
communist state began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   For Lukashenko, that rare head of state who openly longs for a
Soviet restoration, such problems could not have come at a worse
time.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus' socialism dovetails with a larger ambition Lukashenko
harbors: a merger of Belarus with Russia, thus beginning a
rebuilding of the old Soviet empire. It also would enable him to
seek the new nation's presidency, a plum he recently insisted is
the farthest thing from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, Lukashenko and President Boris N. Yeltsin of
Russia took a first step toward the altar, proposing to begin next
year to unify the two nations' economies under a single currency.
That would be hard enough, given that Russia has been heading in
the opposite direction, turning itself into a capitalist state.
</P>
<P>
   It would be harder still if Belarus' stumbling economy grinds to
a complete halt, saddling Moscow with the cost of maintaining
another 10 million impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, a charismatic dictator with a hand-picked Parliament
and a pliant citizenry, appears concerned enough about the future
to begin shoring up his position. He announced new plans this month
to muzzle his few political opponents and charged an emergency
council with restoring staples like eggs and milk to stores.
</P>
<P>
   He also has persuaded the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to withhold judgment on Belarus _ they had all but
renounced any notion of lending more money to the government
earlier this year _ by promising economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   By Western standards, there is a lot to reform. Lukashenko, who
ran a collective farm before entering politics, calls his brand of
economic policy ``market socialism.'' The government owns or
controls much of industry and agriculture, but also allows private
enterprises to exist. In theory, at least, the government side of
the economy competes in the world market as well as with domestic
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Lukashenko has followed a straightforward fiscal
policy: he prints money when the nation runs short, and caps prices
when he thinks they are too high. The result is inflation and
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's controlled from the top,'' said Stanislav
Bahgdankevich, who quit as head of Belarus' national bank in 1995
and now heads an opposition party. ``The private sector is dictated
what to produce, and what price to sell it at. It's a Bolshevik
forced economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The average citizen's monthly income has slumped since July from
$70 to about $40. And that depends on how one measures income: at
last count, there were five separate exchange rates for the
Belarusian ruble, ranging from 91,000 to more than 350,000 per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   At the latter rate _ the one the rest of the world uses to buy
and sell rubles _ a Belarusian millionaire is currently worth about
$3.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus' Gosplan-style network of price controls has fostered a
black market in food, to farmers' ruination. The country's
artificially low prices force farmers to sell their crops at a
loss, while entrepreneurs snap up the food and smuggle it to
Ukraine or Russia, where it is resold for a healthy profit across
the border. It is now illegal to export food without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Belarus' problem is not so much that food is not
available _ privately run markets have abundant supplies of many
staples _ as that Belarusians cannot afford it. In Minsk's
jam-packed public market, state-owned meat vendors this month
offered strips of gristly, bone-ridden beef for 170,000 rubles
(somewhere between 40 cents and $2, depending on the exchange
rate), the price dictated by the state. Directly across the aisle,
private vendors were selling thick, lean steaks for 450,000 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run markets receive their food from collective farms,
many of which lose money and consequently produce poor-quality
goods in low quantities. Private vendors raised their own produce
and meat or bought it from private wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Even 170,000 rubles was too much for one elderly woman, who
refused to give her name but said as she walked away that she lived
on a pension of only 1.5 million rubles a month, about $5 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rulers,'' she said, ``not only Lukashenko. There are
just too many of them. Don't they see what's going on? The fish
rots from the head.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Industry is in no better shape. Westerners buy little, in part
because Belarus factories are so hobbled by economic controls that
they spend little money to modernize and are no longer competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Belarus tried much to sell to the West. The country's
biggest trading partner by far, Russia, is now too hard-pressed
itself to buy many of the nation's televisions and tractors. Yet
factories continue producing.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, many warehouses are stuffed with six months'
supply of goods. Some private ventures, like a Ford Motor Co.
tractor plant in Minsk, have simply shut down most operations for
the duration.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this, Lukashenko declared as recently as September that the
economy was in ``optimal'' condition, and said last week that the
country's gross domestic product will leap an astounding 8 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate as that might sound, virtually nobody is writing
Lukashenko off. Even opposition leaders here allow that he remains
popular, especially in rural areas. And he has managed to virtually
extinguish serious opposition while allowing enough critical
politicians and newspapers to operate so that he can deflect
accusations by human rights critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single journalist in our country at present has been
arrested,'' Vladimir N. Konoplyov, deputy chairman of Belarus'
Parliament and a friend of the president since boyhood. ``And as to
human rights, what can I say? When I meet voters, I always ask the
crowd, `Tell me, who feels any pressure or deprivation of rights?'
Nobody ever answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring group Human Rights Watch says there may be a
reason for the reticence: last July it issued a thick report
accusing Lukashenko of ``violations of a broad spectrum of basic
civil and political rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators are sometimes permitted, but frequently harassed,
arrested and occasionally severely beaten. Some 30 opposition
newspapers are published, but their presence is limited to a few
copies at state-owned newsstands, and their editors are often
hauled in for official warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined circulation, journalists insist, is less than
that of the leading state-controlled newspaper in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
   One leading critical paper, Svoboda, was abruptly closed in
January. Two reporters for Russian media were arrested last year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, five opposition political parties operate in Belarus,
but their leading figures often discover suddenly that they are
jobless and unable to find work, and many members are jailed,
albeit usually for short periods, on various charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko wrote a new constitution and installed a mostly
hand-picked Parliament in 1996 after winning a referendum on the
changes that international observers say was fraudulent. This
month, Lukashenko sent legislation to the Parliament that would ban
from public office anyone who has been found guilty of even civil
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm involved in opposition activity, my family could
starve,'' said Stanislav Suskevich, the first president of
post-Soviet Belarus. ``Already in Belarus, I can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lukashenko's popularity rests in part on the absence of
serious opposition, he also has undeniably played smart politics.
He has attributed most of the nation's economic plight to the
Russian breakdown and to the incompetence of aides, some of whom
are periodically dismissed to demonstrate his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   When advisers recently tried to generate revenue by raising the
price of vodka by 75 percent, Lukashenko berated them on national
television, then ordered the salaries of all workers raised by an
amount sufficient to buy a few bottles of vodka monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Such impulsive acts are part of Lukashenko's personality.
</P>
<P>
   He once blockaded Masherov Prospekt, an eight-lane downtown
artery, so he could practice Rollerblading. He has barred the use
of Belarusian, the country's long-suppressed native tongue, in
newspapers and classrooms. He blamed the poor performance of a
Belarusian athlete in the last winter Olympics on a Western
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   They are the trademarks of a leader who is accustomed to getting
what he seeks. But Belarus will be hard pressed to keep giving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When, as now seems likely, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist opens the impeachment trial of President Clinton early
next year, there will be no time devoted to jury selection. Nor
will the jury be impartial.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Clinton's presidency will be in the hands of the 100
famously independent egos of the Senate, men and women who will be
weighing everything from the facts to public impatience with the
Lewinsky story to the pull of party and faction to their own
dealings with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique process, of course,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., who favors censure of the president instead of
removal. ``There's a natural tendency to want to think of it in
legal terms, but it's also political, which is the way the framers
intended it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House was an angry pit of partisanship throughout the
impeachment debate, the Senate is smaller, clubbier and usually
more moderate. It was designed by the founders to be less subject
to the passions of the moment. Senators have six-year terms, and
each senator has enormous power to bring proceedings, if not to a
standstill, then to a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of a senator to just throw sand in the gears is
incredible,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``In the House, one
person can't do it. Maybe in some odd way that tends to make
senators a little bit more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of the moderation can be found in the fact that
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi , the majority leader, and Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, have been consulting
regularly across party lines in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking a lot,'' Lieberman said. ``Both understand
this is a test for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, achieving some kind of consensus on a way to avoid a
lengthy, embarrassing trial _ a censure resolution, perhaps, or a
brief trial that skips the evidence and moves directly to legal
arguments on whether the offenses charged by the House warrant
removal _ may prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The White House fears that as many as 20 of the 55 Republicans
will want to push for a full trial. Some Democrats want Clinton to
fight for a full acquittal instead of a censure agreement. And any
censure measure that is worked out would have to be tough enough to
attract Republican votes, while not driving away Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by the discussions,'' said one Democratic
senator who has been searching for a solution. ``But this could
blow up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, a majority of the Senate can vote at any time
to suspend a trial. And Democrats hope that the pragmatists and
moderates on the Republican side of the aisle can eventually give
them the extra 6 votes they need on top of their 45 to bring
proceedings to an end.
</P>
<P>
   They will be looking toward Northeastern Republicans who work
with Democrats on issues ranging from the environment to health
care to campaign finance _ people like John Chaffee of Rhode
Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, and Susan Collins and Olympia
Snowe of Maine. Jeffords said in an interview, ``We should start
the trial.'' But he expressed hopes that a censure agreement could
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Other allies might be John McCain of Arizona, who is often a
maverick, and Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Though such Republicans could help stop a trial, Democrats say
they also need a conservative Republican with a following among
Senate colleagues to negotiate a censure.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor in how this all plays out is the role Lott
chooses for himself. Those who have talked to him say that he is
eager to clear the way for his party to showcase an agenda ranging
from tax cuts to education to Social Security policy.
</P>
<P>
   But his anger at Clinton burst into the open the week before
last when he questioned the timing of air strikes in Iraq, and his
power base remains the Senate conservatives. A large part of his
original appeal among the Republicans who selected him as their
leader is that he came from the House and had a sympathy for the
conservatives that Newt Gingrich had shepherded into power. Lott's
No. 2 in command is Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who is also a fierce
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $64,000 question is,'' one Democrat said privately, ``will
Trent Lott be able to resist the forces of the right?''
</P>
<P>
   If he does not, another Republican could step forward to work
with Democrats for a resolution short of removal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., virtually tried to nominate
Republicans he hoped would take on the role when he spoke last week
about the ``quiet giants'' of the Senate and named three
Republicans, Ted Stevens of Alaska, John Warner of Virginia, and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was criticized by his colleagues
earlier this year for looking too much like he was trying to help
Clinton. Some think Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington might
intervene. Thad Cochran of Mississippi has not ruled out censure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And even Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has said that he wants
to see a vote on the two articles of impeachment sent by the House
before any talk of censure, could turn out to be the ultimate
pragmatist. He has denounced Clinton's ``reprehensible behavior.''
But as the head of the Senate Republicans' re-election effort in
2000, he will have 19 Republicans to shepherd to re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Senate's strongest conservatives calculate that
they would rather see the president censured than simply acquitted,
says a Republican aide close to the social conservative movement.
Most lawmakers apparently think the Senate, with 55 Republicans,
will never be able to reach the 67 votes necessary to remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't support censure to replace the trial process or in
any way impede us from moving to a trial,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard,
R-Colo. ``But once you've had the trial, then afterward I could
possibly support censure.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Democratic Party appears unified against Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Passions have cooled since August, when the president first
confessed to an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica
Lewinsky, after seven months of denials. Lieberman, a longtime ally
in the ``New Democrat'' movement, called the president's conduct
``disgraceful'' and ``immoral.'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., often at odds with Clinton over policy, also criticized his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But both men are now supporting censure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, an 81-year-old Democrat from West Virginia and
the unofficial historian of the Senate, is another unpredictable
personality fiercely jealous of the prerogatives of the Senate. He
has already sent a sharp warning to the White House that any
censure measure that is worked out should not involve ``any entity
beyond the current membership of the U.S. Senate.'' But Byrd is
indeed speaking with Senate colleagues about the wisest course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also surprised Republicans who had predicted that he
would be a strict constitutionalist and insist the Senate have a
trial. Last week, he left the door open to the possibility that
there could be ``some other solution.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are Democrats who think there should
not be a censure deal _ or at least not unless Clinton first
defeats the two articles of impeachment in Senate votes.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he had been telling the president's aides: ``You
guys have got to get a grip here. Quit pushing for censure. You
don't want to be the only president in history to be impeached and
have it hang over your head the rest of your life. You want to be
exonerated.'' (Andrew Johnson, the one other president to be
impeached, was spared conviction by the Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the maneuvering, senators have been become cautious
about predicting events in the aftermath of the House's vote for
impeachment, once considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this trial starts, anything can happen,'' Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said last week. ``I think that already we've seen
so many turns and twists in the road, and I think we're going to
see a lot more.''

PRAYERS HELP HEAL WOUNDS OF EX-CARDINAL  
 EX-NFL PLAYER LUIS SHARPE TRIES TO BOUNCE BACK FROM THE DEPTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, ARIZ. - The woman took a seat, looking into the eyes
of Luis Sharpe as he began to ask questions. Only 18, she looked as
if she had seen too much. As a kid, she wanted to be a
pediatrician, but she was at the Love in Action Ministries in
Glendale earlier this month asking for only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe asked for her hands, and they disappeared into those that
held off some of the NFL's fiercest pass rushers for 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in pressed blue jeans and denim shirt, Sharpe, a former
star offensive tackle with the Cardinals, bowed his head and prayed
with her.
</P>
<P>
   As he led her to the ministry's food storage room, the scene was
a blending of heartbreak and joy.
</P>
<P>
   The last images that many have of Sharpe, now 38, are from a
June day in 1996 _ in handcuffs, on a gurney, bleeding from a
gunshot wound that entered under his chin and exited his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Addicted to crack cocaine, Sharpe had suffered his second
gunshot wound during a dispute in a crack house on Broadway Road.
</P>
<P>
   You don't notice the physical scars today unless you look
closely. The emotional wounds have been mostly healed, too, he
said. Conversations with Sharpe today are punctuated with biblical
references, praises to God and parables. With every sentence, he
bears witness.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sharpe _ emerging from the depths of drug abuse, the brink
of death and prison, and a drug relapse _ is a productive member of
society again.
</P>
<P>
   He will spend today with his five children, first at Christmas
services, later opening presents. It is a day some thought Sharpe
would never live to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe knows that many people have grown callous to news of drug
addicts finding religion, or a former professional athlete slipping
up and then trying to turn his life around. The skeptics will ask,
how long will this transformation last?
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe said he is willing to share his story not because he
wants applause, but because he wants people to know there is hope,
even when everything known to man has failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the only thing we can do is pray for people and
believe that what is impossible for man is possible for God,'' he
said. &QL; 
A sudden downfall
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's playing career ended in 1994 because of a knee injury,
prompting the infamous post-game quote from Coach Buddy Ryan, ``We
ain't got anybody hurt that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's life had seemed so perfect until then. He had a degree
in political science from UCLA. He was a member of the executive
board of the NFL players union. He was the Cardinals' marquee
player.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the facade, Sharpe's soul was crumbling. He had used
crack cocaine intermittently for years while in the NFL, mainly he
says, because he was doing nothing to nurture his spirit and
relationship with God. His marriage was failing.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the injury signaled an end to his career. He was in
despair, and he found his escape in cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he said, most of his drug use was done in the
off-season. When he smoked crack during the season, he said he did
it mostly on Monday nights because Tuesday was the players' day
off.
</P>
<P>
   After his knee injury, the addiction became uncontrollable.
Although he had retired from the game, the next two years of
Sharpe's life were chronicled in court documents and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence, arrests, fights with police officers,
involuntary psychiatric treatment, several rehabilitation attempts,
two gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on probation for drug and assault charges as part
of a plea deal with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, but he
violated that probation in that summer of 1996 and ultimately spent
10{ months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He currently is under a 35-month probation period, which for now
includes house arrest. Sharpe must submit a weekly schedule to his
probation officer, Charles Medrano, whose office monitors Sharpe's
activities. In addition, Sharpe is randomly tested for drug use. He
has been clean since last spring when he entered a rehabilitation
program operated by the In Him Outreach Church in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing real well,'' Medrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe blames no one but himself for his descent into the abyss
of drug abuse, and for a brief relapse earlier this year. He
credits only one thing for leading him out: God's grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some heart issues, things that happened to me, people
who had let me down, and I had a hard time forgiving those
people,'' he said. ``I was carrying a lot of pain in my heart, and
I didn't know all I had to do was give my life to the Lord and walk
in forgiveness. Walk in forgiveness!''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe and his ex-wife, Kathi, communicate and are still working
through the pain of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new person; this is not the person that I knew,''
Kathi Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is a changed man, and he traces the transformation
back to the summer of 1996 when he was shot for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of several forces, some of which he cannot
explain, have brought him to where he says he is today: a man of
God who spends most of his days volunteering at Love in Action and
at the In Him Outreach Church; a loving son and a father who has
rebuilt relationships with his five children, who range in age from
14 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't claim to have conquered his addiction. He fell back
into that world earlier this year, he said, using drugs for a
three-week period. He then entered a treatment program, from which
he graduated last month.
</P>
<P>
   Beating drug addiction, along with the continuing development of
his faith, is part of a process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that he now has people he can talk to, people such as
his pastor, David Vasquez, and Patricia Eckhardt, the director of
the Love in Action Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called them my spiritual parents,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still bumps, trials and tribulations along the
road,'' he said. ``However, those bumps no longer represent
stumbling blocks. They are merely steppingstones that allow me to
grow more and more in faith.'' &QL; 
Angels of mercy &QL; 
Lying on a gurney in the emergency room of Maricopa Medical Center,
Sharpe was choking on his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in the neck during a dispute at a crack house, he had
fought with police officers, who finally subdued him and brought
him in for treatment. Sharpe, in critical condition, had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I feel these literal, physical hands on my
body from my ankles to the top of my shoulders,'' he said. ``They
were like the hands of death. I felt the spirit of death come upon
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then coming around the corner into the room, I see this man
who has on all black and he has a nightstick in his hand, and he's
beating it on the other hand. He's standing at my feet, and I'm
trying to figure this out. I look up and see this man in all white.
He says, `Now we put our faith in the one we believe.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trippin' now. I don't understand this at all. I
can't speak because I'm choking on blood. He says it again, `Now we
put our faith in the one we believe.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I nodded my head yes, and he put his hand where I got shot,
right here,'' said Sharpe, placing his finger under his chin. ``And
I remember him saying, `Everyone in this room who doesn't belong
here, leave immediately.' Those hands lifted off my body and I felt
the gurney carrying me out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Sharpe was on his way to a jail infirmary. He
started thinking about what had led him to this cell, how his story
was being told in the newspapers and on television, how his
children would see Daddy's latest failure on television and hear
about it from classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to seriously contemplate suicide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Harris, the Cardinals' community relations director, came
to visit Sharpe about then. She was stunned at what she saw and
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried,'' she said. ``He had been such a strong individual. I
don't mean in football, but he knew where he was going. He had
direction. But he just sounded so down. He was saying things like,
`I'll be all right' and `Does it really matter?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frightened for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe frightened himself. On a Sunday, he summoned a guard and
told him he was having suicidal thoughts and needed to see a
psychiatrist. The guard told him he'd try, but it was Sunday, and
it might take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the Rev. Timothy Tuggle was waiting for
Sharpe. Tuggle had seen Sharpe's story on the television the night
before and decided to visit.
</P>
<P>
   He told Sharpe that he had a purpose for living, that one day he
would bring ``thousands into the kingdom of God.'' They prayed, and
Sharpe went back to his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and the spirit of
depression and suicide had left me and I was full of joy,'' Sharpe
said. A few weeks later, Sharpe was sentenced to a year in prison
for violating his probation. He served 10{ months before being
released in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to a man who had everything the world had to
offer, materially, socially, financially, and you know what?''
Sharpe said. ``It took me having my physical freedom taken away to
be set free from myself. In prison, I had more joy, more peace. I
knew I was on a different path.'' &QL; 
Lending a hand &QL; 
Larry Lee's eyes began to mist. A friend of Sharpe's since they
were teammates at UCLA in the late 1970s and early '80s, he
couldn't help but get emotional when he heard Sharpe address a
crowd at his sister's wedding last summer in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, with the blessing of his sister and brother-in-law, just
wanted to thank everyone for their offers of help during his
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lee watched as Sharpe's oldest daughter, 14-year-old
Leah, hugged her dad. A couple of her sisters, Sarah and Rebekah,
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Lee thought back to the time in 1995 when Sharpe was in trouble
and he visited Sharpe's ex-wife and the kids. Leah was shouting
that she hated her father for everything he had done.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, Sharpe came over to where Lee was and saw that
his ex-teammate was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we both started,'' said Lee, the vice president of
football administration for the Detroit Lions. ``Two big old guys
just boo-hooing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee had never lost hope that day would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Day 1, I saw it as plain as day,'' he said. ``I saw Luis
have a testimony, and I saw this public gathering, and he was the
highlight, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharpe's life spun out of control with drugs and violence
in 1995, Lee conspired with former Cardinals wide receiver Roy
Green to try to help Sharpe. Lee flew to Phoenix and, with Green's
help, bound Sharpe with duct tape and drove him to the Betty Ford
Clinic in California.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Sharpe left, paying $1,800 for a cab ride to
take him back to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's brother, a minister, had some advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we want to help people out, and sometimes we block
God's blessing,'' Lee said. ``Some people have to hit rock bottom
before the Lord can perform a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee stopped helping the day before Thanksgiving 1995. He spoke
to Sharpe and could tell his teammate was ``probably still out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both knew well the toll the drug could take. They and several
other former UCLA players had attended the funeral of former
teammate Don Rogers, who died of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Lee snapped and started screaming into the phone. ``Luis, the
next thing we'll be coming to Phoenix for is your funeral. All the
UCLA guys will be coming together in Phoenix. Just go ahead, Luis,
die, man! Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Sharpe's family who live in Detroit flew to Phoenix
numerous times to help. Harris kept in touch with Kathi Sharpe and
the kids to make sure they were doing as well as possible. And
strangers were thinking of Sharpe, also.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw news broadcasts of Sharpe on a gurney, Pastor
Vasquez of the In Him Outreach Church grabbed his wife's hand and
prayed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord God, send somebody to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Love in Action Ministries, Eckhardt and some other
volunteers did the same. They saw the television reports and prayed
that Sharpe would find help.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was released from prison in April 1997, about the same
time his divorce became final. He maintained his sobriety for a
while before his relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Through another minister, he was referred to Vasquez, who runs a
drug rehabilitation home in Glendale, and he entered the nine-month
program last spring. &QL; 
In search of forgiveness
</P>
<P>
   The In Him Outreach Home in Glendale accommodates 12 men who
share four bedrooms. It's a tight fit, especially after some of the
men recover from withdrawal and start eating well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in skinny and get big,'' Vasquez said. ``We have to
get them down from the top bunks to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The men rise early, and lights are out at 10 p.m. It's not a
prison; they are free to walk out any time. But if they commit to
the program, they must earn the privilege of leaving the home. They
pray, study the Bible, and they work.
</P>
<P>
   The men do volunteer work at Love in Action twice a week and are
involved in the neighborhood, sometimes helping do work for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to help a man forgive himself and view himself as
worthwhile. Drug habits are kicked through prayer, Bible study and
fellowship. The men in the program attend services regularly at the
In Him Outreach Church, located in a vacant store in the Manistee
Town Center at 57th and Northern avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into a home with several other men was not easy for
Sharpe, who made $1.8 million in his last season with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to submit yourself to living where there are 14, 15
men,'' he said. ``That's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the home provided what he needed: the opportunity to be
around men of God for 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you hit bottom, and when people lose confidence in you,
you lose just about everything,'' Vasquez said. ``He needed
somebody to be real with him, to put a mirror in front of him, but
with love and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sharpe was willing to look at the image staring back.
</P>
<P>
   ``God had great things prepared for me, and as long as I held on
to bitterness and resentment, I couldn't see them,'' he said.
``Talking about Buddy Ryan, talking about the end of a marriage,
talking about the end of an NFL career. Those were the issues I was
dealing with and that I didn't know how to deal with at the time.
That's the reason I was out there doing those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who I was. For 13 years in the NFL, I was always driven
by my fleshly, carnal nature, by whatever felt good. Whether that
was in my diet, in hanging out in the streets and doing the things
professional athletes do when you're in the limelight and women
make themselves available to you. I did very little for my
spiritual man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe graduated from the program a month ago in a celebration
attended by friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   He's living in a house in Ahwatukee now so he can be close to
his kids.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, he hopes to attend a school in Tulsa in order to
become a minister. &QL; 
Feeding the spirit &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Love in Action, Sharpe does a little bit of everything. He
speaks fluent Spanish, having been born in Cuba and immigrating to
the United States with his family when he was 6. The second
language is often an asset in interviewing those asking for help to
assess their need.
</P>
<P>
   He loads and unloads trucks and occasionally drives one to pick
up donations. He cleans toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to say, `I'm above that,' '' Eckhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know who Sharpe was that first day he arrived with
the other men from the In Him home. She knew him only as Brother
Luis.
</P>
<P>
   One day, another volunteer told her who Sharpe was, and Eckhardt
remembered her prayer the night she saw pictures of a wounded
Sharpe on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so unbelievable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe has always had compassion for the less fortunate. Harris,
the Cardinals' community relations director, remembers that when
the Cardinals were still in St. Louis, Sharpe would walk by her
desk occasionally and overhear her talking to someone in need.
</P>
<P>
   One time, a woman with kids called, asking for money to pay her
heating bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would reach into his pocket and pull out a $100 bill,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On an average day, about 50 families are helped at Love in
Action. Volunteers are working now to fill the needs of 150
families for the holidays. That includes food, clothing and toys
for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their situations are heartbreaking. If interviewers
determine that a family requires special attention, or additional
assistance beyond the norm, they'll write ``blessing'' on an
information card.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers tease Sharpe because he writes that word so often.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not at 51st and Orangewood during the day, chances are
Sharpe is at the In Him Outreach Church. He operates the church's
sound system and makes recordings of sermons that are distributed
to members of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   He sees his children three or four times a week and has become a
big part of their lives again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at it, it didn't just happen to him, it happened
to my whole family,'' Kathi Sharpe said. ``It was difficult at that
time to see the end of the tunnel. We just hung in there and
figured it couldn't get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his troubles, Sharpe managed to stay financially sound.
A court order allowed him access to just $5,000 a month. Today, the
children are well taken care of, and Sharpe said he really doesn't
need to work.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe knows the pain he caused his family. ``I heard a saying
once,'' he said. ``A king's character permeates his kingdom. While
I was out there living life disobediently and recklessly my
children were suffering.'' &QL; 
Looking ahead &QL; 
Cynics will say Sharpe's conversion won't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``In God's infinite wisdom, he prepared me for this time, when
he knew people would doubt my sincerity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having played for the Cardinals . . .,'' he added, laughing,
``one of the things I found myself doing was refuting those
negative reports, to always have hope and believe in myself and our
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   He has plans for the future. He would like to minister to
athletes, many of whom he believes are struggling as he did.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Luis Sharpe friends and family know. Strong-willed
and determined. A man with a vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery of the gospel is that God will use imperfect
vessels to preach or spread a perfect gospel,'' he said. ``I
believe that as a Christian man, my failures are my successes. They
represent the miracle that I survived.'' &QL;

CLINTON PLANS INITIATIVE ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon propose a $25 million
initiative to combat the spread of infectious diseases, including
virulent new strains of microbes that resist treatment by
antibiotics and other drugs, administration officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials have become alarmed about the emergence
of such ``superbugs'' and more generally about the increasing
incidence of infectious diseases once thought to be under control.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money will be included in the budget request that
Clinton sends to Congress early next year, administration officials
said. It represents a 31 percent increase in the federal program to
address emerging infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the new director of the Federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, said the additional money would be
used to investigate outbreaks of infectious diseases, to upgrade
the laboratories of state and local health departments, to develop
new diagnostic tests and to educate doctors and patients about the
dangers from excessive use of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal officials want to improve communications
with city and county health departments. In a recent test, the
Centers for Disease Control found that it was unable to contact
nearly half of the local public health departments within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over several decades,'' Koplan said, ``the capabilities of
state and local health departments have waned. They don't have the
resources to do what they can and need to do. Many county health
departments don't have computers, don't have e-mail or Internet
capabilities. They report serious diseases on paper in the mail to
state health departments and to CDC.''
</P>
<P>
   Such delays make it more difficult for federal officials to
track the spread of disease, identify the causes and take action,
Koplan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing the genetic characteristics of certain bacteria,
scientists can sometimes identify a common source, as they did
recently with an outbreak of food poisoning from Listeria that
killed four people and sickened 40.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can send the ``genetic fingerprints'' for such
bacteria by Internet to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Laboratory technicians there can compare the genetic data from
different parts of the country, reaching conclusions with fewer
cases than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But, Koplan said, ``the whole system is only as strong as its
weakest link, which unfortunately is often the county health
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants to beef up its network of doctors,
hospitals and laboratories that report cases of infectious disease,
so that outbreaks will be detected more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new money would be used to investigate the growing
threat posed by germs that are resistant to antibiotics. Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., expressed
concern about the problem at a recent symposium on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Overuse of antibiotics in the United States and around the
world, fueled by patients who demand antibiotics for every bout of
the sniffles, has caused microbes to adapt to these drugs, creating
``superbugs'' that resist the usual methods of treatment.
Drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, gonorrhea and pneumococcal
infections _ the most frequent cause of middle-ear infections in
children and pneumonia in the elderly _ have become common in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress approves the president's budget request, the Public
Health Service would conduct a national education campaign to
encourage more judicious use of antibiotics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Many people with a fever and cough assume that antibiotics
won't do any harm, but that's not true,'' Koplan said. ``They can
do harm. They promote the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria.
Moreover, many infections are viral. Antibiotics are of no value in
treating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty million unnecessary prescriptions are written every year
for childhood viral infections that do not respond to antibiotics,
and drug-resistant bacteria cause a million ear infections a year,
many of them in children, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control wants to develop new diagnostic
tests so doctors will know immediately whether a patient's illness
is caused by bacteria or viruses, or by some new strain of
microorganism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they also wanted to investigate the use and
possible misuse of antibiotics in home health care, a booming
sector of the health care industry that is certain to grow as the
population ages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials want to know whether antibiotics have been misused by
patients receiving care at home and whether they too are being
attacked by drug-resistant bacteria.

HOLLYWOOD A TOUGH TOWN FOR AGING WRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- This is not your father's Hollywood, not for
writers over 40, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place where you really begin to notice that you're too old
is at the meeting level when you're pitching,'' said 50-year-old
Larry DiTillio, who began working in Hollywood in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell right away that these guys, who are in their 20s
and 30s, are not interested. From their standpoint, it's like their
father walked into the meeting. Do you really want to work with
your father for an extended period?''
</P>
<P>
   For 81-year-old Oliver Crawford, who survived blacklisting to
earn credits on ``Perry Mason'' and other top shows, there's little
interest in grandfather-aged writers, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were not interested in me when they began to call
me Mr. Crawford. Everyone had always called me Ollie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contemporaries are either retired or dead. The trouble is
that science is doing what it can to keep guys like me alive but
the business is telling me, hey, you've had it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Writers Guild of America, the union that
represents TV scriptwriters and movie screenwriters, found that
many producers definitely don't want to work with their fathers,
especially in television. Professors William and Denise Bielby
described an increasingly bleak outlook for older writers and
disclosed that 77 series last season had no writers over 50 and
half a dozen, including ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's Closet,'' had
no writers over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Older writers find they're being excluded not just from the
plethora of shows aimed at adolescents but also from adult-oriented
shows. ``The executives have really convinced themselves if you're
50, you can't write sharp dialogue anymore for something like `NYPD
Blue,' '' said Steven Lord, who has over 200 writing credits.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's discrimination against older writers, though
illegal, is nothing new. The issue began to receive notice in the
early 1990s when a documentary, ``Power and Fear: the Hollywood
Grey List,'' compared the problem with Hollywood's blacklists of
the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, conditions have deteriorated. Some writers have even
taken the same steps as aging actors and actresses -- dyeing their
hair, lying about their age and obliterating credits more than a
decade old. And much like Woody Allen's character in the 1976 movie
``The Front,'' some enlist a younger relative or friend to act as a
partner during pitch meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Why are older writers pushed out of the way? The short answer
lies with Hollywood's legendary obsession with youth and its
pursuit of the next Steven Spielberg or Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a 32-year-old writer-actress named Kimberlee Kramer
felt the need to change her name to the now-notorious Riley Weston.
She passed herself off as a 19-year-old in order to get hired for
``Felicity'' as part of a $300,000 deal and was quoted saying
things like, ``In many ways, I am Felicity.'' When Kramer's
subterfuge became public in October, no one expressed any surprise
that a writer had pretended to be someone 13 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   What's particularly troubling for older writers is the attention
and resources lavished on young and mostly untested writers.
Earlier this month, 20th Century Fox TV announced a three-year deal
worth at least $2 million annually for 25-year-old Seth MacFarlane,
creator of Fox's yet-to-be launched animated comedy ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Older writers acknowledge that the brutal competition in their
field, where there are literally warehouses full of unproduced
scripts, makes working in Hollywood among the most ephemeral
occupations. They know that when producers say things like ``This
show skews younger'' and ``Do you think you can write about younger
people?'' it's time to find another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Because what the producer is really saying is this -- ``If this
show flops, at least they won't be able to accuse me of hiring
someone who can't cut the mustard anymore.''
</P>

CANADIANS RILED AT PLAN TO CUT TIES TO QUEEN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada has its queen and, as some politicians are
discovering, God save those who would try to sever the country from
its monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Senior advisers to Prime Minister Jean Chretien, along with some
unnamed leaders of the governing Liberal Party, are still smarting
from the sharp response they received to a recent informal proposal
to mark Canada's entrance into the new millennium by finally
cutting all the country's ties to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   After the unnamed leaders passed along the idea to a friendly
reporter and the trial balloon was sent up in a prominent article,
crowds of loyalists came out to shoot it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bauble on the national Christmas tree that these people
think they can pluck off in 1999,'' was what John Aimers thought of
the Liberal idea. Aimers had been through this fight before, which
was why he helped found the Monarchist League of Canada, based in
Toronto, more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a naive, fanciful project of some gutless wonders in
Ottawa who don't want to attach their names to this,'' Aimers said.
``They should be more careful of what they let slip.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a significant amount of backpedaling in the halls of
Parliament after the first reports of the dump-the-queen plan were
released. Although the prime minister's office had made it clear
that Chretien was anxious to hear what Canadians thought of the
idea, in a year-end interview with the Canadian news magazine
Maclean's, Chretien said that abolishing the monarchy was not a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough problems with the separatists in Quebec,''
Chretien said, ``I don't want to have problems with the monarchists
in Ontario.'' And Sophie Galarneau, a spokeswoman for Chretien,
said, ``While it's certainly true that the prime minister would
like to know what Canadians think about it, this is not a
government project at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some officials, like Industry Minister John Manley,
have openly espoused a republican Canada, Deputy Prime Minister
Herb Gray went on television to play down the idea. The premier of
Prince Edward Island then said he would be the first to cast the
one veto it would take from the provinces to block any such
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists at some of Canada's largest newspapers gleefully took
shots at the plan. Dan Gardner, writing in the Ottawa Citizen _ the
newspaper that broke the story _ noted that the plan was billed as
a visionary project to mark the year 2000. But, he wondered,
``Can't we just build a giant dome or something?''
</P>
<P>
   In The Montreal Gazette, columnist Tommy Schnurmacher called the
idea of throwing out the queen ``impertinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's relationship to the queen is a complex one, similar to
that of Australia, another member of the British Commonwealth
seeking to come out from Britain's shadow. For several years, the
Australians have engaged in a debate over whether to remove the
queen as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings toward the royal family are warmer in Canada than they
are in Australia, said Aimers of the Monarchist League, at least in
English-speaking Canada. While most Quebecers are cool to the
crown, royal visits to the Maple Kingdom, as the Monarchists call
it, almost always attract big crowds, and members of the royal
family often vacation in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   While vowing allegiance to the queen is considered by some
Canadians to reveal a lack of independence, Aimers points out that
under the Canadian constitution, Queen Elizabeth is actually
Canada's own monarch, quite separate and apart from being Queen of
England or Queen of Australia, titles she also holds.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the queen's role as head of state, Aimers said, ``is first
and foremost the most significant distinction between Canada and
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site (www.monarchist.ca), the Monarchist League
sells stickers with pictures of the Queen that it suggests can be
attached to letters to the government to show support for the Maple
Crown, and bumper stickers that say ``My Canada Includes the
Monarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian writer Robertson Davies once called the crown ``the
consecrated spirit of Canada.'' Despite changing times, monarchists
want the queen's profile to remain on all Canadian coins, and they
insist the queen is still a central figure in Canadian life.
</P>
<P>
   That much was proved quite smartly, Aimers said, when the
country's immigration service retained the mention of the sovereign
in the Canadian oath of citizenship that was recently updated. The
oath, repeated by all immigrants who become Canadian citizens,
still says, ``I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to Canada and Her
Majesty, Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada.''

LOS ANGELES: mustard anymore.'' Still, writers admit it's a jolt to go from hot to cold in
seemingly just a few weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I worked with some consistency until there was a noticeable
drop off about a dozen years ago,'' said Crawford, the 81-year-old
veteran writer whose credits date back to the so-called Golden Age
of television, including such shows as ``Kraft Theater,'' ``Perry
Mason,'' ``Wagon Train'' and ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford is one of the few writers who managed to resurrect his
career after four years on the Hollywood blacklist, but that no
longer matters much, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound whiny because my credits are really
old-hat credits and they don't carry very much weight,'' he said at
his house in the Fairfax District.
</P>
<P>
   Writers say anti-age attitudes are not as severe in the film
side of Hollywood, where a fairly small group of A-list writers
dominate no matter what their age if they continue to deliver box
office success. But the number of writing jobs for major studio
film projects has stopped growing and the Bielby report showed
several disturbing trends:
</P>
<P>
   --Median earnings for film writers over 40 have been lower than
for younger writers in every year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   --Median earnings for film writers in their 30s have increased
more since 1991 than for any other age group and were the highest
for that group last year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more frustrating for older writers is having to
read about prodigies like Brandon Camp, 27, and Mike Thompson, 29.
Although both were neophytes, their ``Steinbeck's Point of View''
script sold for $750,000; after Tom Cruise expressed interest, the
duo's agent negotiated a three-picture deal that could pay them as
much as $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Marcus, who won an Emmy for writing on ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman,'' said anti-age attitudes have grown to the point that
they permeate Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prejudice against older writers is sort of like the
weather -- everyone talks about it but no one does anything about
it,'' she said. ``The basic message is that if you're over 50, you
should get into real estate or write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, who worked into her late 60s and then spent the last two
years writing a book about her career called ``Whistling Girl,''
believes the problem is worst for baby boomers in their 40s and 50s
because they're partly to blame for the current glorification of
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the children of boomers who are in charge now,'' she
noted. ``In this business, you tend to hire your buddies and
working on a show is very much like being in a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many writers over 40 don't want to talk about age
discrimination, saying that going public would ruin their already
shaky chances for work. About half of the 8,200 members of the
Writers Guild of America, west, work regularly; last year, 260
members lost their right to vote on contracts and in elections
because they had not been able to find work in a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make decisions on using writers are so
scared,'' said one Emmy-winning writer who is still working.
``They're not concerned about the quality of the shows. It's all
about saving their own behind by going with what's tried and
true.''
</P>
<P>
   George Kirgo, a former guild president who led a five-month
strike in 1988, said conditions have worsened in recent years due
to the networks' obsession with younger audiences. ``You get to 45
and forget it,'' said the 72-year-old Kirgo. ``They don't think
that anyone my age can write a show that skews to a younger age.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirgo's credits include an early episode of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' called ``The Forty-Five-Year-Old Man,'' in which WJM
fires Lou Grant because he's too old. The show has an upbeat ending
with Mary Richards arranging for Lou to get his job back, but Kirgo
is pessimistic about his own prospects. Several years ago, he
pitched a movie of the week idea to his agent, who took it to a
network executive. ``Kirgo's too old,'' the executive told the
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even been trying to get TV anymore so I've been
working on movies, books and charity work,'' Kirgo said. ``I think
a lot of older writers find it unbecoming to write for TV but they
still have to earn a living. And they want it to be their decision
when they stop.''

LOS ANGELES: They stop. No one claims that older writers have been entirely shut out of
Hollywood. CBS's ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' for example, employed
one writer under 40 last season of the 15 it used; all 11 writers
on ``Dellaventura'' were over 40.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Burbank-based literary agent Judy Coppage, who specializes in
using older writers, believes that the problems for many older
writers reflect mostly the ferociously competitive landscape and
its economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have writers in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s,''
said Coppage, who's 53 and married to a gerontologist. ``So there
are six decades of writers competing for not that many slots.
Producers are going to hire younger writers because they're going
to be less expensive. A writing career doesn't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The guild's statistics show that a decade ago, nearly half of
writers registered with the guild and in their 50s worked; now,
only a third do. For writers in their 60s, the percentages have
gone from 40 percent in 1988 to 19 percent in 1998. That means
hundreds of writers are left with little to do but collect residual
checks from shows that aired in an era when writers in their 40s
and 50s dominated the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strongly held belief among executives that once
you're past 40, you're not with it anymore and your brain just
dies,'' declared Irma Kalish, whose credits include ``My Three
Sons,'' ``Family Affair'' and ``All in the Family.'' ``And I think
they feel more comfortable with their peer group, so they can do
things like play poker or play golf together.''
</P>
<P>
   So older writers usually lop years off their resumes.
``Unfortunately, I didn't, because I thought my early credits would
help but all they do is date you,'' said Kalish, who admits she
recently brought her 40-year-old son along on a pitch meeting.
``He's an excellent writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the youth-obsessed strategy is largely
economic: What a network charges for advertisements depends more on
how many young adults it attracts. So even though ``Felicity''
reaches a mere 5.5 million viewers and ranks 99th among prime-time
shows, it is universally regarded as a success because it draws
large numbers of 18-to-34-year-old women.
</P>
<P>
   William Bielby, a professor of sociology at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, who has compiled the discrimination
reports for the guild for the past decade, began to notice a rapid
deterioration for older writers coincident with the rise of Fox in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratings began getting done very differently at that point,
with much more detailed reporting on demographics,'' Bielby said.
``Fox was able to capitalize on it because that was the group
advertisers were most interested in reaching. So networks felt they
had to rely on younger writers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a widely held belief that the executives who make
the hiring decisions are doing so out of a peculiar logic -- it's
perfectly OK for a writer to be churning out scripts when he or she
is under 40, but once they reach that age, they ought to be
directing or producing in addition to writing.
</P>
<P>
   Bielby noted that focusing on youthful prodigies and freezing
out all others occurs elsewhere, such as in advertising or
architecture. ``People say that you have to get into management in
your mid-40s or you plateau and don't have much of a future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry DiTillio agrees, saying, ``The age issue is an issue in
every business; it's just become more apparent in this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindi Brooks, who left TV writing eight years ago to become a
successful playwright, said being old is more of an obstacle for
her than being a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked very steadily for 14 years and a lot of the time I
was the only woman or one of the first to get in,'' recalls Brooks,
whose credits include ``Little House on the Prairie,'' ``The
Waltons,'' ``Eight Is Enough'' and ``Fame.'' ``But when the gray
hair started to show, I was out. I didn't want to go the route of
dyeing my hair.''

LOS ANGELES: my hair.'' What's particularly infuriating to older writers is how completely
unembarrassed Hollywood is over freezing them out. They often point
to a 1996 interview given by producer Gary David Goldberg about
``Spin City'' in which he asserted, ``Don't send me any writers
over 29.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldberg did not respond to a request for comment and veteran
sitcom writer Norman Belkin said executives feel no need to
apologize over that attitude. ``The networks have made their choice
and they're comfortable with it,'' he added. ``Right now, the most
attractive people in Hollywood are 30-year-old Harvard and Yale
graduates with MBAs.''
</P>
<P>
   The older writers try not to sound bitter. But the most enraging
part of the Bielby report for them comes from the cold economic
fact that writers in their 30s are getting paid more than any other
group while earnings have declined for those over 40. That's an
astounding shift from a decade ago, when writers in their 40s and
50s commanded the top paychecks, usually after long years of
building up their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that it was the young writers who couldn't get
work, so the pendulum has definitely swung the other way,'' Kalish
said. ``It's definitely happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a writer to do, then?
</P>
<P>
   DiTillio recommends looking at alternative markets and is now
writing science-fiction scripts for the French entertainment
concern Gaumont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been treated as well as I was by the Europeans,''
he admits. ``You're looking at a lot less money -- one `Murder, She
Wrote' equals seven `Babylon 5's. If they won't hire you at one
place, work for another or go to Canada. It's a global business
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppage insists Hollywood hungers as never before for good
writing, no matter how old the writer is, particularly with the
major networks seeing the ongoing erosion of their audiences to
cable. With the migration of cable-bred executives like TBS's Scott
Sassa to NBC and Comedy Central's Doug Herzog to Fox, opportunities
will be opening up for writers who can keep up with the demands of
the market, she believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think writers get better as they get older,'' Coppage said.
``My attitude is you can teach an old dog new tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bielbys and ``Riley Weston'' may have dimmed the allure
of Hollywood for aspiring writers. Paulla Hershey, a 40-year-old
waitress who has been working on three screenplays, said she cried
when she read about the Bielby report.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working on scripts, I thought it was something
I could do forever,'' she said. ``I thought that no one will have
to know what I look like or where I live and that I could just stay
here with my cat and write.''
</P>
<P>
   She still continues to write, however, explaining, ``I don't
want to be a waitress forever. Right now, there's this huge push
toward glorification of kids, but hopefully, five years from now
the trendiness of kids and coming-of-age stories will be out.''

<P>
   WOONSOCKET, R.I. _ Like many, George Saurwein rarely attended
regular religious services, except at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say I was one of those Christmas-and-Easter
Christians,'' said Saurwein, 36, helping himself to a cup of coffee
in the parish hall of St. James Episcopal Church here. ``I had a
relationship with God that was outside the church.''
</P>
<P>
   That was until this fall, when Saurwein's brother-in-law talked
him into going to an Alpha course, a novel approach to Christian
education that has been catching on nationwide in a growing number
of Episcopal congregations, as well as those of other mainstream
Christian denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpha got me closer to people in the church and made me feel
like a part of the community,'' said Saurwein, who now attends
services at St. James every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And while the rector, the Rev. Roger Robillard, is pleased to
see Saurwein and other Alpha graduates fill the pews each week, he
said he was not keeping score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpha's not an instrument for growing my church only, but for
growing the church as a whole,'' Robillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha's objectives are to introduce newcomers to the Christian
faith and to re-establish ties with wayward parishioners through a
10-week videotaped crash course in the basics of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to provide a setting in which participants are not
threatened or judged, the course features a series of lectures by
the Rev. Nicky Gumbel, 43, an Oxford-educated lawyer turned
minister who is on the staff of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church of
Brompton in London. It was there that Alpha was conceived in the
mid-1970s as a Bible study course for new Christians.
</P>
<P>
   A former atheist who once wrote a school essay to disprove the
existence of God and eventually turned to Christianity after
reading the New Testament, Gumbel took charge of the Alpha program
in 1991 and revised it, making the course accessible to a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to keep the message a traditional one, but
change the packaging, to present Christianity in a way that's
culturally relevant to people today,'' said Alistair Hanna, 53,
executive director of Alpha North America, which is based at St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York and is the base for the
Alpha movement in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of humorous anecdotes, personal
reflections and passages from many theological sources _ from the
Scriptures to C.S. Lewis to Charlie Brown _ Gumbel addresses
questions like, ``Why does God allow suffering?'' ``Why and how do
I pray?'' and ``Is Christianity boring, untrue and irrelevant?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is for intelligent seekers who don't yet belong to a
church,'' said the Rev. Jeffrey Black, who used the course to
attract all 250 members of his year-old congregation at St.
Barnabas Episcopal Church in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Each Alpha session begins with a potluck supper, followed by a
viewing of a videotape and then a discussion moderated by a local
Alpha leader, typically a parish member or sometimes the church
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alpha is most popular among Episcopalians, it is
intended to be cross-denominational and has attracted Roman
Catholics, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many barriers being broken down between
denominations these days, so Alpha fits in well,'' said the Rev.
Larry Showalter, pastor of Boston's Ruggles Baptist Church, where
the Alpha course has been offered for a little more than a year.
Showalter said Alpha was directly responsible for a 5 percent to 10
percent increase in membership at his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpha draws in people who are on the fringe as well as those
who are `unchurched' and are just looking to understand the
Christian faith,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Alpha was introduced in the United States in 1995, nearly
2,000 churches have offered the course. Sales of Alpha course
materials in the United States are brisk: 170,000 Alpha manuals and
4,000 sets of videos in the last two years, Alpha officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha officials estimate that more than 1.5 million people
worldwide have taken the course, which is offered in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep enough in the warehouse,'' said Carrie Salstrom,
marketing manager for David C. Cook Church Ministries in Colorado
Springs, the publisher of Alpha tapes and literature and the
nation's largest nondenominational publisher of Sunday school
materials. Ms. Salstrom said Alpha materials had become ``one of
the company's largest lines'' over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha's ready explanations on issues of faith and its
no-pressure approach account for much of its success, said James
Wind, president of Alban Institute in Bethesda, Md., an independent
organization that tracks trends in congregations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's presented in a way that people who are constantly being
marketed to can relate to,'' Wind said. Although he said he
supported any ``new and creative way to invite people into the
faith,'' including Alpha, he wondered whether the course delved
deeply enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the ambiguities and deeper puzzles and paradoxes of the
Christian faith being represented here?'' he said. ``I'm not
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics have picked up Alpha and put it down for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's packaged well and is attractive, but the study of
Christianity is not as simple as Gumbel makes it out to be,'' said
Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology at Georgetown
University and author of ``Roman Catholicism in America,'' which is
to be issued in July by Columbia University Press. ``He makes the
claims of Christianity seem so historically certain that he leaves
little need for faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who bridle at Alpha's hard-line stance
against divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Some ministers chose
to ignore the program's position on the last issue, and edited it
from their presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Still others question whether or not Alpha, owing to its
conservative roots, is as ecumenical in its appeal as its
literature claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that it's bringing in a whole lot of new
people,'' said the Rev. Ian Douglas, a theologian at the Episcopal
Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. ``Unfortunately, I think that
most of the people who have participated are like-minded
conservatives looking for more fellowship and to have their
theological positions affirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Alpha has won the support of many religious
leaders both here and abroad, including the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. George Carey; the televangelist Robert
Schuller and William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, Alpha's top American official, says his goal is to offer
the program in 50,000 churches in the United States and attract 8
million to 10 million new people to the program. His plan: get an

   ``If you walked through any 18th-century village here or in
Europe, the biggest, noisiest building was always the church, with
its bell and its clock,'' Hanna said. ``Today, I think the church

to raise the noise level again.''

<P>
   PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia _ For most of the last
decade, Gen. Anthony Zinni, a square-jawed, square-shouldered
Marine, has been in the middle of some of the nation's least
traditional military campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He shuttled aid to the former Soviet Union and established a
Kurdish haven in northern Iraq. He led American troops into a
starving Somalia in 1992, and after that mission turned to
disaster, brought the last of the U.N. troops out in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which spent hard, cold decades preparing to battle
a nuclear superpower, calls these missions ``operations other than
war.'' As far as Zinni is concerned, they are the future of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we learned after the Cold War is that we have
strange missions _ not only missions that have been nontraditional,
like peacekeeping and humanitarian relief, but these sorts of
limited missions like we just saw,'' he said in an interview aboard
a C-17 flying from Kuwait to this desert outpost south of Riyadh on
a holiday visit to the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The ``limited mission,'' of course, was the four days of air and
missile strikes that Zinni directed against Iraq this month. It was
a campaign intended to damage President Saddam Hussein's military,
but to stop well short of the knockout blow that President
Clinton's critics say should be the real objective.
</P>
<P>
   With the strikes over and American policy toward Iraq lurching
into a new period of uncertainty, a far more daunting task now
falls to Zinni, who as commander of the U.S. Central Command
oversees all American forces from Sudan to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He has to keep the military pressure on Iraq while shoring up
the fragile support of Arab allies still wary of American motives.
He must maintain the morale of 20,000 American troops while drawing
up plans for new strikes that officials at the highest levels in
the Pentagon believe are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more difficult to deal with Saddam directly,'' Zinni
said, referring to an attack that would set out to overthrow the
Iraqi government. ``It would be politically difficult. It would be
difficult in the region. And it could create more instability to
declare an all-out war, let's say, and go to Baghdad.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he cited the long American standoffs with Cuba and
North Korea. ``There are places in the world that for regional
stability, you have to use some sort of containment,'' he said. ``A
lot of people don't like that word because it doesn't give them the
immediate gratification of a resolution. And when the resolution is
a change of regime, then it gets more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinni's is the job made famous during the Persian Gulf war by H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded the multinational coalition that
routed Iraq's army and liberated Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It is, arguably, a harder job now.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Storm, as the 1991 operation was known, had the benefit
of a clear enemy and a clear objective: reversing the brutal
occupation of one country by another. Nearly eight years later, the
effort to keep Saddam from regaining the military power he had has
evolved into a difficult and, Zinni conceded, unsatisfying strategy
of containment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at this not as a U.S.-Iraq problem,'' he said,
``but as a regional problem.'' While the political reality ``puts
some limitations'' on American actions, he added, ``I think within
those constraints and given the objectives of regional stability
and staying with the international community, we are reducing his
ability to threaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Charles Zinni, 55, grew up the youngest of four children
of Italian immigrants in Conshohocken, Pa., a blue-collar town near
Philadelphia. His father, after only eight years in the United
States, joined the American Expeditionary Forces, which fought in
France during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni has been involved in the Marine Corps since his first day
of college at Villanova University in 1961, when he encountered a
Marine recruiter and signed up to spend his summers training as a
platoon leader. He left Villanova in 1965 with a degree in
economics and a commission as a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he was in Vietnam, serving as an adviser to the
South Vietnamese marine corps. He spent 11 months with his South
Vietnamese counterparts, not just fighting alongside them but
living with them, learning their language and immersing himself in
their culture. He described showing up at an American base with a
Vietnamese platoon during the Tet offensive and, sick and
underweight from months in the jungles, being suspected of being a
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I saw the war from a different perspective,'' he said.
``It kind of shaped me in terms of the impact of the culture you're
involved in, the environment you're involved in, and how important
that is in making decisions on military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took over Central Command, with headquarters at MacDill
Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., in August 1997, Zinni again immersed
himself in a foreign culture, reading up on Arab and Islamic
history and learning some Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   It has, he said, made him more sensitive to Arab values. He once
dismissed calls to assassinate Saddam by noting that such a
cavalier attitude sounds like anti-Arab prejudice in the region
since no one in the United States today openly calls for the
assassinations of other publicly named nemeses, like Slobodan
Milosevic, Fidel Castro or Kim Jung Il of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better understand the environment, the culture, because
what may make sense to you may not make sense on the ground and may
actually be counterproductive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni rose through the officer ranks after a second tour in
Vietnam, during which he was badly wounded when his company
attacked a North Vietnamese headquarters in the Queson Mountains.
In 1974 he was assigned to Marine Corps headquarters, his first and
only assignment there; he has relatively little experience in the
political ways of Washington, compared with other four-star
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   He gained a reputation as an outspoken officer willing to break
with conventional doctrine. And while he was not involved in some
of the nation's largest military operations since Vietnam _ the
invasion of Panama in 1989 and the Persian Gulf war in 1991 _ he
made a name for himself in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw the effort to feed and protect the Kurds in northern
Iraq after Saddam cracked down on them after his defeat in 1991.
This left Zinni with a profound impression of Saddam's methods. ``I
went into Kurdish villages that were gassed,'' he said last year.
``I went into villages where no stone stood upon stone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Somalia in 1992, he served as director of operations for the
American-led relief effort, where he tried to open channels of
communication with the faction leaders, including Mohammed Farrah
Aidid, whose attempted arrest later led to the deaths of 18
American soldiers. By 1993 he was the special assistant to Robert
Oakley, the administration's special envoy to a mission that was
spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   He was commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force
when he returned to Somalia to pull out the last peacekeepers. He
was the first American commander to arm his troops with novel
weapons he had seen at the Marine Combat Development Command in
Quantico, Va., including sponges and gooey foams that would hinder
people but not kill them.
</P>
<P>
   His experiences in Somalia convinced him that the military's
doctrine did not address the particularities of peacekeeping or
humanitarian missions. So he wrote a list of aphorisms, called ``20
Lessons Learned,'' many of which, he said, applied to the strikes
against Iraq. ``Don't lose the initiative/momentum,'' reads one.
``Don't make enemies; if you do, don't treat them gently,'' goes
another.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ``Line up military tasks with political objectives.''

TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE MIXES TRADITION AND HOLLYWOOD HYPE

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Here in the shaded glades of live oaks and,
yes, December roses, one of California's oldest civic traditions
lives on in these cold nights and crisp mornings. This is the place
where thousands of square feet of chicken wire, hundreds of gallons
of glue and acres of seeds, plants and flowers somehow become the
Tournament of Roses Parade each New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The festival was founded in 1890 by the Valley Hunt Club of
Pasadena to celebrate California's mild winters, and it has evolved
into an indelible mix of blue-blood boosterism and up-to-the-minute
Hollywood hype.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer ``petal-pushers'' join forces with deep-pocketed
sponsors like Eastman Kodak and Dr Pepper willing to spend up to
$300,000 to promote their products to a worldwide television
audience of 325 million viewers in 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla has even inspired a subversive counter-event, the
annual Doo Dah Parade in late November, in which an anarchic group
of local wags sponsors a stream of Elvis impersonators, dogs in
drag and other oddments, mocking the cherished, polite rituals of
the Rose Parade and its organizers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the real parade participants, the job is deadly serious,
and this is their crunch time. At Phoenix Decorating, which builds
half the parade's floats in the Rosemont Pavilion in the shadow of
the Rose Bowl, workers are finishing up what may be this season's
most elaborate offering, Universal Studios' five-story facsimile of
Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat, promoting the opening of Universal's new
Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Fla., next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say it's THE float this year,'' said
Phoenix Decorating president Bill Lofthouse, a former painting
contractor who has been building Rose Parade floats for 43 years,
as he surveyed a recent test of the cat's hinged neck, which bends
down to let the float clear a 17{-foot overpass along the parade
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the really challenging ones.''
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark striped stovepipe of red-and-white carnations
and a black and white coat of crushed sweet rice, black firegrass,
Japanese seaweed and onion seed, the smiling cat will roll down
Colorado Boulevard on New Year's morning, propelled by a diesel
engine and animated by gas-powered generators and a half-mile of
hydraulic hose, as stunt actors playing Thing 1 and Thing 2 hang
out of the hat and other actors portraying other Universal
characters, like Spider-Man and Popeye, pop out of a big red box.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent turmoil and turnover among Universal's top
movie management, one producer at a rival studio suggested wryly
that it might be more appropriate to have studio executives popping
out of the box, scrambling for cover in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and studios have been sponsoring Rose Parade floats
for decades; MGM built a flower-filled Munchkinland 60 years ago to
promote ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Universal had not offered one since
1970, but as studio designers watched the parade last year, they
decided that its worldwide television audience of a third of a
billion people would be the ideal captive market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the easiest business decisions I ever made,''
said Cathy Nichols, chairman and chief executive of Universal's
recreation group, which oversees its theme parks, including the
famous studio tour here. ``It's an over-the-top entertainment
experience, and that's a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat will have a coveted spot near the front of the march
(fourth in line) but it is hardly the only spectacular offering in
this year's parade, whose theme is ``Echoes of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   American Honda is sponsoring a tribute to space exploration with
a giant Buzz Aldrin floating above a lunar landing module, as Neil
Armstrong's line about ``one small step . . .'' plays over a sound
system. The city of St. Louis has a float drawn by flesh-and-blood
Clydesdales, with more flower-and-glue horses on board, along with
a flowery mock-up of Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, which
was built in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In any given year, the 56-float parade has six to eight times as
many applicants as it can accommodate, and it takes only about half
a dozen new participants a year. Every surface must be covered with
real plants, flowers or seeds, and crass commercialism is frowned
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of espouse a tradition in which the companies offer
greeting cards to the world,'' said Steven Leland, the parade's
director of sponsorship and marketing. ``It's not a hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   For Craig Hanna, Universal's director of attraction development,
designing a flower-covered float, with room for one driver, two
spotters, a sound technician with a 20,000-watt audio system and
three animators to run the moving parts, like the spinning goldfish
bowl, was a shift from creating theme park rides. He found that
working in flowers was not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not,'' he said, ``have a green thumb.''

WAR IN CONGO HAS ITS ROOTS IN RWANDAN GENOCIDE OF 1994

   GISENYI, Rwanda _ Beans are for sale in big metal buckets, and
the potatoes are coming in. But in a camp for the displaced near
here, there are still children whose bellies swell with hunger from
under filthy T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Higiro, 23, pointed his machete toward the banana trees
where his brother was killed this year by invaders who swarmed in,
as they often do, across the Congo border a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Rwanda's turbulent northwest, there is evidence
everywhere of the unfinished business of the attempt in 1994 to
kill every Tutsi in the country. Here too is the best place to see
why Rwanda is fighting so furiously in Congo, why Rwanda helped
spur a rebellion there in August that has now widened into a war
involving at least six outside nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda is the smallest of those, but it has the biggest
emotional stake in Congo, and negotiators in Africa and beyond
acknowledge that Rwanda must feel safe from threats on its border
if there is to be peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Rwanda that the ethnic conflicts between the Tutsi
minority and the Hutu majority exploded into a Hutu-directed
genocide that killed more than half a million people in 1994. Many
of the killers fled across the border into Congo.
</P>
<P>
   From there, these Hutu forces have been carrying out raids into
Rwanda in a campaign to overthrow its government, which is now led
by Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rwanda's desire to stop these raids that led the
government to back the rebellion of Laurent Kabila, who won power
last year. But Kabila proved less pliant than the Rwandans liked,
and as the attacks from the Hutu militia increased, they accused
him of losing control of the borders. Rwanda then helped to sponsor
a new rebellion _ this time against Kabila _ which began in August.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United Nations asserts in a new report, Kabila has
enlisted some of the former soldiers and Hutu militiamen conducting
the raids on Rwanda to fight against the new rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profoundly shocking state of affairs,'' the United
Nations said, accusing Congo of giving these forces a ``form of
legitimacy'' because they are fighting along with Kabila's other
allies, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
   As Philip Gourevitch, an authority on the 1994 genocide, put it,
``You cannot underestimate the real and psychological significance
of the fact that the army and militia of the Rwandan genocide _
supposedly being pursued by a United Nations tribunal _ are being
fielded as the legitimate army of Kabila's government.''
Gourevitch's book on the subject, ``We Wish to Inform You That
Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families,'' was published this
year by Farrar Straus and Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine any country on earth in Rwanda's shoes
not feeling called upon to fight this war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, casting the
fight as an invasion by Rwanda and Uganda. That interpretation has
found support in Congo _ where the rebellion is unpopular with many
people _ as well as among many other African states disturbed to
watch Rwanda and Uganda try to overthrow their neighbor's
government for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   But Rwandan officials point to the continuing problems in the
northwest as proof of why they need to fight in Congo until its
borders are secure. Over the last two years, aid agencies,
diplomats and rights officials estimate, perhaps 5,000 people have
been killed in attacks by Hutu militias and, in some cases, by
Rwandan soldiers in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has been centered in two provinces in the
northwest, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, on the border with Congo, an area
of rich volcanic soil that in peace grows an abundance of beans,
corn, cassava and potatoes. Now the two areas are swelling, with
roughly 600,000 people displaced in the turmoil, four times the
number of eight months ago. Most are living in fetid camps, where
they are being fed by the World Food Program, which doubled its
distribution in November.
</P>
<P>
   A blue appointment book on the desk of Ramadhan Barengayabo, the
local district commissioner, tells the complex story of one of
those camps, Busasamana, where about 54,000 people, mostly Hutu,
live a few miles from Congo's border. The first attack came in
December 1997, when a band of perhaps 1,500 Hutu militia swarmed
the area around the camp, killing five people and releasing 103
prisoners, 67 of them suspects in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people living in the area are Hutu; the attack was
not directed against them but against the local government, run by
Tutsis. (Barengayabo said he was a target, but he happened to be
out of town. His house servant was one of those killed.)
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, all but 2,500 of the 62,000 people then in the
area fled, many to live in the forest with the raiders, saying they
feared violence from the Rwandan Army. The refugees also believed
the raiders, who are known as the interahamwe, when they promised a
revolution to restore Hutu rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to lie to the population that God sent the
interahamwe to help the Hutu in Rwanda,'' said Clement Nsengiyumva,
a 38-year-old Hutu engineer who lives in the camp. But slowly food
began running out. The Tutsi-controlled government, far from
collapsing, began encouraging Hutus to abandon the militia in
return for food, shelter and protection.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics of the Rwandan government have begun to wonder
if in fact the resettlement program has the added effect of
allowing soldiers to keep a tighter control of the Hutu in the
region. Certainly the Hutu militia branded those who returned as
collaborators and, rather than killing only Tutsis, turned their
violence onto some fellow Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, after about 6,000 Hutus had returned to Busasamana,
the militia attacked, killing 86 people and wounding 136, according
to the district commissioner's blue book. There were other attacks.
Higiro, who is Hutu, said his 26-year-old brother was a victim of
the violence, his guilt assumed because he tried to run away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only interahamwe killing other Hutu because they didn't
want to go with them,'' Barengayabo said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to settle the rebellion in Congo has become bogged
down, as the Rwandans and Ugandans, who have their own border
problems, refuse to withdraw until their security is guaranteed.
Kabila, who refuses to talk to the rebels, says there can be no
peace until Rwanda and Uganda withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of proposals to break the stalemate
before the war in Congo escalates to sustained fighting between the
outside combatants.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested a peacekeeping
force along the border. The recent U.N. report recommended
disarming and demobilizing the militia, even as it noted that this
would be an ``expensive, difficult and risky operation.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard, though, to persuade Rwanda to take anything
less than a continued direct role along its borders. Since it sent
its soldiers to Congo, local officials and aid workers say, life
has become quieter in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, even though aid
officials say the need for food remains severe. In Busasamana the
population is nearly back to its original number. On a shelf in
Barengayabo's office sit 12 potatoes with neat labels, one specimen
for each variety grown in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo started nearly five months ago. Potatoes take
three months to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first harvest,'' he said. ``It's very nice. You
can see for yourself.''

   NAPA, Calif. _ On a bend in the picturesque Napa River, local
philanthropists and artists have joined forces to create an elite
boarding school devoted to art.
</P>
<P>
   Named the Oxbow School, its first class will arrive for a
semester beginning next September. The class will be made up of 48
juniors drawn from private and public high schools around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The education takes an innovative approach in which every class
_ not just art but history and English, math and science _ will be
led by both a teacher and a visiting artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the artists in contact with the students up close and
every day,'' said the school's director, Stephen Thomas, a
printmaker and until recently an art teacher and administrator at
the Urban School in San Francisco, a private high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will offer the artists whatever support they need,'' Thomas
added, ``but it's the artists who will decide what they want to do
during their time here. That freedom is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and visiting artists will live in two apartment
buildings next to the school, which will have four studios.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hamilton, Buster Simpson and William Jackson Maxwell will be
among the first participating artists. All are known for their
outdoor site installations.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic focus for the first term will draw on the school's
location along the Napa River, which regularly floods in winter.
Napa residents earlier this year approved a flood-control program
to let the river reclaim adjacent lands, rather than contain it in
diversion channels. And though the river rehabilitation program
will not begin for several years, the students will use it as an
artistic theme.
</P>
<P>
   Oxbow's is not the first semesterlong boarding school program
with a theme. In 1984 the Mountain School in Vershire, Vt., was
opened by the Milton Academy of Milton, Mass., for students to
study the environment. More recent programs include the Maine Coast
Semester in Wicasset, Me., and Cityterm at the Masters School in
Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Oxbow came from Ann Hatch, who since the 1970s has
been a major contributor to the arts in San Francisco. Ms. Hatch
started the Capp Street Project, an artists-in-residence program,
and she serves on the board of the San Francisco Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hatch paid $2.5 million for the properties that make up the
campus. Her partners in Oxbow are the Napa Valley vintner Robert
Mondavi and his wife, Margrit Biever Mondavi. The Mondavis have
been working for several years on an American Center for Wine, Food
and the Arts, which will be across the river from the school.
</P>

   The Mondavis donated $6 million, $4 million of which is paying
for the buildings and $2 million for an endowment to pay tuition
for local children. The aim is to have one-third of the students
each term coming from schools around Napa.
</P>
<P>
   ``By supporting local students financially through the
endowment,'' Mrs. Mondavi said, ``then the community understands
how much commitment there is to the project. Otherwise people in
the community would just think, `Oh, they're putting in a school
for the rich.' By doing it this way, everybody has a chance.''

FOR THE HOUSE, MUCH TO OVERCOME IN NEXT SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rarely has a new Congress had its future shaped so
firmly by its predecessor. With only a few days left of its old
life, the 105th Congress seems to have frozen the early agenda and
tone of the 106th.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is the main, if not quite the only, reason. The
weakness and instability of congressional leadership is the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Congress passed hardly any significant
legislation in 1998. And its preference for investigations of the
president left the public unhappy enough that Republicans lost
seats in the House. Now, with 223 seats, they have the thinnest
majority since 1953. Any time the Republicans lose a net of six
votes, the Democrats can defeat them.
</P>
<P>
   Really skillful, experienced leadership might overcome those
numbers. Since Election Day, the Republicans have lost two
speakers, Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston. And in neither case did
they consider anyone else in the elected leadership, let alone the
mutually distrustful Texans who have held the No. 2 and 3 jobs
since 1994, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hastert of Illinois may yet emerge as more than
Gingrich's health operative and DeLay's deputy, but there is no
compelling evidence of his leadership skills yet.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Senate, Trent Lott has had two and a half years as
majority leader, and his footprints are faint. He is not really an
ideologue himself, but he has to worry about ideologues' dominance
of his caucus.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be a while before his political blunder of
criticizing the bombing of Iraq and then saying he had not really
meant it is forgotten. It is not as dramatic as voting for
impeachment and then saying, ``Oh, never mind,'' as some House
Republicans did the week before last, but it is close.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the House really liberate itself from impeachment just
by sending the matter to the Senate. The bitterness between the two
parties is at peak levels, and while the country may not regard
DeLay with the scorn it came to feel for Gingrich, Democrats think
of him as an ultrapartisan hack, and they regard him, not Hastert
or Armey, as the real boss of the House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And the House has trapped the Senate, setting its agenda by
referring two articles of impeachment demanding that President
Clinton be tried, convicted and removed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a welcome task, like highway bills or an opportunity
to share credit for tax cuts. Most senators would rather not have a
fully fought-out trial with Monica Lewinsky as a star witness.
</P>
<P>
   They have lots of reasons. Some actually have bills they would
rather be working on. Others find the subject simply disgusting.
Many think the charges are faulty. Most think there is no prospect
of getting the 67 votes for conviction. And none like the idea of
abiding by the Senate rule requiring them to sit silently through
the proceedings, a spectacle the former majority leader Howard
Baker recently called ``mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting together on a way to squeeze this issue back into
the toothpaste tube may prove beyond Lott, whose thinking on the
matter is unknown. Most people who want censure want the president
to admit he lied, and he says he will not. Some senators want to
see a trial go to a verdict, to embarrass even if they cannot expel
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senate traditionalists want to make sure the rules are carefully
obeyed, although the rules are 130 years old. And senators
instinctively bristle at advice from the outside, whether it is
DeLay urging conviction or former presidents and former senators
calling for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Some resolution may come quickly, though the Senate is not known
for speed. But if it does not, the standard of disagreeability
could approach the House level.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, politicians of both parties are eager to show that
government can work, that they can do important things for the
nation even in the current atmosphere. Fix Social Security for
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 105th Congress has made what seemed last summer to be
an enormous task for the 106th Congress into a monumental one, both
through the distraction and anger of impeachment and the removal of
first Gingrich and then Livingston from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congress does nothing for months, not too much serious
law-making will probably be lost. First sessions of Congress tend
not to be very productive anyhow.

PRESIDENT VOWS NEW WAR AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summoning a somber image of unopened packages
beneath a Christmas tree (``presents for a child killed by a drunk
driver''), President Clinton on Saturday promised to renew his
Administration's fight against drunken driving in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a generation, drunk-driving has been one of America's
greatest public-safety challenges,'' Clinton said in his weekly
radio address in announcing new steps by the Justice and
Transportation departments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would try again to gain passage of a nationwide
.08 blood-alcohol standard for drunken driving. Congress rejected
that proposal last May as it passed a transportation bill, and
safety groups accused lawmakers of capitulating to the liquor
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The president promised grants to states and other incentives to
enforce laws against drinking by minors; to reinforce programs to
prevent drunken driving, and to pass and enforce strong state
highway-safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With alcohol flowing at parties and millions of families
taking to the road to see friends and relatives, the holiday season
can also be a season of tragedy,'' Clinton said. ``Last December,
more than 1,300 Americans lost their lives in alcohol-related
crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are not all disheartening, he said, noting that
the number of people killed in alcohol-related crashes dropped to
an all-time low in 1997. Last year, for the first time since the
government began keeping track in 1975, alcohol was involved in
fewer than 40 percent of all traffic deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the
Transportation Department, reported in August that alcohol-related
traffic fatalities totaled 16,189 in 1997, down 1,029, or 6
percent, from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said there was much more to be done. ``The most
effective action we can take to make our roads safer is to set the
national impaired-driving standard at .08 percent blood-alcohol
content,'' he said. ``No one will ever doubt that a person with
that much blood alcohol is unfit to drive after meeting Brenda
Frazier.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Frazier, of Westminster, Md., appeared at the White House
last March to back Clinton's call for a nationwide .08 standard.
She recalled watching as her 9-year-old daughter was killed by a
car driven by a man whose blood-alcohol level was exactly .08
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted the .08
standard, while most other states, including New York, Connecticut
and New Jersey, have a .10 standard.
</P>
<P>
   While individual reactions to alcohol vary, a 170-pound man with
an empty stomach would reach the .08 level by consuming four
8-ounce glasses of beer in an hour. A 137-pound woman with an empty
stomach would reach that level by downing three glasses of beer in
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It am determined to succeed in setting a .08 standard in the
New Year,'' Clinton said. ``It's the right thing to do.''

   MILLENNIUM-OVERVIEW _ Almost 2,000 years ago, a man named Jesus
was born and the world changed forever. The impact of Jesus echoes
through the millinnia. It has profoundly changed the way people
view God, the world and each other. Over the next two weeks, and
the coming year, the Journal-Constitution will take a look at
Jesus, focusing on the spread of Christianity, first in and around
its homeland in the Mid-east, later through Europe and the
Americas, and ultimatley around the world. (White, Atlanta

   MILLENNIUM-CHRISTIANS _ JERUSALEM _ Despite their urban settings
and the politics that engulfs them 2000 years later, the sites
where Christ was born, lived and died are still powerful ``faith
strengtheners'' for millions of Christians world wide. Visits to
the region by Christians _ and they comprise about 75 percent of
Israel's 2.3 million annual tourists _ remind them that Jesus was
human and the ideals he practiced can be practiced by others. The
physical sites still make Jesus' story real. Christian
denominations have picked their favorite spots. Catholics come to
Jerusalem's Old City, where they often rent wooden crosses and walk
the supposed path Jesus took with his cross. Traditional
Protestants gravitate toward the Church of the Nativity and
Evangelicals head for prayer nearby in the Shepherd's Fields.

THE VIRTUES OF RADIANT HEATING
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JAY ROMANO  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, when William Levitt began building what
became the model for modern suburbia _ the 17,000-house complex
known as Levittown, N.Y. _ the Long Island developer employed
radiant heating, a design element rarely used at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using hot air or heavy radiators to heat his houses,
Levitt instead used warm water pumped through copper pipes soldered
together in the cement slab on which the house rested. The system
provided homeowners with an efficient, comfortable source of
central heating.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it also created some problems when chemicals in
the cement conspired with chemicals in the solder to eat through
the copper, causing the system to fail. As a result, many Levittown
homeowners switched to conventional systems.
</P>
<P>
   While residential radiant heating systems are still the
exception rather than the rule, heating experts say, modern
materials and installation techniques have made such systems more
efficient, more comfortable and far less likely to fail than their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The optimal heating technology today is radiant heat,'' said
Frank Finkel, president of Davis &AMP; Warshow, a plumbing- and
heating-supply company in Maspeth, Queens, New York City. ``And the
technology today far surpasses anything that was available at the
end of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said that the cause of the problems with the
radiant-heating systems installed in Levittown 50 years ago _ a
chemical reaction that deteriorated the copper pipe _ was no longer
a factor in modern radiant-heating, or hydronic, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are dozens of reputable companies that make plastic or
rubber radiant-heat tubing that carries a lifetime warranty against
defects,'' Finkel said, noting that the tubing now used in
radiant-heat systems was highly flexible yet able to withstand high
pressures and temperatures. In addition, he said, most
manufacturers build into their tubing what is known as an oxygen
barrier to prevent any chemical reaction from occurring between the
tubing and whatever it happens to be encased in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff really works,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gelber, president of Stan Gelber &AMP; Sons, a heating and
air-conditioning company in Uniondale, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radiant heat is far superior to any other kind of heat,''
Gelber said. ``And that's because instead of heating air, you're
heating mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelber explained that with conventional heating systems _ such
as forced-air systems, baseboard hot water systems and steam or
hot-water radiators _ the heat is transferred from the heat source
to the air in the room. But since air moves around a lot and is not
very good at holding heat to begin with, he said, it is difficult
to maintain a constant temperature from room to room and even
within individual rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gelber said, in a conventionally heated house, the
objects in a room are typically colder than the air surrounding
them. As a result, such objects will actually draw heat from a
person on or near them.
</P>
<P>
   With a radiant-heating system, Gelber said, the system functions
not by heating the air in a room, but by heating the objects in it.
Such objects include things like furniture, tables, appliances,
carpet, draperies and even walls _ starting from the floor and
moving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a gigantic, low-temperature radiator encased
in the floor,'' he said, explaining that since objects in a room
retain heat better than air, they are less likely to ``steal'' heat
from a body in close proximity. ``It is an extremely comfortable
form of heat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Gelber said, a hydronic system provides the most even
heating when the heating tubes are installed during construction
and embedded in a solid material like a cement slab or a ``mud''
layer under a tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   Embedding of the tubes, however, is not essential. This makes it
possible to install radiant heat even in existing houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an existing wood or tile floor, and have access to
the space between the joists below, you can retrofit with radiant
heat,'' Gelber said. In such a case, he explained, the flexible
tubing is ``laced'' through the spaces between the joists, stapled
to the undersurface of the floor and then covered with reflective
material and insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One question we're always asked is whether the heat from the
tubing will dry out the wood floor,'' Gelber said. This, he
explained, is not so because the surface area of the heat source is
so large _ essentially, the area of the floor itself _ that it only
needs to be heated to about 80 degrees. To do that, he said, the
water in the heating tubes must be maintained at about 100 degrees
_ not so hot that it would dry the wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional boilers operate at about 180 degrees,'' he said.
To compensate for the difference in temperature, he said, water
going from the boiler to the hydronic tubing is cooled by passing
it through a mixing valve. In fact, Gelbert said, the mixing valves
used in hydronic systems also make it possible to use one boiler to
run both a conventional hot water-heating system and a
radiant-heating system at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of hydronics,'' he said, explaining that a
homeowner can install radiant heating in just one or two rooms _
the kitchen and bathroom, for example _ while using the existing
hot water heating system for the rest of the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kolyn Marshall, a sales engineer for Heatway, a manufacturer of
radiant-heating products in Springfield, Mo., said that in most
cases a number of mixing valves are used in conjunction with room
thermostats to regulate temperature on a room-by-room, or zoned,
basis. Small circulator pumps then move the water through circuits
in the room or zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, we'll recommend ]-inch diameter tubing in 200-foot
circuits,'' Marshall said, adding that circuits of up to 300 feet
can be installed when half-inch diameter tubing is used.
</P>
<P>
   The most common concern regarding the use of hydronic tubing _
the possibility of future leaks _ is generally addressed as soon as
the system is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always recommend a 24-hour pressure test,'' he said, adding
that the test is to make certain that all the fittings are tight
and that the installer didn't inadvertently staple through one of
the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is one other factor to be considered when
contemplating the installation of radiant heat: the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a low-budget option,'' said Aris Crist, an architect
in Greenwich, Conn. In most cases, he said, installation of a
radiant-heating system will cost one-and-a-half to two times more
than a conventional hot-water baseboard system. And though similar
boilers can be used for either system, he said, the increased
expense is attributable to the cost of high-quality tubing and the
mixing valves used to regulate the temperature of individual
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   While the additional expense is often recovered over time in
reduced energy costs, Crist said, saving money is generally not the
primary motivation for installing a hydronic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have experienced the benefits of a hydronic system
firsthand,'' he said, ``will usually find the money in their budget
to install one.''

 &HT;    Jefferson descendants peel back their past
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The story haunted Mary Anne Medley's family like
a half-remembered dream, a mist of pride and shame drifting quietly
through generations.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, someone would say. We are related to Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Medley heard the story as a girl, but gave it little thought.
Black folks in Depression-era Ohio saw scant reason to examine or
brag about a kinship with one of the nation's founding fathers.
After all, who would have believed them?
</P>
<P>
   But decades later, Medley's daughters, including Trotwood
resident Rosemary Ghoston, began to peel away the layers of their
heritage. Their year-long search took them to libraries,
courthouses and graveyards around the Chillicothe area. It ended
with a few words on a death certificate that filled the women with
diamond-hard certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was real. The story was true. They were related to
Jefferson's slave Sally Hemings, and in all likelihood, to
Jefferson himself.
</P>
<P>
   That was 12 years ago. Since then, scholarship and science have
torn away the veil that shrouded the sexual link between the
nation's third President and a slave. November's revelation that
genetic evidence linked Jefferson and Hemings made magazine covers
and front page headlines. Few doubt Medley's family now.
</P>
<P>
   Their investigation, however, uncovered much more than a famous
ancestor. It exposed a past where black melted into white, where
roots tangled and disappeared within a soil of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   While public questions may be settled, private mysteries remain.
For some, the tale is still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1836, a 31-year-old freed slave named Madison Hemings and his
wife left Virginia for the relatively safe ground of Pike County,
Ohio. He lived quietly, rearing nine children on a farm and
supplementing his modest livelihood with the carpentry skills he
learned as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, 37 years after he arrived in Ohio, nondescript Madison
Hemings leaped onto history's stage.
</P>
<P>
   He gave an interview to the local paper, the Pike County
Republican , in which he made an extraordinary claim: His mother,
Sally Hemings, had been Thomas Jefferson's ``concubine.'' He and
three siblings were the president's children.
</P>
<P>
   The account, which remains the primary source of information on
Jefferson and Sally Hemings, was instantly attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds much better for the (slave) mother to tell her
offspring that 'master' is their father than to acknowledge to them
that some field hand, without a name, had raised her to the dignity
of mother,'' wrote a rival newspaperman five days after the
Republican article appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Madison's life, however, suggests he was no fabricator. He said
that among his siblings, he alone clung to his black heritage.
</P>
<P>
   No portraits exist of Sally Hemings or her children, but they
evidently had extremely fair skin. According to Madison's
interview, Sally was only one-quarter black (one of her
grandparents was African, the rest Caucasian). When her children
left Jefferson's estate of Monticello, all but Madison decided to
pass for white.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Beverly and sister Harriet went to Washington, D.C.,
and married white spouses. His brother Eston, who settled in
Chillicothe for a time, also assumed the role of a white man upon
moving to Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure why Madison, Sally's second-youngest child,
decided to maintain his black identity. One theory, advanced by
author Fawn Brodie in her 1974 book, Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate
History, is that Madison bitterly recalled being raised apart from
Jefferson's white grandchildren. Though his skin may have been
light, his segregated youth spurred him to cast his lot with the
black community, Brodie suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Cinder Stanton, a historian at Monticello, notes that under
Virginia law at the time, Sally Hemings' children were officially
white, since they were three generations removed from a fully black
relation (a distinction that did not spare them from a youth of
slavery).
</P>
<P>
   She speculates, though, that Madison's wife, whom he married in
Virginia, may have had darker skin, making it impossible for them
to live as a white couple.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie's research in the 1970s uncovered Eston Hemings' true
identity, and it was one of his descendents who provided the DNA
linking Sally Hemings with Jefferson. Researchers compared his Y
chromosome with that of a man related to one of Jefferson's uncles.
The chromosomes matched, meaning Thomas Jefferson and the son of
his slave shared the same genes.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians are satisfied that Jefferson fathered Madison as
well, but as of yet, his branch of the family has not provided
clinching evidence. The DNA must come from a male descendent, and
while Madison had three sons, one died before having children and
the other two vanished into the white world, erasing their links to
the family's slave history.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be the last to do so.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Ann Medley was a girl in Greenfield, a small town 20
miles west of Chillicothe, her extended family frequently came to
visit at her grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   But as Medley grew up in the 1920s and 1930s, the gatherings
thinned. Aunts, uncles and cousins simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them married white,'' says the 80-year-old Medley, who
now lives in Chillicothe. ``I imagine if they saw us on the streets
someplace, they would turn their heads. They probably wouldn't want
their spouses to know who they were. (Their spouses) might not have
known that they were black.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the family possessed skin so light the average person
probably would mistake them for Caucasian. Some chose not to
correct that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, for someone black to get a decent job
beyond cleaning or housework . . . a lot of people had to do
that,'' says Rosemary Ghoston, 56, one of Medley's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Medley's children learned the subtleties of their
racial heritage. Patti Jo Harding, 46, a daughter who lives in
Chillicothe, recalls her parents' warning when the family visited a
cousin in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we got (there), they said you can't mention anything
about being black,'' she says. ``We had to act like we were just
friends. We (couldn't) let them know that we're related to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cousin had taken a white wife who was unaware of his true
racial background.
</P>
<P>
   Ghoston, like her mother, has a fair complexion but never
wavered in her racial identity. After attending a segregated
elementary school, she swore to marry a dark-skinned man so no one
would mistake the race of her children. When she began work as a
hairdresser, she always told her customers up front that she was a
black woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that from the beginning, you know who I am, so if
you don't want to come to me, you don't have to come to me,'' she
says. ``And a few, when they found out, did stop coming to me,
especially here in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, a family reunion prompted Ghoston and her
sisters to unravel their father's genealogy, which in turn inspired
them to tackle their mother's side. It was a task, they knew, that
could finally shed light upon the Jefferson legend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everyone was eager for an unmasking. The women's aunt
repeatedly asked them why they wanted to dredge up the past. There
was no honor, she said, in being related to a slaveholder, no
matter how illustrious.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her misgivings, she eventually decided to help. She gave
the women a photograph of her mother as a girl, surrounded by her
parents and nine siblings. Most of the children would later pass
for white, Medley says.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing their mother, Medley's daughters visited
government offices around Chillicothe to retrieve birth and death
certificates. They prowled cemeteries to find their ancestors'
gravestones. And with some help from a cousin, they got a big
break.
</P>
<P>
   The cousin, who happened to be tracking her own ancestry, had
sketched out a chart that connected the family with Sally Hemings.
But it was one link short of completion.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Ghoston was at a library when, for reasons
she can't remember, she picked up a book that contained Madison's
newspaper interview. In it, he lists the names of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing one of those children could be the missing generation,
Medley and her daughter Patti Jo Harding went to the courthouse in
Circleville, where they found the death certificate of Emma Bird.
She was Medley's grandmother, and the last relative they knew much
about.
</P>
<P>
   The paper listed Bird's parents. Her mother, it said, was Sarah
Hemings _ daughter of Madison, granddaughter of Jefferson's slave
Sally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' thought Harding. ``That's them.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came in 1986, yet for years the sisters told few
people about their discovery. They still weren't sure anyone would
believe them, or that anyone would care.
</P>
<P>
   Through a local historian, they made the acquaintance of
Monticello researchers who were compiling histories of the estate's
slaves. That led in 1997 to a reunion of slave descendents. Around
80 families _ most of them linked to Sally Hemings _ joined Medley
and her daughters as they toured the house and grounds where their
ancestors labored.
</P>
<P>
   While the weekend unearthed long-hidden family ties, there were
more surprises to come.
</P>
<P>
   In July of this year, one of the women's cousins, Columbus-area
resident Diane Redman, received a mysterious phone call from a
white woman who said, ``This is going to sound crazy, but I think
we're related.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller, who had begun work on her own family tree, had run
into obstacles. No one was willing to give her much information
about her estranged father's lineage.
</P>
<P>
   She had a single clue to pursue: her mother's recollection of a
long-ago visit to someone by the name of Ida Mae Redman, who
perhaps was a relative. The caller began phoning every Redman in
the Columbus phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you've got the right person,'' Redman said.
``We're black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I kind of figured that,'' the caller replied.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a fight her parents had when she was a child, an
argument in which one of them mentioned black relatives. That, the
caller believed, was the reason some of her family didn't want to
aid her search.
</P>
<P>
   Redman invited the caller to meet at a restaurant. Astonishing
physical resemblances convinced both sides that they were indeed
related, and Redman invited the caller and her siblings to meet the
rest of her family.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering occurred on a warm mid-summer afternoon. While it
was pleasant, Redman says it was obvious the caller and her sisters
were in shock. They learned that their father _ a man whom they
thought was white and a racist _ had two black parents. Their
mother, whose own family cut her off for marrying a black man, had
never told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grew up white,'' Redman says. `` . . . While they felt
they didn't have any racist tendencies, they had never thought
about their skin color, never thought about what it was like to be
a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . To suddenly find out that part of yourself is not what
you thought it was, that's very difficult. How do you explain to
your spouse, 'Oh, by the way, I'm black.' That might not go over
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The two families remain in touch, and the caller and her sisters
plan to gradually tell more of their siblings. Their father still
isn't aware that they know their heritage. Ghoston, the Trotwood
resident, says she would like to write him someday and invite him
to rejoin the scattered family of Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   His children maintain that isn't a good idea. But Ghoston thinks
this moment in history _ when Jefferson and Hemings have been
irrefutably linked, when strict definitions of race seem to be in
flux _ might be the time for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people live a lie, they constantly worry that it's going
to catch up to them,'' she says. ``It can be such a relief when it
is all out in the open.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. _ Maj. Rick Coveno of the Air Force saw his
comrades fall, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Not to enemy fire. To civilian hire.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent assignment developing a military satellite
program, all five of the other midlevel officers working with him
chose to take jobs in private industry rather than their next Air
Force posting, Coveno said.
</P>
<P>
   Father to three young children, with a fourth on the way, he has
resisted such lures so far, despite overtures from job recruiters,
or headhunters, and a sharp awareness of the additional money he
could be earning.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, he said, ``For me and my family, we've been weighing
both sides very heavily. I've even put out some resumes, even
though I love my work right now in the Air Force and we're not poor
by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just such swayable young officers that Defense Secretary
William Cohen seemed to have in his sights when he announced last
week that he was requesting the biggest raise in basic military pay
in a generation, with particular salary carrots for midlevel
officers like Coveno.
</P>
<P>
   For the old rule _ that a strong economy enables a strong
military _ has twisted in the current gale of prosperity. An
economy this strong, with unemployment this low, becomes an
impediment to the military's efforts to recruit and retain
soldiers. In Cohen's words, ``It's very hard to compete against a
robust economy such as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems particularly hard to compete in places like
Massachusetts, where unemployment hovers above 3 percent. That is
especially true at places like Hanscom Air Force Base here,
headquarters for the Air Force's electronics development programs,
whose highly trained staff works a short ride from Boston's
thriving high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Chris Ruefer, a contracting specialist here, has seen
friends ``leaving with dollar signs in their eyes.'' Capt. David
Peeler Jr. has watched colleagues, fellow experts in cost analysis,
calculate to the last digit their current compensation and the
comparative advantages of civilian salaries and quality of life,
and decide to go.
</P>
<P>
   And Capt. Joe Allegretti, a public affairs officer, recalled the
rumblings among top-trained pilots in the overseas air squadron to
which he was recently assigned: ``People were really considering
getting out,'' in part simply because Vietnam War-era pilots still
in the military were getting on in years, he said, but also because
``the economy's good, so there's more flying getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   Among a handful interviewed here, most said they had received
letters from job recruiters. Missile launch officers may not get
many nibbles, but a financial specialist like Peeler, whose skills
are especially transferable to an accounting or consulting firm,
get them ``constantly,'' he said. ``And the job offers are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The headhunters seem, they said, to be looking for midlevel
officers like them _ old enough to have gained valuable skills and
often master's degrees during their service, young enough to have
long working lives ahead of them and not so close to retirement
that they would be fools to leave now.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of many young officers, several pointed out, is
part of the usual planned-for attrition of military personnel in a
pyramid structure. Not everyone is supposed to rise to general. But
in part, they said with certainty, the sizzling heat of the economy
is at work.
</P>
<P>
   The military must seek a tricky balance, noted Maj. John
Driessnack, another financial specialist. ``We need to stay close
enough to the economy that it doesn't really inhibit those who want
to serve their country,'' he said. ``You don't want someone in the
military because that's the best offer they got. That's not the
person I want flying the fighter or in charge of nuclear missiles.
They need to have a higher calling. On the other hand, they should
enjoy some of the benefits of the society they're protecting. Where
that balance is, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, however, several officers said: The
balance has definitely been off lately, and the promised pay raise
will help redress that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I don't believe the military should get the
same amount you could get on the outside because it is service,''
said Coveno, a program manager whose salary along with benefits,
like a housing allowance, is in the $60,000 range. ``But you can't
have such a big spread that you're losing all your best people, and
I do see that, mostly in younger captains. A lot of the sharpest
folks that can get the money on the outside take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The raises proposed last week would be as large as 9.9 percent
for midcareer officers like Coveno; President Clinton has already
said he intends to raise salaries by 4.4 percent for all 1.4
million military personnel beginning in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed raises will not, however, change a basic aspect of
the pay system that several officers mentioned as a glaring
difference from civilian life: Officers receive 40 or 50 percent of
their base pay if they retire after 20 years, but they do not have
401k plans, they have no hold on accumulating equity, they see none
of the joy of compound interest.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, Driessnack said, ``If you go to work for Andersen
Consulting or Arthur Andersen or Coopers and Lybrand, at the
20-year point you'd be a partner and a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Another remaining source of discontent, one that commanders say
they are working on, is the heavy demands of military life, demands
that seem to have got only heavier in this putatively mellower
post-Cold War world. The armed forces have shrunk, but the missions
and temporary-duty stints in places like Iraq and Saudi Arabia have
multiplied for the soldiers remaining. And with growing children
and working spouses, it becomes harder and harder to accept the
perpetual transfers to new bases.
</P>
<P>
   Ruefer says he sees many colleagues leaving not for the money
but to have more of a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see guys working in a business environment,'' he said.
``And they have all these degrees, and they're going away all the
time, and when they're not deployed they're working millions of
hours and they go, `Gee, my buddies from college are earning from
35 to 50 percent more than me, depending on the job, and they don't
go away from their families for 120 days a year.'''
</P>
<P>
   When officers are facing their third or fourth or fifth rotation
in the desert, Peeler said, they are likely to say, ``It's
Christmas; I just really don't want to spend Christmas away again.
I've got three job offers. And they walk in and they sign their
name and go, `No, thank you,' and they give their six-month
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another particular attraction of the civilian work world, some
officers said, was the ability of top achievers _ a category that
Air Force officers tend to be convinced includes them _ to rise
meteorically, in job title and salary, in a way that the carefully
staggered military system of promotion does not allow.
</P>
<P>
   One of Peeler's friends who recently left for private industry
took something of a pay cut, he said, but if the friend did as well
as in the military, ``he will move up faster and by the time I'm a
major, he'll make twice what I make.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this griping, a visitor to Hanscom is not left with
any kind of impression that there will soon be a sign posted asking
the last one to leave to turn out the lights. Virtually all the
officers interviewed said they enjoyed their colleagues and their
work, in particular the ability to manage important projects worth
hundreds of millions of dollars, and intended to stay in the
service through retirement.
</P>
<P>
   They had also, however, clearly been thinking and jawing quite a
bit about boom-time inequity. ``It's nice to see the leadership
recognizing what's been talked about for a couple of years at our
level,'' Peeler said.

DOCTOR FINDS HOUSE CALLS UNCOVER CAUSES OF ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The life of every seriously ill child is shrouded
somewhat in mystery.
</P>
<P>
   A clinic visit will reveal symptoms: a runny nose, congested
breathing, deteriorating weight. But it is hard to determine in a
half-hour visit what other details about a child's life might be
contributing to obvious health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The larger stories behind children's illnesses, and clues about
how to treat them, can often be found away from the doctor's
office, in the homes where the children live. For this reason, Dr.
Alex Okun, an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center
in the Bronx, makes house calls part of his weekly routine.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the home will he learn, for instance, that despite
denials from the family, a child with chronic asthma lives with a
chronic smoker, or plays with a neighbor's cats.
</P>
<P>
   In the home, he can find clues to why a child is neglecting his
medicines. And he can quietly watch, over a period of visits, how a
child's illness is used as a pawn in a tattered romantic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   House calling is a practice so antiquated, particularly when
managed care rules the economics of health care, that it seems
almost quaint. But Okun says that home visits are crucial to the
care of his largely poor patients in the Bronx, many of whom have
serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Those who come to his clinic in the Morris Park section of the
Bronx with extreme medical needs are offered home visits. Few
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just work with people who come to your office, you miss
out on a lot of the people who are in on the discussions of how
care is given at home,'' Okun said. ``The decisions there are never
as black and white as when a computer comes back and says, `Give
ampicillin.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was the child with a complicated autoimmunity disorder who
appeared not to be absorbing his medications. Okun suspected that
he actually was not taking them. This was confirmed by the little
piles of pills the doctor found near a stack of baseball cards in
the boy's room.
</P>
<P>
   The pills were kept in a plastic box with a.m. and p.m.
inscriptions, but the boy did not like the container because it was
the same kind used by his grandmother, who has AIDS. By visiting
the apartment, Okun also discovered that the boy's mother worked
nights and was not around to remind him to take his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: a new container for the pills and a sports watch
that beeped when it was time to take them. ``Six months later,''
Okun said, ``all his levels were almost perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Okun, 41, discovered the value of house calls in 1986, his first
year out of medical school, when he worked in rural Kentucky and
visited patients' homes, accompanied by practical nurses.
</P>
<P>
   He said he learned then that the person who holds power in a
family often never sets foot in the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the person who was totally overlooked, like the
granddaddy or something, was completely in charge,'' he said. He
now frequently takes medical residents with him as part of their
training.
</P>
<P>
   More critical and long-term care takes place in the home now
than it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   For people with limited resources and means, a case manager of
sorts, like Okun, who sees patients in what amounts to a hospital
within a home, may be the only thing that holds the fragile
arrangement together.
</P>
<P>
   Even though insurance companies typically do not reimburse
doctors for house calls, the home visits have proved so effective
that they will be a major component of care at Montefiore's
hospital for children, which is scheduled to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few decades ago, house calls were the norm,'' said Dr. Irwin
Redlener, director of community pediatrics at Montefiore. ``The
purpose of house calls was to give medical care to patients who
couldn't get to you. Now, it is to observe conditions in the home
and use that information in deciding treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday afternoon, Okun's first stop was a public
housing project in the northern Bronx, where Bridget Walker and
George Curtis are raising two daughters, Jeanne, 12, and Geneva,
who is almost 7.
</P>
<P>
   The older girl has serious respiratory problems and is hooked up
to a ventilator at night. Both girls are also obese, which for
Geneva has meant an early onset of puberty that Okun is hoping to
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Okun's impressions are usually formed over months, and even
years, of visits to his patients' homes, but clues to these girls'
problems can be seen even on one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There is the matter of Geneva, a bright and animated child who
constantly interrupts conversations, answers questions directed at
her shy older sister, and generally tries to keep all the attention
in the room focused on her, by, for example, pounding on an
electric keyboard as the doctor examines Jeanne.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the material artifacts of their challenges:
large oxygen tanks that make a small apartment seem even tighter,
files containing a paper trail of battles with insurance companies
and six-packs of heavily sugared soda that should not be consumed
by a 6-year-old who weighs 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Okun cannot force a family to diet, but seeing their nutritional
habits helps him to open the doors of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When doctors tell you you need to lose weight or take your
medicines on schedule from behind their desks in the office, it
usually sounds like criticism,'' he said. ``If they come to your
home to talk about it, it shows that they care.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was at another housing project, this time in the
South Bronx, where a little boy with advanced infant Lou Gehrig's
disease lives with his mother, his half brother and his father.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these home visits, in addition to monitoring the
condition of the boy, Magno Morales _ who goes by the name Noel _
is to decide ultimately how he will live out his short life.
</P>
<P>
   Noel, who is almost 3 years old, is tethered to a respirator,
which sits in a little basket behind his wheelchair and is
connected to him through his throat.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in the home seems almost as complicated as it is
painful. Francisca Suazo, the boy's mother, a home health-care
attendant, is clearly drained; Dorrette Allen, a practical nurse,
stays with Noel for most of each day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Suazo seems to hang back when Okun visits, ceding a certain
amount of authority to Ms. Allen, who appears the most
knowledgeable about the boy, his routines and his needs. Noel's
father has barely said three sentences to Okun in the two years the
doctor has been visiting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of the discussion to try home ventilation,'' Okun
said, ``it was important to me to stress to Noel's parents that
they could go back on the decision to sustain his life mechanically
if, after a while, they thought it caused him too much pain and
suffering for too little perceived benefit. I don't see that as the
situation now, and neither do they, but such a time could come.''
</P>
<P>
   By visiting Noel and his family at home, Okun said, he hopes to
see when such a time begins to approach. If he saw the boy only at
his office, he might miss the early, subtle signs of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a home visit reveals that conditions are better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The following Friday, Okun made his first visit to Carol Barnes
and her 6{-month-old baby, Keonna, who was born prematurely and
needs oxygen full time until her lungs can work on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Barnes has a bad back injury from moving patients
around as a health-care worker at Bellevue Hospital Center, she has
a hard time moving around oxygen tanks and other equipment, and is
hoping for a little help.
</P>
<P>
   Tired or not, she keeps her home in perfect order. The nursery
is immaculate. The kitchen table is set as if guests were on their
way. Oxygen tanks are neatly hidden behind a couch. Medicines are
put out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   On the way out, Dr. Adriana Matiz, an intern who usually cares
for Keonna, expressed amazement. ``I have so much insight now,''
she said. ``I thought she would have medical supplies all over the
apartment and that she was living in chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Okun agreed. ``The fact that she is very organized,'' he said,
``makes me conclude that she could be given a lot more
responsibilities for the baby's complex care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes said later that the home visit helped her to better
show Keonna's problems to the doctors. She said that when she takes
Keonna to the doctor's office, ``she just sits there, smiling. Most
of the things she does that worry me, she does at home. So it was
good for me to have them see her in her environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The last stop is back at Noel's house. He has been having
trouble breathing. His mother is upset. She wanted to go to
Honduras to visit family, and Medicaid, as expected, had refused to
pay for a full-time nurse while she was away. She stays in the
kitchen, stirring pots and in obvious distress, while Ms. Allen,
the nurse, talks to Okun about Noel's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Then Noel's father walks in. He nods in the general direction of
Okun and retreats to the kitchen, greeting Ms. Suazo with a slight
nudge. What is it here? Is there a clue? How is their relationship
weathering this enormously stressful situation, and where does Noel
fit between them?
</P>
<P>
   Okun is not sure. He tries to converse in Spanish with Morales,
who gives one-word responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time he has talked to me in two and a half
years,'' Okun says.
</P>
<P>
   It is one moment, one small secret slowly untangling before him.
Perhaps, in time, more will be revealed. For now, Okun gives Noel a
kiss on the head and is on his way.

COMMENTARY: A LIFE BUOYED, NOT BUFFETED, BY 103 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ As we enter what is popularly regarded as the last
year of this century (not to mention this millennium), it doesn't
hurt to draw perspective from someone who lived in the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Adamson _ ``not Flo, or Flossie, it's been Florence all
my life,'' she says with determined dignity _ was born Jan. 4,
1895, into a world without movies, airplanes, income taxes, the
World Series and Mother's Day. She was 50 when television emerged
and 80 when the first personal computer was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the progress during her nearly 104 years, all the epic
events, seem to amount to so much historical bric-a-brac when Mrs.
Adamson reflects on her life, sitting in her mahogany and
floral-print room in The Osborn, a top-drawer home for the elderly
here. Nothing mattered more than the family she grew up with, on
Manhattan's East 21st Street, and the family she raised in two
affluent Westchester County towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sedate world,'' she said, sitting in an armchair
surrounded by family photographs, a walker nearby on which her prim
handbag dangled. ``It was our home life that was a big thing. My
mother was a professional singer and I took piano lessons to
accompany her. We had an Edison gramophone. We loved music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to Stuyvesant Park with a roller hoop and
roller skates. Mother took my brothers and me every good afternoon.
We were outdoors. The park was not crowded. It was delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adamson, whose cheerful, under-5-foot presence is
strengthened by soft blue eyes and spun-silver hair, raised three
daughters who gave her grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and
great-great-grandchildren in numbers she cannot count. ``It's hard
to keep track,'' she jokes. ``I'm lucky I can keep track of
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Depression forced her to move to a smaller house. The two
world wars caused some turbulence. But most great events had the
quality of distant storms, sometimes scaring her, mostly sparing
her, but nothing she could do much about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world just took care of itself, and I had my family to
take care of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The person in the 20th century who most impressed her? ``It
might have been the organist in the church I belonged to,'' she
said. ``He was a fine person, nicely educated, treated us well, and
taught us music and nice manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The organist? What about Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill,
Martin Luther King?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just let them take care of themselves,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Getting such answers from a 100-year-old person reminds one of
those interviews with Mel Brooks as the 2,000-year-old man. The
greatest invention, the old man concluded, was Saran Wrap. The
greatest writer? It wasn't Shakespeare. ``With an L that looked
like a T, an M that looked like an N. He had the worst penmanship I
ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The very old, particularly if they have led comfortable lives,
have the luxury of forgetting that in the 20th century women got to
vote and compete in the workplace, blacks gained access to schools
and jobs, medicine made it possible for people like Mrs. Adamson to
live to 100. (Her secret for health is not the 2,000-year-old man's
nectarine but a sherry now and then.)
</P>
<P>
   But her take on the century is that emotional connections matter
more than all the hoopla historians pay attention to. Nothing gave
her more happiness than marriage to Seth Adamson and nothing
devastated her as much as his death at 62. ``He was playing golf on
the Sunday,'' she said. ``Monday he has a heart attack. Sunday he's
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an old-fashioned theory,'' she said. ``Any woman that
is loved very much by the right man has the world right at her
fingertips. It makes for a happy home. It makes for happy
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adamson is no Luddite. She appreciates the telephone that
brings calls from her progeny, the television that brings her
``Jeopardy.'' But she also seems to believe that many of our
conveniences, much of our consuming need for news and
entertainment, are distractions from life's bedrock pleasures. In
her life, it was civility and companionship that proved enduring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the year is, no matter what the season, if you
have that, you've got the whole works,'' she said.
</P>

ACTS I   &AMP;   II: 150 LOOKS. ACT III: WEST SIDE BINGO! 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephanie Lehmann still cringes when she remembers
the broker who showed her 60 apartments _ because, in the end, she
bought a place through someone else. She imagines that the broker,
frustrated and angry, left the business for good because of her.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate and everything that goes with it _ the close
relationship between buyer and broker, the search for space that
somehow embodies the self, or at least hopes for the self _
consumed Ms. Lehmann for more than a year. During that time, she
turned the obsession into a play, ``River Views,'' which just
finished a three-month run at the 13th Street Repertory Company in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The play _ not a tragedy, but a romantic farce _ tells the story
of an actress who dreams of a place with a river view, while her
husband, a stockbroker, surprises her by buying a house in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the play is a farce, the broker is not a portrait of the
one who still haunts her, but a representation of the aggressive,
overbearing type, one willing to say anything to get someone to see
an apartment. ``I did meet some of them, but they were the
exception,'' Ms. Lehmann said. In general, she added, ``I liked
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Lehmann, who is 36 and the author of five full-length
plays that have been produced in various small theaters, writing
about real estate allowed her to capture a certain point in the
life of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about where you will live, and the compromises, and who
gets what they want, and who doesn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the play was inspired by her apartment hunting, it does
not portray it, although there are some parallels to her
experience. Her husband, Steve Kronovet, is a stockbroker, and he
did have some thoughts about moving to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, she said, she got her way and three and a half
years ago, after a year-long search, they bought a three-bedroom
apartment on Riverside Drive. Basically, she said, the suburbs were
not really an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates looking at real estate,'' she said, ``so he didn't
have a fighting chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a house in San Francisco, by a Freudian analyst father
and an artist mother, with an expansive view of the bay and the
Golden Gate Bridge, she couldn't see herself in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine the isolation,'' she said. ``Where do you
go for coffee? If I had to go to Dunkin' Donuts . . .'' She doesn't
finish the sentence. She doesn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   To be a playwright, she felt she had to stay in New York. But
she also wanted more space than she had. Although they were renting
a two bedroom apartment with views in Midtown, she wanted each of
her children, Madeline, now 10, and David, now 5, to have a bedroom
and she was tired of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Although she knew the Upper West Side offered big apartments
suitable for families, she was drawn to the idea of living
downtown, where she had started in New York. After graduating with
a major in psychology from the University of California at
Berkeley, and trying out cooking school, she had come to the city
as a graduate student in English at New York University. It was
there that she met her husband, who was an aspiring playwright.
</P>
<P>
   As if living out the script handed to an aspiring writer, she
was living on East Sixth Street in a cockroach-infested garret _ an
actual garret, she says, on the top story, with sloping floors.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Manhattan Plaza and looking for a new place to live,
she went to many open houses, seeing about 150 apartments by the
time she was done. The Village was appealing, she says, because
``it matched my image of myself as a writer and an artist.'' The
Upper West Side struck her as very bourgeois and middle class, but
on the other hand, it has a lot of buildings with the views that
she craves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get over the idea of its being really dull, and that
we were going to be entering our boring middle age,'' she said.
Downtown, Ms. Lehmann said, with its fashionable restaurants, is
the image of young, ``like your life is still ahead of you, and
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But ignoring her image of the Upper West Side, she forged ahead,
and looked at the large classic apartments on and near Riverside
Drive. With every one, there was always something wrong. The maid's
room was too small to be a third bedroom, or the apartment was on
the ground floor and dark, or the maintenance was too high.
</P>
<P>
   But then a broker showed her a real three-bedroom apartment on
Riverside Drive, with a huge kitchen and three bathrooms on the
fourth floor for $510,000. (That's not a misprint; her search was
conducted four years ago.) It doesn't have the river view that she
wanted, but she had had to give up on that early into the search,
because they just couldn't afford it. Still, she said, ``if you go
right up to the window, you can see the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when she walked in and saw the apartment, she knew her
search was over. ``I actually felt a little disappointed,'' she
recalled, ``because I knew this was going to be the one.'' And that
meant no more looking at apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love looking at people's places,'' she said. ``I think you
really get a glimpse of people's lives, and the truth of what's out
there.'' The knowledge has not left her, even though she is now
part of the bourgeois family masses of her neighborhood, with her
children happily enrolled in local public schools. So when she
walks by the many buildings that she looked at, ``I remember all
the apartments I saw, and think of what it would have been like
living there.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she move again if she got a river view? ``My husband says
he will not move,'' she said. He would have been content to stay,
in truth, at Manhattan Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get involved in the whole fantasy of where you
live,'' said Ms. Lehmann. ``For him, it's just something
practical.'' When she would take him along to see places, they
would have totally different reactions. ``He'd say, `Let's buy
it,''' she recalled. ``I'd say, `Shouldn't we see the next one?' I
had to know all the choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, she said, the choice is made. A bit grimly, and not
really convincingly about an event that could easily be 60 years in
the future, she said, ``I'll probably die here. They'll carry me
out.''

CALIFORNIA ESTATES WITH BACKYARD VINEYARDS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERMORE, Calif. _ If ever subdivided homesites were judged to
have an attractive bouquet, it would probably be here in the
rolling hill country east of San Francisco, where instead of laying
sod, developers have enhanced the appeal of their lots by planting
row after row of zinfandel, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to capitalize on the affinity many people have these
days for vineyard living, two companies have created what they call
``vineyard estates.'' At decidedly champagne prices, buyers get a
place to build a mansion and nearly 15 acres of land planted by the
developers with mature grape vines. The total site is usually about
20 acres.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 10 buyers so far, some of whom had never
harvested a grape before in their lives. Their inexperience is not
necessarily much of an obstacle to having a productive vineyard
since the property comes with the option of having contractors
prune, pick and buy the grapes. Each home buyer can raise about 94
tons of grapes a year, which would produce about 73,000 bottles of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Among vineyard estate owners is Heidi De Mayo, a money manager,
who, with her husband, Frank, an orthopedic surgeon, is building a
Tuscan-style farmhouse on a hilltop that overlooks their vines and
the oak-covered mountains across the valley. They moved here from
Brewster, N.Y., a New York City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always loved wine and I guess we are just fascinated
with the vineyard lifestyle,'' Ms. De Mayo said the other day on
one of her home's half-finished balconies. ``It's a really nice
feeling out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. De Mayo does not expect to prune or weed her vines, though
she has helped pick the grapes. She contracted with other wineries
to do the work and to buy the harvest so that she can focus more on
hosting dinner parties and appreciating the view of her vineyard
out the window.
</P>
<P>
   But next year, the De Mayos plan on making about 300 bottles of
their own wine, expecting to use the equipment of a local winery,
for the sheer pleasure of it. They have not chosen a name for the
label, though Ms. De Mayo said that she wants ``something
Italian-sounding'' to go with the style of her house. She said she
would probably have to spend at least $700 for a wine barrel, but
that it was possible that the winery would make the wine at no cost
to her if it buys her grape production.
</P>
<P>
   Their home is in the Crane Ridge development, a subdivision of
10 lots that sold out two years ago for about $800,000 each and are
now being built up with a handful of custom homes. Parcels are
about 20 acres and include a dirt driveway, space for a house and
irrigated vines that are already producing grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Crane Ridge was created by Wente Brothers, the largest vineyard
in this historic wine-producing community of 67,000, situated 50
miles east of San Francisco. It is believed to be the first
development of its kind in the state, according to wine industry
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, small vineyards had almost always been sold
independently in places like the Napa Valley, the grape growing
region northeast of San Francisco. But at Crane Ridge, the
marketing was more akin to tract homes in that multiple properties
were developed from scratch and delivered ready for construction.
</P>
<P>
   Owners must design and build their homes and from the looks of
three houses under construction, the overall style is Mediterranean
and palatial.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Wente, executive vice president for Wente Brothers, said
that the project had been initiated in an effort to maximize the
sales price for grazing land that it owned. The potential for
losing money was limited to the cost of putting in the driveways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly low risk for us because the only downside if there
were no buyers was that we would have a bigger vineyard, which we
could have used for ourselves,'' Wente said.
</P>
<P>
   His company's interest in the project was increased by
statistics showing that small vineyards were popular. Wente said
that nearly 40 percent of California's were on 20 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
   In marketing the project, Wente Brothers stressed the obvious _
the romance of living in the country and the vineyard ambiance. The
company also used the Poppy Hills golf course across the road as a
selling point.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most effective lure was probably the unusual
business package that came with buying a property at Crane Ridge.
In an effort to alleviate the fears some owners had about becoming
novice farmers, Wente Brothers offered to manage their vineyards at
a charge to each owner of nearly $40,000 a year and buy their
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the owners accepted. A few chose to sell part of their
crops to other vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people ask for a complete turnkey operation,''
Wente said. ``They just sit on the porch with a cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no guarantee that selling vineyard estates
will be easy. Some home mortgage companies are reluctant to lend to
buyers because they did not generally make farm loans. And, as in
any real estate transaction, there were disagreements over what the
land alone cost.
</P>
<P>
   It took 18 months and a price reduction of a few hundred
thousand dollars before Crane Ridge sold its first parcel in 1994.
The rest of the lots sold by 1996. Buyers have been spending upward
of $750,000 to build houses, which range in size from 3,800 to
7,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A similar development built later by Signature Properties in the
neighboring town of Pleasanton has in a year and a half yet to sell
any of its 32 vineyard estate lots covering 20 acres, each of which
costs nearly $1.1 million. The vineyard lots are part of a gated
community called Ruby Hills, which also includes traditional luxury
homes and a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a wide market,'' said Joy Bowman, manager of
broker relations at Ruby Hill. ``No one wants to be first, but I
think that will change soon.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, owning a vineyard estate has certain
advantages apart from the spectacular views. Among them is an
annual income that at today's wine-grape prices approaches $100,000
after expenses at Crane Ridge, which nearly covers the average
annual mortgage for owners there, according to Wente.
</P>
<P>
   There are also tax deductions that owners can claim by
designating their vineyard a business. While owning a vineyard is
not a tax shelter, the value of the land can be depreciated over 10
years and, since it is agricultural land, the state allows a small
reduction in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the buyers at Crane Ridge have no immediate plans to
build a home and instead treat the vineyards purely as an
investment. Vineyards have grown in value in recent years to up to
$75,000 an acre in the most desired spots with the highest quality
grapes, stoked by the popularity of vineyard living among the
affluent and a 5 percent annual increase in wine consumption in the
nation over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, owners at Crane Ridge say they are happy
with their estates. Some had shopped for small vineyards in the
Napa Valley, but found that the land was more expensive, the roads
were congested, and that the idea of being novice farmers on their
own was a bit daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Wood, an airline pilot, who bought a lot with her
husband, Michael, the chief financial officer for an
air-conditioning manufacturer, said that they had always dreamed of
retiring in wine country. But she said that opportunity came sooner
than expected after they toured Crane Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was close enough to work that they could keep their jobs,
said Ms. Wood, who had never owned a grape vine before in her life.
And, if need be, they could ask for advice about their grapes from
their neighbors or Wente Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we need something we just run down the road and talk
to someone,'' Ms. Wood said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jesus Christ walked on the stone streets of this
ancient city nearly 2000 years ago, and his followers still come
here to praise his name.
</P>
<P>
   They come, undaunted by today's reality.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the place where Protestants believe Christ was
crucified is now a grimy outdoor bus terminal. Or, that the
fortress-like Church of the Nativity sits in the heart of a crowded
Bethlehem, where the rattle of jackhammers and bus engines echoes
around ``Manger Square.''
</P>
<P>
   To the pilgrims, it is still the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The holy sites today are surrounded by the wonders and problems
of the 20th century _ office buildings and shopping malls, traffic
jams and smog.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still a few shepherds on the rocky hills of
Bethlehem. The rolling green landscape of the Galilee is still
relatively serene, a logical place for Christ to take refuge and
preach. And Jerusalem remains a spiritual center, the place legend
suggests all prayers return to before soaring to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   As this Christmas season edges us closer to the second
millennium since Jesus' birth, his believers today still find that
the ``Holy Land'' attests to his humanity. A visit to these stone
streets and rocky hillsides adds a gritty realism to The Bible
story, strengthening the faith the pilgrims bring with them.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked out of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem
recently, through the dust of construction in preparation for the
anticipated tourist influx in the year 2000, aluminum siding
salesman David Gage reflected on his trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the presence of the Lord with me two or three times,
it's almost like being lifted up,'' said Gage, 39, from Venice,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, pediatric nurse Rebecca Wiley of Houston wept as
she emerged from the austere rock crypt at Garden Tomb. The bare
rock floor is believed by Protestants to be the burial place of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the place where they laid Jesus and he's no longer
there,'' Wiley, 39, said. ``That's the whole reason for our
Christian belief. Everything you read and studied and learned _ you
look at it in a whole new light.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fourth century, Christians have flocked to this land.
They came from Europe on foot or jammed in the holds of ships,
diseased and unwashed. Royalty and members of the aristocracy made
the journey in caravans and during state visits.
</P>
<P>
   Denominations the world over, from the Greek Orthodox in the
fourth century to Mormons in the 20th, built their churches and
schools here, laying claim to at least a portion of this holy land.
</P>
<P>
   Their pilgrims followed and, through most of history visited a
land that was ruled not by Christians but by Muslims and, now,
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they come in airliners and tour buses, from Oregon and
Great Britain and Guatemala. This is the Jewish state, but about 60
percent of the 2million tourists to Israel each year are
Christians. The total might double in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents and tour guides agree that when terrorism and the
political turmoil of the modern Middle East scare off visitors to
Israel, Christian tourists are the last to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians are guided through their heritage by
Jewish-Israeli tour guides, licensed by the Israeli government.
They point out remnants of the pre-Christian past _ either in the
architecture or the landscape _ that bring Jesus' story alive and
let believers identify with his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Catholic priest and historian Jerome
Murphy-O'Connor notes that Bible readers might not understand why
at Gethsemane Christ anguished about his impending death. After
all, he had anticipated his demise long before. Visitors here,
though, will see that Christ had likely just walked through the
Kidron Valley, where he might have been frightened by stern tombs
that still stand today.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if one wonders about the story of the foot washing, which
Jesus did for his disciples in the manner of a servant, a few walks
around the dusty area will demonstrate why that was a custom.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Gallbreath, a civil engineer from San Antonio, Texas, said
he got a new insight looking at the woods of Galilee _ a modest
patch of trees on a rolling landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought of Jesus before as what he was, a
carpenter,'' Gallbreath, 54, said. ``(In the Galilee) I imagined
him having to cut down one of those trees and making it into
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, drawing inspiration from the holy sites may require
imagination or selective tourism. The exact location of many
biblical events is disputed and many shrines are labeled
``traditional sites,'' meaning people have decided through the
years to accept their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The various Christian denominations have chosen their separate
destinations. Protestants favor the airy, landscaped Garden Tomb
near the bus terminal in east Jerusalem. Catholics and Orthodox
Christians say Christ was crucified and buried at the hulking
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants often sing Christmas carols in the Shepherds Fields
outside of Bethlehem. Catholics kiss the stones of the big
churches, more ready to accept that the floors and walls touched by
Christ still radiate his holy essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the Catholics will be moved standing in the chapel,
the Protestants in the hillsides,'' Israeli tour guide Josef Gilboa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many evangelical Protestants carry a literal belief in the
Bible's Book of Revelation. They see the apocalypse as close and
believe steps are under way to clear the way for Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical tourism surged after Israel captured the West Bank
in the war of 1967. Many Christians see the uniting of the Holy
Land under the Jews as a necessary condition for Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   Such belief has led to a stream of evangelical tourists who are
also hard-line believers that Israel should keep controversial
occupied Arab territory. Frequent visitors include the Revs. Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the birthplace of Christianity can include a sail on
the Sea of Galilee, where Christ is said to have walked on water.
Some pilgrims rent smocks and towels and stand knee-deep for a
rebaptism in a branch of the Jordan River, the same river _ though
in a different spot _ where Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the religious sites are getting a make-over for the
millions expected at the turn of the millennium. That can be
sensitive work in a land where tradition often trumps pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of pressure, the Israeli government recently
talked the three main orders in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre _
Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox _ into adding a
second door to the church for a much-needed emergency exit. After
that, Israeli officials want them to upgrade the dilapidated public
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The three groups have feuded for centuries and jealously guard
their portions of the church. They fear that even the slightest
change will disrupt ownership rights.
</P>
<P>
   The church, first dedicated in 335 A.D., is often held up as a
metaphor for the region, where followers of many religions live
under the same roof but cannot agree on simple solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But even the religious rivalry and harsh politics can be
incorporated into the story of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rossing, a Jewish Israeli who used to be the government's
liaison with the Christian churches, said Christian visitors should
not be distracted by the discord.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the story of Jesus all about?'' Rossing asked. ``It
was about him coming to the nitty-gritty. You want a paradise?
That's not what this is about.

 &HT;    One man, 2 millennia, 2 billion followers worldwide
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christians believe that through the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth, God became human.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he was God incarnate, Jesus changed the world.
History is full of the best and the worst of human actions in his
name: horrible wars and wonderful acts of kindness; persecution and
sacrifice; bigotry and unselfish love. Some of the world's greatest
art, music and literature have been produced and some of its most
prominent institutions of medicine and learning have been
established to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the calendar changed to mark his birth. The celebrations
that will mark the beginning of the year 2000 will actually
acknowledge an anniversary of that event. Groups ranging from small
survivalist sects to the Roman Catholic Church are gearing up for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in a small Middle Eastern town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians did not believe that the time and place
of the birth of Jesus had been left to chance,'' writes church
historian Justo L. Gonzalez of Decatur, author of ``The Story of
Christianity.'' ``On the contrary, they saw the hand of God
preparing the advent of Jesus in all events prior to the birth, and
in all the historical circumstances around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus was born at a crossroads, historically and geographically.
Palestine back then was at the intersection of trade routes joining
Egypt with Mesopotamia and Asia Minor with Arabia. As a result, it
was often invaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the late first century B.C., Palestine was a ``rustic,
despised corner'' of the Roman Empire, Gonzalez said. A few hundred
years before, people had lived in city-states that determined their
identity, including their religion. But with the Roman Empire came
interaction of cultures and a new mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The time of Jesus' birth ``was a time of confused identities,
similar to now,'' Gonzalez said. ``Christianity came into that
fray.''
</P>
<P>
   It arose as a renewal movement within Palestinian Judaism.
Jesus' earliest followers saw their role as fulfilling the promises
of God, Yahweh, to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The gospels of the Christian Bible say God performed miracles
through Jesus, beginning with his birth to a virgin and ending with
his resurrection after death. Perhaps one of the most amazing is
the growth of the faith that worships him. From 12 disciples,
according to Biblical accounts, it has increased to nearly 2
billion followers. One out of three people identifies with some
branch of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact date of Jesus's birth is unknown and
generally estimated to have occurred between 3 and 6 B.C., the
coming of the year 2000 still has great symbolism for Christians,
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good time for reflection, for recollection, for
thanksgiving and for repentance,`` he said. ``Every once in a while
you need to go back to your origins.

   Church of the Nativity
</P>
<P>
   Site of Jesus' birth
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem _ One must bend when entering the Church of the
Nativity. The large door was made into a small passage centuries
ago, in order to stop raiders from taking horses and carts inside.
Over the past 1,600 years, this church has been built, pillaged,
repaired, fortified, commercialized and, now, enveloped in urban
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army pulled out of the city in late 1995, leaving it
to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   A mosque sits across the plaza, as this city for decades has
beenmostly a Muslim city. At prayer times, the amplified call from
the minaret reverberates inside the cavernous church.
</P>
<P>
   Now, forklifts and bulldozers lay stones in Manger Square, the
plaza in front of the church that has long been used as a bus
parking lot. The renovations, planned for the tourist boom expected
in 2000, will keep the buses out.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sirk, a 56-year-old Methodist from Washington, D.C., says
he can imagine the presence of angels, who fanned out across the
surrounding hillsides to announce Christ's birth. ``I feel that my
faith has been strengthened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stone church sits over the cave in which Christ is said to
have been born. In that spot now, at the bottom of a small stone
staircase, is a dim cave-like room that houses a shrine. A hole in
the floor lets pilgrims touch the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims file through. Some stop to pray, light candles or sing
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Some are bothered by the construction and the souvenir sellers
outside. But they still find meaning in the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Room
</P>
<P>
   Site of the Last Supper
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem _ For Oregon Pastor Howard Loyd and his congregants,
this plain room in Jerusalem's Old City is not at all plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are common, ordinary, everyday people, but once we are
filled with the Holy Spirit we can change the world,'' he tells the
group from the St. Helen's Assembly of God Church.
</P>
<P>
   They stand in a close circle in the center of what is called by
many, simply, ``The Upper Room.'' They begin praying loudly and
separately, with some raising their hands above their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a complex of 14th-century buildings constructed on
foundations more than 1,600 years old, the rectangular room has
vaulted ceilings, bare white walls and a plain stone floor. It
looks like it could be a large dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe it to mark the location of Christ's Last Supper.
It's considered a ``traditional site,'' meaning that it is accepted
more by custom than by evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is also believed by many to be the site where Christ sent the
Holy Spirit to descend upon his disciples during the Pentecost. The
event prompted the disciples to begin speaking in tongues, in the
language-- of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of Pentecostal Christians still, in their fervor, speak
in tongues in this room. The loud, bubbly, utterances echo off the
bare walls.
</P>
<P>
   Below this room is the traditional site of the Tomb of David,
the Jewish king. While Pentecostals exult above, Hasidic Jews, with
their side curls and hats, rock their heads in silent prayer facing
David's supposed resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Yardinit _ The Jordan River
</P>
<P>
   Site of Jesus' baptism
</P>
<P>
   Near the Jordan River _ There are lines most afternoons, people
wading their way through the railings and chains on the submerged
stone platform of this river.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 yards wide, this is near where the slow river
forms from the Sea of Galilee. Tall eucalyptus trees form a canopy
over the banks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a quiet spot. Groups from Canada, Great Britain,
and West Palm Beach, Fla., are being baptized today. The Canadians
shout ``Hallelujah,'' and the families of the British people
getting baptized sing gospel music with enthusiastic precision.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque says Christ was baptized near here. The original site,
near Jericho on the Jordanian border, was often too dangerous for
foreign pilgrims. So an Israeli kibbutz, a collective farm,
established this spot further north.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for $6 in the gift shop you can rent a white robe and a
towel, stand in line with your local pastor, and duck back in the
water of the Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baptism is an expression of your personal relationship
with God,'' Pastor Keith Thomas told his congregants from the First
Baptist Church of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Wingate, of Wellington, Fla., came with her mother, husband
and two children. ``It's going to make my spiritual walk even
closer to the Lord,'' she said, dripping from the head-to-toe
immersion.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Tomb
</P>
<P>
   Site that many Protestants believe was the scene of the
crucifixion and burial of Christ
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ Behind the wall on this busy street, the rumble of
buses is somehow replaced by the chirping of birds that flutter
among the olive, cypress and mustard trees. It's a large garden,
hilly enough to divide into small areas of valleys and peaks.
</P>
<P>
   In one plateau, with large umbrellas and benches, members of an
American church group testify to their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a long-haired, drug-abusing hippie boy,'' one husky man
announced, ``I never thought I'd live to see a day like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The site of the crucifixion can be seen from a raised deck that
overlooks a gritty outdoor bus terminal. Somewhere amid what is now
blacktop, legend has it, the cross was planted.
</P>
<P>
   A guide explains that the Romans crucified people at busy
crossroads, so this spot was probably ugly in Christ's time, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the garden, a room is carved out of a rock
cliff and inside, an indentation carved in the floor is thought to
be the place Christ's body was buried. A sign on the door states,
``He is not here, for He is risen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Padilla, 63-year-old pastor at the First Hispanic Baptist
Church of Jonesboro, enters and kneels facing the stone slab. After
a couple minutes, he emerges, with a white handkerchief, wiping
tears from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful experience to see the place where he was
laid, and that he didn't stay there, and that he is very much
alive,'' the Georgia man said. ``I thanked the Lord for the victory
he had over death and for the victory that is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Church of the Holy Sepulcher
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Catholic, Orthodox site of Jesus' crucifixion and
tomb
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ Packed amid the markets and mosques of Jerusalem's
walled Old City, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher creates a vast,
complex, universe of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The high, metal and wooden door is the only passage in or out.
After four years, the Israeli government has persuaded the
denominations that share the church to agree to an emergency door.
They guard their space jealously and to the letter of a
centuries-old treaty. For centuries, the key to the church has been
entrusted to an impartial, Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
   The church was first built by the Greek Orthodox in 335 A.D. It
was destroyed and rebuilt twice. The current structure has been
there about 800 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a stone or an arch or a corner that does not have
a legend or tradition,'' Israeli tour guide Josef Gilboa said.
</P>
<P>
   The dim, ornate church is a conglomeration of large sanctuaries
ringed by small chapels. Upon entering, there is a smooth stone
slab marking where, according to believers, Jesus' body was
prepared for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Up a steep staircase to the right is the elaborate, some say
gaudy, shrine covering the rock where the cross was planted. Jesus'
tomb is back downstairs, inside a small structure of deteriorating
rock now held in place by a cage of girders.
</P>
<P>
   There are many passages, chapels and levels. Many pilgrims do
not like the gaudy look of the chandeliers. Some resent the
infighting between the denominations inside. But the church
impresses, despite itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an area of significance, you can feel it in the
air,'' Alan Howard, a 20-year-old psychology student at Morehouse
College in Atlanta, said on a recent visit. He does not care about
the garish decoration. The atmosphere is more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about God and religion,'' he said. ``There's a religious
feeling in the air.

 &HT;    Refugee not content to just look back
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back in his homeland of Nigeria, there was a price on
Abelage Sunday Ereba's head.
</P>
<P>
   He was wanted, dead or alive, simply because he had organized
protests against the government and Shell Oil Co., which, for 40
years, had drilled oil from Ereba's region of Nigeria. The
drilling, protesters argued, caused air pollution and left much of
the rich farmland unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Ereba never attacked anyone. Never killed anyone. All the
protests about the environmental effects of the drilling were
peaceful, he said. ``We carried palm fronds. No one was armed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the military government considered him an enemy of the
state because his protests made it look bad and eventually forced
Shell to stop drilling. He and the other protesters also cost the
government money because it lost its cut of Shell's profits when
the oil giant left.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ereba's name went on the ``most wanted'' list in 1994,
he had to go into hiding. For the next two years, each day could
have been his last. Whoever turned him in would get about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Often he hid in rivers or creeks, dodging snakes and crocodiles.
He moved under the cover of darkness and could hear soldiers
terrorizing nearby villages. He heard gunshots and screams as
people ran away. He smelled fires when the soldiers burned down
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Some days he didn't eat. He relied on the kindness of
sympathetic strangers who gave him food and warned him if the
soldiers were getting close.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know who to trust. You had to move a lot, so as not
to be discovered. You take whatever comes your way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ereba's story is similar to those of 65,000 refugees from hot
spots all over the world who now call Atlanta home. Many of them
also fled torture, detention, the murder of loved ones and other
unspeakable horrors of war. After escaping places like Bosnia,
Rwanda, Vietnam, northern Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, they hardly ever
look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refugees who come to Atlanta have lost everything. They have
to start over with nothing when they arrive here,'' said Stephanie
Baric of the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit agency
that has resettled thousands of refugees, including Ereba, in
DeKalb County. ``When they come here, they want to leave what
happened to them behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ereba, 34, is different. He is eager to talk about his past.
And he is still fighting the demons who forced him into exile. His
willingness to talk about his old life opens the door for his new
neighbors here to understand how far refugees have come, not just
in distance. It also helps Atlantans understand the contrast
between an open, democratic America and the oppression of the
countries refugees fled.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted by his government
</P>
<P>
   Ereba worked in security and personnel for Shell from 1985 until
1989. In 1990, he joined the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni
People (MOSOP) in protesting Shell's presence in the Ogoni region
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shell took the oil out of our land, but they gave nothing
back. We had been cheated and we decided we should have a share in
the resources,'' he said. ``We had nothing. No electricity, no
running water, no schools.... We didn't have good roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell's pipelines were not buried deep and they often exploded,
leading to gas fires that would burn for days, polluting the air
and making breathing difficult. The resulting oil spill also ruined
the land, but the farmers were never compensated for their losses,
Ereba said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell acknowledges environmental problems with its operations in
Nigeria, but says it has not devastated the land.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known in his village, Ereba was targeted by the government
because he worked closely with MOSOP officials to organize
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Ereba was one of about 2,000 refugees who fled Nigeria because
they were wanted by the government. ``Many people were in Ereba's
shoes,'' said Ledum Mitee, MOSOP president at the organization's
London office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people hid in the bush, or fled to neighboring
communities. Many others were killed when the soldiers came into
their villages looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 men, women and children were killed in a military
crackdown that followed Ogoni protests against Shell, Mitee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were an activist, they went after you. If they couldn't
find you, they would go after your family,'' Mitee said. ``Ereba's
house was destroyed by security agents. His stepfather was detained
and tortured. He is no longer in detention, but his health is very
bad, I'm told.''
</P>
<P>
   While in hiding, Ereba missed the birth of his first child, who
was born about a month after he disappeared. His wife, Nelly, had
to hide with the infant because of her husband's sins against the
state. ``They wanted me to get to him,'' she said. ``I could hear
the soldiers shooting as we ran away from the hospital. It's only
God who saved my life and the life of my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Also while he hid, the government executed nine of his comrades,
including Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent writer who had been nominated
for a Nobel prize in literature. They were accused of treason and
murder, but human rights organizations condemned their hangings,
saying they were killed simply because they opposed the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ereba could have easily been in the gallows with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by the grace of God that I am alive,'' he said. ``They
would have killed me if they had found me.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in Buckhead
</P>
<P>
   While he worries about the family he left behind in Nigeria _
including his mother, three sisters and a brother _ Ereba is
adjusting well to his new life here. Since September, he has lived
in a three-bedroom apartment in Clarkston with his wife, two
daughters, a brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   He works as a security guard at the Grand Hyatt in Buckhead,
where he makes $8.25 and hour and says he feels like part of a
family. The ambience couldn't be more different from the world he
knew in Nigeria. At the hotel, the rich come to do business and
attend parties. Valets park their cars. Guests dine on gourmet food
served on fine china.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it fascinating. It gives me a clear sense of seeing and
knowing the other side of life,'' he said. ``Right now, it poses a
challenge. I have decided to do my best.'' The job ``is like a son
to me,'' he said. ``My whole family is involved in seeing to it
that I get to work on time.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes him 90 minutes to get to work. A bus, two trains, a
short walk up Peachtree Street from the MARTA station. He gets free
meals at work, and his family was given a turkey, stuffing and
cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   A local church and the International Rescue Committee have
donated food, clothing and furniture to his family and several
other Nigerian families who have moved to Atlanta in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been an immigrant myself, it's easy for me to identify
where they are coming from,'' said Bankole Akinmola, a native of
Nigeria and pastor of the World Outreach Church for All Nations in
Tucker. ``God has brought these people to us and because they are
immigrants, there are many things they need. We want to meet their
needs physically and spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   One church member had heard of Ereba, who is known as Sunday to
his friends. His middle name came from the day of the week he was
born. Such naming is common among Nigerians from his region. It is
a remnant of British colonial rule, which ended when Nigeria gained
independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday is a very courageous, intelligent man. God is really
guiding him,'' said the church member, Dorn Manadom, a native of
Ogoni who left Nigeria in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard that some refugees were going to be sent from
Ogoni to Atlanta, I quickly called all the agencies responsible for
bringing in refugees. They were able to tell me where they put
them. I was the first person to see them from Ogoni.''
</P>
<P>
   Ereba said he is grateful and amazed that strangers have offered
him so much help. It's an example he hopes to emulate when he is
more settled. ``I hope to be able to help some other people who
might need help tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in touch
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't have much here, it's more than what he had
had for two years in a Benin refugee camp. Food was rationed in the
crowded, desolate camp, and there was never enough. The fact that
he found his wife after two years apart was miraculous. He
clandestinely crossed into Nigeria from Benin in February 1996 and
entered a refugee camp. Two weeks later, U.N. officials located his
wife and brought her to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw my daughter, I broke down in tears,'' he
said. ``My wife and I were both in tears. It was a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   A second daughter was born in the camp. He prayed every day that
they would be approved to come to America. ``I never planned for a
refugee life,'' he said. ``Escaping into Benin to seek asylum was
my last resort. I am very grateful that it was approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is thousands of miles away from home, Ereba stays
in touch with MOSOP officials in London and the United States. His
briefcase is filled with articles about the struggle of the Ogoni
against Shell. In November, he went to Washington for a human
rights conference sponsored by the MOSOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue the struggle even as I am here,'' he said.
``Something must be done to stop Shell from coming back into
Ogoniland and to make them compensate us for the damage they caused
while they were there.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ereba reflects on his life, he savors the freedom he now
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself in a completely different environment, an
environment where people can air their different views and not be
afraid. For now, I feel safe. I had no feeling like that for four
years. I had been living in perpetual fear,'' he said. ``It was
like I was living in a dungeon.''

   A hodgepodge of snow will fall at high elevations in the
mountains of Idaho, western Montana, Utah, western Colorado and
northern Nevada on Sunday as moist Pacific winds aloft are forced
to rapidly rise over west-facing slopes. Though there will be no
organized storm system, this lifting of moist air by the terrain
will result in as much as a foot of snow on some mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will develop later Sunday and Sunday night in western
Washington as a warm front approaches from the Pacific. Rain and
wind will intensify, particularly over the Olympics and the Coastal
Range, where the sloping terrain adds lift to invading ocean air.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a fast-flowing stream of moist air 2,000 feet
above the ocean will slam into northern California and southern
Oregon late Sunday, setting the stage for moderate to heavy rains.
Elevations where mountain snow occurs will steadily rise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cirrus clouds will dim the sun over parts of the
Southwest as a plume of high-altitude moisture arrives from the
tropical Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will gather over the western Gulf States on Sunday as a
flow of increasingly moist air off the Gulf of Mexico is encouraged
by a disturbance emerging from the Rockies. Rain will develop late
Sunday or Sunday night across eastern Texas, Arkansas and
Louisiana, with isolated thunder near the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of generally light snow will spread across the
upper Great Lakes toward western New York as a moisture-starved
disturbance streaks eastward along the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MOUNTAIN GLACIERS
</P>
<P>
   Snow advisories were in effect Saturday for parts of the
Cascades as heavy snow showers were expected to bring additional
accumulations of 6 to 10 inches. With a parade of Pacific storms in
winter and recurrent ocean winds continually rising up western
slopes, snowfalls in the Cascades typically exceed 400 inches each
year. High snowfalls account for the existence of glaciers in the
Cascades. A glacier forms where snow can stay long enough to change
to ice. The amount of ice in mountain glaciers pales in comparison
to the ice locked over glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica.

IMPEACHMENT PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON `GUARDIAN' OF THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., W.Va.)  (js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the roiling confusion over how the impeachment
drama in the Senate will end, there is for some in the capital a
consoling certainty: Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia will be
at hand to press the Senate to act with an eye to upholding its
dignity before history.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 years in the Senate (which entitles him to be only
second in seniority to Sen. Strom Thurmond with 44 years), Byrd has
come to be accorded a peculiar bifurcated form of respect from his
colleagues: while his influence on everyday issues has waned
greatly, his views on history and constitutional protocols are
immensely respected. His pronouncements on Senatorial procedure and
prerogatives during the impeachment debate may well be treated like
decrees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everybody is delighted that Byrd may be a force in the
coming debate. Many in the White House, for example, are concerned
that Byrd will be more a guardian of the Senate as an institution
than of his own Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as partisan a
Republican as exists in the Senate, said last week that he would be
guided by Byrd's counsel, especially over procedures as the drama
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to follow the Constitution,'' McConnell told
one interviewer. ``I've said I'm going to take my cues from Senator
Byrd; I think he's the expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Another incident occurred in October, when the White House
sought to forestall the House vote to authorize an impeachment
inquiry by trying to get 34 Democratic senators to sign a petition
that they would never vote to convict President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd took to the Senate floor and warned the White House to end
its lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tamper with this jury,'' he said. To his own colleagues,
Byrd said: ``We may have to sit as jurors. Don't let it be said
that we allowed ourselves to be tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned White House officials quickly backpedaled, fearful of
offending Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Byrd offered another version of his ``butt out,''
this time to former Presidents Gerald R. Ford, a Republican, and
Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. In a joint Op-Ed article in The New York
Times, they urged a solution in which Clinton would be censured
after a partial acknowledgment of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released on Monday, Byrd reinforced his
reputation for guarding the Senate's prerogatives, saying that no
one outside the Senate should be involved in brokering any deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of our nation, there must be no `deal' involving
the White House or any entity beyond the current membership of the
U.S. Senate,'' he said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant, his aides said, as a message to the former
presidents, and anyone else who might try to get involved,
including former Sens. Bob Dole of Kansas, a Republican, or George
J. Mitchell of Maine, a Democrat, both of whom have been mentioned
as possible brokers.
</P>
<P>
   But to those who thought Byrd's sense of etiquette meant that he
would insist on a trial, his statement also opened the door to a
censure resolution, as long as it germinated solely in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Byrd talked last week with Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Democrat of New York, according to a Senate aide.
Moynihan has indicated that he favors censure.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd has had a reverential approach to the Senate throughout his
career, steeping himself in its traditions, mastering its rules and
writing a detailed two-volume history of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 200 years,'' he wrote at the end of the study, the
Senate ``is still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and
evening star in the American constitutional constellation.''
</P>
<P>
   His inflexible view of the Senate's traditions and procedures
led him to wage a successful fight to bar laptop computers from the
floor last year. He is evidently more comfortable with the
ornamental spittoons on the Senate floor, relics of another era,
than laptops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is also a man who is deeply serious about the art of
political oratory as practiced in its pre-television manner. He
has, for example, developed a series of highly individualized hand
gestures that are exquisitely coordinated with his language.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Senate visitors' gallery who come upon Byrd holding
forth are able to walk away without the disappointment of most
tourists who discover that the world's greatest debating society,
as the Senate has been billed, can be a bit of a bore. For some
regulars in Congress, though, Byrd's long-winded style can be
tedious.
</P>
<P>
   In his orations, Byrd is as likely as not to be discussing some
obscure aspect of Greek history or to invoke a little-known Roman
philosopher-politician to support his view on some contemporary
budget issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to colleagues last month in the Old Senate Chamber,
given at the request of Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
Republican leader, Byrd quoted Cicero: ``To be ignorant of what
happened before you were born is to remain always a child.''
</P>
<P>
   With great enthusiasm, he then recounted many of the Senate's
most colorful characters (``Here the dashing Texas senator, Sam
Houston, sat at his desk whittling hearts for ladies in the
gallery'').
</P>
<P>
   But he concluded by lamenting how many in the modern Congress
afford the presidency a more exalted role than they do their own
branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   For all his stature, Byrd, who has said that he expects to run
for re-election in 2000 at age 83, has no significant legislative
legacy to match his long tenure. He has said, for example, that he
is proudest of defeating several efforts to enact a balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his home state, West Virginia, there are plenty of
monuments to his time in Congress and especially to his status as a
former chairman of, and still the senior Democrat on, the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, difficult to drive through the state without
using either the Robert C. Byrd Freeway, the Robert C. Byrd
Expressway, the Robert C. Byrd Highway or, near Charleston, the
Robert C. Byrd Lane. There are dozens of other public buildings and
other structures throughout the state bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   A new library at the College of West Virginia in Beckley _ the
Robert C. Byrd Education and Resource Center _ is filled with
computers that have as their screen-savers pictures of a smiling
Byrd. A cheerful bust of him in bronze sits at the entrance. Byrd
had persuaded Congress to provide $5 million to the private college
to build the center as a ``pilot project.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carlyle Byrd was born in North Carolina in 1917 as
Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. His father gave him up before his first
birthday after his mother died of scarlet fever. He was renamed by
the aunt and uncle who adopted him and took him to West Virginia's
coal fields.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved around the state by wagon, living for a time in
Wolf Creek Hollow in Mercer County, ``a few miles from the hard
road,'' as he once recalled in an interview. He took up the fiddle
and learned to play most of the traditional tunes of the mountains,
both mournful and joyous. (In 1982 he abruptly hung up the fiddle
forever after his nephew was killed in an auto accident.)
</P>
<P>
   He began his working life as a butcher in company stores in West
Virginia's coal towns but yearned for a political career.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by his oratorical skills and his fiddling, he was elected
to the state Legislature in 1946. In 1952 he was elected to the
U.S. House and six years later to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he is doing to prepare himself for the debate and
possible trial of Clinton, Byrd said this week through a
spokeswoman that he expected to immerse himself in various
historical tracts, ``different authorities on England and the
American colonies and the American states, prior to the
constitutional convention,'' and other articles about what became
of the United States in the next two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious constitutional matter,'' he said in a
statement this week. ``It requires serious reflection, careful
research and sober judgment, not legal shenanigans, partisan
rhetoric and shooting from the hip.''

ALFRED WOLF, 75, CHEMIST HELPED DEVELOP NUCLEAR MEDICAL IMAGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Peter Wolf, a nuclear and organic chemist whose work at
the junction of chemistry and medicine helped create some of
today's most sophisticated diagnostic tools, died Dec. 17 at John
T. Mather Hospital in Port Jefferson, N.Y. He was 75 and lived in
nearby Setauket.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a lengthy illness, according to Brookhaven National
Laboratory, where he was a senior chemist. He retired as chairman
of the chemistry department in 1987 but continued his laboratory
work until earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Through nearly five decades, Wolf, who was a member of the
National Academy of Sciences, advanced the field of organic
radiochemistry, radiopharmacology and nuclear medicine. He made his
mark particularly in the development of positron emission
tomography, PET for short, which is used to observe the inner
workings of the brain and heart.
</P>
<P>
   PET scans explore deep crevices to spot chemical processes
responsible for neurological diseases and can be used, for example,
to reveal which part of the brain is most active in performing
certain tasks. Much of his research was performed at Brookhaven, an
arm of the federal Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's work laid the foundation for many of the nuclear medicine
and medical imaging procedures performed in the world today, which
help save thousands of lives each year and expand our knowledge of
our brains and our bodies,'' said a Brookhaven colleague, Joanna
Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf founded and led one of Brookhaven's largest
interdisciplinary collaborations, which remains a vital program. To
set it up in the 1970s he called on experts from the fields of
physics, computer science, mathematics, medicine, physiology and
biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   His group scored its big breakthrough in 1973 with discoveries
that led to a procedure now widely applied to measure such vital
signs as glucose metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, group members developed a form of sugar _
fluorodioxyglucose _ that researchers and doctors use to perform
PET scans to determine brain function and diagnose cancer and heart
disease. His group also developed a radiotracer, which, when
injected into the body, acts as a chemical beacon whose signals are
picked up by imaging equipment to track brain activity or the
movement of a drug through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was born in Manhattan and earned B.A., M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in chemistry at Columbia University. He joined the
Brookhaven staff in 1951, and became a senior chemist in 1957 and
department chief in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as a research professor in the department of
psychiatry at New York University, and was affiliated with other
schools and institutions in the United States, Austria, Germany,
Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is survived by a son, Roger O., of Los Angeles, and two
granddaughters. His wife, Elizabeth Gross Wolf, died last year; the
couple had been married 51 years.

branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   For all his stature, Byrd, who has said that he expects to run
for re-election in 2000 at age 83, has no significant legislative
legacy to match his long tenure. He has said, for example, that he
is proudest of defeating several efforts to enact a balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his home state, West Virginia, there are plenty of
monuments to his time in Congress and especially to his status as a
former chairman of, and still the senior Democrat on, the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, difficult to drive through the state without
using either the Robert C. Byrd Freeway, the Robert C. Byrd
Expressway, the Robert C. Byrd Highway or, near Charleston, the
Robert C. Byrd Lane. There are dozens of other public buildings and
other structures throughout the state bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   A new library at the College of West Virginia in Beckley _ the
Robert C. Byrd Education and Resource Center _ is filled with
computers that have as their screen-savers pictures of a smiling
Byrd. A cheerful bust of him in bronze sits at the entrance. Byrd
had persuaded Congress to provide $5 million to the private college
to build the center as a ``pilot project.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carlyle Byrd was born in North Carolina in 1917 as
Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. His father gave him up before his first
birthday after his mother died of scarlet fever. He was renamed by
the aunt and uncle who adopted him and took him to West Virginia's
coal fields.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved around the state by wagon, living for a time in
Wolf Creek Hollow in Mercer County, ``a few miles from the hard
road,'' as he once recalled in an interview. He took up the fiddle
and learned to play most of the traditional tunes of the mountains,
both mournful and joyous. (In 1982 he abruptly hung up the fiddle
forever after his nephew was killed in an auto accident.)
</P>
<P>
   He began his working life as a butcher in company stores in West
Virginia's coal towns but yearned for a political career.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by his oratorical skills and his fiddling, he was elected
to the state Legislature in 1946. In 1952 he was elected to the
U.S. House and six years later to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he is doing to prepare himself for the debate and
possible trial of Clinton, Byrd said this week through a
spokeswoman that he expected to immerse himself in various
historical tracts, ``different authorities on England and the
American colonies and the American states, prior to the
constitutional convention,'' and other articles about what became
of the United States in the next two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious constitutional matter,'' he said in a
statement this week. ``It requires serious reflection, careful
research and sober judgment, not legal shenanigans, partisan
rhetoric and shooting from the hip.''

ODO STRUGER, 67, INVENTOR OF AUTOMATION DEVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wis., Mich., Austria)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN E. BRIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Odo Struger, who invented the programmable logic controller,
which makes possible modern factory automation, amusement-park
rides and lavish stage effects in Broadway productions, died on
Dec. 8 in Cleveland. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   He had thyroid cancer, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   The device Struger invented, essentially a rugged computer that
controls machinery, was based on a concept developed in his
doctoral dissertation at the Technical University of Austria. It is
now used in factories throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Struger left the university in 1956 for a job at Asea Brown
Boveri, a Swiss power company. While there, he completed his
dissertation, ``The Process for Quantitative Handling of
Positioning Errors of Numerical Control Machines.''
</P>
<P>
   His paper led to a job in 1958 as a research engineer at
Allen-Bradley in Milwaukee, where he headed the team that developed
the programmable logic controller, or PLC, creating a
billion-dollar-a-year business.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Slovick, editor of Spectrum, the magazine of the
Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, said: ``Simply
put, programmable logic controllers are what industry uses to
automate factories. They are used to control a wide range of
equipment, everything from heating, ventilation, air conditioning,
to plastic injection molding machines to commercial washing
machines to conveyor lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Struger's invention has branched out from its blue-collar
beginnings. ``PLCs are pervasive,'' said William Little, chief
technical officer at Rockwell Automation, Allen-Bradley's parent
division. ``They show up in the road production of `Phantom of the
Opera' and in rides at Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   Little said the devices were designed to work in real time,
taking in information, processing it and producing commands to
control a mechanical process as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Struger had a long list of awards and technical achievements; he
received the Prometheus Medal for technical innovation in 1996, the
same year it was awarded to Leonardo da Vinci. Struger was also a
fellow of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
He held 50 patents and published more than 40 professional papers;
a laboratory at the Technical University of Austria was recently
named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Struger was an avid outdoorsman, said Karen Costantino-Struger,
a daughter-in-law. He skied throughout his youth, winning a spot on
Austria's all-academic team and becoming an alternate for the
Austrian Olympic ski team, she said. He became a professional ski
instructor, taught his sons to ski, and in 1991, when he was 60,
won a national skiing title for his age group.
</P>
<P>
   Struger was born in Austria in 1931 and lived in Cleveland,
where he had been a vice president for Allen-Bradley until retiring
last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marlene; two sons, Andre, of
Farmington Hills, Mich., and Gregory, of Newbury, Ohio; a sister,
Franziska Panger of Austria, and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Gerhard Brinkmann, a partner in the New York
office of Gensler, an international architecture and interior
planning firm, died on Dec. 19 at New York University Hospital. He
was 53 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure after a stroke, the firm reported.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkmann, a native of Riverside, Calif., attended California
State Polytechnic University and graduated with a degree in
architecture in 1969 from the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He then spent 13 years as a designer and associate in the San
Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, architects.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York in 1982 to join Gensler Architecture Design
and Planning Worldwide and was named a partner in 1985. As the lead
designer in the office, he worked on projects in San Francisco,
Minneapolis, Buffalo, Miami, Washington, New York, London and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkmann designed office space for law firms, financial
institutions, corporations and consulting firms. He recently
completed projects for Baron Capital in New York, QVC Network
headquarters in West Chester, Pa., and Swiss Re American Corp.
offices in New York. He was also working on designs for Christie's
auction house in New York and Bank Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the Interior Design Hall of Fame in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, John, of Riverside, and his
companion, Dr. Mark Weinrod.

JUDGE ORDERS NEW ELECTION AT A POSTAL UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge has ordered a new election for the
leadership of one of New York City's largest postal unions after
finding that the incumbents acted illegally in keeping their
opponents off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling issued earlier this month, Judge Constance Baker
Motley of U.S. District Court in Manhattan found that the
leadership of the New York Metro Area Postal Union, which
represents 14,000 workers in mail-sorting sites, violated federal
labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Motley wrote in her opinion that the union's leaders were
wrong to disqualify seven opposition candidates for failing to
provide their addresses and Social Security numbers at a nominating
meeting. The union disqualified one of the opposition candidates
even though he filed his address and Social Security number the day
after the nominating meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The disqualifications enabled the union's leaders to run
unopposed in the March 1997 election, the third time in 10 years
that the union held uncontested elections.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the union's leaders had acted illegally because
they did little to inform their opponents about the need to provide
the information at the nominating meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A union cannot enforce as a rule, on penalty of
disqualification, a requirement that it has not adequately
disclosed,'' Judge Motley wrote. She specifically criticized the
union's leaders for not mentioning at its meetings what information
nominees needed to provide.
</P>
<P>
   After having their protests rejected by the union, the
disqualified candidates appealed to the secretary of labor, Alexis
Herman, who then sued on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers who were thrown off the ballot asserted that
this was a case in which the leadership deliberately twisted the
rules in order to squelch democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Smith, the opposition candidate for president who was
thrown off the ballot, said the judge's ruling was a good decision.
``They planned the whole thing,'' he said of the incumbents. ``They
planned to disqualify us all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The union had argued that it needed the challengers' addresses
and Social Security numbers by the time the nominating meeting
ended to make sure the nominees were properly identified and were
legitimate members of the union. In addition, the incumbents said
the information was needed to identify a nominee whose name was
identical to that of another member, as was the case with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Caniano, an executive vice president of the union,
maintained that all union members had a copy of the union's
constitution ``and should have known what the requirements were.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Motley found that the constitution was ambiguous about
the deadline for providing addresses and Social Security numbers.
She said the constitution was not clear that the information had to
be provided at the nominating meeting.
</P>
<P>
   She ruled that the union's ``officials provided highly uneven
notice: personal assistance with requirements for incumbents' slate
members but mere availability of muddy texts for the rank and
file.''
</P>
<P>
   Caniano said the union's leaders did not plan to appeal the
ruling. ``We don't agree with it,'' he said, ``but we'll abide by
the law.''

 &HT;    'Burbs swarm in deer
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's one of the few really cold mornings of the
hunting season so far, and Mike Ivie, face flushed from an icy
wind, shivers in his tree stand as the sky begins to brighten.
</P>
<P>
   He listens to the noises of the forest: The rush of a nearby
river, the cawing of an obnoxious crow, the scurrying and barking
of squirrels, the constant roar of the morning rush-hour traffic
and the ``thump-thump-thump'' of heavy bass coming from a music
lover's car.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Ivie is hunting within earshot of I-20 and a major road leading
to it. On the way to this section of DeKalb County, he drove by
large, luxury homes with manicured lawns and custom landscaping.
Not exactly the pastoral scene that comes to mind when the word
``hunt'' comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to hunting in the 'burbs. When asked where he would go
to get a trophy deer, Ivie replied: ``DeKalb County with a bow and
arrow. South Fulton also has some excellent deer. All these places
that have woods where the deer have been pocketed up, hunted only
with a bow, not shot at and not spooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think deer are using people _ subdivisions and other
neighborhoods _ as safety valves,'' he said. ``A lot of Pope &AMP;
Young (scoring system for bow hunters) deer in DeKalb have been
taken around subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that only bow hunting is legal in DeKalb, says
Ivie, 46, major-league baseball's No. 1 draft pick in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first love was hitting a baseball,'' he said. ``Next is
deer hunting with a bow. I take hunting as seriously as I did
playing ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He hunts nearly every day of the season and many a morning his
mind must drift to today's sports salaries, especially some of
those fringe players with million-dollar contracts.
</P>
<P>
   His career .269 average and home-run-hitting bat, would be worth
big bucks today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quiver at the thought,'' Ivie said. ``I could own my own
hunting preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been away from the game for more than 10 years but still
dreams of getting a job as a minor-league hitting instructor,
possibly with the Braves; Atlanta coach Glenn Hubbard is a hunting
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he had asked Hubbard to hunt with him that morning but
it didn't work out. That was the day Hubbard's home burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I used to live within walking distance
from him,'' Ivie said. ``I hate it. I hate it. And right at
Christmas time. But I'm extremely glad none of them were harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivie's trophy wall at home is tangible proof of his hunting
skills, with 20 trophy deer head eight points or better with
18-inch spreads or better.
</P>
<P>
   A large portion were taken with the bow. He started bowhunting
at 13 with a recurve and now uses a compound. For the last five
years, he has used a bow only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather bow hunt because I don't have to worry about
someone shooting me with a rifle by mistake,'' he said. ``You
really know you've become a real, true deer hunter when you sit and
watch a deer 40 yards away, watch it feeding on acorns or something
else and don't take a shot at it (because it's out of range).''
</P>
<P>
   At such times, Ivie says, he studies the deer's habits and adds
the information to the mental file that will contribute the his
next success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn so much about deer hunting by bow hunting,'' he
said. ``You really learn about deer. If you watch them enough, the
deer will actually tell you where to put your stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing Ivie learned: ``A deer is nose, No. 1,
ears No. 2 and eyes No. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Covering scent is the most important aspect, then being silent
or at least not making noises foreign to the habit, and then
camouflage. Ivie's DeKalb enclave isn't the only 'burb suddenly
becoming a deer-hunting hotspot.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Ivie's hunts in a patch of woods close to one of the
Harry's Farmer's Markets and has taken several deer. He's shot at
some while hearing people talking and putting groceries in their
car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Other unlikely spots include one near a Shoneys and another
within earshot of a Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got 10-15 acres in DeKalb,'' Ivie said, ``you've got
deer.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   TOP GUN
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Norman F. LeClair got the Christmas card of a lifetime
earlier in the week. It was signed, Norman ``Top Gun'' LeClair and
signified a momentous event, the day a son topped his dad. The
senior LeClair, 62, seemed unbeatable in the Thanksgiving Grand
National Waterfowl Hunt at Cambridge, Md., having taken five ducks
with his five allotted shells. But a hunter on another team was
even more perfect, after figuring that two ducks with one shot can
improve a score. Norman A. LeClair, 35, got two doubles along with
his singles, to win the event's Top Gun award. The senior LeClair,
acknowledged as the ``fastest gun in the South'' by those who have
participated with him nationwide in various celebrity hunts, said,
``I taught him everything I know, he turns around and whips me. It
may be years before I live this down.'' He was smiling, though.

   BRAGGIN' RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   What 20-year-old Brian McBride has done since taking up fishing
seriously more than a year ago will be unsettling and maybe even
infuriating to many veteran bassers. In that short span, the
Barnesville college student has caught three largemouth bass
weighing more than 11 pounds _ a feat most anglers never
accomplish. And get this: The latest lunker he has landed weighed
15 pounds, 13 ounces, one of the largest largemouths caught in
Georgia in recent years. McBride caught the bass at the same place
he landed the other two fish three weeks apart last summer _
weighing 11-7 and 11-15 _ at a 20-acre private pond near Griffin.
``It was a monster,'' McBride said. ``It took me about 20 minutes
to land it. I was taking my time because I knew it was big. I
wanted to be careful.'' The Middle Georgia College sophomore caught
the fish on a large shiner he caught with a cast net at a nearby
creek. He caught it Dec. 10, the first day of his Christmas break.
McBride took up fishing seriously after he graduated from Lamar
County High School and no longer had football as a hobby. A former
tight end, he began taking frequent trips with grandfather Donald
Duke and friend Jeremy Worthy. The only problem McBride has now is
trying to outdo his unreal beginnings as a serious angler. ``I
really can't explain it. Maybe it's just pure luck. It's hard for
me to believe (what) I've done,'' he said last week. ``I almost
wished I hadn't caught them yet, because it makes me think, `What
else more can I do?' I can't expect to catch anything (bigger) than
15 pounds again. ... But I'm still going fishing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S TIP
</P>
<P>
   The challenge in landing a big striper this month has been
finding the roaming fish. Lake Lanier guide Don Roberson has been
finding stripers in 35 to 50 feet of water feeding on school shad.
Flex-It jigging spoons are still successful. ``They're on the
move,'' Roberson said. ``All of a sudden they'll be gone.''
Stripers have been coming up the surface in coves and shallows late
in the day, feeding on the summer's last shad hatch. Those baitfish
are small _ generally less than an inch long _ and the stripers are
pushing them to the surface and gulping up several at a time.
Matching the bait _ fly fisherman Craig Carter was throwing flies
of similar size _ can attract some good action. The problem? The
stripers might be splashing the surface all over a cove, but they
might not stay around long.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE NEWSSTAND
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought it? Old-timers are probably looking
askance at the cover of Sports Afield magazine's Winter 1998-99
issue. Instead of a hunter and a deer or bear, or an angler, there
is a skier. And inside, it's celebrity buzz with a report on the
rich and famous buying the state of Montana. Names dropped include
Ted and Jane, David Letterman, Steven Seagal, Dennis Quaid and Meg
Ryan, and Whoopi Goldberg. In an old-line hunting and fishing
magazine!

CHARLES MIZE, 77, MARINE VETERAN OF THREE WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Hawaii)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Mize, a combat veteran of three wars who won
the Navy Cross with the 1st Marine Division in the Korean War and
was the division's commander a quarter-century later, died on Dec.
10 at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Va. Mize was 77 and
lived in Falls Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mize wanted to be a country lawyer, but he was a Marine for 32
years, fighting in epic campaigns from the battle for Okinawa in
World War II, to the retreat from the Chosin Reservoir in the
Korean War, to the rescue of troops in the Mekong Delta in the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Mize and his son Maj. Gen. David Mize, commander of the Marine
Forces Reserve, were the sixth father and son in Marine Corps
history to have both worn a general's stars.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Davis Mize, whose father was a farmer, was born in Cave
Spring, Ga., and joined the Marines after graduating from the U.S.
Naval Academy in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as a rifle platoon leader on Okinawa in April 1945, in
the last great battle of the war in the Pacific, he was shot in the
upper arm by a Japanese soldier he was flushing out of a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Early in August 1950, five weeks after North Korean forces
crossed the 38th Parallel and captured Seoul, the South Korean
capital, Lt. Mize arrived in the port of Pusan with elements of the
1st Marine Division sent from California to bolster besieged Army
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with Company G of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine
Regiment, Mize took part in defending the Pusan perimeter and in
the amphibious landing at Inchon, operations that led to the drive
to recapture Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over Company G after its commander was wounded, Mize was
shot through the leg while battling North Korean troops in the
hills northwest of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after heavy fighting in the streets of Seoul, he and his
men stormed the grounds of the Capitol, which had housed the South
Korean National Assembly. Marines tore down North Korean flags
flying over its dome and ran up American flags, then routed the
enemy troops, moving room by room.
</P>
<P>
   For his role in the retaking of Seoul in late September 1950,
Mize was given the Navy Cross, the Marines' second-highest award
for valor after the Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Late in November, Mize was deep inside North Korea at the
mountain village of Yudam-ni, near the Chosin Reservoir, when
Communist Chinese troops entered the war, threatening to annihilate
American forces that were approaching the border with China.
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 marines were left in Company G, and they were exhausted,
hungry and suffering greatly in the subzero cold. But Mize roused
them with a pep talk that he recalled decades later in an interview
with the military historian John Toland for his book ``In Mortal
Combat'' (Morrow, 1991).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a hell of a mess,'' he recalled telling his men.
``But you and I together have gone through many battles. We've
always done the job and I know we can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   His men made it to the port of Hungnam in a retreat in which
thousands of Marines overcame the frigid Korean winter on a 10-day,
70-mile journey, taking their wounded with them and inflicting
heavy casualties. Mize was awarded the Bronze Star for his actions
in the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   He saw action again, in 1968 and 1969, serving as operations
officer of the IV Corps command in the Mekong Delta and winning
another Bronze Star for a helicopter rescue of wounded troops while
under enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1973, Mize was commander of the Marine Corps base
at Quantico, Va. He then returned to his old outfit, commanding the
1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, Calif., in 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1976, Mize was a partner in a home
construction firm in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son David Mize, he is survived by his wife, Martha;
another son, Randy, of San Diego; two daughters, Sally Ekfelt of
Falls Church and Ann Cuseo of Kailua, Hawaii, and eight
grandchildren.

MIDTOWN MOSQUE FINDS ROOM TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six years, Muslims who work in midtown Manhattan
have squeezed into the stuffy, low-ceilinged basement of an office
building on West 44th Street to pray. The congregation has grown so
large that the main lunch-hour prayer on Fridays finds taxi drivers
and street vendors, office workers and messengers, crammed together
with barely enough room to exhale _ all to the unwelcome
counterpoint of clanging heat pipes.
</P>
<P>
   But this modest assembly has a big dream: a building of its own
with space to breathe and grow. And despite their humble
circumstances, the 800 or so regular worshipers, most of them
recent immigrants, are closing in on their goal.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of donating a few dollars here, a few dollars
there _ boosted by the occasional emotional pledge of an entire
week's paycheck _ the congregation has raised nearly $1 million
toward the down payment on a $3.3 million, five-story building at
154 E. 55th Street, which it wants to convert into one of the
city's most spacious Muslim prayer halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody puts, like, $5 or $10, it would help,'' said
Ibrahim Bah, a Senegalese immigrant who was rushing after prayer on
a recent Friday to get back to his work of selling shirts from a
small table on the street. ``I think we must make it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of Ramadan, a month of daylight fasting for
Muslims, the mosque leaders are hoping for a surge in donations.
Giving to charities and to the poor is an obligation for Muslims
during the holy month, when Islam teaches that any good deed will
be multiplied in the eyes of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are giving money because this is the duty for Muslims,''
said Mohammed Alam, an immigrant from India who said he works as a
technician for Federal Express. ``Sometimes we have so many people
here to pray we go out in the street, in the cold and the rain. We
simply need more space.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the worshipers are struggling themselves. Arriving for
one recent Friday prayer session at the nondescript office building
at 120 W. 44th St., they dragged their folded-up vending tables
straight from their coveted sidewalk spots. Nearly all were
immigrants from Africa, Arab countries, India or Pakistan. Most
wore coats that were threadbare or too thin for the cold weather.
There were no designer brands in the piles of shoes that the men,
in accordance with the rules of Islam, removed before praying and
left in the corners of the basement prayer hall.
</P>
<P>
   The modest but flourishing mosque, created by and for Muslims
working nearby, is only the latest manifestation of a timeworn New
York City pattern. One of the first impulses of many immigrant
groups has long been to build their own houses of worship, first
near their homes and then in the congested urban neighborhoods
where they find work.
</P>
<P>
   When the garment trade moved out of Lower Manhattan in the early
1930s, for example, Jewish workers built a new Garment Center
Synagogue, which still operates at 205 W. 40th Street, to accompany
them uptown. The Seamen's Church Institute, which operated first as
a floating chapel in the mid-1800s and then out of a large church
building on South Street, still serves an international
congregation of mariners in a new facility on Water Street.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of immigrants to the United States from Muslim
countries has risen in the past decade, so has the number of
mosques in the New York City area, which now counts about 400
scattered throughout residential neighborhoods in the five boroughs
and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked among the office towers of Manhattan are about 10
mosques, most operating out of rented quarters and serving overflow
crowds of workers from the surrounding neighborhoods at the noon
prayer on Fridays, the one time during the week when Muslims are
obligated to worship as a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The first Manhattan mosque was opened 45 years ago at 1
Riverside Drive. Like those opened in the following 20 years to
serve Muslim immigrants, it was built with help from foreign
governments and their diplomats. Those mosques tended to be moored
to specific immigrant groups _ a Turkish mosque, an Albanian
mosque, an Egyptian mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years, as the U.S. Muslim population has grown
more diverse and more settled, the congregations of most city
mosques have become more mixed and more intent on relying on their
own resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are modest people _ a real mix from all over the world,
just like Manhattan,'' said Mohammed Ali Abdelaal, the midtown
congregation's director. ``When I realized some years ago how many
people are interested, I thought to myself that if every one of us
brings $1,000, we could soon have $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdelaal immigrated to New York from Egypt 25 years ago. The
imam, or prayer leader, came from Egypt just last year. The
worshipers represent nearly every continent, with some working in
white-collar professional jobs and others scraping by as sidewalk
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The collection for a new mosque has been under way for about
five years, and in September, Abdelaal and other trustees of the
Islamic Society of Mid-Manhattan felt confident enough of their
fund-raising capacity to sign a contract to buy the building.
Two-thirds of the cost, or $2.2 million, will be provided by United
Bank of Kuwait in what the bank general manager, Abdelkader Thomas,
described as a ``lease-to-own'' arrangement that is consistent with
the Islamic prohibition on charging interest on debts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest must come from the congregation, which is still short
about $100,000 and faces a scheduled closing on the sale in early
January. If the money is not raised from donors, mosque officials
said they would go back to the bank for additional financing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There are a number of appeals going out,'' said Thomas, an
American-born convert to Islam who is also a member of the board of
trustees of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation grew from a few people who began praying
together 10 years ago in a room provided by a friendly manager at
the Roosevelt Hotel, on East 45th Street, to the normal Friday
contingent of 800 to 1,000 people who crowd into the West 44th
Street basement and spill out onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelaal said annual rent increases have made the basement too
expensive, more than $7,000 a month. With a full five floors at the
building it plans to buy, he said, the congregation hopes to open a
school and earn income from a street-level restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   All that would be a big change from present conditions. The
handful of women who pray on Fridays squeeze between filing
cabinets and a desk in the imam's makeshift office. Piled cardboard
boxes separate them from the men, who pray shoulder to shoulder
under bare light bulbs hanging from a low mildewed ceiling. A few
floor fans provide the only air circulation. Moving, as a result,
is on everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' called out Ahmad Dovidar, the imam, as he sent
the worshipers back to their day jobs after prayer recently. ``Pray
to move very soon to our new place.''

 &HT;    Smoke is Asheville hit
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ It's not unusual to see crowds in this part of
the Smoky Mountains in the fall. But the lure usually is autumn
leaves and bookstores, not a Class A-level hockey team and $1 beer
nights _ ``Frosty Fridays.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Asheville didn't have hockey before the UHL's Smoke
left Brantford, Ontario. The city didn't have an ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ohio State hockey player and owner Dan Williams, who
purchased the Smoke with his brother last year, spent $500,000 to
build a rink in the 23-year-old Asheville Civic Center. Problem is,
the arena wasn't built for hockey. Consequently, the rink is only
185 feet long, 15 fewer than standard. Team officials were painting
lines on the ice until 3 a.m. the eve of the first home game, and
the ice still isn't quite up to standards.
</P>
<P>
   But without a reference point, fans hardly notice. Crowds were
near capacity for the first three games in the 5,434-seat facility.
The team averaged 1,464 in Brantford but stands at 3,620 in
Asheville. Residents are thrilled to have a new diversion, even if,
as forward Kris Schultz says, ``Somebody asked me how we can stand
on the ice, because it's so slippery.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz spoke by phone with friends in Regina, Saskatchewan, the
other day. ``They asked me what the temperature was, and I told
them, `On the 17th hole, it was about 76 degrees.' They told me it
just snowed two feet. I love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchandising: Almost anything with the smoking dragon logo is
a hot item; the glow-in-the-dark goalie mask is unique.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nourishment: Low marks for grub, but the buck beers on Fridays
are a hit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between periods: Fans shoot the puck through a microscopic
hole to win a truck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promotions: Players skate out through inflatable dragon;
the team raffles off an autographed Wayne Gretzky stick _ the coach
is his brother Keith; fans skate with the Smoke after selected
games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never thought you'd see: Dasherboard ads for ``3 Little Pigs
BBQ'' and ``Alan's Jewelry and Pawn Shop.

 &HT;    Bulls slog through bad ice, worse Elvis
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ On a football Saturday, an oversized,
inflatable bull walks _ on two feet _ through the corridors of the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center. If the mascot bears a strong
resemblance to ``Sir Slapshot'' from the days of the Atlanta
Knights, there's a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham Bulls of the East Coast Hockey League are owned
by David Berkman, run by Charles Felix and marketed by Bruce Burge,
all of whom held similar positions with the Knights. What the Bulls
don't quite have is the Knights' loyal following. They average
fewer than 3,500 fans per game, near the bottom of the league. The
crowd looks particularly small in a 16,850-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Felix says, ``We believe this is a good market, and we're
trying to do some things to get out in the community more. We're
bringing more entertainment into the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a moonwalk in the lobby for kids. The public-address
announcer describes every Bulls score with the cry of,
``Goooooal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make you forget that the season opener had
to be canceled because of unsafe ice. Potholes developed where ads
had been placed, and the ice never froze properly.
</P>
<P>
   Although not quite holding the rich tradition of football,
hockey tradition here runs deeper than in most Southern cities. The
city had teams in the since-disbanded World Hockey Association
(1976-79) and the Central Hockey League (1979-81).
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchandising: ``My other car is a Zamboni'' bumper sticker;
12 kinds of hats; hockey masks in three colors; stuffed bulls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nourishment: Burgers, dogs, ``Gus BBQ Pork'' and three of the
team's major sponsors _ Budweiser, Finlandia, Jack Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between periods: Bicycle races on ice; the absolute worst
Elvis impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promotions: Family Fun Zone with interactive games in the
arena lobby; kids' summer hockey program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never thought you'd see: One man, David Berkman, being allowed
to have ownership in three teams _ Birmingham, Pensacola,
Jacksonville _ in the same league. ECHL bylaws prohibit his making
trades or waiver transactions between his teams.

 &HT;    Force unafraid to be zany
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. _ It's one hour before faceoff and George
Butterfly, a.k.a. Mr. Puck, is getting his game face on. He is
dressed in black shorts, a psychedelic T-shirt, clown shoes, a bow
tie and a puck hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48, but I'm only one in puck years,'' says the mascot of
the CHL's Fayetteville Force. ``I'm on medication now. I don't
drool anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly/Puck is not a converted hockey fan but a Northern
transplant. ``I'm from New York, and this is as close as I get to
my Rangers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Force is owned by the promotion-oriented Bill Coffey, a
long-time minor-league hockey executive, and plays in Crown
Coliseum (9,715), a facility impressive enough that the NHL's
Carolina Hurricanes almost made it a temporary home until their
arena in Raleigh was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The team nickname plays off nearby Fort Bragg. ``The military
has a $3 billion payroll,'' Coffey explains. ``That's a lot of
money floating around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Force sold out its final home game last year, its inaugural
season. Average attendance is down about 700 to 3,300 this year,
but Coffey is always looking for new gimmicks to bring in fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville also has something no other Southern hockey team
does: a member of the Guiness Book of World Records. General
manager Kevin McNaught scored 25 points (seven goals, 18 assists)
in a British Super League game. ``To tell you the truth, I didn't
want anybody in my family or friends to find out, because I didn't
want them to know how bad the league was,'' McNaught says.
</P>
<P>
   McNaught, a Canadian, said hockey in Fayetteville and London
have one thing in common: ``People here don't know a lot about
hockey, just like there. But they want to have fun. And I guess
they like the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchandising: Original logo with ``demonic-looking'' _
Coffey's words _ dragon was canned after complaints from scared
kids. New army-looking, bandaged hockey player is a hit on jerseys,
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nourishment: First choice is ``The Boss Hawg'' BBQ.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between periods: Fans shoot pucks at empty beer cases. You win
a full case for every one you knock over.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promotions: Win a drawing to ride on the Zamboni between
periods. It got out of hand one night when a woman, emboldened by
beer, flashed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never thought you'd see: Dasherboard with a ``Bill Claydon's
Tattoo World'' ad. The original board spelled it tatoo.

 &HT;    Devils waken offense
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something has happened to Team Sleepeze.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils, believed to be the only team in NHL
history to win the Stanley Cup and concurrently gain a national
endorsement from the Association for Chronic Insomniacs, seemingly
have undergone a transformation this season. The former masters of
the wait-wait-wait-for-a-break-and-win-games 2-1 have opened up the
offense and continue to win with a roster that only slightly
resembles the Cup winners of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Lou Lamoriello insists, ``It wasn't our intent
to change our style,'' this season under first-year coach Robbie
Ftorek, who replaced Jacques Lemaire. But that's the appearance.
New Jersey recently had a five-game stretch during which it scored
five goals or more in each game for the first time in franchise
history. Through 30 games, the Devils were one of only four teams
averaging at least 3.0 goals per game (Toronto, Detroit and Phoenix
were the others).
</P>
<P>
   There was little sign this was coming. New Jersey scored only 12
goals in six exhibition games, then lost their first two of the
regular season (2-1 and 3-1) for the first time in five years
before taking off. The Devils had runs of four straight wins and
one loss in a stretch of 13 games (9-1-3). They've also continued
to operate as a sports executive's dream, winning with a payroll
($27.7 million) that ranks 21st of 27 teams and is dwarfed by that
of their border rivals, the New York Rangers ($39.8 million), who
struggle nonetheless. This team does not include what are arguably
the five best forwards from the '95 team: Stephane Richer, John
MacLean, Neal Broten, Bill Guerin and Claude Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some difficult decisions, but they've usually
worked out for us,'' said Lamoriello, who declined to match
Chicago's $6 million-a-year offer to free-agent center Doug
Gilmour. ``We've always tried to stay consistent and not let the
fans or the media make decisions for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were consistent under Lemaire, perfecting the
neutral-zone trap defense that smothered opposing offenses and
eventually led to rule changes to open the game back up. But
Lemaire's Devils won only one playoff series in the three seasons
that came after the Cup and he resigned in May, six days after the
team was bounced by Ottawa in the first round. Lamoriello said the
decision was entirely Lemaire's (who remains in the organization as
a Tampa-based ``consultant,'' but he may eventually leave to coach
elsewhere).
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek, an assistant coach for two years but in the organization
for seven, was promoted to replace Lemaire. There were skeptics. In
his only previous head coaching stint, with Los Angeles, Ftorek
went 65-56-11 and won one playoff game in a year and a half. He
also reportedly clashed with then-King Wayne Gretzky, which isn't
conducive to job security.
</P>
<P>
   But under Ftorek, the Devils have trapped less and attacked
more. Lamoriello said the change has less to do with philosophy
than it does the team's youth. Of New Jersey's top eight scorers,
five are 25 or younger, including 22-year-old points leader Petr
Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when a team is playing a certain way, perception
becomes reality,'' Lamoriello said. ``With the type of players we
have, young, highly skilled forwards that we've been bringing
along, we felt it was time to let them go. Robbie has been in the
organization for a number of years, so we have a similar philosophy
about things. We're still a team where defense is very important.
People are looking at what we're doing offensively and think we've
changed. But I think by the end of the year, we'll be as good a
defensive team as we were before. . . . The trap is an overused ...
word. We've been tagged (unfairly). We're just a quicker team now
than we were last year.

 &HT;    Grrrowl a market success
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In his four years as co-owner of the ECHL's
Charlotte Checkers, Carl Scheer learned something foreign in
major-league sports: You don't have to excel on the ice to draw
fans; you just have to package properly.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Packaging Central.
</P>
<P>
   The name Greenville Grrrowl _ that's three R's _ was created by
an ad agency. The team plays in a new 14,000-seat, $64 million
arena, the Bi-Lo Center, which looks like an art museum from the
outside. Scheer orchestrated construction but took little financial
risk. The 30 luxury suites are sold out. There are 3,900
season-ticket holders, and games average 9,200, second-highest in
the ECHL. Scheer said he wouldn't sell the franchise, which he
purchased for $1 million dollars, for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   If hockey seems secondary at Grrrowl games, it's not an
accident: players skating onto the ice through an inflatable
doghouse, twirling spotlights, the ``Grrrowl Girls'' dancing to
rock music, goofy games between periods.
</P>
<P>
   Should anyone not understand the sport, coach John Marks says,
``I tell people to look at hockey like they do basketball. They're
both five on five. There's transition from offense to defense. In
both, you're trying to take it to the net, and a hand check is just
like slashing, except that you're doing it with a five-foot
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchandising: Plentiful. Best may be the $6 puck with a bite
taken out of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nourishment: ``BBQ of the South'' pork sandwich; Blueplate
``Meat and 2'' for $6; Carolina Blonde Beer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between periods: If you're not interested in on-ice games,
there is an autograph session in the lobby after the first period
with players not suited up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promotions: Coach does on-ice interview immediately after
the game for fans; ``Dog Obediance Class,'' a free pamphlet
explaining rules and penalties; box office phone number, 467-GRRR.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never thought you'd hear: On the Grrrowl's colorful Web site
(http://www.grrrowl.com), move the mouse over the team's logo and
hear the sound of a dog biting a puck. Move it to the ``Bad Dog''
icon and hear comedian Bill Murray say, ``You beast. You savage.
Come on, bark like a dog for me.

 &HT;    Asheville's Team Gretzky
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ During a recent road trip through various
Northern hamlets in the United Hockey League, the coach of the
Asheville Smoke directed the team bus driver to go to Brantford,
Ontario, for a stopover.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to Keith Gretzky that his players might want to see
the city where Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and
Gretzky's brother reinvented the game of hockey. And don't ask
which feat is held in higher regard in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to my parents' house and showed them all the
trophies,'' Gretzky said. ``Their basement is, like, the Hockey
Hall of Fame. They all took turns putting on some of Wayne's old
jerseys and having their pictures taken.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have connections. Keith Gretzky, coach and general
manager of the Asheville Smoke, is a younger brother of Wayne
Gretzky, widely considered the sport's greatest player. So is
forward Brent Gretzky, who has played much of this season in
Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an instant marketing dream come true for Smoke owner
Dan Williams. He moved the team last year _ out of Brantford, where
it flopped at the gate _ and brought it to a mountain resort known
more for bookstores, New Age shops and changing leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gretzky) is the one name everybody knows,'' Williams said.
``It has created an identity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent, 26, may be familiar to Atlanta hockey fans, having played
for the since-departed Knights and getting called up for cameo
apperances by the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning 1993-95. He bounced
around the minors, playing on four teams in three U.S. leagues
before signing with a club in Austria. He was set to return to
Austria this year for a second season but came home because the
team, having financial difficulties, reneged on housing promises.
</P>
<P>
   Brent, who had resisted offers to play with Keith, 31, in
California for three years, decided to contact his brother in
Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Keith at 11 o'clock at night, and we had a deal in an
hour and a half,'' Brent said. ``A lot of people say, `How can you
play in this league?' But sometimes that's what you have to do, and
it's worked out great. Plus I had the security of playing for
Keith. I get a lot of ice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing an estimated $50,000 salary, compared to Wayne's $6
million with the New York Rangers, Brent scored 45 points in his
first 20 games with the Smoke before being called up by Hershey in
the AHL. He played well in six games, then returned to Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   On the hockey ladder, the AHL is two steps higher than the UHL,
but Brent is having such a good time that he might decline an offer
to play with Hershey for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Keith also enjoys Asheville. Had the Smoke remained in
Brantford, ``I never would have coached there,'' the former
European and minor-league player said. ``I like the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gretzkys often are taunted about their famed sibling. ``In
Utica, some guy held up a sign saying, `You'll never be like
Wayne,''' Brent said. ``They were throwing garbage in the penalty
box at me. I expect to get hit on the ice. But the garbage? I guess
it comes with the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff: Wayne, 37, gave Keith an autographed stick to be
raffled off at a recent game to raise money for the team, which
also uses equipment Wayne's company supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Did the renowned brother supply it for free?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but we got a family discount,'' Keith said.

 &HT;    South afire over hockey
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the chuck-a-puck contest, before spotlights and
FM tunes and the apparent rule that every minor-league hockey
player had to pass through an inflatable smoking animal before
skating onto the ice, there was just the game and the owner and the
traveling team bus with the hole in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my first bus was used in `Slapshot,''' said Bill
Coffey, owner of the Central Hockey League's Fayetteville (N.C.)
Force, referring to a satirical movie that is as embraced in the
hockey world as ``Caddyshack'' is in golf. ``That's when I owned
Winston-Salem in the Atlantic Coast League. Bus had a hole in the
floor. A man could fall right through and fall right to the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how teams would issue helmets and gloves and shoulder
pads in training camp? I used to issue sleeping bags. Players were,
like, `What's this? We already have bunks.' Then they'd get on the
bus and find out there was no heat. Drove that thing in the winter
and snow would blow up through the hole, so you had to bundle up.''
</P>
<P>
   That first bus _ not to be confused with the bus he acquired in
exchange for his rights to another franchise _ now sits in a North
Carolina junkyard, Coffey said. In the interim, the sport of hockey
has been repackaged and distributed as at no time before,
particularly in the South.
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta Thrashers make their NHL debut in the fall,
they will represent at least the fourth hockey team in Georgia,
joining minor-league franchises in Macon, Columbus and Augusta,
with another possibly relocating to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is not even ahead of the curve. There are eight
franchises in Florida and seven in Louisiana, including the
Lafayette-based IceGators, a member of the mushrooming East Coast
Hockey League and the gold standard for minor-league teams. Even
with a drop in attendance this season, the IceGators have a
season-ticket base in excess of 7,000 and average crowds of 9,800
in an 11,000-seat building.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco Road doesn't quite resemble the Canadian provinces, but
it's getting there. North Carolina has four hockey teams, with a
possible relocation on the way. The Asheville Smoke couldn't make
it in Brantford, Ontario, the birthplace of Wayne Gretzky, but is
thriving in the hometown of Thomas Wolfe. Tennessee owns three
franchises, including the NHL's hip Nashville Predators. South
Carolina has three teams, with a commitment for a fourth, including
the Greenville Grrrowl, sports' only nickname that comes equipped
with woofers. The ECHL team is owned by former longtime NBA
executive Carl Scheer, who has sold all 30 suites at $45,000 a pop
in the new 14,000-seat Bi-Lo Center.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 40 franchises are spread out over seven leagues
operating in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
and West Virginia. You can visit the Everblades in Florida, feast
on Kingfish in Baton Rouge, hit the Lynx in Augusta, run with the
Throroughblades in Kentucky or, if in the mood, make Whoopee in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Desrosiers, coach of the ECHL's Birmingham Bulls,
recalled when the team moved from Cincinnati. ``There was some
controversy at the time whether the team should come here, because
some of the other owners thought it was too far south,'' he said.
``Now we're the northern-most team in our division.''
</P>
<P>
   To Thrashers vice president of marketing Derek Schiller, the
boom ``without a doubt'' will have a positive impact on the NHL
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the ability to make anybody a hockey fan, and thus an
Atlanta Thrashers fan, is to have some understanding what the sport
is,'' Schiller said. ``Part of that understanding is going to a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller expects the Thrashers to evolve into a regional
attraction. ``I would compare it to the Braves drawing from a lot
of the minor-league communities in the South,'' he said. ``We have
the same expectations. We'll market fully in those towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the expansion
</P>
<P>
   There is no single overriding theory why hockey and the South
now seem as perfectly partnered as grits and Canadian bacon.
Actually, there are six:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wayne Gretzky. Doesn't it always start with him? When Gretzky
was traded from Edmonton to Los Angeles in 1988, it spurred
sellouts in a previously half-empty building and stimulated NHL
expansion or franchise relocation in areas not terribly familiar
with Toe Blake, dump-and-chase or the Original Six. Soon, pucks
were flying in San Jose, Anaheim, Miami, Tampa Bay, Dallas,
Phoenix, Nashville and Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern migration. The economic boom has created a haven for
transplanted Northern fans. Hockey generally has defied the belief
of the late Jack Kent Cooke, first owner of the L.A. Kings, who
said, ``The reason all the Canadians moved to California was to get
away from hockey.'' But Coffey believes a number of the Southern
teams are not dependent on transplants. ``These are just
Southerners catching on to hockey,'' he said. ``When we started (in
Fayetteville) last year, I bet you nine out of 10 people didn't
know what offsides was.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marketing and promotion. Hockey was the last sport to catch on
to the idea, and it started mimicking minor-league baseball. ``We
recognized that a game was an entertainment event and that the
hockey was just a part of that,'' ECHL president Richard Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, every between-periods intermission is filled with
wackiness. In chuck-a-puck, the most common game, fans can buy a
foam-rubber puck for $1, write their names on it, then throw it to
a designated spot at center ice. Closest to the spot wins cash or a
souvenir of his or her choice. At worst, a team will collect $1,500
in exchange for a $75 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two things I won't use are politicians and animals,''
Fayetteville's Coffey said. Fortunately, he wasn't part of the
ill-fated guess-the-weight-of-the-cow night in Muskegon, Mich.,
several years ago. The cow slipped on the ice, broke all four legs
and had to be destroyed on the site.
</P>
<P>
   But Coffey did once hold a ``Fight Night'' in which he ordered
four ambulances to circle the arena. ``The city attorney wasn't
very happy,'' he said. ``It turned out there weren't any fights,
but we had a great crowd.''

<P>
   _ Secondary markets. Teams are thriving predominantly in areas
where there is no other pro sports franchise, except perhaps
minor-league baseball. Particularly in the South, hockey is being
exposed for the first time in smaller cities, and potental fans
don't have _ or care about _ a reference point. Whether it's the
NHL or the Class A equivalent United Hockey League, it's just
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Miami, a major sports town, is last in
the ECHL in attendance. The NHL's Carolina Hurricanes are a
major-league team dying in a minor-league town (Greensboro) until
its arena in Raleigh is complete. Greensboro residents have
supported minor-league teams in the past but won't pay NHL prices,
let alone to a temporary tenant. It's expected that when the
Hurricanes move to Raleigh next season, the American Hockey League
will shift its franchise in New Haven, Conn., back to Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   _ Affordability and backlash against major leagues. Scheer says
rising ticket prices and a ``bad trend'' in television revenues led
him away from the NBA and into part-ownership of an ECHL team in
Charlotte four years ago. ``I didn't like the way consumers were
being treated,'' he said. ``I didn't see a future in the CBA
because college basketball was so big, but hockey was different. It
had enormous appeal to a midsize city in a blue-collar environment.
It had the physicalness of it, the fighting. It had the finesse.
And most important, it was affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Growth of in-line skating. It led to the roller-hockey fad and
an understanding of the game and partly has fueled the increase of
construction in ice rinks in the South. The Asheville Civic Center
didn't have ice until the UHL's Smoke announced plans to move there
this year. ``I never saw a rink made until I came here,'' said
Smoke forward Kris Schultz, a Saskatchewan native. ``Where I'm
from, there's towns with 2,500 people that have two rinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose structure to leagues
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's minor leagues are not as structured as baseball's. All
NHL franchises have one major affiliate in the American or
International leagues, which is comparable to baseball's AAA level.
Some also will supply players to the ECHL (AA). The Central, United
and Western Pro and West Coast leagues are roughly Class A, also
called ``Plumbers League,'' with few players whose rights are owned
by NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
   All leagues have salary caps, enabling them to control costs and
limit ticket prices. Players in the ECHL, CHL and UHL generally
earn $400 to $500 per week, plus housing. ``It's not quite the
business it is at the next level,'' said Dave Schultz, a former
Philadelphia Flyers bad boy who is coach and general manager of the
UHL's Mohawk Valley (N.Y.) Prowlers. ``These guys are just making a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Canadian players, however, have taken to Southern
towns and now find themselves rejecting promotions to the AHL or
IHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I didn't know what I was getting into when
I came here,'' said Birmingham forward Jamey Hicks, an Ontario
native who played two years in Europe. ``But I don't know if I ever
want to leave. I think one reason hockey players love the South is
we love to golf. It's a lot different going from practice to the
golf course instead of going home to shovel snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he has turned down IHL teams, adding, ``To go some
place for a few weeks for an extra $100 a week, it's not worth it.
It used to be guys would keep their bags packed, just praying for
the day to go to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has seen more changes than Coffey. His entry into hockey
came 15 years ago when he asked the Winston-Salem Thunderbirds if
they needed an accountant. The team and its league have since
folded, as have two other ventures. He helped launch the five-team
ECHL in 1988. Franchises could be had for $25,000. Now, expansion
fees are $2 million, and the league is 27 teams deep, with an
intended cap of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we (expanded) to Tallahassee in 1994, they were an island
down there,'' Adams said. ``Then we went to Lafayette and drew
10,000 (per game). Then they put ice in in Baton Rouge and we went
there, then the same in Pensacola. Now we have nine or 10 teams
along I-10.''
</P>
<P>
   It has grown too large for Coffey, who used to drive not only
the bus to the games but the Zamboni during them to smooth the ice.
``At some point, there is going to be some serious consolidation,''
he said. ``All of these leagues and teams can't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   He also subscribes to the ``three-and-done'' rule, claiming that
after three years the newness will wear off with a number of teams
and crowds will start to drop. It already has occurred in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's Fayetteville team is averaging 3,300 fans, not great
but enough for now. He says he has done ``very well'' from selling
ECHL teams in Knoxville and Greensboro. He didn't exactly sell
Winston-Salem, instead agreeing to give up his share of the team to
partners in exchange for the team bus, which he wanted to bring
with him to Knoxville in 1988, the ECHL's birth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I announced I was putting a team in Knoxville, one
reporter said to me, `You'll be bankrupt by the end of the year,'''
Coffey said. ``But we did great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, we didn't even get there until late September and the
season was starting in October. We didn't even have dasherboards. I
hired three people to build them in 26 hours, around the clock. A
lot of these billionaire (owners) won't go into a place now unless
everything is done. They never would have survived back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Least of all, without a sleeping bag.

 &HT;    Macon Whoopee no easy sell
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ It's another Central Hockey League season, another
reason for Macon Whoopee.
</P>
<P>
   The world's best sports-franchise nickname is back for a third
season, tripling the lifespan of the Southern Hockey League's Macon
Whoopees, who unfortunately didn't check opponents as well as their
owner bounced checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Whoopee's five-headed ownership group is down to two,
including CEO Jeffery Fried, a Macon physician, who concedes,
``I've realized this takes a lot of work to make it profitable. I
thought crowds would just automatically show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, Fried hired a new president, Keith Burdette,
who has imported several promotions from his previous team in
Memphis and plans a grand expansion of the Whoopee Web site, which
should be a gold mine for merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Burdette also plans to unveil a new ``spicier'' logo for a third
jersey, although it will include the current fig leaf _ ``everybody
thinks it's a maple leaf.'' A mascot also might be created,
although it could be dangerous given the team's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is happier about the franchise's resurrection than
Spencer Barnes, who professes to be the first season-ticket holder
of Whoopees '73. ``It's like I'm reborn again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes says about the players, ``They were a lot meaner back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach and general manager is John Paris, who led the former
Atlanta Knights to an IHL championship. Asked if he ever thought he
would coach a team called the Whoopee, Paris says, ``No. But I knew
the song.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchandising: Two things you won't find in any other arena
are the book, ``Once Upon A Whoopee,'' about the ill-fated
Whoopsters of 1973-74, and the ``10 reasons for Macon Whoopee''
T-shirt. Among the few printable ones for family readership is,
``Your parents cheer when you score.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nourishment: Food is standard burgers and dogs, but there are
two bars serving mixed drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between periods: There's nothing like Human Ice Bowling _
helmeted fans on sleds sliding into inflatable pins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promotion: The Macon Whoopee ``One Night Stand'' includes
15 seats and a keg of beer for $450.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never thought you'd see: A kiosk to apply for a Macon Whoopee
MasterCard.

 &HT;    Gardens party
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Much has been made of the fact the Toronto Maple Leafs
will move out of antiquated Maple Leaf Gardens in February and into
the new Air Canada Centre. But as coach Pat Quinn said, ``Maybe
we'll run down to the new place and destroy it.'' The Leafs went
12-4-2 in their first 18 home games, on pace for their best home
record in 30 years. Toronto has had losing home records the last
two years. The Leafs' league-high of 105 goals in 32 games _
including 19 in consecutive wins over Phoenix, the New York Rangers
and Pittsburgh _ also left them at a full-season pace of 269 goals,
75 more than last season. In crediting Quinn for the turnaround,
left winger Derek King unwittingly took a shot at former coach Mike
Murphy, saying, ``Pat is letting us be creative instead of just
dumping (the puck) in. In the past, we were too concerned with
keeping the puck out of our net and not concerned enough about
putting it in the other net.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuffled off
</P>
<P>
   Despite having one of the best records in the Eastern
Conference, Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier is feeling some
heat for getting only a second-round draft pick from Los Angeles
for forward Donald Audette. Audette, who was unsigned, led the
Sabres in goals last season and scored on his first shift with the
Kings, who have been desperate for offensive help. ``We were not
offered players who we thought would come in and contribute to the
hockey club right now,'' Regier said. ``If we had been performing
poorly, there would have been more pressure to sign Donald or get a
player who could help us right now.'' Sabres forward Brian
Holzinger appeared to second-guess Regier, saying, ``My personal
feeling is he's a guy we need on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho ho ho
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins are losing their shirts but they haven't
lost their sense of humor. In a videotaped holiday greeting that
was played on the Civic Arena scoreboard, coach Kevin Constantine
said, ``We hope that your holiday spending hasn't left you, shall
we say, bankrupt?'' The Penguins, in the midst of bankruptcy
proceedings, sold out only one of the first 12 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   After Anaheim's Travis Green hit New York's Kenny Jonsson from
behind, Islanders coach Mike Milbury called Green a ``gutless
puke'' and added, ``I don't know what day they come into Long
Island, but it will be interesting.'' . . . As Montreal continues
to struggle, trade rumors concerning Mark Recchi heat up. The
winger is an unrestricted free agent after the season and probably
won't be re-signed by the Canadiens. ... Lost in Montreal's 10-game
winless streak at midweek was that Jeff Hackett, acquired from
Chicago, appears to have solved the goaltending problems. Hackett
stopped 35 of 37 shots against Dallas, but the Canadiens only tied
2-2.

 &HT;    Odds against Paris for Thrashers coaching spot
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thrashers general manager Don Waddell says he has
``probably 200'' resumes from qualified coaches and scouts seeking
positions with the team, and John Paris makes it no secret that he
represents one of them. Paris coached the IHL's Atlanta Knights
when the since-departed team won that league's Turner Cup title.
Now, he is coach and general manager of the Macon Whoopee of the
Central Hockey League. Paris said he has had offers to work for
other teams in the CHL or ECHL but he has stayed in Macon. ``I like
living in Georgia,'' he said. ``(And) I knew the Thrashers were
coming into the league. Everybody knows why I stayed here. We'll
see if it works out.'' The odds are against Paris. Waddell has
completed the scouting staff, and Paris probably won't be a
candidate for the head coaching position. Whoever is chosen as the
head coach will pick his own assistants. Other positions to be
filled include a lawyer or financial person in the front office to
deal with contracts, trainers, equipment people and a publicist. .
. . Waddell flew to Winnipeg on Christmas day for the World Junior
Championships. He estimated that ``20 of the 28'' first-round picks
will be in the tournament, and the Thrashers will staff it
accordingly, with five scouts. . . . The Thrashers will conduct a
street hockey clinic for physically disabled youth Monday (10
a.m.-noon) at the Robert D. Fowler YMCA in Norcross. The clinic is
being held in conjunction with the American Association of Adapted
Sports Programs. . . . Club hockey teams from Georgia, Georgia
Tech, Florida and Tennessee will take part in an inaugural hockey
tournament in Savannah Jan. 8-9. The games, at the Savannah Civic
Center, will decide the winner of the ``Thrasher Cup'' _ yes, named
for the team. Savannah also is interested in bringing a Thrashers
exhibition game to the city.

 &HT;    Is the Red Wing's Panic premature?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schutlz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Detroit is coming off consecutive Stanley Cups and
appears in control in the Central Division. But when the Red Wings
lost to Dallas last week for the third time in a row, speculation
grew that management might try to alter the team's chemistry with a
trade or two. But former Wings assistant general manager Don
Waddell, now with the Thrashers, says he thinks there has been too
much focus on the Dallas games because ``those games are lot more
important to Dallas than they are to Detroit.'' One statistic is
worth noting, however. Through 31 games, Detroit was 0-7 against
division leaders and only 4-10 against teams with .500 or winning
records. ``We're not fooled by our record by any means,''
defenseman Larry Murphy said. ``We haven't had much success against
the stronger teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Expansion nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Nashville goalie Mike Dunham (10-9-1, .912 saves percentage),
the primary reason the Predators have been competitive this season,
also might be the center of the team's possible forthcoming slide.
Dunham will be out at least three weeks with a strained groin. If
it sounds familiar, it's because he also suffered a groin injury in
training camp, then aggravated it Nov. 29, then was reinjured when
he came back two weeks later. ``It's not chronic,'' Dunham insists.
``It's just that we didn't let it heal 100 percent from the last
time, and the muscle wasn't strong enough. I'm not worried about
letting this affect the rest of my career. I just need to let it
heal completely this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bure to Belarus?
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver holdout Pavel Bure, who isn't talking to the U.S.
media but apparently has no problem discussing his future on
European television, says he has an offer to play in Belarus next
season. Bure has been skating with the Russian national team in
Moscow. Calgary's Valeri Bure, who speaks to his brother by
telephone often, said, ``I don't know what Vancouver is going to
do, but he might not even come back here. He might play in Belarus
and make the same type of money that he would here. . . . He
sounded (on the telephone) like he wanted to get back to playing,
but he can't let that get into his head. It's tough, though, for
him to sit at home and watch the other guys play.''
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton general manager Glen Sather denies a Canadian TV report
that he is close to firing coach Ron Low: ``Do these guys make this
stuff up? There's absolutely no truth to this at all. Ronnie's done
an exceptional job. Every time a team goes for a slide, is it
supposed to be time to get rid of the coach? We're in first place
in our division, and we haven't had Doug Weight. I'd say that's
pretty good.

 &HT;    Veteran to players: Invest
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Wednesday night's secret David Stern-Billy Hunter
meeting at the Los Angeles office of agent Leonard Armato in mind,
here's a little NBA story for some perspective on today's impasse
over mega-bucks.
</P>
<P>
   This is about a 6-foot-6 guard with the musical name of Shaler
Halimon, who in 1969 was dealt from Philadelphia to the Bulls with
Chet Walker for Jim Washington, now an Atlantan.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Super Shay'' for his entertaining and individualistic
style, Halimon never fit with coach Dick Motta's conservative game,
but before the advent of the three-point basket he once registered
four points in one second to help the Bulls beat Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Halimon today is a bus driver in Portland, where he played after
being traded by the Bulls in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He's been working for the transportation company for 17 years
and figures he has 10 years until retirement. With his $1,400 a
month NBA pension and good investments, he says, ``I'll be in good
shape. Gosh, if I would have made (today's minimum salary of)
$250,000 a year, I would have never had to work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Halimon told Oregonian columnist Dwight Jaynes, ``You know, the
greatest thing man ever invented was compound interest. So many of
these young basketball players never learned that. Most of them go
to college, but I don't think very many of them take finance
classes. They never learn how to take care of their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with all that money?'' wondered Halimon, whose
top salary was $60,000. ``There's only three things you need in the
world _ a home, food and a job. Most of those guys have four
houses, seven cars, two or three girlfriends, a lot of clothes and
about 16 people trailing along behind them. Have they ever heard of
mutual funds or zero-coupon bonds?''
</P>
<P>
   Solutions
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone denies that he and John Stockton are working behind
the scenes to bring the lockout deal to a vote, perhaps even
working on having David Falk clients Pat Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo,
Alonzo Mourning and Juwan Howard removed from leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Malone says, ``I'm with the union.'' His agent,
Dwight Manley, says, ``I don't know that Karl has even talked to
John lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Manley also said, ``Karl would be glad to serve, if asked, but
he is not trying to usurp any power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some background on the frenzied efforts to save the season:
</P>
<P>
   As some might have expected, Stern's skiing vacation was a
calculated ploy, as was his announcement of a Jan. 7 ``drop-dead''
date. On two occasions, union leaders reneged publicly on verbal
agreements, infuriating Stern, who broke off negotiations each
time.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials claim it happened a third time a week ago, after
which Stern suddenly announced he was off to his vacation home in
Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has needed a deadline to get serious, believing that
Stern wouldn't get serious until the end. Meanwhile, his sport is
eroding as Charles Barkley, Malone, Tim Hardaway and now Kevin
Willis openly break with the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Learning game
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens can't coach the Hawks on the court during the
lockout, but he can coach in your den. Wilkens and long-time friend
and assistant Dick Helm have produced an instructive videotape and
booklet set, entitled ``The Basics,'' available at the Turner Store
and by telephone order at 800-261-3773. The teaching is done in
clear, concise language, with diagrams and player demonstrations,
particularly effective for young players. The bad news: The set is
a very pricey $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   Under repairs
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pervis Ellison isn't the malingerer some Celtics believed.
The Savannah native quietly had surgery last month to repair a
tendon in his right ankle. That solves the physical issue and helps
quiet the negative rumblings among Ellison's bosses after he failed
to respond properly to rehab on the injury that originally occurred
Jan. 7 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was more than just a
sprained ankle,'' Ellison said. ``Nothing I did for it seemed to
help, so I finally went to see a doctor at Johns Hopkins, and he
found the torn tendon. I had the surgery about four weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden silence
</P>
<P>
   Here's a holiday gift for the ears: Jim Chones, one of the worst
game analysts of all time has left the booth in Cleveland to become
a coach at Orange High School, where the star players happen to be
his 14-year-old triplet sons _ Kyle (6-4), Kendall (6-5) and
Kameron (6-1). The left-handed freshmen have a lot of their
father's mannerisms on the court and, it is hoped, none of his
penchant for verbosity.
</P>
<P>
   A fortune
</P>
<P>
   Australian Chris Antsy can't understand the grumbling over an
extra million here and there in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference if you make $10 million a year or $9
million a year? How much difference does it make to your lifestyle?
It's going to be more than most people see in a lifetime, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish someone would explain it to me. I played my first three
years of professional basketball in Australia, and my total salary
was $150,000, and I was happy with that. Right now, I'm making
($713,900 last year), less than half the average salary, and I
couldn't be happier with what I'm making. I never thought I'd make
this much in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness
</P>
<P>
   Think players don't mellow with age? Look to Rick Mahorn. In
Mahorn's early years in the league, he never smiled. Now, he grins
even when he knocks you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the point where you realize that all you want to do
is be healthy enough to go out there and play the game,'' Mahorn
says.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Royal can relate to that. The Hornets free agent is on
the mend from surgery for colon cancer. On Monday, he takes a blood
test to see if his white cells have returned to normal so he can
resume full-scale workouts, with a comeback in mind.

FAILED HMO EXPOSES SHORTCOMINGS IN CHANGING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS and CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October, New Jersey's fourth-largest health maintenance
organization collapsed, threatening the medical coverage of nearly
200,000 people and leaving hospitals and doctors holding the bag
for nearly $120 million in unpaid claims.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse was the first of its kind in New Jersey, and it has
been attributed to a number of factors _ from poor management to
increased competition to inadequate financing. But state officials
and financial experts say it could have been avoided if the state
had been able to examine the books of the company that bought the
right to run the HMO's health centers and physicians' network.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the state's inability to examine the purchaser's finances
was its own fault, a result of regulations that did not keep up
with the rapid changes in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO itself, HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, also failed to
check the background of the company, so it did not know that the
company was already having serious financial and management
problems in another HMO deal.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent financial mess has exposed what some experts view
as the most urgent problem now facing HMOs across the United States
_ that many have too little funding to survive in an increasingly
competitive business.
</P>
<P>
   HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, with premiums of more than $300
million a year, is now licking its wounds and scrambling, under
state supervision, to try to pay something to health providers and
hold onto its members.
</P>
<P>
   Its former partner, Pinnacle Health Enterprises, is in
bankruptcy liquidation proceedings, and one of its top executives
committed suicide as the deal was unraveling this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle's parent company, PHP Healthcare Inc., has been driven
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Last week, PHP's stock
stood at 11 cents, down from a high this year of as much as $17.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil also has caused financial strains at HIP's larger
New York affiliate, which had tried to help the New Jersey
operation stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter tale of the dealings between HIP-NJ and its hoped-for
savior started 18 months ago, when the New Jersey plan was looking
at a deficit of $10.1 million that was not getting any smaller. So
it went to the state with a proposal: It would sell its system of
health centers and its physicians' network to a private company,
which would then manage them for a hefty annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   But when the state examined HIP's proposal, it realized that it
had no authority to directly review the finances of a what is
called a ``third-party administrator,'' a company that provides
services for an HMO, because third-party providers are not covered
under the state's licensing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Kumar, director of a Standard &AMP; Poor's unit that analyzes
health industry companies, said that until recently the regulation
of HMOs focused on quality of care rather than finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the country, the solvency guidelines are a joke and
we have found that one-third of the HMO companies do not have
adequate capital,'' Kumar said. ``It's like treating managed care
as if it had the same risk characteristics as selling Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the two state commissioners now supervising
HIP, Jaynee LaVecchia of the Department of Banking and Insurance
and Len Fishman of the Department of Health and Senior Services,
said they had looked at Pinnacle's public filings but could not
compel the company to disclose more information. They said they
relied on HIP's diligence in checking out its proposed partner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of HIP said privately that they had relied on the
consultant that had identified PHP, based in Reston, Va., as a
likely partner, and ``assumed'' that it had checked out the company
better than it did.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also said they approved the deal partly because
they had no reason to turn it down. They wanted to protect HIP,
which was in deep financial trouble and needed the $72.6 million
that PHP would pay for its health centers and doctors' network.
</P>
<P>
   `A Giant Siren Should Have Gone Off'
</P>
<P>
   Once state regulators realized that Pinnacle was acquiring most
of HIP's assets, they sought to compel Pinnacle and PHP to put up a
large reserve of cash to ensure continued care for HIP members. But
Pinnacle and PHP refused, since they were not directly subject to
state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A giant siren should have gone off at this point telling us
that PHP didn't have the resources that we thought they had,'' said
one HIP official.
</P>
<P>
   So the state imposed more stringent reserve and accounting
requirements on the only company it did regulate, HIP, even though
this just increased its financial stress.
</P>
<P>
   Elie Radinsky, a director in corporate ratings for Standard &AMP;
Poor's, said that if HIP had examined PHP more closely, the deal
might have turned out differently. For PHP, ``this was biting off a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically HIP transferred its entire risk for a statewide
program to a third party,'' Radinsky said. ``And from a regulatory
point of view you need to know the financial strength of the
insurer who is responsible for the bills as well as that of the
third party.''
</P>
<P>
   HIP of Greater New York began in New York in 1947 as a system of
clinics providing affordable health care to city employees. It came
to New Jersey in 1980 at the invitation of state officials who
asked it to save a failing health plan.
</P>
<P>
   After putting that one on a firm footing, HIP expanded into much
of New Jersey by the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, managed care companies were flooding into the
state offering premiums that undercut HIP's. The newcomers also
were giving members more choices among doctors. So HIP began to
move away from clinic-based care toward its own network of doctors
in private practices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to state filings, HIP's enrollments rose from about
170,000 in 1994 to about 205,000 in 1996, but then dipped to
194,000 by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to studies by Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co.,
a Wall Street investment firm, HIP-NJ was not run efficiently. From
1995 to 1997, the company went from spending 96 cents of every
dollar collected in premiums on medical services to spending $1.02,
while the average managed care company was spending 85 cents. HIP
held on with $40 million in loans from its New York City affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, HIP hired Wasserstein Perella to attract
suitors. The proposal from PHP was the only one that seemed to fit
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state was relying on the fact that we were using
Wasserstein Perella, a national firm, to do this search,'' said one
HIP official who insisted on anonymity. ``And we were interested in
whether PHP worked, more so than in the company's history. We
thought Wasserstein had checked all of that. Maybe we were naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Management companies like PHP had found a niche by promising to
squeeze savings out of HMOs. PHP began in 1975 by contracting with
the Army and other government entities. In 1992, its revenues were
beginning to decline. It wanted to expand in the private sector,
and the deal with HIP-NJ seemed just the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Inside PHP the sense of expectancy was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more than $300 million a year in business, and they
had never taken on anything this big before,'' said a former
executive there who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``PHP was
enthusiastic about this because they thought if it went well it
would mean access to the New York HIP market.''
</P>
<P>
   PHP Venture Fails Just Two States Away
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the company was reeling from a similar
foray. In 1996, PHP had joined with a group of hospitals in
Fairfield County, Conn., to form Connecticut Health Enterprises. It
was to be a physician and hospital organization offering one-stop
medical service contracts in exchange for a large percentage of
insurance premiums. It eventually signed up 12 insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a year into the arrangement, PHP's Connecticut subsidiary
and its partners, including St. Vincent's Health Center in
Bridgeport, were at each other's throats. By November 1997, within
days of the commencement of the PHP/HIP-NJ partnership, the
Connecticut arrangement was falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed in federal court last January by PHP's partners
accused the company's Connecticut subsidiary of failing to ``to
take appropriate remedial action, precipitating a financial crisis
at CHE.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was settled out of court, with a condition that PHP
leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   As HIP officials in New Jersey were closing the deal with
Pinnacle in the autumn of 1997, they did not know anything about
these problems two states away.
</P>
<P>
   What PHP did tell financial analysts was that it didn't want to
come into New Jersey with ``slash and burn'' management that would
frighten doctors and hospitals away. The new Pinnacle operation
would lose money for the time being, they said, but they planned to
ride out this period through concessions that required HIP to
shoulder as much as $28 million of the costs in the first year of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the shadow of financial problems at other
managed care companies, like Oxford, had prevented PHP from
financing the HIP deal by issuing stock. After PHP arranged a bank
loan, it sought to raise money by issuing convertible notes that
promised purchasers that, should the price of company stock
decline, the noteholders could increase their shares of company
stock proportionally.
</P>
<P>
   What the company did not expect was a ruling from the Securities
and Exchange Commission in January that required PHP to restate its
1995 earnings to reflect a $4 million loss. The price of the stock,
which was already dropping, began plummeting. PHP used the money it
had raised to cushion its first year to buy back stock and
stabilize the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This created a liquidity issue and the company had little
margin for error,'' said Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HIP was becoming nervous. Its enrollments were not
growing, its costs were not going down and PHP officials were
clamming up.
</P>
<P>
   HIP officials became more uneasy when they found out that PHP's
president, Jack Mazur, and two partners in another business had
settled a civil fraud lawsuit in the mid-1980s for $5.5 million.
The HIP officials only found out about this when they logged into
an Internet chat room discussing PHP's problems late last July.
</P>
<P>
   And for their part, Pinnacle officials said that they were
submitting plans for cutbacks which either HIP was contesting or
state officials were not acting on.
</P>
<P>
   The state finally began to take notice as HIP's quarterly
reports showed that its deficits were growing while Pinnacle was
failing to pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   400 Pink Slips in `September Massacre'
</P>
<P>
   In early September, frantic to wring immediate savings from the
New Jersey operation, Pinnacle sent out pink slips to 400 employees
at the medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   This move set off alarms with the regulators, who were concerned
about such a large cut. Angry state officials summoned HIP and PHP
executives to a meeting over what they were calling the ``September
massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Fishman said his agency maintained that Pinnacle
and its parent should have informed the state before the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman recalled the response from Mazur and Pinnacle's lawyers.
``They did what lawyers often do,'' he said. ``They argued that
they didn't have to inform us, but in the alternative they should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Weixel, who was then PHP's executive vice president but
recently succeeded Mazur as its president, described that meeting
as being ``like government trying to tell a doctor that he didn't
have enough receptionists.'' He added, ``We just don't think that
we had to ask their approval to lay off receptionists.''
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, which included doctors and nurses in addition to
receptionists, were drastically scaled back at the state's
insistence. Four days later, using a 1-year-old law meant to
toughen state regulation of HMOs, regulators placed the
Pinnacle/HIP combine under ``administrative supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the beginning of a closer relationship between state
regulators and HIP executives. On Oct. 27, the state regulators
announced that they would get a judge to put HIP-NJ into
``rehabilitation.'' This would allow them to take over the plan's
operations, seize control of the health centers and cancel
Pinnacle's contract.
</P>
<P>
   It also was on that day, local authorities say, that Pinnacle's
top executive, Dr. Paul Frankel, killed himself by taking handfuls
of pills along with a bottle of red wine. His brother, Kenneth
Frankel, laid the blame partly on the stress of the business
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was the first time that Paul wasn't 100 percent
successful,'' Kenneth Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually PHP wound up in Chapter 11 reorganization while
Pinnacle filed for Chapter 7 liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   And as state regulators try to fashion a partial payment plan
acceptable to health providers that are owed money by HIP/Pinnacle
and try to persuade the providers to continue to treat HIP members,
they are analyzing what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Wright, program director for Citizens Action, a New
Jersey public interest group, said that, in light of how extensive
its role was, PHP should have been required to take over HIP's
license as an insurer and be subjected to greater financial
scrutiny and reserve requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Already the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has
come up with new guidelines that recommend sharp increases in the
claims reserve requirements for health maintenance organizations
nationwide _ a move that will require greater funding for most
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly likely that most states will adopt these by the
year 2000, which will change the situation for the better,'' Kumar
of Standard &AMP; Poors said.
</P>
<P>
   At the direction of Gov. Christie Whitman, Ms. LaVecchia of the
Department of Banking and Insurance said that she would seek
legislative approval of the creation of an HMO ``guaranty fund,''
financed by contributions from the state's 23 managed care
insurers, to ensure continued coverage for the members of any plan
that goes bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Langevin, president of the Association of Health Plans
of New Jersey, is opposed to the idea, saying that well-run
companies would have to finance such a fund _ and bail out the bad
operators _ by raising premiums for their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this isn't about protecting consumers,'' he said. ``It's
about paying the old bills for doctors and hospitals. Why should
the public have to pick up those costs?''

   ATLANTA _ New York Jets assistant head coach Bill Belichick, the
eventual heir to Bill Parcells, may not hang around and wait for
''The Tuna'' to retire. Belichick last week contacted Baltimore
vice president Ozzie Newsome seeking permission to speak with
current Ravens assistants about the possibility of joining him if
he lands a head coaching job. Ravens assistant head coach Kirk
Ferentz, receivers coach Richard Mann, special teams coach Scott
O'Brien and strength coach Jerry Simmons all worked for Belichick
when he was head coach of the old Cleveland Browns franchise.
Belichick interviewed for the Oakland vacancy last year and is
certain to draw interest for some of the jobs coming open.

   Seattle president Bob Whitsitt, who won't waste much time in
dismissing coach Dennis Erickson, may seek permission to talk with
Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett as early as this week.
Whitsitt and vice president Randy Mueller also will speak with
former 49ers coach George Seifert. Owner Paul Allen, who failed to
land Mike Holmgren a year ago, won't make a second run at the
Packers coach. Mueller has distinguished himself enough to preclude
having a coach-general manager position anyway.

<P>
   Jacksonville linebacker Bryce Paup continues to be distressed at
the way he was used this season by coordinator Dick Jauron and is
having a hard time biting his tongue. The Jags promised Paup he'd
be a pass-rush force again, but the nine-year veteran more often is
used in coverage. When he earned defensive MVP honors with Buffalo
in '95, Paup rushed on nearly 80 percent of the snaps. This year he
has rushed 38 percent of the time. Jacksonville is paying Paup
$6.95 million in '98 and he has just 5 1/2 sacks. Meanwhile, Jags
owner Wayne Weaver is becoming increasingly frustrated with agent
Bob Fraley as he attempts to negotiate a contract extension for
coach Tom Coughlin. Ever since the fiasco two years ago with Bill
Parcells' contract in New England, Fraley has sought more clout for
his clients and is meticulous in nailing down every clause. Witness
how long it took the Falcons to finalize a deal with Dan Reeves,
another Fraley client, after they had an agreement with him.

yards each rushing and receiving in the same season. But Faulk may
get just scant playing time from coach Jim Mora against the
Panthers. The multi-talented back has been late for several
meetings the past two weeks, and some disciplining may be the
result. Also, there continues to be a disagreement over a clause in
Faulk's contract. Agent Rocky Arceneaux claims Faulk is a free
agent if he finishes among the top five rushers, while GM Bill
Polian contends that isn't the case. Faulk enters the weekend No. 6
in the league, 18 yards behind Emmitt Smith.

 &HT;    Cardinals reviving
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Including victories in both matchups this season, the
Dallas Cowboys have defeated the Arizona Cardinals in 16 of 18
meetings during the '90s. That dominance aside, the last team
Cowboys players want to see at Texas Stadium for the first round of
the playoffs next weekend is the upstart Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up 28-0 the last time we played and barely hung on to
beat them (35-28 on Nov. 15),'' Dallas strong safety Darren Woodson
said. ``They started playing `street ball' with no huddles, the
quarterback was running around making a lot of big plays, and we
about died. They're a dangerous team that I could do without (in
the playoffs).''
</P>
<P>
   The decimated Cowboys are the division champion most observers
see headed for an early playoff exit, and the Cardinals are the
wild-card entry everybody wants to avoid. Provided, of course,
Arizona evens qualifies for its first postseason since the
truncated '82 season.
</P>
<P>
   A victory today over San Diego _ no gimme, because the Chargers
quietly own the NFL's top-rated defense _ will secure Arizona the
lone vacancy left on the Super Bowl tournament dance card. More
important to personnel director Bob Ferguson and coach Vince Tobin,
it will provide positive reinforcement necessary for a young roster
that probably doesn't realize yet how good it can become.
</P>
<P>
   Like most playoff-bound teams in a league diluted by free-agency
and the accompanying lack of depth, the Cardinals have holes. The
safeties are pedestrian, the offensive line makeshift, the
defensive front ravaged by injuries and the kicking inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   But give credit to Tobin, and more notably Ferguson, for
dragging owner Bill Bidwill into football's modern age. One of the
game's most unloved losers, Bidwill has loosened his purse strings
to acquire key free agents, turned most of the football decisions
over to football people and actually demonstrated the kind of
vision that has been foreign to the franchise's limp legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the turnaround is quarterback Jake Plummer, who last week
agreed to a contract extension that made him the
second-highest-paid player in the league. A skinny passer from
Idaho who brought his derring-do playing style to Arizona State,
the second-year veteran probably will return the Cardinals'
investment with increased ticket sales. Fans in the Valley of the
Sun, who watched Plummer take ASU to the Rose Bowl his senior
season, are betting that he eventually will get the Cardinals to a
title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are betting on it as well, to the tune of a $15
million signing bonus, and $7.425 million average compensation in
the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is that I had to sell everybody, including
Vince, on him,'' Ferguson said, remembering the passionate debate
that transpired in the second round of the '97 draft. ``Vince was
afraid Jake would come in and be a flop, and then we'd have to
release the golden boy of Arizona State football.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the emerging star has rallied the Cardinals to comeback
victories in eight of his 24 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is the foundation in the rebuilding of the team, but the
Cards have other bricks as well. Ferguson is a savvy football guy
who tended bar, sold shells in Hawaii, drove a beer truck, did
public relations for a hydroplane-racing team and booked the
appearances of the Seattle Seahawks cheerleaders while trying to
break into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He has drafted wisely and spent judiciously on key free agents.
As demonstrated in 1997, when he browbeat Bidwill into signing
standout wide receiver Frank Sanders to a huge contract extension
that kept the former Auburn star off the free-agent market, he has
worked hard to retain nucleus players. The last thing Ferguson
wants is for his carefully constructed house of Cards to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the playoffs today would be the next, but not the
final, step.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in training camp, fullback Larry Centers tricked
then-rookie Plummer into carting a dead skunk into his dorm room by
convincing the quarterback that the plastic bag he handed him
contained a takeout order of chicken wings. The Cowboys' Darren
Woodson agrees that Plummer isn't about to fall for such hijinks
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team,'' Woodson said, ``doesn't stink anymore.

 &HT;    Niners still in flux?
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's still plenty of smoke to the speculation that
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren could end up back in San Francisco,
and recent events have fanned the flames. About 10 days ago,
current 49ers coach Steve Mariucci told his agent, Don Yee, he was
prepared to sign a contract extension he'd been considering for
months. Mariucci's rationale was that the uncertainty over
ownership, and the possible return of Ed DeBartolo Jr., still was
superceded by security through the 2005 season. But then the team
suddenly began ''negotiating in reverse,'' in the words of one
party involved, and slowed the talks with Mariucci. If Bill Walsh
returns as team president, there's little doubt he'll push for the
hiring of Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Vikes strikes
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Vikings for a preemptive strike Christmas Eve,
signing quarterback Randall Cunningham and right tackle Korey
Stringer to five-year extensions. Both would have been among the
most coveted players in the '99 free agent market. The move allows
the Vikings to keep intact a line that may be the league's best. In
addition to Stringer, three other starters _ left tackle Todd
Steussie and guards Randall McDaniel and David Dixon _ are signed
for 2-4 more seasons. The team still has several key free agents,
though, including middle 'backer Ed McDaniel, defensive linemen
Jerry Ball and Derrick Alexander, safeties Orlando Thomas and
Robert Griffith and corner Corey Fuller. Keeping Cunningham sets up
some intriguing possibilities with former starting quarterback Brad
Johnson, who is due a roster bonus of $1.15 million on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren redux
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over where Holmgren will coach next season is
starting to wear thin on Packers GM Ron Wolf, who feels the
speculation has distracted the club. Holmgren does not have a
21-day window to seek other positions, Wolf said last week, much to
the chagrin of agent Bob LaMonte. The Packers, who could be eyeing
Jets assistant coach Bill Belichick, among others, want a swift
resolution of Holmgren's status. Carolina owner Jerry Richardson
stopped only inches short of conceding he intends to pursue
Holmgren after dismissing incumbent Dom Capers in the next day or
two. Unless current Redskins president John Kent Cooke retains the
team, or the group including Joe Gibbs gets it, Holmgren will be a
candidate in Washington. Both Cooke and Gibbs' partner Sam Grossman
would keep Norv Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Giants steps
</P>
<P>
   Despite the three-game winning streak he has sparked since
replacing Danny Kanell, there's no way New York Giants quarterback
Kent Graham goes to camp as the clear-cut starter in '99. And even
though Gary Brown will probably go over 1,000 rushing yards today,
GM Ernie Accorsi plans to pursue a big-time tailback. That might
run counter to coach Jim Fassel, who has told some confidants he
feels LeShon Johnson, out all this season while recovering from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, could come back and win the No. 1 tailback
spot. Look for Accorsi to woo quarterback Kerry Collins unless he
signs back with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke turned down at least two offers to partner with other
groups attempting to buy the Redskins and his reluctance could cost
him the team. ... The fate of Bears coach Dave Wannstedt remains
uncertain, with team president Mike McCaskey cryptic about his
plans. McCaskey plans a weeklong vacation starting Monday to mull
things over. ... Jim ''Mouse'' McNallyRams coach Dick Vermeil Jerry
Rhome ... Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene

 &HT;    Two-minute drill with Buffalo's Sam Gash
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Buffalo fullback Sam Gash.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: His selfless approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Background: An eighth-round pick of New England in 1992, the
former Penn State star signed with the Bills as an unrestricted
free agent this year. In 103 games, he has only 237 ``touches,''
including just 115 rushing attempts. Despite only 10 carries this
season, Gash was elected to the Pro Bowl squad for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The last four seasons, you've carried the ball a total of 32
times. Wouldn't you like to get 20-25 carries in a game just once?
</P>
<P>
   A: That kind of stuff only happens in my dreams. Man, I'm a
1,000-yard rusher when my eyes are closed. Seriously, I get excited
from putting a linebacker on his rear end, then watching somebody
else get the yards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the key to being a good lead blocker?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a grunt job, so a lot of it is mental. Physical stuff,
like hitting square-up, gets to be second nature. You have to like
pain, because there's a train wreck every play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After making the Pro Bowl, what areas can you improve?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a lot of room for improvement in my blitz-pickup
technique. In the run game, it's seek and destroy, and I like
finding people to hit. Pass protection is different and more about
recognition and reading keys.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight on . . .
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: In the past two weeks, Green Bay tailback Dorsey Levens
has rushed for 175 yards and seems to be rounding into shape after
a nine-week absence. Against a porous Chicago defense, Levens
figures to get 25 more rehabilitative carries this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: Miami first-round tailback John Avery is allegedly
quicker on artificial surfaces, but his AstroTurf average (3.6
yards per carry) is no better than on grass (3.7). With Karim
Abdul-Jabbar injured, Avery gets a chance to test the Georgia Dome
rug today.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent: The Giants have won three in a row with reserve
quarterback Kent Graham and a fourth today could force Arizona to
defeat San Diego for the final wild-card berth. Graham once played
for the Cards, and he wouldn't mind turning up the heat on Vince
Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Despite winning the division, Jets coach Bill Parcells
had his team in pads last week because he wants the ground game
ready for the playoffs. That means offensive line coach John Matsko
better have the troops hyped for ``Tuna Bowl IV'' this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   This will be a tough week on coaches. Dom Capers (Carolina),
Dennis Erickson (Seattle), Ted Marchibroda (Baltimore) and Ray
Rhodes (Philadelphia) all figure to be fired by the middle of the
week. ... Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick, certain to
be a candidate for a number of vacancies, would like to take
Vikings offensive line coach Mike Tice with him. That could be a
problem in San Diego, where GM Bobby Beathard wants to retain
incumbent Joe Bugel. ... Any doubts about the future of Cincinnati
coach Bruce Coslet were quashed last week when owner Mike Brown
quietly extended the contracts of all the assistant coaches. ...
The latest rumor _ and that's all it is for now _ is that Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch, having conferred with Peyton Manning, is
leaning toward staying in school. ... The Rams might consider Scott
Mitchell, who will be jettisoned by Detroit next spring, as
competition for Tony Banks. ... Amid speculation he will be fired
if Bill Walsh rejoins the team, San Francisco personnel director
Vinny Cerrato met with owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. to attempt to
gauge his future.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up
</P>
<P>
   Just one year after a spinal cord injury ended his career,
former Lions linebacker Reggie Brown is getting on with his life.
Brown, 24, spends two days a week visiting patients with spinal
injuries. He will graduate from Texas A&AMP;M in May with a degree in
economics, and on Christmas he became engaged to longtime
girlfriend Kerrie Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart was replaced for the
second week in a row by Mike Tomczak because of ineffectiveness,
but Stewart refused to accept blame for the Steelers' continuing
offensive malaise. Word is that Stewart and coordinator Ray Sherman
have been at odds much of the season, and teammates are turned off
by the quarterback's huge ego.
</P>
<P>
   The list
</P>
<P>
   How strong a year is Atlanta Falcons tailback Jamal Anderson
having in '98? His 1,743 yards represent the 14th-best performance
in NFL history. He needs 75 yards today to earn a spot among this
elite top 10:

   Until Oakland tailback Napoleon Kaufman won the dubious
distinction last year, Barry Sanders led the NFL in rushes for
negative yardage five seasons in a row. Sanders is tied with
Tennessee's Eddie George with a league-high 56 losses this season.

POSTHOLIDAY CROWDS SEEK BARGAINS AND RETURN GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many stores. So little time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are many Christmas sales, so I have very much to
do today,'' said Yoshihito Higashi, a Japanese student visiting New
York City for the holidays. He was breathless with excitement. His
shopping bag, stuffed with Salvatore Ferragamo shoes, jiggled in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He scanned Madison Avenue and, like a sprinter before a race,
began to bounce up and down as he spotted the door to the Crate &AMP;
Barrel store. ``Many stores still,'' Higashi explained in apology
for rushing off. ``Here. Fifth Avenue. Then I am going to SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   On what has traditionally been one of the busiest shopping days
of the year, the streets of mid-Manhattan and suburban shopping
malls filled up only slowly Saturday with bargain hunters and
people bearing gifts to exchange or return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Christmas is very different than the last two,'' said
Wendy Braunstein, manager of the Me Too shoe store in the Roosevelt
Field mall in Garden City, as she waited for a rush of customers.
``I think it's retail in general. People are not spending as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But hopes were high. At the Westchester, a mall in White Plains,
parking lots were about three-quarters full by early afternoon.
``The big thing today is turning around the returns into positive
sales _ making the return an exchange,'' said Bruce Embree, the
manager of Nordstrom's.
</P>
<P>
   He said sales appeared to be running about the same as on the
day after Thanksgiving, another traditionally heavy shopping day.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Christmas brings a flood of sales at many stores,
but many shoppers said they had become numb to the pitches because
so many sales are offered throughout the year. What appeared to
draw some people to the shops was the chance, on a weekend day, to
return and exchange holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kapp, sales manager for North and South America for Fogal,
said she was making a few quick late-morning stops at Barneys and
other midtown stores to exchange Christmas presents. But she has
been conservative in her shopping this year, heeding the sales
offers that seem to come every month, and said she bought ``better
but fewer'' items overall.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Ms. Kapp said she had in mind was a round of
shopping. Her plan was to see a movie or two. ``We want to stay
away from the stores,'' she said. ``Who wants to go shopping after
Christmas?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was: lots of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shopped for everyone else and now it's time to shop for
ourselves,'' said Darlene Mooney, who drove from her home in
Brooklyn with a friend to hunt for bargains at Roosevelt Field.
Discounts were on their minds. ``I don't shop at retail prices
anymore,'' said Ms. Mooney. ``Anyone who does is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, business also seemed sluggish at many luxury
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't crowded, really,'' said Jonathan Ephraim, a shopper
who took a spin through Barneys, which was promoting a storewide
postholiday sale. ``I was at Bloomingdale's at 9:15 this morning
and it was empty, although it had pretty much filled up by 10 or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds or no crowds, making the rounds of midtown stores the day
after Christmas is a tradition that many people said they
anticipated with joy and executed with relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No store is safe,'' said Charles Kilby, interrupted for a
brief midshop conversation during his rounds of midtown stores. He
had already hit Tiffany's (in a vain search for his yearly
discounted Christmas card haul), Crate and Barrel and Barneys. He
was on his way to Bergdorf's and the Metropolitan Museum store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we're going to regroup,'' said Kilby, who works for Lycos
in Boston and was visiting his parents in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Christine Amirian, a brand manager for Kraft Foods in
New York, was trying bravely to keep up. The two shared the
shopping bags. ``I'm not quite as avid a shopper as Charles is,''
she said. ``But I was easily convinced to come and see what kind of
carnage I can do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For other shoppers, hitting the day-after-Christmas sales is a
sort of stately and inexplicable ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gourley Jr., a Manhattan bank executive, said he had
been coming to the post-Christmas sale at Brooks Bros. since he was
in prep school. He is now 51 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I bought two suits, a pair of shoes, two shirts, and I
replaced a tie my mother gave me that I didn't like,'' he said as
he emerged, three navy blue Brooks Bros. bags in hand, from the
store on Madison Avenue. ``I spent far less than the regular
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't only the sale that draws him. It is tradition.
``Everyone I went to school with _ the day after Christmas, you go
to Brooks Bros.,'' Gourley said. ``This,'' he added, ``is where you
come to get your button-down shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of loyalty has generally made Dec. 26 the biggest day
of the year for the store, with about 30 percent to 40 percent
higher sales than the busy days before Christmas, Jack Delargy,
senior vice president and general manager of Brooks Bros. And it
could be even better, he added, because the big day fell on a
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should bring in a lot more people from the suburbs because
it's a natural day off for everybody,'' said Delargy, who called in
the entire store staff to work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For stores selling merchandise other than clothes, the day after
Christmas was less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two weeks before Christmas are our busiest time,'' said
Lisa Smith, the manager of the Crate and Barrel store at 59th
Street and Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were offered on holiday-related merchandise _ ``everything
that screams Christmas,'' Ms. Smith said _ but there was no blanket
storewide sale like those that many fashion retailers offer after
Christmas. Nor did she expect exceptionally big crowds of shoppers,
especially since it was a Saturday. ``New Yorkers,'' Ms. Smith
said, ``leave town.''

E.W. ETCHELLS, 87, BOAT BUILDER AND YACHTSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Conn., Vt.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E.W. ``Skip'' Etchells, a boat builder and world champion
yachtsman, died last Sunday in Memorial Hospital in Easton, Md. He
was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Most yacht racing is done in one-design sailboats, all built to
a specific design so that the outcome rests with the skill of the
crew rather than the builder.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and the 1950s, Etchells dominated international
competition in the one-design Star Class. In the 1960s, he created
a new one-design yacht, the Etchells 22, now known as the
International Etchells Class. Etchells built Stars for 30 years and
Etchells 22s for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, with his wife, Mary, as crew, he won the Star Class
world championship. She is the only woman to have won a world title
in this popular boat. Skip Etchells won the 1959 North American
Star Class and many U.S. and international championships. Some
victories came on Long Island Sound, where one-design racing is
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood Widmer Etchells was born July 5, 1911, in Philadelphia
and raised in Trenton, N.J. At the University of Michigan he won
three consecutive Big Ten titles in the discus throw. He graduated
in 1936 with a degree in naval architecture and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He started designing boats and during World War II he helped
build destroyers and icebreakers for the Navy. After the war, he
worked in New York for Sparkman &AMP; Stephens, the well-known yacht
designers. After two years, he founded Old Greenwich (Conn.) Boat
Co., which became a leading builder of Stars, Lightnings and other
one-design boats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 and 1966, the International Yacht Racing Union held a
competition in Kiel, Germany, to choose a new three-man keelboat
for the Olympics. The six entries included an Etchells-designed
craft 30 feet 6 inches long, with a wooden hull covered with
fiberglass. Although it won 10 of the 13 races, the officials chose
a 27-foot Soling.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointed Etchells said only, ``The various sponsors never
were called upon to present their plans or arguments.'' But sailors
around the world praised his yacht, and he started production of
the class that he called the Etchells 22 because the boat's
waterline length is 22 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The design's first national championship was held in 1968.
Etchells won it and sailed in Etchells 22 races throughout the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Skip and Mary Etchells retired to Easton. He is
survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Mary O'Toole; a son,
Tim of Middlebury, Vt.; a daughter, Anne Nieusma of Easton, and
three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Etchells, a senior editor of the magazine Mountain Sports
and Living, said his father would be remembered for designing
``very fast boats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Etchells 22 is probably the fastest keelboat of its length
before or since,'' the son said. ``In addition to being fast, it's
a delight to sail. Last summer, more than 100 of them sailed in the
world championship in Marblehead, Mass. There were 15 Olympic
champions in the fleet. The Etchells Class is a nice legacy to
him.''

 IN AFTERMATH OF BUS CRASH, SHOCK OF GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With cracked ribs and an injured spleen, 72-year-old Louis Weiss
was ``sore all over'' on Saturday. Yet he told his doctors at
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., to
release him by Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He has to bury his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Louis and Shirley Weiss were one of four couples ripped apart on
the road on Christmas Eve when the bus they were riding from
Brooklyn for a day of gambling in Atlantic City hurtled off the
Garden State Parkway in New Jersey and flipped several times before
landing at the bottom of an embankment. Shirley, 70, was among the
eight people killed, most of whom are to be buried Sunday. Louis
was among the 15 _ including the driver, Valentin Viner _ who were
hospitalized with injuries, many of them critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would tell me this is a dream,'' Weiss said,
choking back sobs and then letting them run free, crying openly
into the telephone during an interview from his hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that God would help me,'' said Weiss, who, like
most of the victims, is Jewish. ``Every Saturday I prayed to Him in
synagogue. I guess He didn't hear my pleas.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis said that he and Shirley had been married 46 years. They
have two children and four grandchildren, who live in New Jersey.
He was an accountant, she stayed home with the children.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five or six years, they had visited Atlantic City
about once a month, joining other retirees on the buses that depart
daily from Brooklyn, picking up passengers at corner stores and
ferrying them to the shining lights of the casinos and the fresh
ocean breeze of the boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were partners, always, in the slot machines,''
Louis Weiss recalled Saturday. ``We had a lot of fun putting in
four, five, six nickels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we won,'' he said. ``But they took it back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the two-family gray-brick rowhouse where the Weisses have
lived for four decades, marigolds line the front garden. Neighbors
said that Louis, a World War II veteran, is active in the Knights
of Pythias and in his shul on Avenue O. Shirley was like an aunt to
her neighbor's grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he and his wife were sitting next to each other,
watching the Steve Martin movie ``Roxanne'' on the bus video
screen, until the accident happened. Weiss said Viner is ``a good
driver,'' but that he ``must have been going a little too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone cut him off, I don't know,'' Weiss said. ``He
flew off the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   N.J. state police investigators said Viner told them he lost
control of the bus when he swerved to avoid a patch of ice. Other
witnesses, including two passengers and a driver who was behind the
doomed bus, have said that Viner was speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Viner, 52, emigrated from Moscow, where he was a pilot, about a
decade ago, said a friend, Sarah Peregrina. Neither he nor his
lawyer could be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in fragments, as much from the shock of remembering the
horror as from the shot of pain medication he had just received,
Weiss had only a hazy half-recollection of events when he spoke of
the accident Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hydroplaning,'' he said. ``Like I had wings. The bus took off.

 &HT;    Run missing in Miami
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Their air attack working superbly against the Super
Bowl champions on Monday night, the Miami Dolphins' ambition this
afternoon at the Georgia Dome is to establish a running game
against one of the NFL's best run-stopping teams, the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes for an interesting clash, particularly since
starting back Karim Abdul-Jabbar has suffered from concussions for
the last two games. And so, rookie John Avery likely will be thrust
into a starting role. And even he missed a workout on Wednesday
because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have stacked the line of scrimmage against Miami, their
obvious intent being to stop the run and force the Dolphins'
offense to survive solely on the arm of Dan Marino. That tactic
didn't work Monday night, for Marino was stellar in throwing for
four touchdowns in Miami's victory over Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, the Dolphins' ground game has been mostly
anemic. In the past five games, Miami backs have failed to get 100
yards. And now the Dolphins have to rely on a rookie with a
questionable ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver tried to put somebody in every running lane we have and
they did it,'' Avery said. ``(New Orleans) had three or four guys
waiting for us on the backside for our cutbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons likely will not change anything in trying to contain
Miami's ground game, which was held to just 33 yards by New England
and 36 by Denver. Atlanta is seventh in the league against the run,
thanks largely to a front seven that has been sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that (Miami coach) Jimmy Johnson likes to run the
ball, no matter who is in there,'' Falcons defensive lineman Lester
Archambeau said. ``So, it's up to us to shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9, 190-pound Avery, who has just 45 carries and 112
yards in the previous five games, is excited about his opportunity,
so much so that he said his ankle hardly would keep him out. ``Not
much going to keep me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To take out the Miami running game would be to force Marino to
pass more. That, however, is a short-term solution. Teams that go
deep into the playoffs usually have a running attack that is
effective and consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has so little confidence in its running game that on most
third-and-short situations it passes. ``I think we get in that
situation and we have doubt that we can do it,'' Avery said. ``We
have to get an attitude.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ For four long years, President Alexander G.
Lukashenko has pursued an unlikely obsession: to raise tiny Belarus
from the shards of the sundered Soviet Union and remake it into a
model socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems he has succeeded all too well.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of Lukashenko's labors are evident daily outside the
aptly named Golden Egg, a downtown shop in this city of 1.7
million, where nearly 100 people lined up in foot-stamping cold on
a recent December morning.
</P>
<P>
   Their objective was to get inside the store and buy the allotted
maximum of 20 eggs each.
</P>
<P>
   Most had been waiting for three hours, since the store opened at
8 a.m. ``I can't feel my feet,'' a fur-swaddled woman said. ``This
is Lukashenko's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   She refused to give her name. ``The further away this is
published, the better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one way _ the food rationing, the lines, the
ever-shrinking ruble, the undercurrent of fear _ Minsk in 1998
resembles Moscow eight or nine years ago, not long before the
Soviet Union began to crumble. For Lukashenko, that rare head of
state who openly longs for a Soviet restoration, such problems
could not have come at a worse time.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus' socialism dovetails with a larger ambition Lukashenko
harbors: a merger of Belarus with Russia, thus beginning a
rebuilding of the old Soviet empire. It also would enable him to
seek the new nation's presidency, a plum he recently insisted is
the farthest thing from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such a union, would be hard enough, given that Russia has been
heading in the opposite direction, turning itself into a capitalist
state. It would be harder still if Belarus' stumbling economy
ground to a complete halt, saddling Moscow with the cost of
maintaining another 10 million impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
   But it is something that both governments appear to desire. (On
Christmas Day, Lukashenko and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia
proposed to begin next year to unify the two nations' economies
under a single currency.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also a prospect that elevates Lukashenko from
garden-variety autocrat to a man the West is beginning to watch
with some dismay. For Lukashenko has spent considerable time
stumping in Russia's so-called Red Belt, a devotedly Communist
strip of Russia south of Moscow, and the regions' governors are
frequent visitors to Minsk. He has surfaced in Russian presidential
polls, and few believe his denials of interest in ruling a united
Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Russia's Communists, a politically clumsy and mostly
unpopular faction, Lukashenko might even be a contender _ if he
gained an entry to Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, a charismatic dictator with a handpicked Parliament
and a base of peasant support, still appears concerned enough about
the future to begin shoring up his position. He announced new plans
this month to block his few political opponents and created a
so-called emergency headquarters, charged with restoring staples
like eggs and milk to store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   He also has persuaded the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to withhold judgment on Belarus _ they had all but
renounced any notion of lending more money to the government
earlier this year _ by promising economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   By Western standards, there is a lot to reform. Lukashenko, who
ran a collective farm before entering politics, calls his brand of
economic policy ``market socialism.'' The government owns or
controls much of industry and agriculture, but also allows private
enterprises to exist. In theory, at least, the government side of
the economy competes in the world market as well as with domestic
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Lukashenko has followed a straightforward fiscal
policy: he prints money when the nation runs short, and caps prices
when he thinks they are too high. The result is inflation and
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's controlled from the top,'' said Stanislav
Bahgdankevich, who quit as head of Belarus' national bank in 1995
and now heads an opposition party. ``The private sector is dictated
what to produce, and what price to sell it at. It's a Bolshevik
forced economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The average citizen's monthly income has slumped since July from
$70 to about $40. And that depends on how one measures income: at
last count, there were five separate exchange rates for the
Belarusian ruble, ranging from 91,000 to more than 350,000 per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   At the latter rate _ the one the rest of the world uses to buy
and sell rubles _ a Belarusian millionaire is currently worth about
$3.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus' Gosplan-style network of price controls has fostered a
black market in food, to farmers' ruination. The country's
artificially low prices force farmers to sell their crops at a
loss, while entrepreneurs snap up the food and smuggle it to
Ukraine or Russia, where it is resold for a healthy profit across
the border. It is now illegal to export food without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Belarus' problem is not so much that food is not
available _ privately run markets have abundant supplies of many
staples _ as that Belarusians cannot afford it. In Minsk's
jam-packed public market, state-owned meat vendors this month
offered strips of gristly, bone-ridden beef for 170,000 rubles
(somewhere between 40 cents and $2, depending on the exchange
rate), the price dictated by the state. Directly across the aisle,
private vendors were selling thick, lean steaks for 450,000 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run markets receive their food from collective farms,
many of which lose money and consequently produce poor-quality
goods in low quantities. Private vendors raised their own produce
and meat or bought it from private wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Even 170,000 rubles was too much for one elderly woman, who
refused to give her name but said as she walked away that she lived
on a pension of only 1.5 million rubles a month, about $5 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rulers,'' she said, ``not only Lukashenko. There are
just too many of them. Don't they see what's going on? The fish
rots from the head.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Industry is in no better shape. Westerners buy little, in part
because Belarus factories are so hobbled by economic controls that
they spend little money to modernize and are no longer competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Belarus tried much to sell to the West. The country's
biggest trading partner by far, Russia, is now too hard-pressed
itself to buy many of the nation's televisions and tractors. Yet
factories continue producing.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, many warehouses are stuffed with six months'
supply of goods. Some private ventures, like a Ford Motor Co.
tractor plant in Minsk, have simply shut down most operations for
the duration.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the crisis, Lukashenko declared as recently as
September that the economy was in ``optimal'' condition, and said
last week that the country's gross domestic product will leap an
astounding 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate as the nation's condition might appear, virtually
nobody is writing Lukashenko off. Even opposition leaders here
allow that he remains popular, especially in rural areas. And he
has virtually managed to extinguish serious opposition while
allowing enough critical politicians and newspapers to operate so
that he can deflect accusations by human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single journalist in our country at present has been
arrested,'' Vladimir N. Konoplyov, deputy chairman of Belarus'
Parliament and a friend of the president since boyhood. ``And as to
human rights, what can I say? When I meet voters, I always ask the
crowd, `Tell me, who feels any pressure or deprivation of rights?'
Nobody ever answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring group Human Rights Watch says there may be a
reason for the reticence: last July it issued a thick report
accusing Lukashenko of ``violations of a broad spectrum of basic
civil and political rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations are sometimes permitted, but protestors are
frequently harassed, arrested and occasionally severely beaten.
Some 30 opposition newspapers are published, but their presence is
limited to a few copies at state-owned newsstands, and their
editors are often hauled in for official warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined circulation, journalists insist, is less than
that of the leading state-controlled newspaper in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
   Two reporters for Russian media were arrested last year. One
leading critical paper, Svoboda, was abruptly closed in January. It
reopened under another name, Navina; not long ago, burglars entered
the office and removed hard drives from computers containing the
paper's photographs and databases.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, five opposition political parties operate in Belarus,
but their leading figures often discover suddenly that they are
jobless and unable to find work, and many members are jailed,
albeit usually for short periods, on various charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko wrote a new constitution and installed his own
Parliament in 1996 after winning a referendum on the changes that
international observers say was fraudulent. This month, Lukashenko
sent legislation to the Parliament that would ban from public
office anyone who has been found guilty of even civil offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm involved in opposition activity, my family could
starve,'' said Stanislav Shuskevich, the first president of
post-Soviet Belarus. ``Already in Belarus, I can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lukashenko's popularity rests in part on the absence of
serious opposition, he also has undeniably played smart politics.
He has attributed most of the nation's economic plight to the
Russian breakdown and to the incompetence of aides, some of whom
are periodically dismissed to demonstrate his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   When advisers recently tried to generate revenue by raising the
price of vodka by 75 percent, Lukashenko berated them on national
television, then ordered the salaries of all workers raised by an
amount sufficient to buy a few bottles of vodka monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Such impulsive acts are part of Lukashenko's personality.
</P>
<P>
   He has barred the use of Belarusian, the country's
long-suppressed native tongue, in newspapers and classrooms. He
attributed the poor performance of a Belarusian athlete in the last
winter Olympics to a Western conspiracy. Last year, he unleashed
the government's displeasure on a Spanish restaurant that had the
misfortune of being on his commuting route until it changed its
menu to include Belarusian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the trademarks of a leader who is accustomed to getting
what he seeks. But Belarus will be hard pressed to keep giving.

RAPID DEVELOPMENT REMAKING LOCAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ One township official called the women
who helped organize the Coalition to Save Hopewell Valley
``hysterical housewives.'' Another township board member branded
them a ``feminist menace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the women who first began asking tough questions a year ago
about Merrill Lynch's plans to build a corporate office park here
can soon expect new civility at township committee meetings. Two
coalition members have been elected to the committee and will be
sworn in on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In this once sleepy farming community near Princeton and in
other fast-growing spots across the region, the rapid pace of
development is remaking local politics. It is also causing concern
among developers and local officials who were able to announce
plans with little debate only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Planning board hearings that were poorly attended are now often
packed with residents complaining about the building boom
threatening their way of life. Even some residents who once
welcomed new development to bolster their local tax rolls are
arguing that it is driving their taxes up, not down, because of
increased demands on local services.
</P>
<P>
   In Hopewell, the debate over Merrill Lynch's proposal and the
township's plans to expand sewer service by building an eight-mile
sewer line from Trenton drew hundreds of residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about the future of our town, our whole quality
of life,'' said Marylou Ferrara, 43, a member of the coalition in
Hopewell who won election to the township committee last month in
her first bid for elective office. ``We are one of the last rural
towns in New Jersey, and we are willing to drive 20 minutes to buy
a gallon of milk. But we are not willing to sit in traffic to get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation
Campaign, an advocacy group based in New York City, said she
believes there has been a growing awareness, particularly among
suburban mothers, about the effect of land-use decisions on matters
as varied as traffic, classroom size and water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to connect the dots,'' Ms. Bauer said.
``What used to be considered `not in my back yard' stuff has been
transformed into preserving our communities by preserving our open
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Ferguson, a vice president at Merrill Lynch who is
overseeing the project in Hopewell, said there had been little
public concern when the company built an office complex in nearby
Plainsboro during the 1980s. ``But they were not experiencing some
of the suburban sprawl problems then,'' Ferguson said. ``Now there
are a lot more questions. There is a lot more work that you need to
do to prove to a community that the development you are bringing is
truly a win-win.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over suburban sprawl is also bubbling up as a state
and even national political issue. In November, a half-dozen states
voted on ballot initiatives that would preserve open space.
National environmental groups, like the Sierra Club, have made
anti-sprawl campaigns a top priority. Vice President Al Gore has
spoken several times about the importance of ``smart growth''
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman has tapped into voter
concern about the vanishing landscape, making open-space
preservation a top priority of her second term. She pushed for $1
billion in borrowing to set aside half the state's 2 million
remaining acres of open space during the next 10 years. Voters
overwhelmingly approved the measure in November.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of new local organizations like the Coalition to Save
Hopewell Valley have popped up in the last couple of years,
signaling what environmentalists say is a new movement against
unchecked development.
</P>
<P>
   In Hopewell, almost 900 acres of open fields on Scotch Road near
Interstate 95 had been zoned for industrial/commercial use for
years. But there was little public concern until Merrill Lynch
announced plans last year to build a complex of 3.5 million square
feet of office space, retail outlets and possibly a hotel on 450
acres on the east side of Scotch Road. Just last week, Merrill
Lynch officials acknowledged that they had also purchased 440 acres
of open fields from various farmers and landowners for possible
development on the west side of the road.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While the prospect of a huge office park worries residents, they
expressed even more concern about the township's plans to expand
the sewer line from Trenton. Critics say the plans, which would
expand sewer capacity beyond what Merrill Lynch and the number of
present homeowners need, would encourage too much commercial and
residential development.
</P>
<P>
   Hopewell Township rejected a proposal to install a sewer system
more than 20 years ago, preferring to retain its dependency on
individual septic systems. As a result, it has maintained much of
its rural character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sewers are everything,'' said Leslie Kramer, 39, who led the
effort to create the coalition once she learned about Merrill
Lynch's plans. ``When the sewers come in, development will follow.
There is no going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kramer said she helped organize the coalition to focus
attention on the effect of the Merrill Lynch project and the sewer
line. After she was quoted in the local newspaper, other residents
who shared her concerns called to offer help. Most of the callers
were women like herself with young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really not a women's issue; it is a mom's issue,'' said
Peggy Snyder, 39, the mother of three small children who also
helped organize the coalition. ``I really don't have time for this.
But we are talking about the quality of life and the quality of our
children's' lives. That is what we are fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's organizers pored over zoning maps and sewer
plans, becoming experts on land-use law and issuing bonds for
sewers. They spoke up at planning board and township committee
meetings. The five-member township committee did scale back the
original sewer proposal, but not far enough for the coalition,
prompting members to try to make their case at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition decided to support Jon Edwards, a Democrat who
shared many of its views but had lost a previous race for the
township committee. In the primary, some coalition members wrote in
the name of Ms. Ferrara for the Democratic Party nomination. When
both she and Edwards won nominations, they decided to run jointly
in the general election against the incumbent Republicans, even
though she had been a registered Republican all her life.
</P>
<P>
   They won handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never considered running for political office before,
not even student body president,'' Ms. Ferrara said. ``But this was
an opportunity to bring change.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as she and Edwards prepare to take on their new roles, they
hope to chart a different course for the township because there is
likely to be a majority on the five-member committee sympathetic to
the coalition's concerns. Kathy Bird Maurice, a Republican, has
served on the township committee for two years and has already
aligned herself with them on most development issues.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch plans to break ground on its office complex in the
spring, and a lawsuit is pending over the proposed sewer line from
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   For now, John Hart, a Republican member of the township
committee and Hopewell's mayor, said he was taking a wait-and-see
approach toward the two new officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to come in with guns ablazing,'' said Hart, 45, a
farmer who has lived in Hopewell all his life. ``I am going to sit
back and watch. It is easy to criticize when you are out front.
When you get behind the podium, they will see that it is sometimes
different and you can't always do what you want to do.''

of the city. This team has willed its way from nothing to become
the NFC West champs and national darlings, and when they face the
Dolphins today, a full house in the Georgia Dome will roar its
approval. Shades of 1991 with the Braves? You bet. (Winkeljohn,

HOFSTRA HAS EASY TIME HANDLING GEORGIA TECH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A holiday date at Madison Square Garden. A convincing
victory over an opponent from the prestigious Atlantic Coast
Conference. Hofstra acted as if it accomplished the ordinary
Saturday in demolishing Georgia Tech, 61-42, in the ECAC Holiday
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Craig Claxton of Hofstra simply held the ball as
time ran out, and the Flying Dutchmen shook hands with each other
and then shook hands with the Yellow Jackets as both teams filed
into the locker room. No hugs, no jumps for joy. Business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on the road so much, we said we would treat this as
a home game,'' Hofstra Coach Jay Wright said. ``Since it was a home
game, we expected to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright even put up a sign that read ``attitude'' in the Flying
Dutchmen's locker room at the Garden, just like home. Every Hofstra
player slapped it on the way out, and the team showed plenty of
attitude in harassing Tech into 25 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (6-4), from the glamour-challenged America East
Conference, received a game-high 23 points from smooth-shooting
swingman Norman Richardson. Alvin Jones led Georgia Tech (8-3) with
12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra managed only 6 points in the first 6 minutes 45 seconds
of the second half, and its 12-point halftime lead dwindled to
35-29 after Tech's Jason Collier hit a layup. Roberto Gittens
twisted in a layup and Marc Petit swished a baseline jumper to
stretch Hofstra's cushion to 39-29 with 11:36 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra had refused to give Tech any momentum by taking care of
the ball and sprinkling in a few offensive rebounds to milk the
clock. Richardson hit a 3-pointer at the shot-clock buzzer and
followed with another to give Hofstra a 47-33 lead with 7:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then guard Jason Hernandez was fouled hard by T.J. Vines on a
breakaway. Hernandez made one of two free throws on the
intentional-foul call. Hofstra did not score when it retained
possession, and it lost Claxton, who vomited at the baseline under
the basket. Claxton got sick again at the bench, but even without
its floor leader, Hofstra stepped up its upset bid. Richardson
floated in a 3-pointer from the baseline to make the score 51-33
with 5:53 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Claxton returned to the game a few minutes minutes later,
missing a layup, but Duane Posey scored on the follow to give the
Flying Dutchmen a 55-40 lead at the 3:23 mark. Posey hit a soft
jumper and Richardson dunked off a break to widen the gap to 19
points.
</P>
<P>
   Tech Coach Bobby Cremins called a timeout, but all the
gamesmanship in the world was not going to bail the Yellow Jackets
out of this surprising defeat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the beginning of the second half, Tony Aikins hit a 3-pointer
and Jones followed with a dunk to pull Georgia Tech to within
29-22. Claxton responded for Hofstra with a driving layup to
restore the lead to 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra had taken a 12-point lead at halftime by collecting
eight steals and controlling Tech's mammoth front line.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra refused to be intimidated by Georgia Tech's 66-64
victory over No.7-ranked North Carolina last Tuesday. The Flying
Dutchmen took an 11-9 lead on Hernandez's 3-pointer with 14:52 left
in the half. Posey built the margin to 4 with a put-back after
three offensive rebounds by the Dutchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Yellow Jackets' 6-foot-11-inch center, followed with
a dunk. It was one of the few moments either Jones, or Collier,
Tech's 7-foot power forward, was able to use his height advantage.
Hofstra, without a player taller than 6-8 on the floor, used simple
man-to-man defense and darting hands to limit Jones to 6 points and
Collier to none (on 0-for-4 shooting) in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jones and Collier showed fatigue whenever the pace
quickened. The smaller Dutchmen appeared energized. Richardson
scored 5 straight points to build Hofstra's lead to 18-13.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech has had a wild couple of weeks. On Dec. 13 the
Yellow Jackets rallied to beat Georgia, a game that Cremins said
was one of the most exciting in his 18 seasons at Georgia Tech.
Three days later, they had trouble defeating Wofford.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, Tech suffered a 41-point loss to then-No. 3
Kentucky, and then came the stunning victory over North Carolina.
Against the Tar Heels, the secret was that Tech committed a
season-low eight turnovers and fouled just nine times. Tech also
has shown resilience with three overtime victories over New
Orleans, Appalachian State and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yellow Jackets' mercurial season should come as no
surprise. They have two sophomores, two juniors and a freshman in
their starting lineup. Guard Dion Glover, their leading scorer last
year at 18.3 points a game, is out for the season with a torn
ligament in his left knee. Their leading scorer now, Collier (18.8
points a game), has played only four games since becoming eligible
after transferring from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech defeated Hofstra, 58-47, in the 1996 Holiday
Festival before losing to St. John's in the final, 67-55. The
Yellow Jackets won the 1993 tournament. Cremins, a native New
Yorker, brought his first New York-free roster to the Garden.

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: ADDS first item on competitive balance.) 
 (JT) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each astonishing signing by a high-revenue club this off
season, the lament has grown louder: The day the 1999 season
begins, half the teams, if not more than half, will not have a
chance to win a spot in next October's playoffs. Gene Orza wonders
when that fact of major league life has not existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was it not true?'' asked Orza, the players association's
No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory check supports his point. Baseball history has
been filled with teams that didn't have a chance from the opening
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-year period from 1934 through 1968, the franchise now
known as the Oakland Athletics finished in the second division, the
lower half of the league standing, 33 times. The Washington
Senators (later the Minnesota Twins) finished in the second
division 24 times in a 28-year period from 1934 through 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 59 years of the franchise now known as the
Baltimore Orioles, the team finished in the second division 47
times. It finished first once, as the St. Louis Browns in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs played for 20 successive seasons, 1947 through
1966, without emerging from the second division. The Philadelphia
Phillies wound up in the lower half of the standings 45 times in
the 56 seasons from 1918 through 1973.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, the Yankees won 22 pennants in
29 years, from 1936 through 1964, and 29 pennants in 44 seasons,
from 1921 through 1964. In a shorter period, a 10-year stretch from
1947 through 1956, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished first six times.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals won nine pennants and finished in the
first division nine other times in the 21-season stretch from 1926
through 1946. In each of the next three years they finished second.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' dominance prompted their opponents to vote for the
implementation of the draft of amateur players, beginning in 1966,
but these days nonplaying baseball people view the predraft times
as the good old days. Salaries in those times were not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The players association, not unexpectedly, views recent
developments differently from Major League Baseball officials,
owners and general managers.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1976, Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, decried
the advent of free agency, warning that it would wreck competitive
balance. The fact that no team repeated as World Series champion
from 1978 until 1993 presumably did not alter Kuhn's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Four commissioners later, the people on the management side of
the competitive fence say growing payroll disparity is wrecking
competitive balance. Bud Selig, the current commissioner, has made
the issue his No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the players' representatives become uncomfortable when
owners start mentioning competitive balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive balance does not deserve to be uttered with a view
toward what it really means,'' Orza said. ``Competitive balance is
a code for restraining payroll levels. That's what it means
historically. They've been using that term for the last 20 years.
They don't mean competitive balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials and owners point to the 1998 experience to support
what they say they mean. None of the 17 teams with payrolls under
$48 million reached the playoffs. Only two of those teams, St.
Louis and Toronto, had winning records. Of the 13 teams above that
payroll plateau, only Baltimore had a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   And they see the trend becoming more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are payrolls going up, but they're also going down,''
Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's vice president for baseball
operations, warned last month. ``We lose sight of the fact that
there are some clubs that are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins last week became a case for Alderson's
point. Proclaiming they could not compete in the current economy,
the Twins said they would slash their payroll from a season-ending
$24.5 million to a figure between $10 million and $15 million. The
Montreal Expos had last season's lowest payroll, $8,317,500.
</P>
<P>
   Orza said no one should be surprised that payroll disparity
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who bought into a system that says New York and Los Angeles
shouldn't spend more than Montreal?'' he asked. ``This notion that
the goal of baseball should be to create a balance by which all the
teams, no matter what their population base, what fan support they
have, however well marketed and run they are, should have an equal
chance to win the World Series isn't realistic. It's just the way
it is. There always will be disparities.''
</P>
<P>
   When owners buy teams, he added, they understand the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't say at owners meetings, `Because I have only
400,000 people available for local TV and you have seven million,
I'm going to want your money,' '' Orza said. ``They say, `Let me in
and I'll compete with you and beat your brains out.' Then when they
don't win, they say: `It's not because I run a bad franchise or
made mistakes. It's the other guy has an unfair edge over me
because I'm in Montreal and they're in New York.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The owners will continue to lament payroll disparity, but they
obviously should not expect a sympathetic ear from the players
association.
</P>
<P>
   A POX ON SEVERAL HOUSES
</P>
<P>
   The toughness that players show in games and that agents display
in contract negotiations evidently does not carry over to verbal
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Houston Astros recently had the audacity to
make some unflattering comments about the bargaining position of
Roger Clemens and his agent, Randy Hendricks, and Clemens and
Hendricks reacted as if they were going to take their bat and ball
and go home. Maybe age has thinned their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Clemens business has become a fiasco, for the Astros,
for the Toronto Blue Jays, for the five-time Cy Young award winner,
for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Blue Jays gave Clemens a double-edged sword by
agreeing to let him have the right to not only request a trade but
also veto a trade. He could dictate where the Blue Jays could trade
him while they were under the pressure of having to trade him if he
so wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Second, once Clemens asked to be traded, the Astros, his
hometown team, became the most likely team to get him. The only
trouble was that the Astros, in this instance, started to resemble
the Yankees: one hand, in this case Gerry Hunsicker, the general
manager, apparently didn't know what the other hand, Drayton McLane
Jr., the owner, was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker publicly expressed outrage over the terms Clemens
sought for a revised contract before he would approve a trade, only
to have McLane, who had been negotiating with Hendricks, apologize
to Clemens and Hendricks for Hunsicker's remarks. It's always good
for organizational unity when the owner panders to a player instead
of supporting his general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Clemens looks bad because of his effort to get an
additional $27.4 million for one year _ a $15 million salary for an
added third year, the rest as a signing bonus divided evenly over
the three years of the contract. It has prompted people to believe,
correctly or not, that his trade request had more to do with money
than with his desire to play with a contender or closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Major League Baseball looks bad because its president
and chief operating officer, Paul Beeston, was the Blue Jays'
president last winter who held out Toronto's deal-clinching carrot
to Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston now faces a hefty fine for not submitting the agreement
with Clemens' contract. Beeston, an upstanding and outstanding
official, has been forthright internally about his role and will
accept his punishment. But it is embarrassing for him and for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, the Blue Jays have compounded the matter by ignoring
established guidelines and allowing Clemens and his agent to speak
with other clubs before a trade was completed. Gord Ash, the Blue
Jays' general manager, has acknowledged that he did not ``follow
the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN'S BIG COUP
</P>
<P>
   Did the Los Angeles Dodgers really give Kevin Brown a seven-year
contract for $105 million? Information circulating in the upper
echelon of baseball has it that the next best offer Brown had was
$65 million for five years from the Colorado Rockies, even though
Scott Boras, the pitcher's agent, may say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out to secure the richest contract in baseball
history, Boras made much of Brown's effort in helping two different
teams reach the World Series in successive seasons. But he omitted
Brown's contribution in the World Series itself. In four starts for
Florida and San Diego, Brown had a 0-3 record _ his teams lost all
four games _ and a 6.04 earned run average, allowing 40 base
runners in 251/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   USING THE YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Belle was a free agent last month, he was talking
seriously with the Yankees, whose presence in a bidding war is
always beneficial to a player. How does Belle really feel about
playing for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   In the contract he signed with Baltimore, he was given a
complete no-trade provision for the first three years, and for the
last two years he was able to list eight teams he can be traded to:
Anaheim, Arizona, Atlanta, Colorado, San Diego, Seattle, St. Louis
and Texas. Somehow he left out the Yankees.

 &HT;    Falcons are still reaching for goals
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons fans long ago grew tired of games like today's
season finale against the Miami Dolphins, a meaningless contest
where the home team is playing for nothing, with no chance to
advance in the standings and no reason to fight to the finish in
hopes of securing a playoff bid.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the Georgia Dome sold out today?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (13-2), have become fun to watch while rendering
this game unimportant for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta already has won the NFC West and locked up a bye in the
first round of the playoffs and a home date with either Dallas,
Green Bay or San Francisco in the second week of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   So why lay it on the line today against a 10-5 Miami team that
will play all-out in an attempt to win a home playoff game of its
own?
</P>
<P>
   There are goals, like the team's first undefeated record at home
and a record-tying nine-game winning streak. And there's a mind-set
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our incentive is to maintain what got us here,'' said
defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, who is interim head coach while
Dan Reeves recuperates from quadruple heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fall off before the playoffs,'' Brooks said.
``We have to keep on trucking, and playing hard. Playing another
team that is going to be in the playoffs ... really, it's kind of
an extension of the playoffs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, such as left defensive end Lester Archambeau,
could use some time off. He still has two pins sticking out of the
skin near his broken left thumb, which is in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about this game not meaning something. It means a
ton,'' Archambeau said. ``Anytime you can go into the postseason
with some momentum, it's going to carry you. We'll have a week off
after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was released from the hospital Thursday. Team officials
say he's not supposed to be at the Dome today. In a season where
surprising developments have become the norm, it wouldn't be a
shock if he makes an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, today figures to be difficult. Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson is very good at getting his squad ready for big games.
He'll bring the NFL's No. 2 defense to town, a young and quick unit
that limited Denver, the AFC's No. 1 offense, to 219 yards in the
Dolphins' 31-21 win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it may end up looking like a normal game because, like
quarterback Chris Chandler said, ``It's a Sunday in the football
season, and that means you go out to play to win.

 &HT;    Even '74 Marino great
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Arduous research has shown that there have been only
nine coaches over the last 25 years who defeated a Dan
Marino-quarterbacked team more than once in a season. And, believe
me, I am honored to share the company of an illustrious roll call
that includes Bill Parcells, Marv Levy, Raymond Berry, Marty
Schottenheimer, Joe Walton, Ron Meyer, Pete Carroll and Bruce
Coslet.
</P>
<P>
   For the better portion of 16 NFL seasons those coaches have
watched Marino _ who makes his first and likely final appearance in
the Georgia Dome this afternoon _ from a sideline vantage point.
For those 16 years, and the four before them when he played at
Pitt, I scrutinized him through binoculars, usually with my elbows
resting on a laptop computer. This bond, however, we share: It was
just as difficult designing a game plan to counter Marino more than
two decades ago, when he was starring for St. Regis Elementary
School in Pittsburgh, as it was for Falcons coordinator Rich Brooks
and his staff over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow we pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1974 and two buddies and I coached the junior high
team at St. Joseph Elementary School. The endeavor helped me score
points with the team nurse, now my wife of 24 years, and kept a
neighborhood school we all had attended from disbanding its
floundering football program and spending the bingo money on
textbooks. Two years out of college, it was a good excuse not to
look for a real job.
</P>
<P>
   Our expertise was about as short as the AstroTurf-carpeted
80-yard surface of Dean's Field, where we played our home games,
but at least we were long on good intentions. And every season we
managed to develop a couple of solid prospects for Central Catholic
High School, the beloved alma mater that Marino and I share.
</P>
<P>
   The scores from those '74 titanic struggles between rival junior
highs representing the adjacent East Side neighborhoods of
Bloomfield (mine) and Oakland (Marino's) are irrelevant. And
because the Pittsburgh Catholic League collapsed years ago, ending
the superb feeder system that fueled Pittsburgh's private high
schools, the records have been forever lost.
</P>
<P>
   This much, though, the ravages of 24 years of brain-cell
deterioration and 20 seasons of trying to make deadline have not
purged from my memory banks: In '74, we somehow defeated Dan
Marino's team twice, that despite the fact he was an incredible
player.
</P>
<P>
   How good was Marino at age 13? Good enough that, as an
eighth-grader, he certainly could have beaten out any quarterback
Central Catholic coach Joe Scully had playing on the varsity squad
at the time. Good enough that, everywhere St. Regis played that
year, large crowds showed up to watch Marino and the home team
always banked a few bucks more when it passed the hat at halftime.
Good enough to be a hometown legend before he ever picked up a
razor for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough that, on the two occasions we played St. Regis, the
coaching staff sent a letter home to the parents of our players,
apprising them that practices would run at least an hour longer
that week. Because of Marino, and an incredibly convoluted offense
designed for him by St. Regis coaches Shorty Mafeo and Chick
Sciulli, the floodlights at Dean's Field burned late into the night
as we tried to devise a defense that might hold him under 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   Once we even dispatched a spy to Frazier Field, where St. Regis
played its home games, hoping to infiltrate a practice session. The
gambit failed, likely because our would-be saboteur suffered from
asthma and the field, since renamed Dan Marino Field, overlooked
the blast furnaces of the Jones &AMP; Laughlin steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   So we plotted against a St. Regis passing game that featured
flea-flickers and double reverses, all of which ended with the ball
in Marino's hands. We schemed against a run game whose staple was
the old Statue of Liberty play. And somehow _ maybe Marino had a
debilitating attack of acne those two weeks _ we defeated St. Regis
twice.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, when I visited my two sideline compadres in
Pittsburgh, we tried to convince ourselves the outcomes of those
games were the result of seamless coaching. But we all knew better.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the '74 season ended, our staff was chosen,
largely by default, to head the East squad in the annual Catholic
League all-star game. Our quarterback, of course, was Marino and
our instructions to him were something along the lines of: ``Here's
the ball, Danny, throw it as much as you want.''
</P>
<P>
   That minimalist approach backfired and we lost the game. Given
that Don Shula had the benefit of Marino's brilliance for 13 years,
though, and never won a Super Bowl game, I don't feel so bad. Give
me Marino now, and the experience of watching 20 years of some
dubious NFL coaching decisions, and I'd probably win that all-star
game.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the all-star game, Marino went on to Central
Catholic and I moved on to writing about the game he has played so
well. For four years _ one of which included a season when my
younger brother, Joe, served as his right tackle _ I watched Marino
hone his skills. And when he was at Pitt, I documented some of his
deeds. Now that it appears he'll play a few more seasons, there
will be even more opportunities to watch him turn back the clock,
as he did last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Dan Marino hasn't forgotten the people he met on
the way up. He is _ and this is the highest honor I bestow on
anyone _ the consummate Pittsburgh Guy.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man whose private graciousness outshines even his public
performances. When his son, Michael, was discovered to be autistic,
he helped raise funds for a program at the Miami Children's
Hospital to offer comprehensive care for similarly challenged kids.
Earlier this year, he and wife Claire added to their own brood of
four by adopting daughter Niki Lin, a 2-year-old Chinese orphan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins played in Pittsburgh a few years ago, Danny
ducked out of the locker room for a few minutes to visit with my
brother, whom he hadn't seen in years. Since I'm begging off
today's contest at the Dome to spend some time with my family and
gear up for weeks on the road at the playoffs, I won't get a chance
to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   But if I did, the message would be this simple one: Thanks,
Danny, for the memories.

and the politics that engulfs them 2000 years later, the sites
where Christ was born, lived and died are still powerful ``faith
strengtheners'' for millions of Christians world wide. Visits to
the region by Christians _ and they comprise about 75 percent of
Israel's 2.3 million annual tourists _ remind them that Jesus was
human and the ideals he practiced can be practiced by others. The
physical sites still make Jesus' story real. Christian
denominations have picked their favorite spots. Catholics come to
Jerusalem's Old City, where they often rent wooden crosses and walk
the supposed path Jesus took with his cross. Traditional
Protestants gravitate toward the Church of the Nativity and
Evangelicals head for prayer nearby in the Shepherd's Fields.

 &HT;    Beazer shapes a financial plan
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beazer Homes has no intention of getting caught in a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case one happens next year, the Atlanta-based builder is
fine tuning a strategy that includes gaining market share through
acquisition, taking short-term options on land rather than risking
ownership, exploring niche markets, avoiding duplications of
competitors' products and rewarding employees for saving money
internally.
</P>
<P>
   That sits well with analysts such as David Dwyer of Salomon
Smith Barney. He believes that consolidations will overcome the
effects of a 1999 slowdown, assuming market fundamentals like
interest rates and inventories stay low and buyer commitments stay
high.
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes' share price has jumped nearly 50 percent during
the past six weeks. When stockholders receive their 1998 annual
reports in the next week or so, they'll understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Shares closed down Thursday at $25.37 1/2, down 31 1/4 cents,
near the 52-week high of $27.12 1/2 reached April 7. The climb has
been steady since Nov. 4, when the nation's eighth-largest builder
reported dramatically improved fourth-quarter earnings and year-end
results. It also announced a significant acquisition in northern
Virginia, Trafalgar House Property, which is expected to take
revenue past $1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Through a joint venture with a Mexican builder, and based on
projections of large increases in the Hispanic population, the
company is targeting the Hispanic market in Texas and potentially
Arizona, Florida and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the 1997 fourth quarter, 1998 net income was up 59
percent, to $12 million from $7.5 million. Income per share came in
at $1.37 in the period ended Sept. 30, against 87 cents in the
prior-year quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Dec. 2, Beazer Homes revealed its entry into an
experimental niche for a home builder _ the never-land of apartment
renters _ by announcing an Atlanta venture with Chicago-based
Equity Residential Properties Trust, a large real estate investment
trust with several apartment complexes in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, an exclusive arrangement called ``rent with
equity,'' is intended to allay the renter's chronic anxiety that
rent is money down the drain. An Equity Residential Properties
tenant paying, say $1,000 a month for an apartment, would have 25
percent of that payment credited toward the purchase of a
Beazer-built house, to a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of
the home.
</P>
<P>
   1999 earnings estimate
</P>
<P>
   By the time January ends, results for the first fiscal 1999
quarter, which ends Dec. 31, will be ready for release. Wall Street
looks for Beazer Homes to report 44 cents a share, against 14 cents
per share in the first 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Ivy Zelman expects 45 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman, who has a ``hold'' rating on the stock, has raised her
fiscal 1999 earnings estimate twice since Beazer Homes' year-end
report: from $3.25 to $3.70 and, in early December, to $3.75. First
Call's consensus estimate for 1999 is $3.62. The company earned
$2.66 in 1998, so meeting either estimate would represent at least
a 36 percent year-over-year increase.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it would cap a brisk ride for a company that went
public in England in 1971, branched into the United States in 1985,
separated from the parent and became publicly held here in 1994. It
would also underscore what Ian McCarthy, chief executive officer
and president, says: ``We have posted a 30 percent annual growth
rate in closings during the past three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beazer Homes now builds entry-level and move-up houses in 12
Southern and Western states and, by virtue of the Trafalgar House
acquisition, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, McCarthy indicated that the Trafalgar
House deal could also be enhanced by Beazer Homes' year-old
in-house mortgage operation that he said added $2 million to fourth
quarter 1998 profits .
</P>
<P>
   He further said its design center _ which allows buyers to
select upgrades for their houses _ added another $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure against overhead eating into profits, expenses are
controlled partly through a thin corporate staff. Only 35 people
work in the company's north Atlanta headquarters. The rest of the
1,200 or so employees work in sales, management and construction at
construction sites in the metro area and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are in great financial shape. We continue to be
among the most conservatively financed builders,'' said David
Weiss, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Trafalgar House acquisition, the company increased its
debt-to-capital ratio to 55 percent from 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After analyst Steve Percoco of Lark Research expressed minor
concerns about that, the company said its $200 million line of
credit is set for four years, which would enable it to withstand a
liquidity crunch that might make it hard for privately held
builders to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Beazer Homes controls enough land to last for three
years. Half is owned, half is under option because, McCarthy said,
``we want to work our assets and turn them fast to limit
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Increase in backlogs
</P>
<P>
   Backlogs, or homes under contract but not actually closed and
occupied, soared 73 percent to 2,057, year over year, at the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Builders tend to regard such increases in backlog as birds in
the hand because buyers have made a commitment to buy the new home.
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts, including Percoco, point out that those
buyers do not necessarily have their mortgages approved and, he
says, ``if there is a dislocation in the market or the economy, you
could have increased cancellations. Your view of backlog should
depend on where that buyer is in the (home-buying) process.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, home building has enjoyed strong order growth, but
closings have been slower to grow. This, in Percoco's mind, has
contributed to the increases in backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Weiss and McCarthy maintain that Beazer Homes is
conservatively managed. Since the initial public offering, there
has been only one setback, one McCarthy says the business press
overinflated. It was reported during fiscal year 1997 involving a
$6.3 million inventory write-off of Nevada properties and a
decrease in closings and average sales prices in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The company has regained whatever ground was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, home-building stocks have outperformed the Russell
2,000, an index of smaller-capitalized companies. But they have
underperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which represents the
broader market. In October, there was a general decline, then a
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top 10 home-building stocks have not followed. With
its notable share-price increase, Beazer Homes is _ at least for
now _ one exception to the rule. Pulte Corp. and Kaufman &AMP; Broad
Homes are the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of its goals to increase sales and profits may be
tough to accomplish during this stage of the cycle, says analyst
Percoco, ``from a strategic perspective, this company is very well
positioned.''

LITIGATION AGAINST LOS ANGELES POLICE COSTLY FOR TAXPAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The city has identified 300 pending lawsuits
against the Los Angeles Police Department as the tip of a
litigation iceberg that is costing taxpayers tens of millions of
dollars a year, according to computer-generated records obtained by
the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever compilation of LAPD litigation by City Attorney
James Hahn's office for the Police Department and its oversight
commission is the initial step in a far-reaching plan to identify
every department's exposure in an effort to reduce payouts that
since 1992 have cost the city more than $322 million.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the city had little idea what its exposure might be
at any given time, even as police payouts rose to $26 million in
fiscal year 1994 before settling back to about $12 million in
fiscal 1998 _ still about six times the annual payments in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The new window into the LAPD shows just how extensive a problem
litigation has become since the 1991 Rodney King beating by police
officers and its subsequent $3.8 million payout.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an aggressive risk management program, the LAPD
continues to account for about one-third of all city settlement and
judgment payouts, which have totaled $109 million since fiscal
1993, according to city attorney records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not satisfied,'' said police Cmdr. David Kalish. ``We
have to identify the areas that create the greatest risk and to
reduce our future liability. We live in a litigious society, and
the department must be proactive in addressing risk management.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a six-year average, the Police Department has paid out
about $17.4 million annually, followed by street maintenance at
$8.4 million, engineering at $5.7 million, transportation at $4.1
million, sanitation at $3.2 million, the city clerk at $3.1
million, and recreation and parks at $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the payouts will amount to about $42 million
citywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still too high,'' Hahn said. ``We have to get all the
departments involved from the claim stage. Right now there is too
much of a focus on single cases. The City Council looks at the big
cases and the big dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The city still does not have a state-of-the-art system to track
litigation in most departments. General managers also have not
acted aggressively enough on available information to improve
practices to avoid lawsuits, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The City Attorney's and Mayor's offices are proposing a claims
board, which has the support of both the elected and appointed
Charter Reform Commissions, to involve more of the city in making
decisions on litigation and payouts. The mayor in particular would
have more influence.
</P>
<P>
   A new risk management executive committee made up of department
representatives also has met for a year under the chief
administrative officer's oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Barring rapid improvements in all departments, though, Hahn said
he is prepared to recommend far harsher remedies, including
charging departments directly for settlement and judgment payments.
</P>
<P>
   Police litigation has taken center stage as a new city
attorney's police division with 29 lawyers is scheduled to start
work on the pending 300 cases and all new police litigation Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting settlement and judgment payouts, the
department hopes to reduce its use of outside law firms, which have
been paid more than $5 million on police litigation alone since
fiscal 1995, according to city records.
</P>
<P>
   The division will work with LAPD risk managers, who will
concentrate on identifying and minimizing risk through officer
training, identifying trends of behavior, tracking risky personnel,
holding supervisors accountable for failing to curb high-risk
actions and the application of appropriate discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The tabulation of 300 cases provides much better detail than the
LAPD previously had on litigation trends.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits include 25 police shootings, which carry some of
the highest exposure ratings. Exposure does not indicate liability
or wrongdoing, but rather what a jury might award, usually based on
experience with similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 182 lawsuits allege civil rights violations, including
use of force and unlawful searches. Assault and battery or false
imprisonment account for 54 cases, while 83 other plaintiffs have
sued for damages as the result of traffic crashes. The remaining
cases are unclassified.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20 cases rated as having a high exposure, which means
an exposure to a jury award of more than $500,000 per case, or
above $10 million total, according to the city attorney's rating
scale. That number includes one case that is headed to trial after
the City Council recently refused to settle it for $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some 53 cases are rated at medium exposure, while the remainder
carry a low rating or are unrated, according to the records.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff attorneys contend that high numbers of lawsuits and
large payouts remain a measure of the LAPD's failure to
sufficiently reform itself in accordance with Christopher
Commission recommendations.

LOS ANGELES: Commission recommendations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney Beatrice Royster, whose client Damien Deshay Burris was
released after 5 1/2 months in jail on a murder charge, questions
the significance of the LAPD's attempt to get a handle on
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much of a change in the department,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Royster said charges against Burris were dropped after new
detectives were assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The City Attorney's Office, without admitting any wrongdoing,
has said the case carries a high exposure. The first civil trial
resulted in a hung jury, with a second scheduled early next year,
Royster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They locked this guy up for months, then other detectives
investigate and he's out,'' she said. ``Their approach is to ruin
his reputation rather than look at their investigative
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's attorney in the case, Marsha Berkowitz, said she
could not comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Yagman's Venice law firm is suing LAPD
officers, as well as the council and other city officials in
connection with shootings involving the LAPD's Special
Investigation Section. He said the department has not reformed
because it refuses to recognize that anything is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no improvement,'' said Yagman, who contends the
SIS has acted like ``death squads'' in waiting for criminals to
commit crimes before swooping in on them, sometimes resulting in
shootouts and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the SIS cases are rated with high and medium
exposure, but Deputy City Attorney Cory Brente said the tactics
used are defensible and the shootings unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shootings are up to the criminal,'' Brente said. ``Who (on
the Police Department) wants to shoot anyone, to be called death
squads, killers, murderers? Who wants that?''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the department determines an officer acted beyond
the scope of his duties, it can recommend against legal
representation, and the officer is left to pay for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. David Louis Navarro, a former Foothill Division officer,
was denied city representation after pleading no contest July 2,
1997, to four counts of assault under color of authority in
connection with the sexual assaults of several minor girls,
attorneys involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The city recently paid more than $1.2 million to settle the case
and is in the process of filing a cross-complaint against Navarro,
said Assistant City Attorney Philip Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Encino attorney Karyn Shatzkin said the case was outrageous on
its face, but that the city failed to monitor Navarro's fitness for
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar said research indicated there are no reliable tests to
predict sexual assaults. Navarro, who was fired, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said isolated cases, and even litigation in general,
should not be the sole barometer of LAPD reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are anomalies,'' he said. ``There are much more
scientific ways to evaluate the improvement in the organization,
including citizen surveys.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Attorney's Office continues to grapple with its
litigation strategy, particularly what cases to take to court and
which ones to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't uncomfortable with giving out $1 million,'' said
Thomas Hokinson, chief assistant city attorney. ``Twenty years ago,
$100,000 was a large amount for a case.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has been for the City Attorney's Office to try fewer
cases, in part because there is a smaller backlog of cases under
the present fast-track system of handling cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the office tried 78 cases, losing 20 of them at a cost
of $5.8 million. Last year, the number of trials dipped to 17, with
two losses amounting to $2.9 million in payouts.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1990 the office settled 87 cases for $5.9
million, compared with 100 settled for $7.5 million in 1997.

VIKINGS SET SEASON SCORING RECORD IN WIN OVER OILERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It looked like a team that had clinched everything _
the playoffs, home field advantage, team and individual honors _ a
team that had everything going for it on the road against a team
whose season blew up long ago. It looked like the Minnesota
Vikings, down by 13-8 at halftime against the Tennessee Oilers,
needed a collective jolt, something to spark the day, something to
make this matchup more intense. More urgent.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings found it in the third quarter. That is their
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings took the opening kickoff in the third quarter and
kicked the Oilers. They drove 76 yards in nine plays and Randall
Cunningham finished it by tossing a 5-yard scoring pass to rookie
Randy Moss. Cunningham-to-Moss earned the 2-point conversion, too,
and the Vikings were set, as they went on to a 26-16 victory before
41,121 fans at Dudley Field here at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota toppled Tennessee by 15-3 in the third quarter, and
those points helped the Vikings score the most points in a season
in National Football League history (556). Those points gave
Minnesota a 139-58 scoring advantage in third-quarter play this
season. Minnesota earned a 15-1 regular season record; only the
1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears have reached
15-1 in league history; both went on to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can score on special teams, on defense and on offense,''
said Dennis Green, the Vikings head coach. ``The scoring record we
earned today is a team record. We made enough plays in the second
half and Randall Cunningham played a solid game. The offense came
around, but we always have a fast-starting defense. We have a team
that plays together. That makes me most proud.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth victory in a row for the Vikings, who are now
set for the National Football Conference playoffs, with a bye next
weekend. The NFC road to the Super Bowl must now go through
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that our talent level is not that much
different from that team,'' said Oilers rookie cornerback Samari
Rolle, whose team has been stuck at 8-8 for three consecutive
seasons. ``The difference may be in part talent, but it is just as
much in confidence. That is a very confident group. You can tell by
the way they talk before they play. They just believe. They'll
probably win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have already earned history. In this game alone,
three major league records were set.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minnesota scored 556 points this season, breaking the league
record of 541 set by the Washington Redskins in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kicker Gary Anderson scored 10 points Saturday to give him 164
for the season. He surpassed Washington's Mike Moseley (161 in
1983) as the highest scoring kicker for a single season. Anderson
also completed a perfect season in field goals (35 of 35) and in
extra points (59 of 59). His final field goal stretched his NFL
record of consecutive field goals to 40 over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moss and Cris Carter, the Vikings receivers, who each scored
touchdown catches today, set a new record for most touchdowns by a
receiving duo (28 _ Moss with 17 and Carter with 11).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exciting ballgame against the elite in the National
Football League,'' said Oilers Coach Jeff Fisher. He watched as the
Oilers played their last game here at Vanderbilt and their last as
the Oilers. Next year Tennessee will move into a new stadium in the
heart of downtown Nashville and will play as the Tennessee Titans.
``We showed we could play with them for awhile,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' good play, however, lasts longer than awhile,
thanks to the third quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tennessee actually gained more yards in the game (354 to 338)
but the Oilers hurt themselves in third-down conversions (2 of 9
for 22 percent) and in penalties (13 for 105 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was 23 of 35 for 235 passing yards with two
touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 15-1 record is awesome and Dennis Green did an absolutely
great job of coaching,'' Cunningham said. ``It is amazing. We
struggled to put 26 points on the board; we have high expectations
of ourselves. We appreciate times like this when we only score 26
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 points? Yes, in their previous four games, the Vikings
had scored 46 points on Dallas, 48 on Chicago, 38 on Baltimore and
50 on Jacksonville, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like we were capable of playing and we knew it was
going to be a tough week with Christmas and traveling and all of
those things,'' Carter said. ``I think we handled it really well.
The 15-1 record does not matter now. We have home field in the
playoffs and we are 0-0 now. But we are excited about what we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Denver Broncos who started the season with all eyes
on them. Now the Vikings in the regular season have caught and
passed Denver in record and in notoriety. The postseason awaits.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked away Saturday and as Minnesota
secured its spot among the playoff elite, Vikings owner Red
McCombs, his wife, Charlene, and their family stood just outside
the south end zone and savored the special moment. The Vikings
ownership has gone from one of instability to stability in the
McCombs' first year of ownership. That stability at the top has
trickled down to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found here a team that is a team in every sense of the
word,'' said Jimmy Hitchcock, a cornerback who this season joined
Minnesota from New England. ``Every single day, we are a team. It
is a beautiful atmosphere. I thank the McCombs family for coming
into our lives. We lost one game this season, by 3 points at Tampa
Bay. We were 3 points from having a perfect season. But we can
still be perfect by winning the Super Bowl. That is the perfect
goal.''

ANTIAGE _ What would it mean to the world, to our lives, to
politics, economics, culture, if growing old as we know it becomes
a thing of the past? What would happen if an elixir were discovered
that, when injected into the heart, the brain, the liver, the
kidneys, would rebuild old tissue with new cells? Scientists say
that era is at hand. Over the next 20 years, new elixirs are likely
to revolutionize medicine and aging. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TESTS _ As a kid I hated report cards. Now, several decades later,
I still felt nervous as Dr. Charlene DeHaven held my test results
and got a funny look on her face. I knew I was in for it. While my
birth certificate and driver's license say I'm 46, my anti-aging
report card said I should really be putting 52 candles on my cake.
Thank you, Doc. Thank you very much. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will

VEGAS-AGE (Las Vegas, Nev.) _ America's bio-medical community is
closing in at a feverish pace on the secrets of aging and disease.
If its methodical and well-funded approach looks like a NASA moon
shot, be advised that there are also others _ a Wild West fringe
group of anti-aging treatment promoters _ whose Las Vegas gathering
earlier this month at moments looked more like a Star Trek
convention than serious science. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move

SCOTTSDALE (Undated) _ A year after the death of its beloved mayor,
Scottsdale is still basking in the afterglow of Herb Drinkwater's
legacy and pondering ways to memorialize the man in the silver
Stetson. But now, Scottsdale, embroiled in twin scandals and public
squabbling, is getting the kind of headlines Drinkwater would have

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: REPEATING to clarify, first item on competitive balance SUBS
for story slugged BBO-PARITY on sports digest.) 
 (JT) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each astonishing signing by a high-revenue club this off
season, the lament has grown louder: The day the 1999 season
begins, half the teams, if not more than half, will not have a
chance to win a spot in next October's playoffs. Gene Orza wonders
when that fact of major league life has not existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was it not true?'' asked Orza, the players association's
No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cursory check supports his point. Baseball history has
been filled with teams that didn't have a chance from the opening
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-year period from 1934 through 1968, the franchise now
known as the Oakland Athletics finished in the second division, the
lower half of the league standing, 33 times. The Washington
Senators (later the Minnesota Twins) finished in the second
division 24 times in a 28-year period from 1934 through 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 59 years of the franchise now known as the
Baltimore Orioles, the team finished in the second division 47
times. It finished first once, as the St. Louis Browns in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs played for 20 successive seasons, 1947 through
1966, without emerging from the second division. The Philadelphia
Phillies wound up in the lower half of the standings 45 times in
the 56 seasons from 1918 through 1973.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, the Yankees won 22 pennants in
29 years, from 1936 through 1964, and 29 pennants in 44 seasons,
from 1921 through 1964. In a shorter period, a 10-year stretch from
1947 through 1956, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished first six times.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals won nine pennants and finished in the
first division nine other times in the 21-season stretch from 1926
through 1946. In each of the next three years they finished second.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' dominance prompted their opponents to vote for the
implementation of the draft of amateur players, beginning in 1966,
but these days nonplaying baseball people view the predraft times
as the good old days. Salaries in those times were not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The players association, not unexpectedly, views recent
developments differently from Major League Baseball officials,
owners and general managers.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1976, Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, decried
the advent of free agency, warning that it would wreck competitive
balance. The fact that no team repeated as World Series champion
from 1978 until 1993 presumably did not alter Kuhn's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Four commissioners later, the people on the management side of
the competitive fence say growing payroll disparity is wrecking
competitive balance. Bud Selig, the current commissioner, has made
the issue his No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the players' representatives become uncomfortable when
owners start mentioning competitive balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive balance does not deserve to be uttered with a view
toward what it really means,'' Orza said. ``Competitive balance is
a code for restraining payroll levels. That's what it means
historically. They've been using that term for the last 20 years.
They don't mean competitive balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials and owners point to the 1998 experience to support
what they say they mean. None of the 17 teams with payrolls under
$48 million reached the playoffs. Only two of those teams, St.
Louis and Toronto, had winning records. Of the 13 teams above that
payroll plateau, only Baltimore had a losing record.
</P>
<P>
   And they see the trend becoming more severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are payrolls going up, but they're also going down,''
Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's vice president for baseball
operations, warned last month. ``We lose sight of the fact that
there are some clubs that are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins last week became a case for Alderson's
point. Proclaiming they could not compete in the current economy,
the Twins said they would slash their payroll from a season-ending
$24.5 million to a figure between $10 million and $15 million. The
Montreal Expos had last season's lowest payroll, $8,317,500.
</P>
<P>
   Orza said no one should be surprised that payroll disparity
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who bought into a system that says New York and Los Angeles
shouldn't spend more than Montreal?'' he asked. ``This notion that
the goal of baseball should be to create a balance by which all the
teams, no matter what their population base, what fan support they
have, however well marketed and run they are, should have an equal
chance to win the World Series isn't realistic. It's just the way
it is. There always will be disparities.''
</P>
<P>
   When owners buy teams, he added, they understand the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't say at owners meetings, `Because I have only
400,000 people available for local TV and you have seven million,
I'm going to want your money,' '' Orza said. ``They say, `Let me in
and I'll compete with you and beat your brains out.' Then when they
don't win, they say: `It's not because I run a bad franchise or
made mistakes. It's the other guy has an unfair edge over me
because I'm in Montreal and they're in New York.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The owners will continue to lament payroll disparity, but they
obviously should not expect a sympathetic ear from the players
association.
</P>
<P>
   A POX ON SEVERAL HOUSES
</P>
<P>
   The toughness that players show in games and that agents display
in contract negotiations evidently does not carry over to verbal
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Houston Astros recently had the audacity to
make some unflattering comments about the bargaining position of
Roger Clemens and his agent, Randy Hendricks, and Clemens and
Hendricks reacted as if they were going to take their bat and ball
and go home. Maybe age has thinned their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Clemens business has become a fiasco, for the Astros,
for the Toronto Blue Jays, for the five-time Cy Young award winner,
for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Blue Jays gave Clemens a double-edged sword by
agreeing to let him have the right to not only request a trade but
also veto a trade. He could dictate where the Blue Jays could trade
him while they were under the pressure of having to trade him if he
so wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Second, once Clemens asked to be traded, the Astros, his
hometown team, became the most likely team to get him. The only
trouble was that the Astros, in this instance, started to resemble
the Yankees: one hand, in this case Gerry Hunsicker, the general
manager, apparently didn't know what the other hand, Drayton McLane
Jr., the owner, was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker publicly expressed outrage over the terms Clemens
sought for a revised contract before he would approve a trade, only
to have McLane, who had been negotiating with Hendricks, apologize
to Clemens and Hendricks for Hunsicker's remarks. It's always good
for organizational unity when the owner panders to a player instead
of supporting his general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Clemens looks bad because of his effort to get an
additional $27.4 million for one year _ a $15 million salary for an
added third year, the rest as a signing bonus divided evenly over
the three years of the contract. It has prompted people to believe,
correctly or not, that his trade request had more to do with money
than with his desire to play with a contender or closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Major League Baseball looks bad because its president
and chief operating officer, Paul Beeston, was the Blue Jays'
president last winter who held out Toronto's deal-clinching carrot
to Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston now faces a hefty fine for not submitting the agreement
with Clemens' contract. Beeston, an upstanding and outstanding
official, has been forthright internally about his role and will
accept his punishment. But it is embarrassing for him and for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, the Blue Jays have compounded the matter by ignoring
established guidelines and allowing Clemens and his agent to speak
with other clubs before a trade was completed. Gord Ash, the Blue
Jays' general manager, has acknowledged that he did not ``follow
the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN'S BIG COUP
</P>
<P>
   Did the Los Angeles Dodgers really give Kevin Brown a seven-year
contract for $105 million? Information circulating in the upper
echelon of baseball has it that the next best offer Brown had was
$65 million for five years from the Colorado Rockies, even though
Scott Boras, the pitcher's agent, may say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out to secure the richest contract in baseball
history, Boras made much of Brown's effort in helping two different
teams reach the World Series in successive seasons. But he omitted
Brown's contribution in the World Series itself. In four starts for
Florida and San Diego, Brown had a 0-3 record _ his teams lost all
four games _ and a 6.04 earned run average, allowing 40 base
runners in 251/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   USING THE YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Belle was a free agent last month, he was talking
seriously with the Yankees, whose presence in a bidding war is
always beneficial to a player. How does Belle really feel about
playing for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   In the contract he signed with Baltimore, he was given a
complete no-trade provision for the first three years, and for the
last two years he was able to list eight teams he can be traded to:
Anaheim, Arizona, Atlanta, Colorado, San Diego, Seattle, St. Louis
and Texas. Somehow he left out the Yankees.

   With cracked ribs and an injured spleen, 72-year-old Louis Weiss
was ``sore all over'' on Saturday. Yet he told his doctors at
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., to
release him by Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He has to bury his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Louis and Shirley Weiss were one of four couples ripped apart on
the road on Christmas Eve when the bus they were riding from
Brooklyn for a day of gambling in Atlantic City hurtled off the
Garden State Parkway in New Jersey and flipped several times before
landing at the bottom of an embankment. Shirley, 70, was among the
eight people killed, most of whom are to be buried Sunday. Louis
was among the 15 _ including the driver, Valentin Viner _ who were
hospitalized with injuries, many of them critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would tell me this is a dream,'' Weiss said,
choking back sobs and then letting them run free, crying openly
into the telephone during an interview from his hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that God would help me,'' said Weiss, who, like
most of the victims, is Jewish. ``Every Saturday I prayed to Him in
synagogue. I guess He didn't hear my pleas.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis said that he and Shirley had been married 46 years. They
have two children and four grandchildren, who live in New Jersey.
He was an accountant, she stayed home with the children.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five or six years, they had visited Atlantic City
about once a month, joining other retirees on the buses that depart
daily from Brooklyn, picking up passengers at corner stores and
ferrying them to the shining lights of the casinos and the fresh
ocean breeze of the boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were partners, always, in the slot machines,''
Louis Weiss recalled Saturday. ``We had a lot of fun putting in
four, five, six nickels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we won,'' he said. ``But they took it back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the two-family gray-brick rowhouse where the Weisses have
lived for four decades, marigolds line the front garden. Neighbors
said that Louis, a World War II veteran, is active in the Knights
of Pythias and in his shul on Avenue O. Shirley was like an aunt to
her neighbor's grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he and his wife were sitting next to each other,
watching the Steve Martin movie ``Roxanne'' on the bus video
screen, until the accident happened. Weiss said Viner is ``a good
driver,'' but that he ``must have been going a little too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone cut him off, I don't know,'' Weiss said. ``He
flew off the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   N.J. state police investigators said Viner told them he lost
control of the bus when he swerved to avoid a patch of ice. Other
witnesses, including two passengers and a driver who was behind the
doomed bus, have said that Viner was speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board plans to begin
reconstructing the accident Monday. George Black, a highway
engineer who sits on the NTSB, said in an interview Saturday that
questions about whether the guardrails were up to standard and
whether anti-lock brakes might have helped prevent the fatal crash
are among those that will be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials has deisgn policies specifying the appropriate height and
length of guardrails, Black said. But because the Garden State
Parkway not part of the federal highway system, it is not
necessarily required to meet the group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The bus, a 1992 Vanhool, probably was not equipped with
anti-lock brakes, which are only required on buses manufactured
after March 1998, Black said. Such brakes, known as ABS, improve
braking efficiency and likely would have helped the bus maintain
stability if it hit a patch of ice as the driver swerved, Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABS brakes on large vehicles, small vehicles, any vehicle,
always helps the driver maintain control,'' he explained.
``Whether, in this particular accident it would have helped enough,
we won't know until we reconstruct the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bus had ABS, Black said, it probably would not have spun
around as quickly. Had it still tumbled off the road, the slower
rotation might have kept it from rolling over repeatedly, reducing
the severity of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Viner, 52, emigrated from Moscow, where he was a pilot, about a
decade ago, said a friend, Sarah Peregrina. Neither he nor his
lawyer could be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in fragments, as much from the shock of remembering the
horror as from the shot of pain medication he had just received,
Weiss had only a hazy half-recollection of events when he spoke of
the accident Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hydroplaning,'' he said. ``Like I had wings. The bus took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my last memory, until I was laying on the floor, with
my wife next to me,'' he continued between bouts of sobs. ``She was
gone. I tried to wake her. But I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I protected my wife,'' he said. ``But it was too late. She
flew off.''

UNION OFFICIAL WANTS TO TALK WITH STERN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As union executive Billy Hunter feels the pressure of the Jan. 7
drop-dead date to cancel the National Basketball Association season
closing in, he said Saturday that he expects to reach out to
Commissioner David Stern on Sunday and he wants to schedule a
meeting with the principals involved for this week.
</P>
<P>
   When reached at his home in Oakland, Calif., Hunter said he was
flying back to New York on Saturday and planned to call Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a watch and wait situation,'' Hunter said. ``I'm thinking
that David and I are going to be talking before the weekend is out,
but I just don't know when. Right now I'm not optimistic because
nothing is happening. I don't want to go into specifics, but things
continue to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stern set Jan. 7 as the drop-dead date last week, it
spurred some activity. But Hunter said that absolutely nothing came
of the secret late-night meeting he had with Stern in Los Angeles
on Wednesday. If a new meeting can be scheduled for this week, it
is unlikely to be a full bargaining session. Only a few major
principals, such as the union president Patrick Ewing, and the
NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, will likely join Stern and
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the union's negotiating committee said the players
were confident a deal could get done if a swap of key compromises
unfolds. The union is prepared to accept the league's proposal for
a maximum salary for players with more than six years experience if
the owners will add a median salary exception of about $1.3 million
and raise the minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Billy will give unless there's a trade, straight
up,'' one union official said. ``I think if those things can be
worked out, we're not that far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   One major sticking point still exists, though. The union has
been adamant about getting 57 percent of the basketball-related
revenues, while the league has not offered anything more than 53.5.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks to make a deal, the pressure is intense
on both sides. Hunter has had to watch as Karl Malone called the
league's proposal fair and Kevin Willis call for a vote on it.
Stern has the task of delivering a deal to appease the owners that
will prevent the NBA from becoming the first major professional
sport to cancel a season.

HOFSTRA HAS EASY TIME HANDLING GEORGIA TECH; PENN BEATS IONA
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: SUBS throughout to add second game, Penn over Iona.) 
 (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's doubleheader at Madison Square Garden presented a
chance for two often-overlooked local teams to grab center stage.
When the day was over, Hofstra had humbly recorded its biggest
victory in years, and Iona had slipped further into a season of
mounting frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (6-4) acted as though it had accomplished the ordinary
in demolishing Georgia Tech, 61-42, in the first game of the ECAC
Holiday Tournament. In the second game, Iona's puzzling start
continued with a 67-61 loss to Pennsylvania, which gave the Gaels
(4-6) as many losses as they had last season.
</P>
<P>
   In Hofstra's victory, point guard Craig Claxton simply held the
ball as time ran out, and the Flying Dutchmen shook hands with each
other and then with the Yellow Jackets (8-3) as both teams filed to
the locker rooms. No bear hugs, no jumps for joy. Business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on the road so much, we said we would treat this as
a home game,'' Hofstra Coach Jay Wright said. ``Since it was a home
game, we expected to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright even put up a sign that displayed the word ``attitude''
in the Flying Dutchmen's locker room at the Garden, just as it is
in their gym in Hempstead, N.Y. Every Hofstra player slapped it on
the way out before harassing Tech into 25 turnovers and 34.6
percent shooting (18 of 52).
</P>
<P>
   A search through the record book revealed that no Hofstra
victory had come close in significance since the 1976-77 season,
when the Dutchmen defeated Virginia and later stunned Temple in the
tournament of the East Coast Conference, which is now defunct.
Hofstra, of the glamour-challenged America East Conference, had
lost 18 straight to Atlantic Coast Conference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I came to Hofstra was to knock off one of
these teams,'' said Claxton, who had a quiet 8 points and 3 assists
and vomited twice on the Garden floor in the fourth quarter after
he was elbowed in the midsection.
</P>
<P>
   Swingman Norman Richardson poured in 23 points for Hofstra,
sinking 4 of 6 three-point attempts. Richardson said he took 500
shots a day during the summer. Against Tech, three mattered the
most. After the Yellow Jackets had cut Hofstra's 29-17 halftime
lead to 31-24 early in the second half, Richardson killed the
momentum with a jump shot from the perimeter. When the Yellow
Jackets scored two straight times down the floor to trail by 41-33
with 7 minutes 54 seconds to go, Richardson sailed in a 3-pointer
to beat the shot clock, then swished another 3-pointer the next
time downcourt to give Hofstra the breathing room it needed to seal
the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this is probably the biggest win,'' said a blase
Richardson, who was supported by 10 points each from forward
Roberto Gittens and guard Jason Hernandez. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't playing as tough as they were,'' said Tech's
6-foot-11-inch center, Alvin Jones (12 points), who, along with the
7-foot power forward Jason Collier (7 points), was troubled by
Hofstra's energy and darting hands. The Flying Dutchmen had 14
steals to offset a substantial height disadvantage. They also
limited Tech's Tony Akins to 10 points and 2 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Tech followed a 41-point loss to then-No. 3 Kentucky with a
stunning 66-64 victory over No. 7 North Carolina last Tuesday. Now
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you try to figure things out like that and it drives
you crazy,'' Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said.
</P>
<P>
   Iona Coach Jeff Ruland has some things to figure out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a work in progress,'' said Ruland, who is in his first
season with a team that went 27-6 and reached the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament last season. ``My guys
competed today, and that's all we can ask for. We still held them
to 35 percent shooting, and that's usually good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania (3-2) and Iona exchanged the lead nine times in the
second half before Pennsylvania went ahead for good on two free
throws by Matt Langel that made the score 58-57 with 4:05 left. The
Quakers' Jed Ryan (19 points) added a 3-pointer before Iona's Tariq
Kirksay scored two of his game-high 20 points to close the gap to
61-59 with 1:35 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaels came as close as 63-61 on a 12-foot jumper by Dyree
Wilson (8 points), but the Quakers hit 6 of 6 free throws in the
final minute to secure the victory and a date Sunday with Hofstra
in the championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaels played the last 4:23 without their best player, center
Kashif Hameed (12 points). After picking up a fourth foul, Hameed
needlessly reached over the back of Geoff Owens on the ensuing
inbounds pass to earn his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Penn shot poorly from the field but had just 11 turnovers to
Iona's 17 and made 15 of 20 foul shots. Iona made 5 of 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't beat themselves,'' Hameed said.

MEXICAN-AMERICAN BOXERS, FANS CARRY SPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It started as early as the 1930s, when Mexican
fighters like featherweight champion Alberto ``Baby'' Arizmendi
captured the imaginations of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   It exploded in the '50s, '60s and '70s, when favorites such as
Raul ``Raton'' Macias and Ruben Olivares dominated their weight
classes.
</P>
<P>
   And it might have reached its peak in the '80s and '90s, when
Salvador Sanchez and then Julio Cesar Chavez emerged as icons and
the love affair that both Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have with
boxing fully bloomed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those of Mexican heritage are far and away the sport's
most loyal fans and important market. And as the Latino population
and influence continues to grow, many believe their tremendous
impact on the boxing business will grow with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, right now, Hispanics are carrying the sport of
boxing outside the heavyweight division,'' promoter Bob Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   The passion Mexicans have for the sport isn't difficult to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   They have very few great basketball or football players to
embrace as their own. However, their boxers _ along with some
soccer and baseball players _ are among the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's not difficult to understand what has happened:
Olivares and Chavez became world-class stars because their
countrymen were starving for such heroes.
</P>
<P>
   That boxing's lighter weight divisions offer a home to a
relatively small people and the fact the sport has traditionally
drawn from impoverished neighborhoods _ from which many fighters,
both Mexican and otherwise, come _ makes for a perfect marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the only major sport Mexico has succeeded in. It's
pretty simple, really,'' said Fernando Paramo, a journalist born in
Mexico who has covered boxing for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the media has played a big role. Macias was one of the
first to become champion. He became an idol because of the radio.
Then, with other fighters, television brought the champion boxers
to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it took. They became part of our culture, like the
NFL and baseball here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans and Mexican-Americans both participate in and support
boxing in inordinate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly evident in California and the southwest.
Here's one example: Of 56 fighters who took part in six recent
boxing shows in California, 13 were Mexican nationals (18 percent)
and 39 were Latino (70 percent), according to the California
Athletic Commission. And all 39 are believed to have been either
Mexican or Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, those numbers would be lower in areas with small
Latino populations. Still, Mexicans are believed to be better
represented in boxing than any other ethnic group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are certainly the majority of the fighters,'' said John
Jackson, head of Forum Boxing. ``That's the reason we focus on the
lighter weight classes, where there are a lot of Latino fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market, there are a lot of Mexican fans and
Mexican-American fans. . . . When we started to develop fighters,
like Chiquita Gonzalez, who happens to be Mexican, that was
positive for us. The fans were very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   That fact isn't lost on the country's boxing promoters or sports
television executives.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the Latino boxing fan became clear to Arum when
junior flyweight Michael Carbajal was rising to prominence early
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Arum promoted Olympic gold medalist Kennedy McKinney around the
same time and had difficulty drawing fans. However, Carbajal, an
Olympic bronze medalist in 1988, developed a huge following in his
hometown of Phoenix and other areas with large Latino populations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Arum has focused much of his energy on the Latino
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbajal would go to Phoenix and draw 5,000 right from the
start and then later it built to about 15,000. With other fighters,
you couldn't give away a ticket. And it had nothing to do with
ability,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the impact of Mexican fans on TV revenue.
</P>
<P>
   When De La Hoya fights, according to Arum, 53 percent of the
pay-per-view buys comes from six million homes with large Latino
populations while 47 percent comes from the remaining 32 million
homes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   HBO executive Mark Taffet said the percentage of Latino buys on
its pay-view-arm, TVKO, has been as high as two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, on KCAL (Channel 9), roughly 45 percent of those who
watch monthly boxing shows, which typically feature Mexican and
Mexican-American fighters, are Latino. By comparison, 30 percent of
those who watch Angels games are Latino. Channel 9's ratings for
boxing are also high, an average of about 4.5 (225,000 viewers) per
show. The Angels average about 3.5, the Kings and Ducks 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   All this would seem to support the contention that Latino
viewers are committed to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   However, that isn't to say their interest in the sport ends when
no big-name Latino fighter is on the card. No Mexican or
Mexican-American heavyweight has ever made it to the top of that
division but the fans _ like the American public in general _ also
seem to be enamored with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Taffet, of HBO, said that 40 percent of the pay-per-view buys
for cards that (begin ital)don't(end ital) feature Latino fighters
are made by Latino households.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're avid (begin ital)boxing(end ital) fans,'' said Taffet,
whose network was the first to provide both English and Spanish
commentary for all its fights. ``That's not just for fights
involving people like De La Hoya or Chavez, but for all fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they're the anchor and core of the pay-per-view
business today.''
</P>
<P>
   But as generations of Mexicans become more Americanized, will
they shift their passions to the major American sports? Or will
boxing remain woven into the fabric of the culture and grow with
the population?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Romo, a Mexican-American historian at the University
of Texas, Austin, believes the love affair will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people, the way they were raised, who don't
take an interest in ethnic groups, ethnic food, ethnic music. Those
folks are making those choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, a large part of our population chooses daily to take
part in our culture, our traditions. That would include pulling for
their heroes.''

A LONG SHOT TO CAPTURE BEST MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; I &UR; xr &LR; t was a request from a golf publication to vote for
the best of 1998, and much of it took some thought. But not the
lead question, which asked for the sport's top moment. No room for
debate here, as the vote went to a young woman who made an
improbable putt that did more than force a playoff _ it provided
proof that the foundation of this game remains unspoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Chuasiriporn, on the 72d hole of the US Women's Open,
reminded us all that golf, though an impossible game, never fails
to somehow reward us. She was shocked when her putt went in, and
whether it covered 40 feet or 50 or somewhere in between is
incidental; the lasting image is what matters, because it embodied
so much of what is missing in sports today: sincerity and
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn seemed embarrassed to make the putt, not because
she was a 20-year-old amateur playing against professionals and not
because the birdie bomb had tied her for the lead; no, she was
embarrassed because she knows what every golfer knows, that you
don't try to make putts like that, you just want to get them close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick a spot,'' she told her brother/caddie Joey, who gave her
the line. He told her to give it a good run, a stern reminder that
she had left a par putt short on the 71st hole. Chuasiriporn
watched the putt roll and roll and roll and ... drop. She put her
left hand to her mouth and looked aghast, almost apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no need to apologize, for she had painted the
sport with a fresh coat of humility. And she did it all while
having no chance to earn any money, outplaying the likes of Annika
Sorenstam, Laura Davies, and Dottie Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18-hole playoff the next day, Chuasiriporn started well,
struggled in the middle, then seemed poised to win on the 18th
hole. But what golf gives, it also takes, and on the 18th hole the
psychology major at Duke missed a putt to win. Two holes later, in
sudden death, Chuasiriporn lost to Korean sensation Se Ri Pak. Six
months later, however, Chuasiriporn is still golf's biggest winner
of the year.
</P>

<P>
   The views out across Pleasure Bay will still be spectacular and
the greens velvet-smooth, but for those privileged to play Eastward
Ho! next spring, there will be something missing: the gracious
presence of  &UR; John Scheffler &LR; . The 62-year-old former baseball star
is retiring after 19 years as head professional at the venerable
Chatham course, drawing the curtain on 38 years in the golf
business. Scheffler is one of the great gentlemen in the New
England PGA, a man who had the distinction of breaking into the
business working for  &UR; Jack Grout  &LR; in the early 1960s at LaGorce CC
in Miami Beach. Grout was a giant, universally acknowledged as the
teaching force behind  &UR; Jack Nicklaus &LR; . Scheffler continued his good
fortune with several years under the tutelage of  &UR; Bill Ezinicki &LR; 
before taking his first head job at Wianno. He stayed there for
seven years before heading to Chatham, where the ride has been more
joyful than he could have imagined. Scheffler was recently honored
as Professional of the Year by the Cape Cod Chapter of the NEPGA
... Also honored at the Cape Cod festivities was  &UR; Mike
Ghelfi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the assistant at Ballymeade who earned Player of the Year
status by winning the coveted Wessner Award.  &UR; Mike Pry  &LR; of New
Seabury was cited as Junior Golf Promoter of the Year, while  &UR; Jane
Frost  &LR; of Holly Ridge and  &UR; Sue Kaffenburgh  &LR; of Hyannis GC shared
Teacher of the Year honors ... The Massachusetts Golf Association
will hold its 1999 spring conference March 9, when the theme will
be ``A Salute to the Ryder Cup,'' in recognition of that little
gathering just nine months away. The MGA is hoping to stage a
re-creation of ``Golf Talk Live'' with The Golf Channel's  &UR; Peter
Kessler &LR;  and former Ryder Cup players helping out ... He is a
superb golfer from Australia, and 1998 will go into the books as
his first season without a victory since 1989.  &UR; Greg Norman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; you
say? Wrong.  &UR; Peter Senior &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the man whose swing is nothing to
imitate but whose success is to be admired. He made a strong run in
the Australian Open earlier this month but finished second. For the
record, Norman, before his shoulder woes, won the Holden Classic
Down Under last February; he last was winless in 1991 ... One
Aussie who will never forget 1998 is  &UR; Stuart Appleby &LR; . By now the
27-year-old's story of tragedy is well-known to golf fans: His wife
 &UR; Renay  &LR; was killed in London, crushed by a car as she unloaded
luggage from a cab at the airport. Appleby was a witness to the
July accident, and it has been a tough road for him. He returned to
competition at the PGA Championship in August and was cheered by an
enthusiastic gallery, and after a few other emotional events,
Appleby recorded a bittersweet win at last week's Coolum Classic.
It was an event he would not have played, he said, save for the
fact that his wife used to love the stop ... Appleby will be in the
select field when the Mercedes Championship tees off Jan. 7 at
Kapalua on the island of Maui. That's right, the kickoff to the
1999 PGA Tour is just 11 days away. If you are looking to pick a
winner in that event, you might consider  &UR; Davis Love  &LR; or  &UR; Fred
Couples &LR; . Love won the Kapalua International in 1992, Couples took
the title the next two years, and Love returned to the top spot in
1997, the year it ended its 15-year-run as one of the premier
non-Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   During the Presidents Cup two weeks ago, it was reported that
Norman's doctor had expressed fears of the golfer getting into too
hectic of a schedule so soon after returning from a long layoff.
Dr.  &UR; Richard Hawkins  &LR; reportedly suggested that Norman take six
weeks off after the Cup to let the shoulder heal. Norman must be
listening, because he is not due back until the Holden lassic in
early February, followed by a date in the Australian Masters. The
latter is a surprise, because Norman has not played the event since
1994 when he split with IMG, which organizes the tourney. Of
course, for a reported $300,000 appearance fee, Norman can let
bygones be bygones ...  &UR; Ernie Els  &LR; joined select company when he
was granted lifetime membership on the European PGA Tour.  &UR; Arnold
Palmer &LR; , &UR; Gary Player &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Bob Charles  &LR; are also lifetime members
... The pet peeve for 1998 was the same as the pet peeve for 1997
and the pet peeve for 1996 (and, sadly, probably the pet peeve for
2000). Namely, all those low handicappers who neglect to hand in
their cards following competitive rounds ... If you are able to
play to that low handicap, however, it figures to be an attractive
summer in '99 for you. The MGA State Amateur will be held at
Kittansett, the US Amateur at Pebble Beach. Expect record entries.

SUCCESS A CREDIT TO PARCELLS'S SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Former Patriots on the New York Jets said last week
that they felt the Patriots' resilience the past two seasons was
born of their experience with Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The nonsense on this subject persists almost two full seasons
since Parcells left New England.
</P>
<P>
   Even Parcells said, ``I had nothing to do with what's happened
there the past couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards didn't learn how to recover from a midseason dip
under Parcells. Chris Floyd didn't learn to block well from
Parcells. Tony Simmons was milking cows in Wisconsin when Parcells
was here. Chad Eaton became a major player under Pete Carroll, not
Parcells. Chris Slade became a Pro Bowler under Carroll the year
after Parcells benched him on first and second downs. Ty Law
finally got his wish to cover the top receiver under Carroll, not
Parcells, and now he's a Pro Bowler who leads the league in
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Thomas, the heart and soul of the defense, never played
for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong had a chance to join Parcells in New York but
stayed in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Todd Rucci.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells makes players play? Shawn Jefferson said he was fine
the week after sustaining a concussion on Opening Day in Miami in
1996, but Parcells wouldn't let him play. It's the only game
Jefferson has missed in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brown, when healthy, has flourished under Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells led Todd Collins to quit football by treating him like
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy has come on like gangbusters the last two years
under Carroll and is now a Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Zefross Moss, who has had the most consistent year of any
Patriot offensive lineman, never played for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It is Carroll's team that has made the playoffs two years in a
row. Parcells did not do that in his four years with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   If these Patriots are resilient, they have become so the past
two years under Carroll, not Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday that resilience will be tested again. Having gone 4-1
after hitting a low point at 5-5, the Patriots at 9-6 have
qualified for the playoffs, and need Sunday's game for a shot at
home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like to win it for two other reasons as well. (1) They're
sick of the Parcells topic _ and that goes from owner Robert Kraft
right down to the coaching staff and the players. (2) Momentum for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum is what it's all about,'' said Willie McGinest, who
will see some action at his defensive end spot Sunday. ``If you
have it heading in, it means everything for you. You build a head
of steam, a confidence, and you feel like nobody can beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   The healthy Jets likely will throw everything including the
kitchen sink at Scott Zolak, who is expecting it. The Patriots kept
their practices under wraps this past week, but the playbook again
will include the long ball as they believe they can beat the Jets
and Otis Smith downfield because New York stops the underneath
passes so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be missing not only Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn,
and Ted Johnson, but also linebacker Collins, who has a tear in a
chest muscle. That leaves the Patriots with Marty Moore in the
middle and probably Vernon Crawford, a second-year linebacker out
of Florida State, to play a lot in the regular defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will have to contend with their former specialty
player Dave Meggett, who will get more playing time this week on
third down and on punt and kickoff returns. The Patriots know
firsthand how Meggett can destroy opponents with big plays.
</P>
<P>
   This could be one of the more physical games the Patriots play
all season. The first meeting, a 24-14 win by the Jets at
Foxborough Oct. 19, was costly since it began the incredible run of
injuries the Patriots have endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose this game,'' said Eaton. ``This is a game that
can play on our nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave us a chance last week against San Francisco,''
added Willie Clay. ``Nobody seems to be giving us a chance this
week. But this team has a lot of pride in the way it's fought back
from all the adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has nothing to do with Parcells.

POTI LOOKING SLICK AS AN OILER 
</HEADLINE>

   Tom Poti's adjustment to the pro game has been virtually
seamless. The former Boston University defenseman, who had two
years of eligibility left with the Terriers, is playing about 20
minutes a game with the Oilers, paired with another
offensive-minded blue liner, Roman Hamrlik.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough at first, I'd say it took me 8-10 games to feel
comfortable,'' said the 21-year-old Poti, who figures to be a
shoo-in for the NHL's All-Rookie team if he keeps up his
impressive, steady play. ``(Hamrlik) is a very gifted offensive
defenseman, so it was pretty weird they put us together, but they
did, right from the start of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3-inch Poti is playing at 205 pounds, about 10 more
than he carried in his college days. Head coach Ron Low also rolls
him out for the second unit on the power play, pairing him with
Janne Niinimaa. Not even halfway through his rookie season, Poti
looks and plays most nights like a seasoned veteran.
</P>
<P>
   General managers from around the league call the Oiler front
office, mention Poti's name, and assistant GM Doug Risebrough
apprises them, ``He's for real.'' Message: Don't even think about
asking for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised,'' said Poti. ``But I've worked at this
all my life, waiting for this opportunity to come. It's a different
game, though, pretty much in every way, mostly because of the pace.
You've got to be thinking about what you'll do with the puck even
before you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Poti keeps up on his Terriers, who have
struggled this year. His sister, Colleen, tapes some of the BU
games and sends them to Edmonton. He wishes his old team was doing
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never looked back on my decision,'' he said. ``I met
with (BU coach) Jack Parker five or six times before I made up my
mind, and he was great about it. He just said, `You've got to do
what's right for you.' He wanted to make sure I was doing it for
the right reason _ not doing it for the money, but doing it because
it was the right time and it made me happy.''

   &UR; Glen Murray &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Boston's first choice in the '91 draft, finally
is blossoming into a scorer at age 26 _ once again a reminder that
these things sometimes take time. Murray banged home his 14th goal
of the year Tuesday night vs. the Penguins and should break his
career-high mark of 29 last season. The Kings picked up Murray from
Pittsburgh at the March '97 trade deadline, giving up  &UR; Ed Olczyk &LR; .
Kings coach  &UR; Larry Robinson  &LR; on Murray: ``When he came to us, we
really didn't know what we had. What we've gotten from him is a
kind of diamond in the rough who has really blossomed.'' ... The
Sabres have seen their average attendance jump by nearly 3,500 this
season, a carryover from last year's promising finish and playoff
success. They're also reaching over the border, offering Canadian
fans a decent exchange rate on their deflated dollar (75 cents
instead of 64 cents) when buying tickets ... At the rate he's
firing, Hingham's  &UR; Tony Amonte  &LR; could walk away this year with the
first Maurice Richard Award as the league's No. 1 goal scorer. Not
bad for a guy whose career seemed to come to a close with the
Rangers when then coach  &UR; Mike Keenan  &LR; questioned his courage. ``I
know one thing,'' said another ex-Ranger,  &UR; Doug Weight &LR; . &UR;  &LR; ``Tony's
not chicken. He gets his goals from the same place ( &UR; John &LR; ) &UR; LeClair
 &LR; and ( &UR; Keith &LR; ) &UR; Tkachuk  &LR; get 'em _ and they call those guys power
forwards.'' Amonte on Keenan: ``He definitely didn't like me, and I
didn't like him. I still don't think I like him.'' ... How badly do
the Avalanche miss  &UR; Uwe Krupp  &LR; and  &UR; Sandis Ozolinsh  &LR; at the points?
They were recently mired in a 4-for-62 slump on the power play.
Krupp left as a free agent for the Wings and Ozolinsh still can't
come to contract terms. The sides are close on the money (two
years/$6.75 million), but the sticking point is that Ozolinsh wants
it backloaded _ much more money in year No. 2 _ in order to
diminish the sting of not being paid for this season's ``lost''
games. Meanwhile,  &UR; Claude Lemieux  &LR; is teeing it up at the point.
Ouch ... The Capitals will go the rest of the way without tough guy
 &UR; Chris Simon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but don't worry,  &UR; Craig Berube  &LR; can still pound the
heavy bag with the best of 'em. Simon came back too soon from
shoulder surgery last season, reinjuring himself in the Cup finals
vs. Detroit, and a second operation will keep him down until next
September. The good news for the Capitals:  &UR; Adam Oates  &LR; returned
last night after missing some three weeks with a groin pull ...
 &UR; Donald Audette &LR; : &UR;  &LR; Two games with the Kings, two goals. And, folks,
there were actually teams out there that said giving up a
second-round pick for him was too much. Sure, there are some real
finds in the second round, but not enough to pass up a 29-year-old
winger who can score _ not might score ... Weight, who skated
Tuesday for the first time since Nov. 2 knee surgery, has collected
no fewer than 40,000 votes for the All-Star Game. ``I must have had
a hell of a three games,'' mused Weight, whose season started late
because of a contract holdout. Truth is, Weight was hurt in his
fifth game, but it's good to know the fans aren't counting.

   Admit it, Bruins fans, Christmas doesn't get much better than a
0-5-5 Montreal winless streak. But, hey, they just had to get rid
of  &UR; Patrick Roy  &LR; ... While on the subject of St. Patrick, keep in
mind that he is an unrestricted free agent as of July 1, 1999. Do I
hear the bidding begin at $6.5 million per year? And what do you
suppose  &UR; Guy Hebert &LR; , &UR;  &LR; another UFA goalie, is going to bring on the
open market? Hebert, who recently came within five minutes of a
third straight shutout in the Anaheim net, will turn 32 Jan. 7 and
is in only his sixth season as an NHL starter (read: lots of miles
left) ... Word around Tampa is that the Lightning, projected to
lose $20 million this year, would love to unload both  &UR; Craig Janney
 &LR; and  &UR; Stephane Richer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who have failed to spark the offense.
Janney, with only the balance due on his $1.7 million this season,
could be a cheap, interesting fit as a second-line center for the
Bruins. OK, he's soft, but don't discount the effectiveness of his
velvety hands; he entered this season with better than a
point-per-game average (724 points/704 games) over his 10-year
career. For about $850,000, with no obligation beyond that, he
could be that dash of creativity the Bruins need in the pivot ...
Hall of Famer  &UR; Glenn Hall  &LR; sounded miffed recently, following
comments from Calgary coach  &UR; Brian Sutter &LR;  about the way Hall's
stomach often turned over come game time. ``Everybody says that's
what I'm known for,'' said Hall. ``Nobody knows that I also stopped
the odd puck.'' Sutter wouldn't let his own netminder,
 &UR; Jean-Sebastien Giguere &LR; , &UR;  &LR; leave the Calgary net in a recent game,
even though the rookie was heaving because of dehydration. Hall,
said Sutter, was sick before games and between periods, but never
gave in to his gut. ``That's a fantasy,'' said Hall. ``I did get
sick before games, but I don't think I ever got sick during a
game.'' ... The fur was flying in Anaheim when Islanders GM/coach
 &UR; Mike Milbury  &LR; berated  &UR; Travis Green  &LR; as a ``gutless puke'' for the
stinging hit Green put on New York defenseman  &UR; Kenny Jonsson &LR; .
``It's why he doesn't wear an Islander uniform anymore,'' added
Milbury, who dealt Green to the Ducks last February. The immediate
diagnosis was that Jonsson suffered a concussion _ and there was
talk it could be career-threatening, because Jonsson has suffered
five concussions in his career. But Jonsson, later told by doctors
his head was fine, was back and playing two nights later in Phoenix
... As expected, San Jose defenseman  &UR; Gary Suter  &LR; will be out for
the year, following a third surgical attempt to repair his torn
right triceps. In the latest operation, an Achilles' tendon from a
cadaver was inserted into Suter's arm _ reminiscent of when doctors
patched up ex-Bruin  &UR; Randy Burridge's  &LR; knee with parts taken from a
deceased donor ...  &UR; Ziggy Palffy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; fresh from signing his
five-year, $25 million contract, connected for a pair of assists in
his first game back with the Islanders Tuesday night. Meanwhile,
rumors persist that the Islanders will deal Woonsocket's  &UR; Bryan
Berard  &LR; _ a Group 2 free agent as of July 1 _ before the March 23
trade deadline. Another possibility to go is former BU blue liner
 &UR; Scott Lachance &LR; . Berard, NHL rookie of the year in '96-97, could
be a victim of mixed signals, getting conflicting reads from the
lengthy list of Islander coaches. Berard has the skills to be a
great talent, but not if he's asked to be two or three different
kinds of player ... Among the many benefits of New Jersey's revived
offense under new coach  &UR; Robbie Ftorek &LR; : &UR; Jason Arnott  &LR; had nine
goals as of last week. Suddenly, the swap that brought the Oilers
 &UR; Bill Guerin  &LR; doesn't look so lopsided. Unlike their days under
 &UR; Jacques Lemaire &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Devils aren't reluctant to go on the
attack. Lemaire's game plan grew increasingly more conservative
(read: stifling).

   Pittsburgh defensive whiz  &UR; Rob Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; once dubbed a ``goal
suck'' by goalie  &UR; John Vanbiesbrouck &LR; , &UR;  &LR; will be out 6-8 weeks
following surgery Wednesday to repair a broken bone in his left
foot. Brown was felled by a  &UR; Garry Galley  &LR; slapper Tuesday night,
and he knew the diagnosis even before going for an X-ray. Brown:
``There's a pretty big dent where the bone used to be.' ... Quick
lesson in hockey's runaway economics: The Ducks, who had a $16.5
million player payroll in '96-97, this year are paying $31.5
million _ nearly a 100 percent increase in two years. According to
team president/GM  &UR; Pierre Gauthier &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Ducks, with ticket sales
down some 6 percent, will lose upwards of $9 million by the end of
the season ...  &UR; Steve Smith &LR; , &UR;  &LR; back in uniform after surrendering
to a bad back two years ago, is playing 20 minutes a night on the
Calgary blue line. The Flames some nights look to be taking shape,
but they really won't know their direction until they figure out
whether they can afford to re-sign  &UR; Theo Fleury &LR; , &UR;  &LR; their downsized
sharpshooter. If not, then now is the time to deal him, get some
value back, and move ahead with a full commitment to kids ... The
Canadiens likely won't pony up the bucks for  &UR; Mark Recchi  &LR; when
he's an unrestricted free agent next summer. When the bidding
begins, look for Dallas owner  &UR; Tom Hicks  &LR; to open wide his wallet
one more time. Recchi is close pals with Stars coach  &UR; Ken
Hitchcock &LR; , &UR;  &LR; once his junior coach in Kamloops ... When his wife
had to go to the Mayo Clinic recently for back surgery, Sabres
netminder  &UR; Dominik Hasek  &LR; brought along his pads, figuring he'd
stay sharp by practicing with a local junior B squad in Rochester,
Minn. But the diagnosis and surgery went so quickly that the
Dom-inator never got on the ice with the locals ... Ex-NHLer  &UR; Craig
Simpson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose bad back forced him to pack it in at age 27,
recently had to miss a CTV commentary assignment because of vertigo
... As of last week, old friend  &UR; Jeff Odgers  &LR; led the league with
no fewer than 15 fighting majors. He recently got a two-year deal
with the Avalanche, worth a total of $1.2 million ... The Kings
next season will play in their new $350 million arena, but their
first home game isn't scheduled until Oct. 23. They'll play a
couple of early-season games in England, one in London and another
in Manchester. LA owner  &UR; Phil Anschutz  &LR; also owns a hockey team in
London (the Knights) ...  &UR; Stu Barnes &LR; , &UR;  &LR; relegated to fourth-line
duty for the Penguins in recent weeks, moved up a considerable
notch on the depth chart last week when  &UR; Alexei Morozov  &LR; went out
of the lineup with his second concussion in less than six weeks.
Head coach  &UR; Kevin Constantine  &LR; slotted Barnes between  &UR; Alexei
Kovalev  &LR; and  &UR; German Titov  &LR; the next night. Barnes, who makes $1.5
million a year, has been the subject of much trade speculation, but
GM  &UR; Craig Patrick  &LR; says he's not interested in dealing the
28-year-old center ... The Kings have seen next to nothing from
 &UR; Steve Duchesne  &LR; after laying out $11 million over four years to
woo him away from St. Louis ... Can anyone really believe that
 &UR; Pavel Bure &LR; , &UR;  &LR; yet to report to the Canucks, actually would give up
the idea of playing in North America for a $4 million deal in
Belarus next season? If so, you'd have to believe there is $4
million in all of Belarus. And if there is, what would it be worth
by the time the Russian Rocket pulls on skates? Truth is, there are
only a handful of teams that can pay Bure _ the Rangers, Wings,
Stars, Flyers, and maybe the Kings. When Canucks GM  &UR; Brian Burke
 &LR; hears the right offer from one of those clubs, that's where Bure
will play, and nowhere else. Oh, unless Hartford comes in with a
late bid, of course.

FOR UCONN, FLEET NOT NECESSARILY IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Is Connecticut the best men's team in the country? Perhaps,
perhaps not, but in December, it really is a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   What is more important for the Huskies is that they stay aware
of a couple of Atlantic Coast Conference teams in the polls and
computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's much too early to worry about NCAA Tournament
seedings, No. 1-ranked UConn should remember this as the season
unfolds: Even if the Huskies take care of business and finish with
a sparkling record _ we're not going to project them to run the
table quite yet _ they are no mortal lock for a No. 1 seed in the
East, which would mean first- and second-round games at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons. Duke, which did a pretty good job of
spanking Kentucky Tuesday night in the Meadowlands, and Maryland.
Both teams appear to be good enough to merit No. 1 seeds. With
first- and second-round regional games also slated for Charlotte,
the ACC teams, if they were ranked higher than UConn by the
tournament selection committee, would get preference and stay in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   Since a region obviously can't have two No. 1's, someone would
have to be shipped out, and that could be UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Huskies coach Jim Calhoun doesn't mind his team
traveling (as long as it's not to an opponent's home court, such as
North Carolina had at Greensboro in last year's East Regional
final). This season is different, however.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has never lost in the FleetCenter, and the Meadowlands,
site of this season's East Regional final, is a familiar and
comfortable venue for the Huskies as well as one easily accessible
to UConn fans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, UConn has had to deal with some strange
geographical imbalances. The Huskies lost the West Regional a
couple of years ago to UCLA in Oakland. Greensboro last season was
one of the most one-sided home-court situations imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies must take care of their own business, not only in
March, during the single-elimination part of their season, but now
as well. They need to stay ahead of Maryland and Duke in the RPI
rankings, which seem to mean so much.

   Once upon a time, the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden
was the crown jewel of holiday tournaments, drawing large fields of
quality teams, who played before sellout crowds. Not anymore. This
year's field: Georgia Tech, Penn, Hofstra, and Iona. Ticket sales
are so bad that the Garden is making this offer: Any adult buying a
ticket can bring in any number of kids for free ... The FleetCenter
has been awarded first- and second-round games for the 2003 NCAA
Tournament. Count on it getting an East Regional site after that as
long as there are no serious glitches at this season's games ... Is
Rutgers women's coach  &UR; Vivian Stringer  &LR; a fan of the men's team or
not? Depends on whom the Scarlet Knights are playing. At last
week's Rutgers-Temple game, Stringer sat one row behind the bench _
the Temple bench. Coach  &UR; John Chaney &LR;  is an old friend. Stringer
made it known that she received the tickets from Chaney, although
she could have easily gotten great seats from the Rutgers athletic
department ... George Washington's  &UR; Tom Penders  &LR; has coached in 805
games, which puts him 14th on the active list. But he is the
runaway leader in number of teams coached among that elite group,
with stops at Tufts, Columbia, Fordham, Rhode Island, and Texas
before he came to George Washington last spring ... Atlantic 10
fans looking for an excuse for the slow start of the conference
teams can use this to warm their spirits. In the first RPI report
of the season, the Atlantic 10 had the second-toughest of
conference schedules, trailing only the Big 10 ... Pay attention to
Notre Dame freshman  &UR; Troy Murphy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is averaging 19.5 points
per game and already has been named Big East Rookie of the Week
twice.

   One of the reasons Maryland is off to such a quick start is the
play of guard  &UR; Steve Francis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a junior college transfer. While
some schools have made a living taking JC transfers (Cincinnati
comes to mind), Maryland is not one of them. Until Francis,
Maryland coach  &UR; Gary Williams  &LR; had recruited only two JC players in
nine years ... American-Puerto Rico's 2-0 forfeit loss to Oklahoma
_ after a brawl in Monday's first round of the Puerto Rico Holiday
Classic _ was rare but not unprecedented. According to NCAA
records, Chicago State forfeited a game to Illinois State in 1991
after a brawl in which 10 Chicago State players were ejected. In
1990, a game between North Carolina Central and North Carolina A&AMP;T
was declared no contest after a brawl resulted in injuries to seven
people ... Nothing like a good old-fashioned family feud in the
Southeastern Conference to start off the season. That's what's
happening between South Carolina's  &UR; Eddie Fogler  &LR; and Florida's
 &UR; Billy Donovan &LR; . Seems that Fogler questioned the propriety of a
basketball trip organized for Florida recruits by a financial
adviser. Fogler and Donovan got into a verbal sparring match during
SEC media day, and last week the SEC office reprimanded both. Said
Fogler, ``I said, `Is it ethical?' Does the release say anything
about whether it was illegal or not? It did not. As far as I'm
concerned, I stand by my statement.'' The Florida-South Carolina
games on Jan. 13 and Feb. 24 should be something else ... Look for
North Carolina to get even better now that freshman guard  &UR; Ronald
Curry  &LR; has finished his quarterbacking duties with the football
team ... Anyone check out what Ohio State has done in  &UR; Jim
O'Brien's  &LR; second year? Last year the Buckeyes were a woeful 8-22.
They have already surpassed that win total this season _ 11-2 ...
The rest of the America East teams may be playing for runner-up
status if Delaware continues its roll. The Blue Hens have yet to
lose in the nonconference part of their schedule. Even worse for
America East teams, the conference tournament will again be played
at Delaware, something that needs to be changed next season.
Delaware has gotten too good to have a home-court edge in the
postseason ... Here's Duke coach  &UR; Mike Krzyzewski &LR;  on sophomore
center  &UR; Elton Brand &LR; : &UR;  &LR; ``He can become an outstanding player. He's
not an outstanding player right now. If you feel that you've
already finished the journey, you don't continue to travel. He
needs to continue to travel and that's what we're trying to impress
upon him.''

TIGHT END'S YEAR COATED WITH ANGUISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The end is coming, but it can't come soon enough
for Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   In five more days, Coates will tear the final page from his wall
calendar with a sad flourish. A year littered with trials and a
trial will finally be over and he will move on, knowing there is
little chance that 1999 could be worse than this year just past, a
year in which he earned his fifth trip to the Pro Bowl and his
first trip to hell on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my personal problems, I wish the year was over right
now,'' the Patriots tight end said last week, as he prepared for
Sunday's regular-season finale against the New York Parcellses. ``I
look in the mirror some mornings and I can't wait until Dec. 31.
There has to be some good things for me in 1999 because it can't
get no worse than '98.''
</P>
<P>
   On the football field, 1998 was not unlike 1994 and 1995 and
1996 and 1997 for Coates. He was an unstoppable force at tight end
except on those Sundays when his own team stopped him by looking
elsewhere or on the one day two sprained ankles stopped him after
113 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   When such things did not conspire against him, Coates caught
enough passes to rank second among tight ends to Tennessee's
versatile Frank Wycheck, who led him by two (67 to 65) going into
the weekend but does not play the true tight end position.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Wycheck doesn't play like Coates does, and neither
does anyone else. Since he made his first Pro Bowl appearance in
1994, Coates has caught more passes for more yards than any other
tight end in the game, and that includes Denver's fast-talking
All-Pro Shannon Sharpe, but as Coates's position coach points out,
not even Sharpe comes close to doing all Coates is asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody can fight a war against Reggie White and Mo
Lewis and Levon Kirkland and Henry Jones and win all those
battles,'' Carl Smith said. ``Some of the other guys are good at
certain things and try the rest. Ben does all those things and gets
them done.''
</P>
<P>
   What he gets done most often, though, is catching footballs in
clutch situations. Since his first Pro Bowl season, Coates has
hauled in 373 passes for 4,578 yards to Sharpe's 360 for 4,208, and
after them, no one else is even close. Yet even though he has put
up numbers this year similar to the ones that preceded them,
everything has been different because everything about 1998 has
been wrapped in the dark bunting of death or the white light of bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as the season went along the coaches wanted to get me
more involved in the offense to minimize the things going through
my mind,'' Coates said. ``But when you go home at night and the
phone is ringing at 5 a.m., you don't have to answer it to know
what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   What it has been about since training camp is death and discord.
The chaos of a domestic assault charge filed by the mother of one
of his daughters and the slow, sad death of family members left
Coates often worried and weary, his life seeming to have spun out
of his control.
</P>
<P>
   It began when he was arrested in training camp and charged with
assault by Jennifer Marshall, a former girlfriend to whom he pays
$54,000 a year in child support. The charges were questionable from
the start, as neighbors insisted Coates did none of what he was
accused of, but eventually he would have to answer them in court at
the same time his mother was dying in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Coates had buried his aunt and his 38-year-old sister,
and while he was still reeling from all of that, he sustained
double ankle sprains that left him on the sidelines for the first
time in his career. As he stood in jeans and jacket while his
teammates played the Indianapolis Colts, Coates understood for the
first time that the sideline was no place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, `What the hell am I doing in street
clothes?''' Coates recalled. ``We've had a lot of injuries, but
there are four or five of us _ myself, Drew (Bledsoe), Bruce
(Armstrong) _ who are always there. We've always played hurt. If
something is really wrong with No. 87, you'll know because I won't
be out there. Otherwise, I play.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest blow
</P>
<P>
   Actually, plenty has been wrong with No. 87 this season but few
people knew because he has played. Despite a sore knee and two
painful ankles that limited his mobility and for a time robbed him
of his quickness and speed, Coates missed only one game.
</P>
<P>
   He was not physically himself for half a season yet he played
on, gaining momentum just as his detractors started suggesting that
he may be a little too old or a little too slow to be what he'd
once been. This was all nonsense, but as his body healed, Coates's
mind came under assault from the kind of troubles that come from
living a life, not playing a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Colts game, Coates learned that his sister had
died suddenly less than two months after his aunt had died, and he
went home to South Carolina to bury another woman who had been
close to him. Not long after he came back, the worst news hit just
as he was learning that his lawyers had been unable to convince a
local prosecutor to drop the assault charges against him. Coates's
mother, Mozella, was found to have an inoperable brain tumor. At
56, her time was short.
</P>
<P>
   During most weeks, Coates would leave Foxborough each Monday,
fly home, return in time for Wednesday's practice, play on Sunday,
and then repeat the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was just a matter of time before she passed,''
Coates said. ``There was nothing anyone could do about it. You just
had to wait and hope she'd survive the season so I could go home
and be with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I had to go to court, all the pressure started to build.
I did find it hard to concentrate on the field. Defenses were
moving around to try and stop me and sometimes I had trouble seeing
what was going on. I had to get over that hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got to the point with my sister calling, telling me how
my mother kept getting worse, that I asked, `Why me?' My aunt had
passed. My sister had passed. Then the ultimate one, my mother. You
start to think, `Can't I get a break?' It's been a very difficult
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Smith said, Coates seldom showed the effects of
his stresses on the job. In the huddle, he would find his refuge.
There nothing bad could happen. No phones could ring. No bad news
could reach him. No lawyers could get to him with false charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come and tell me when something had happened, so I
knew what he was going through,'' Smith said. ``Some days he'd be
pretty quiet but when he got on the field he was home. I think that
carried him through. That was the good time for him.''
</P>
<P>
   His day in court
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, Coates began to have more good times at his
opponents' expense. He had two touchdowns on two receptions against
Kansas City, which is about as efficient as you can get. He had a
10-catch game against the Colts when they thought rumors of his
demise might be true and tried to play him man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody tried that nonsense much after that, but Coates continued
to catch passes even as he was hauled into court to defend himself
in December, the same week his mother was breathing her last.
</P>
<P>
   He had 16 receptions against Buffalo and Pittsburgh leading up
to his trial date, then had to go sit for three days as his lawyers
told a jury that their client had assaulted no one but rather was a
250-pound victim of a woman who had threatened she would ``own his
contract and he would be running on the field for the rest of his
life for her.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness testified that Marshall ``started whaling on him''
after she confronted Coates outside his home about another woman.
Other neighbors testified that she went on a screaming rampage,
cursing and threatening Coates, saying she would call a police
detective she knew and have him arrested. Coates's guest, another
woman, testified that Marshall hit and threatened her, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a real estate agent said Marshall had phoned a week
after the July altercation to say that she wanted to see three
high-priced homes, one worth $749,900. After seeing them, the agent
testified, Marshall made the statement about owning Coates's
contract and advised the agent to watch the papers. A luxury car
dealer told a similar tale.
</P>
<P>
   After this, Coates's attorneys pushed for a dismissal that would
have allowed him to go see his dying mother immediately. The
request was denied and he went home on the evening of Dec. 9
knowing the case would go to the jury the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in court that day, I had a bad feeling,'' Coates
recalled. ``Soon as I got home, my sister called. She never calls
unless something bad happens. She asked how soon I could get down.
She said it wouldn't be long now. I told her they wouldn't let me
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 6:30 or seven (p.m.), my brother called. He said my
mother was gone. It was a shock. It was devastating. I never saw
her again.''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, after closing arguments, Coates left
Wrentham District Court immediately and flew home on Bob Kraft's
private jet to bury his mother. Less than an hour after he was
gone, the jury acquitted him. That nightmare was over but the end
had come one day too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been going down every Monday except when we played to see
her,'' Coates recalled. ``I'd be down there with her and sometimes
she'd know me and sometimes she wouldn't. It's hard to see your
mother in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very discouraging at times. Her temperature and her
blood pressure was rising and she was having real bad headaches.
Each time I came back I knew it was not going to be too much longer
but instead of me being there at the end I had to be in court when
an average person would have had that case thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were trying to make a point because of who I was.
Maybe they couldn't dismiss it. I know there are guys who don't pay
child support or claim their own kids but I've never failed to pay
for her. The reason I don't see my daughter is because (Marshall)
always wants to do things as a family and we're not a family. It's
me and my daughter, not her. Maybe when my daughter is 18 I'll
explain to her how it was. But it's too much trouble now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big setup that didn't go the way she planned it. I
knew we'd win. I told my wife that but it still was embarrassing to
be sitting there when I should have been home with my mother for
her last few hours. When I finally got to South Carolina I told the
Patriots I couldn't make the game in St. Louis. I was totally not
into it. I wouldn't have helped them, even though we're a better
team when I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Long season prolonged
</P>
<P>
   After Coates returned last week, outwardly it was as if nothing
had happened. He is stoic by nature and inclination. A funny guy
when he lets his personality show, he seldom speaks to the media
although he's usually cordial enough when he declines to talk,
choosing mostly to speak on Sundays when footballs are coming his
way.
</P>
<P>
   So it was last weekend, a week after he'd buried his mother and
was acquitted in court, when he went out against the San Francisco
49ers on fourth and 2 with the game on the line. He went out and
did what he's well-paid to do. He made the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard what people were saying about me,'' Coates said. ``I
knew there were people saying I've lost a step. I didn't take that
to heart because when my team needs a touchdown or a first down,
who do they throw it to? Who do they go to in the Red Zone? On that
fourth and 2, everyone in the stadium knew (Scott) Zolak would
throw to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Niners did, as well, and they braced Coates with two
linebackers but he shielded them off with his body and caught the
ball to preserve a drive that would bring New England victory and a
place in the playoffs. What that catch also meant is that Ben
Coates's long season will be longer now.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as it drags on, the worst is finally over. The sadness
still exists when he thinks of his mother, sister, and aunt already
gone. The anger still exists when he thinks of the woman who
falsely accused him or of the court that refused to let him see his
mother one last time.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he just counts the days until Jan. 1. It will not be
long after midnight that Coates rips that last page off his
calendar and puts behind him an All-Pro year of sadness. It is a
year whose end will bring no nostalgic thoughts. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is a strong person,'' said his agent and friend, Michael
George. ``At his mother's funeral he was taking care of everyone,
but when they went to lower her casket, he grabbed his kids and
hugged them tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who takes care of things in his family. This has
been a trial for him. It's about as rough a period in your life as
you can have but he'll survive it. He'll be fine one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely he will. One fine day, maybe Jan. 1, maybe later. Until
then he'll think about 1998 and have to be satisfied just being a
fine tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't ever a day he didn't do what he needed to do,''
Smith said. ``He never had a down game, even when he was hurting.
Through all his troubles we knew he had a lot left. You could see
that down the stretch. When we had to win games, Drew went to him
because he's Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he was tired Ben. Sometimes he was injured Ben.
Sometimes he was frustrated Ben. Other times he was sad Ben. But
always on Sunday he was reliable Ben. Same as he'd always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to New England I wasn't that aware of him,'' said
his old mentor, Bill Parcells, last week. ``I knew they thought he
was a good young talent. Bobby Grier had told me that. Once I saw
him in practice it didn't take too long to realize he's what we
wanted to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``That decision took about 15 minutes in practice. I'm not going
to take much credit for that. I'll give Ben all the credit. If he
never catches another pass, he's had a great career.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a career that didn't come to an end in 1998, even when it
seemed like the rest of his world was closing in on him. It didn't
end but it changed because after a year like this, everything
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole season has been lessened because of all these
things,'' Coates said. ``I don't know what to think about it. Maybe
it was a sign from the Man above to wake up. You go through these
things and it makes you change your priorities. You see it's time
to do the things you weren't doing, if you weren't doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were things Ben Coates wasn't doing, it wasn't on
Sunday. Never on Sunday.

GAME HITS HOME IN MORE THAN ONE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glad to see The Tuna is as disingenuous as ever. But that's part
of the charm, no?
</P>
<P>
   The media makes more of this. I know a lot of players on that
team. I know what the relationships are. But what it really is is
good copy. I don't let the personal stuff get into it. I never
have. That's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bill, that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And you damn well know it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good rivalry. I expect the game to be clean and
hard-hitting. You acquire a respect for a quality opponent and
that's what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, and your great and good friend Bob Knight would care
just as much about beating Minnesota as he does Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   There may be meaningless games in Week 16, but this is not one
of them. Carolina (3-12) at Indianapolis (3-12), this ain't. When
the ball gets kicked off at the Meadowlands this afternoon, the
adrenaline will be flowing, and a great deal of it will be pumping
inside the ``dispassionate'' mentor of the New York Jets, who would
rather be sentenced to a veggie diet the rest of his life than lose
to the New England Patriots, the team owned by You Know Who, a.k.a.
the Connecticut Kid.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots very much want to win this game, and no one knows
this better than Parcells, who is the reigning expert on NFL
strategy and psychology. Were he coaching a team in the Patriots'
situation, he would be preaching the absolute necessity of a
victory, without which there will be no chance of a home game when
the wild-card phase of the playoffs begins next week. A Patriots
victory will not provide that home game unless the Dolphins
cooperate by losing at Atlanta, but it is mandatory if there is to
be any hope at all.
</P>
<P>
   So The Tuna knows what this game means to the Patriots, and
because it is the Patriots, he will care more about this game than
he would if it were against the Broncos, Vikings, or Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It just isn't cool to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   He can't slip this jive by us. We well remember the goings-on in
January and early February of 1997, when Parcells went to the legal
mattresses to extricate himself from New England. He had declared
war on Bob Kraft, and there is no way the passion has diminished.
In his mind, he is Athens and the Patriots are Sparta, and as long
as Kraft owns the team, that is never going to change.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffwise, the Jets are locked in, but Parcells has more than
enough incentive Sunday. He is on record as saying that he wants
the Jets to become the first team in franchise history to win 12
games. Is that really important? The 1968 team, which went on to
win Super Bowl III, was 11-3 in a 14-game schedule. Well, it
certainly seems to be important to Parcells, and if that's the
case, he doesn't want to blow his opportunity to become the Jets'
single-season coaching leader by losing to the, ugh, Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   This is likewise a very big game for Pete Carroll. The general
public perception is that he has yet to defeat Parcells in an NFL
game. Even some of his players have suggested that the only way for
the Parcells ghost to be exorcised is for the Patriots to win this
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the events of Sept. 14, 1997, never took place.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played in Foxborough on that Monday evening. The final
score was New England 27, New York 24, and you can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of curse, is that it sure didn't feel like a W.
With 16 seconds remaining in regulation, the Jets were encamped on
the New England 12-yard line in a tie game. All John Hall had to do
was ram home the perfunctory 29-yarder, and the Jets would win. But
Mike Jones got a hand on the kick, and the teams were forced into
OT. Adam Vinatieri's 34-yard field goal provided the Patriots with
a scary triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have won the last two meetings, and now people have it
in their heads that Carroll has yet to defeat Parcells. It may be
weird, but it's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, and Carroll, need this game even if Miami upsets
Atlanta and thus sends them on the road next week. Parcells's great
success in New York has enhanced the legend. The Patriots have got
to find a way to knock off The Tuna, Drew Bledsoe or no Drew
Bledsoe, or else Carroll will continue to be regarded as the
consolation prize in these here parts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the Jets were 1-15. With a victory Sunday they
would be 12-4. Two years ago the Patriots were in the Super Bowl.
With a loss they will finish at 9-7 and will be serious underdogs
in the first round of the playoffs. It will be impossible not to
play the compare-and-contrast game, and it won't matter to most
people that the Patriots really have been whacked by injury this
season. It will be 12-4 vs. 9-7. It will be a team looking like the
biggest obstacle for Denver getting to the Super Bowl vs. a fairly
decent odds-on to be an over-and-out playoff participant.
</P>
<P>
   In a better world, Parcells would stop the nonsense and tell us
the truth. He would say, yeah, sure, I want to beat the Patriots in
the worst way. It would help me and hurt them, and what could be
better than that? But he would rather insult our intelligence by
pretending it's Just Another Game, when we know otherwise.

PREACHER ALWAYS DID HIS SUNDAY BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,
</P>
<P>
   ``A pawn and a king.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I find myself flat on my face,
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick myself up and get back in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``That's Life,'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; as sung by Frank Sinatra &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Irving Fryar has been flat on his face more often than Rocky
Balboa.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen more ups and downs than the Otis Elevator Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 years in the NFL, he's been not only a puppet, a pauper, a
pirate, a poet, a pawn, and a king but also a playmaker and a
prayer-taker.
</P>
<P>
   He's been to the Pro Bowl five times and to a jail cell once.
He's been roundly applauded and lustily booed. He's played in the
Super Bowl and in the Stupor Bowl. He's been on the best team in
one conference and the worst team in two. He's run pass patterns
for the leading passer of all time and for guys who passed out at
the thought of facing an NFL defense (anyone remember Jeff
Carlson?).
</P>
<P>
   When Sinatra sang ``That's Life,'' he could have had Irving
Fryar in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Through all those years and so many of his troubles, Fryar was
always a couple of things. He was, even in his worst moments, a
good guy who hurt only himself and he was always an unselfish
football player.
</P>
<P>
   Not an unselfish wide receiver. Fryar was an unselfish football
player, which is not something that can be said of every wide
receiver who ever played, including some of the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays and too many nights during his nine years in New
England, Fryar was not always what a coach wanted, but _ with the
exception of one memorable afternoon when he became the only player
I've known in 24 years around the NFL to get into a car accident at
halftime _ he was that on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Irving Fryar was as unselfish a player as the
Patriots, Miami Dolphins, and now Philadelphia Eagles ever knew. On
Sunday, he ran as hard when he was a decoy as he did when he was
the primary receiver. On Sunday, he blocked as hard as he worked to
get open. On Sunday, Fryar played football the way it's supposed to
be played.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he will play his last. Although at 36 there is still a
place for him in the NFL, it is no longer the place he wants to
occupy. After too many hits and too many patterns run recklessly
across the middle, after too many kick returns and too many games
played for bad teams, Fryar has decided to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   His last team, the Eagles, is as bad and as rudderless as some
of the ones he once toiled for in New England before he escaped to
Miami in 1993 and began a run of four trips to the Pro Bowl in five
years. During his second coming in Miami _ where he first found God
and then found himself _ Fryar regularly put on the kind of
performances that had been projected for him in 1984, when the
Patriots made him the first wide receiver in history selected with
the first pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years of being drafted, he was to go to his first Pro
Bowl _ as a fearless punt returner _ and few thought it would be
eight years before he would return. By the time that next trip
came, few thought he'd ever make it there again.
</P>
<P>
   Too much happened between 1985 and his escape from New England,
and there's no need to repeat it all Sunday. Suffice it to say,
life was harder than football for Fryar in those years, but I can
still remember meeting him at his mother's house in Mt. Holly,
N.J., just after the draft and finding him to be as charming as a
young athlete could be.
</P>
<P>
   He remained that even in his darkest days, when drugs and a
fascination with street life he now admits could have been fatal
nearly consumed him. That afternoon in Mt. Holly, Fryar's mother
talked of her deep faith and so did her son. He had sung in the
church choir and learned to play five instruments there, and
fortunately a trail blazed on the right path by his mother when he
was young went deep enough to save him in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Fryar is one of only four licensed preachers in the NFL and,
reports say, one of its best. That comes as no surprise, because
when Fryar put his many God-given gifts to work at something, few
could stay with him. As things turned out, that was true even for
Beelzebub, because Fryar outmaneuvered even the Devil in his last
days in New England and then broke away from him and into the open
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Fryar the Fabulous was free to emerge, and he did,
registering 1,000 yards receiving four times in five years between
1993-97 and barely missing that mark (910) in the fifth. He even
got to do what few athletes ever do _ star for his hometown team in
Philadelphia for two years before age and the heavy weight of
defeat seemed to slow him this season.
</P>
<P>
   That brought him some criticism in a season when there was
little else for the Eagles, but this time he deserved none of it.
Perhaps he had grown too old. Perhaps his body took longer to heal
now than it used to, as Fryar's wife, Jackie, alluded to at his
retirement announcement. Perhaps he could no longer do on the field
what he once had done. But Fryar deserves no more criticism because
he has done what few of us ever do. He has made the most of
himself, not the least.
</P>
<P>
   He not only maximized his football skills but also became a man
instead of continuing to live the boy's life. He turned his life
around and then turned around more than a few others, and that has
meant more to him than all the pass receptions he ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has made so many of the latter that they cannot be
ignored. Few football fans in these parts might guess that Fryar
ranks seventh all-time in receptions with 781, eighth all-time in
yardage with 11,947, 11th all-time in 100-yard games with 32, 15th
all-time in touchdowns with 77 and, perhaps most telling of all,
second all-time to Jerry Rice in receptions after the age of 30
with 473.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some in New England who will fume that had he
started his resurrection earlier, the Patriots might have won more
games and perhaps even a championship by now, but that is
small-time thinking. He did it his way, Fryar did, and it has
worked out and that's why everyone should be rooting for him to
become on the football field what he has never been before.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day, Fryar should be selfish. He needs to demand the
ball and the Eagles need to throw it to him because if he can make
five more receptions for 53 more yards he will reach two more
milestones. He will have made 50 catches or more for the ninth
straight season and become only the eighth player in history to
gain 12,000 yards on pass receptions.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Fryar could go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame with
those kinds of numbers. He'd already be a shoo-in in Cooperstown,
where numbers mean everything. It may be more difficult in Canton,
where your team's play counts for something, too, but it will be
difficult for anyone to justify keeping him out if he can reach
those final milestones and he can be sure he has at least one vote
when the time comes if he needs it because he's won it both with
the way he's played and with the way he's lived.
</P>
<P>
   Fryar has a lot to be proud of Sunday, his final day in the NFL.
He has numbers and the change he made from devil's disciple to
God's warrior and he has one more thing. He has the assurance that
his last request has already been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I want to be remembered?'' Fryar asked last week. ``As
a football player. Not just a receiver, but a guy who blocked, who
was a decoy when he was supposed to be, who tackled when he had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all of that and more. He was a man Sinatra could sing
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record shows
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the blows
</P>
<P>
   ``And did it my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was my way.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the hard way sometimes but, in the end, it was
the right way, too, because look where it has led Rev. Irving
Fryar. It led him back home to Mt. Holly with the same wife and
four kids he started out with. It led him home with numbers they
can all be proud of beside his name.
</P>
<P>
   If that's life, it's been a good one, so here's hoping when the
last day of his NFL life is over, Irving Fryar will have those five
catches and the 53 yards he wants so badly.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, he's earned 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Good omen for the Patriots Sunday. After a five-game stretch in
which the Jets' defense allowed only 206.4 yards a game, it has
given up an average of 366.7 the past three weeks ... Bad omen for
the Patriots Sunday. According to the Elias Sports Bureau,  &UR; Bill
Parcells's  &LR; teams are 48-0 when entering the fourth quarter with at
least a 10-point lead ... The Arizona Cardinals ran up the
inflation flag a bit higher last week when they signed 24-year-old
quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer  &LR; to a four-year extension that carried
with it the largest signing bonus in NFL history, $15 million. The
previous largest bonus was $12.99 million given to  &UR; Deion Sanders
 &LR; by the Dallas Cowboys and the largest ever handed out by the
Cardinals had been $10.491 million to No. 1 pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth
 &LR; in September. Perhaps out of sympathy for Cardinals owner  &UR; Bill
Bidwell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Arizona fans went out and bought up more than 7,000
tickets for Sunday's game with San Diego that could put the
Cardinals into the playoffs for the first time since 1982.
Plummer's teammate  &UR; Chris Dishman  &LR; put into perspective just what
that bonus meant: ``He could buy my whole town (Cozad, Neb.). But
he deserves it. He's going to take the team a long way.'' Plummer
will receive the bonus in two parts. The first $11.25 million is
payable next year, and the remaining $3.75 million comes in 2000.
One reason Plummer got all that cash now is that he led the
Cardinals to eight come-from-behind victories in his first 24
starts, the last coming 24 hours before he signed his new deal when
he found a way to beat the New Orleans Saints, 19-17, last Sunday.
The other reason is that by getting the deal done before the end of
this season, Arizona can count $3 million of the bonus against this
year's salary cap ... For those of you keeping score at home,
 &UR; Terrell Davis's  &LR; quest to break  &UR; Eric Dickerson's  &LR; single-season
rushing record hit some major roadblocks the past two weeks and it
will take a gargantuan effort for him to make it now. Davis still
leads the NFL with 1,830 yards rushing but he has been held under
100 two of the past three games and fell far off the pace to match
Dickerson's 2,105 when he rushed for just 29 yards against the
Dolphins last Monday night. Davis needs 275 yards Sunday to tie
Dickerson. Don't count on that ... Being a No. 2 pick and a running
back does not bode well if you're a Saint. Last year, coach  &UR; Mike
Ditka  &LR; cut  &UR; Mario Bates &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a running back the Saints had taken on
the second round in 1994. This year he did the same to  &UR; Ray
Zellars &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the team's No. 2 selection in 1995.

   Buffalo's decision to go to a spread offense has paid big
dividends. Coach  &UR; Wade Phillips  &LR; believes spread formations have
been a big part of the Bills' remarkable resurgence under  &UR; Doug
Flutie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who made them the first team in history to reach the
playoffs after starting 0-3. The spread, with one back and four
receivers or no back and five receivers littered from sideline to
sideline, gives Flutie a faster look at what defense he is facing
and hence more time to figure out how to beat it, Phillips
believes. Yet the spread hasn't hurt running back  &UR; Antowain
Smith &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is seventh in the AFC with 1,082 rushing yards. Bills
fullback  &UR; Sam Gash  &LR; concedes that 1,000 yards doesn't mean what it
used to because of the 16-game schedule but argues, ``What it does
mean is that your running game is effective. It's the barrier that
separates the good running backs from the average ones.'' ... As
many as nine new head coaches could be in the league next fall,
which shows just how dangerous a job it is running an NFL team. But
one who survived was St. Louis's  &UR; Dick Vermeil &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who sadly has
seemed overmatched since returning to the NFL. So why is he back?
It would have cost the Rams $5.7 million to buy him out, a
circumstance that made him look a lot better to  &UR; Georgia Frontiere
 &LR; and  &UR; John Shaw  &LR; than his record does ... It looks as though  &UR; John
Kent Cooke  &LR; will not succeed his father as owner of the Redskins.
Word is his bid to buy the team from his father's estate was not
among the top four offers last week. Two of the groups in the
bidding were also in the Cleveland horse race and a third has
ex-Redskin coach  &UR; Joe Gibbs  &LR; as a partner ... Apparently rookie
linebacker  &UR; Travian Smith  &LR; took a lot of heat in Oakland last week
for his zealousness. He had been promoted from the practice squad
and was so fired up to play against the Chargers that he was in
full uniform at his locker 90 minutes before the game. While
everyone else was still in shorts and T-shirts, Smith sat silently
in full gear, staring into space. ``When I looked over at him, it
just cracked me up,'' said receiver  &UR; Tim Brown &LR; . Reports are Smith
played well when he got the chance.

CLOSING GAPS A FULL TIME JOB FOR SELIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bud Selig probably wakes up a lot of mornings wondering why
anyone would agree to become the commissioner of baseball. Life was
a lot simpler when he had only the Milwaukee Brewers to oversee.
His six-year stint as acting commissioner was mostly a labor of
love.
</P>
<P>
   But while his relations are better now with the Players
Association, Selig is quick to admit that being full-time
commissioner is in many ways more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget that the battle between unrestrained owners
and overzealous players once boiled down to simple language. Owners
wanted salary caps, players didn't. Owners wanted revenue sharing
and high thresholds before the so-called luxury taxes kicked in.
But since the end of last season, clubs have tossed around millions
upon millions in pursuit of an elusive World Series trip. From the
commissioner's view, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is a disparity problem,'' says Selig, who has
turned over the reins of the Brewers to his daughter. ``One that
has seriously escalated over the past 2-3 years and especially the
last few months. I have every confidence that we will deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we do have the process of putting revenue sharing
in place. I don't think people really realize what that means. It
becomes fully implemented in the year 2000 but it does jump up some
next year. That's when we'll send $140 million from the top six to
the bottom six. Plus, there are a series of internal controls that
will deal with this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the problem is in the eye of the beholder. You won't
find new Dodger Kevin Brown or his agent, Scott Boras, complaining
about the $107 million contract the pitcher signed to leave San
Diego. And why did anybody think Mo Vaughn would decline an $80
million offer from Anaheim? The stakes are too high. Both Fox
(which owns the Dodgers) and Disney (Angels) want baseball's
greatest show to come to Southern California. All the previous
regimes wanted was to win. The new bosses want to create a
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The moving of two New York teams to California decades ago is
peanuts compared with the maneuverings on the West Coast these
days.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching the World Series last season, the San Diego Padres
impressed their fans enough to get a new stadium. Yet by losing
several key players _ Brown, Steve Finley, Joey Hamilton _ the
Padres could find themselves relegated again to also-ran status.
According to figures calculated by management's Player Relations
Committee and reported by the Associated Press, San Diego had a
payroll of $52.9 million, ninth-highest in the majors. And in
January the Padres must go to arbitration to sign three pitchers:
Sterling Hitchcock, Dan Mecir, and Woody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That's show business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt that for many years baseball would repress all its
problems,'' said Selig. ``A kind of `we'll think about it next year
philosophy.' We can't do that anymore. Owners also have to
understand we can't have a work stoppage. So this has to be solved
in very creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there are people who are concerned about the
economics of baseball. It was one of the reasons I took this job. I
can promise one thing. The whole problem of disparity in economics
is something that has to be dealt with, and more importantly will
be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   The top six payrolls last year were Baltimore ($73.9 million),
New York Yankees ($73.8 million), Texas ($62.1 million), Atlanta
($61.7 million), Los Angeles ($60.7 million), and Boston ($59.3
million). The low six were Minnesota ($22 million), Cincinnati
($20.7 million), Florida ($19.1 million), Oakland ($18.5 million),
Pittsburgh ($13.6 million), and Montreal ($8.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been like this,'' said Selig. ``There was always
concern about disparity, but in the late '80s other teams were
winning. Minnesota was winning. Milwaukee and Kansas City were both
very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, there are a lot of things the commissioner can do to
try to deal with this. Like always, the solution will come from a
myriad of sources and I'm very confident we can do it. The clubs _
big, medium, and small _ all understand this is a problem that has
to be dealt with. I've had no resistance from anybody on that
concept. Now, when we get into separate plans, that's a different
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras recently said it does not surprise him that people are
upset about the high prices demanded by players. But it goes with
the territory, he added, and those seeking quality talent should
expect to be asked for the fair market price _ even if that price
is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to shoot the messenger when the message is
frustrating,'' said Boras. ``But I operate in the area of truth.
When I said I had the offers (for Brown and Bernie Williams),
everyone scoffed and said, `That's crazy!' In the end, everyone
responded to the market and even exceeded the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet next time when we say we have certain years and terms,
teams are going to not question it. My job is to carry that
bulletproof vest and go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners will be going through it in their quarterly meetings in
San Diego in two weeks. The creativity necessary for modern
solutions could come from a new source. Central Baseball, as the
New York office is now called, is headed by Sandy Alderson and Paul
Beeston, former top executives in Oakland and Toronto,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've created for the first time in the central office
that not only a lot of momentum but a different attitude than we've
ever had,'' said Selig. Between the three of us we have 66 years of
experience in running franchises. Baseball has never had that
before. Each one of these people along with Rob Manfred and several
others really bring insight to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice part of doing this job after running a franchise is
that there are no secrets. I'm not surprised at anything and
neither are they. I had six years as commissioner before I took
this job. So nobody could go into a job with more knowledge and
understanding of the people problems. I feel a greater sense of
responsibility now. I understand that as painful as some of the
solutions may be, we've got to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the most innocent questions provoke the most
interesting answers. Asked if the Red Sox had any interest in
 &UR; Ramon Martinez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the older brother of Boston's ace, general
manager  &UR; Dan Duquette  &LR; said that, in a perfect world, he'd like to
have  &UR; Pedro &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Ramon, and a third brother,  &UR; Jesus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has
pitched briefly in the majors, most recently with Cincinnati.
Trouble is, Ramon and Jesus are free agents recovering from
shoulder operations. Few clubs may gamble on them at  &UR; today &LR; 's
prices, although the Red Sox might be an exception. The Dodgers
don't think Ramon will be able to pitch until around the All-Star
break, and they are confident he will re-sign with them. ``You
never know,'' said Duquette. ``It would be great to see all three
brothers wearing a Red Sox uniform.'' Sure ... Hopefully,  &UR; Roger
Clemens  &LR; learned a valuable lesson in his failed attempt to escape
Toronto by forcing a trade. No matter how many Cy Young Awards he
wins, the bottom line is money, and if the numbers don't come out
right, the same people who were singing his praises will turn
against him. Still, he may wind up somewhere else, only this time,
he'll know it's not just because somebody out there likes him. He
should try Arizona. Ownership just spent $108 million for three
players _  &UR; Randy Johnson &LR; , &UR; Steve Finley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre &LR; .
We know that Diamondbacks owner  &UR; Jerry Colangelo &LR;  can afford it.
Remember, the Florida Marlins made it to the World Series in only
their fifth year of existence ... As far as I'm concerned, it's
still a dead heat between home run hitters  &UR; Mark McGwire  &LR; of St.
Louis and  &UR; Sammy Sosa  &LR; of the Cubs. Sosa showed his true grit in
going to the Far East and talking the Japanese into building 1,000
prefab homes for hurricane victims in his native Dominican
Republic. Last week, McGwire came through with the first donations
in an ambitious plan to provide $1 million annually for three years
to benefit abused children. McGwire sent out four checks of
$175,000, two to charities in St. Louis and two more in Southern
California. The two sluggers should have been on the cover of Time
magazine, not Sports Illustrated.

UCLA TRIES TO FORGET MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA guard Andy Meyers completed the purge
Wednesday afternoon when he grabbed reserve quarterback Drew
Bennett by the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers had no quarrel with Bennett, but his T-shirt had to go.
So after the Bruins' final pre-Christmas practice, dowsed in bright
sun and holiday spirit, Meyers playfully grabbed Bennett and ripped
the shirt off his back.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``Hurricane Bowl'' shirt, gray, with UCLA and Miami
logos on the back, along with the date that will live in infamy in
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last one in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bennett didn't think I was serious at first, until I grabbed
him,'' Meyers said a few minutes later, the shredded T-shirt
dangling from his pants. ``I'm going to make sure it goes in the
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Meyers hopes, the Bruins severed all remaining
physical ties to the costliest loss in school history _ a loss they
can neither forget nor explain, but must overcome. If they walk
into the Rose Bowl on Friday with Miami on their minds, they'll
have Wisconsin stamped on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear stories about teams getting embarrassed and not
getting up for the next game, and then getting embarrassed again,''
Bruins quarterback Cade McNown said. ``As soon as the past starts
affecting your future, you have to change your mindset . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in the Rose Bowl and how we respond will dictate
what sort of season it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been an easy month for the Bruins. After a 20-game
winning streak, they had forgotten what losing felt like. The 49-45
collapse in Miami on Dec. 5 unleashed a fury of emotion _ players
in shock, players in tears, offense blaming defense, defense
feeling the blame. Meyers, a senior captain, was smack in the
middle of it, angry, outspoken and critical as he sat by his locker
in the bowels of the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Meyers was also one of the first to start the healing
process. On the long, quiet flight home, he walked the aisles and
spoke with several players about what had gone wrong and what was
ahead. He offered an honest critique and words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Meyers met with several defensive players in a
conference room in the Morgan Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't apologize,'' he said. ``It was more about what we had
to do to get tighter. Hey, they're used to me popping off. They
know what I said was not unfounded, and I didn't rip any
individuals. I think it helped the team. It brought us to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, the winning streak's over, the national
championship's over, but the Rose Bowl's not over.' That's what
we've got on our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The healing progressed at different rates for different players.
For some, the pain lasted a few days. For some, it lingered until
the following weekend, when the Bruins assembled for their first
Rose Bowl practice. A few needed the urgency of exams to break free
from the funk.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 23, when Meyers ripped off Bennett's T-shirt and the
Bruins scattered for Christmas, they seemingly had turned their
collective gaze from Miami to Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the Fiesta, in with the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids always bounce back; they're more resilient than
coaches,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be fine. The last game is so important to win.
For the seniors, it gives you a good feeling to finish your career.
And it's good for the younger guys going into the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fiesta Bowl meant everything, the Bruins have come to
realize the Rose Bowl means (begin ital)something(end ital). It's a
chance to win a school-record 11th game. (Five UCLA teams have won
10.) It's a chance to win the school's first Rose Bowl since 1986
and a chance to improve on the No. 5 national ranking, hence
bettering last year's finish.
</P>
<P>
   For 105 players who have never participated in the Rose Bowl,
who have never eaten at Lawry's Beef Bowl or done Disneyland or
toured Universal Studios or run across the giant rose in the middle
of the field, the game has meaning. Until this year, after all, the
Rose Bowl was UCLA's No. 1 goal.
</P>
<P>
   The prestige hasn't faded. The Bruins just needed a few weeks to
put Miami in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flipping channels the other day and I found the 1980
Rose Bowl game with USC and Ohio State,'' said Bruins freshman
linebacker Ryan Nece, whose father, ex-Trojan Ronnie Lott, played
in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this. It's No. 1 (Ohio State) against No. 3
(USC) and they're going at it. There are great players, Charles
White, Marcus Allen, my dad's in it. I saw the rose in the middle
and the stands were packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking, `We're going to be there.' It's what I
always wanted to play in since I was little. People ask us, `Are
you ready?' We're definitely ready.''

WASHINGTON: out censure. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And even Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has said that he wants
to see a vote on the two articles of impeachment sent by the House
before any talk of censure, could turn out to be the ultimate
pragmatist. He has denounced Clinton's ``reprehensible behavior.''
But as the head of the Senate Republicans' re-election effort in
2000, he will have 19 Republicans to shepherd to re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Senate's strongest conservatives calculate that
they would rather see the president censured than simply acquitted,
says a Republican aide close to the social conservative movement.
Most lawmakers apparently think the Senate, with 55 Republicans,
will never be able to reach the 67 votes necessary to remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't support censure to replace the trial process or in
any way impede us from moving to a trial,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard,
R-Colo. ``But once you've had the trial, then afterward I could
possibly support censure.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Democratic Party appears unified against Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Passions have cooled since August, when the president first
confessed to an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica
Lewinsky, after seven months of denials. Lieberman, a longtime ally
in the ``New Democrat'' movement, called the president's conduct
``disgraceful'' and ``immoral.'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., often at odds with Clinton over policy, also criticized his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But both men are now supporting censure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, an 81-year-old Democrat from West Virginia and
the unofficial historian of the Senate, is another unpredictable
personality fiercely jealous of the prerogatives of the Senate. He
has already sent a sharp warning to the White House that any
censure measure that is worked out should not involve ``any entity
beyond the current membership of the U.S. Senate.'' But Byrd is
indeed speaking with Senate colleagues about the wisest course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also surprised Republicans who had predicted that he
would be a strict constitutionalist and insist the Senate have a
trial. Last week, he left the door open to the possibility that
there could be ``some other solution.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are Democrats who think there should
not be a censure deal _ or at least not unless Clinton first
defeats the two articles of impeachment in Senate votes.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he had been telling the president's aides: ``You
guys have got to get a grip here. Quit pushing for censure. You
don't want to be the only president in history to be impeached and
have it hang over your head the rest of your life. You want to be
exonerated.'' (Andrew Johnson, the one other president to be
impeached, was spared conviction by the Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the maneuvering, senators have been become cautious
about predicting events in the aftermath of the House's vote for
impeachment, once considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this trial starts, anything can happen,'' Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said last week. ``I think that already we've seen
so many turns and twists in the road, and I think we're going to
see a lot more.''

   What would it mean to the world, to our lives, to politics,
economics, culture, if growing old as we know it becomes a thing of
the past?
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if an elixir were discovered that, when
injected into the heart, the brain, the liver, the kid neys, would
rebuild old tissue with new cells?
</P>
<P>
   And what if such an elixir were to become plentiful long before
we were really ready for it _ before we under stood how to shift
the world from a culture based on limited life spans to one based
on extended lives?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that era is at hand. Over the next 20 years, new
elixirs are likely to revolutionize medicine and aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impossible is possible,'' said Richard Sprott, former head
of the Biology of Aging section of the National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a breakthrough announced last month. Researchers
in Wisconsin and Maryland said they have grown embryonic stem cells
that can form any of the 210 kinds of cells in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Such cells are derived from the all-purpose tissue of very early
human embryos. The expectation is that when they are injected into
an aging or diseased organ, they will rejuvenate the tissue by
forming more new cells.
</P>
<P>
   New heart muscle, for example, could be generated with an
injection instead of a heart transplant. Subse quent injections
could keep the organ youthful. Eventually, scientists say, the
method could be used on and under the skin so that, for your 50th
high school reunion, you still look a lot like your graduation
photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Within the next five years, scien tists will be injecting
embryonic cells into animals to see if they renew heart muscles and
tissues of other organs. If science progresses at its current pace,
that therapy could be cheap and plentiful in about 15 years,
predicts Dr. Thomas Okarma, vice president of Geron Corp. in Menlo
Park, Calif., which is responsible for research that could affect
age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its cell immor talization technology could
supply ``an unlimited number of young cells and tissues for every
organ in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Such scientific breakthroughs are part of a multibillion-dollar
race for the future of medicine being played out in private labs
around the world. Serious scientists are talking about cures for
cancer, controlling Alzhei mer's disease and advancing major
assaults on the processes of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are pepped up as I have never seen them,'' said
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Penn sylvania. ``They are somewhere between gaga and
drooling over the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic interviewed scientists, ethicists and
experts in volved in aging research, asking 10 questions aimed at
finding when the breakthroughs may affect our lives. At the very
least, they said, more of us are headed for a world of extended
life spans, with the prom ise of better health and improved mental
powers well into our 80s, 90s, 100s and beyond. Some of today's
children may live to be 130.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the advances stand to affect our aging in
ways that go far beyond vitamins and face lifts:
</P>
<P>
   Within five years we will have the blueprint of the gene
structure of the human body. Out of that will come new medicines
and gene therapies, individually designed for each of us.
</P>
<P>
   Not in five years, but in 25 years, computer chips could be
implanted in people's brains to enhance mem ory, Caplan predicts.
By 2025, he sees the start of the first implant technology.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs also could enhance memory and fire up neurons in the
brain, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look just to the most touted areas of research for ad
vances, said Dr. Michael Rose, a geneticist at the University of
Cali fornia-Irvine who has doubled the lives of fruit flies in his
laboratory through gene therapy. ``Expect the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older people are already healthier, feeling and looking
younger than their parents were at the same age because of
lifestyle and medical advances of the past 30 years. But now,
instead of simply understanding the ailments of old age, more
research is directed toward mastering their root causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention is turning toward slowing, postponing or preventing
aging,'' said Dan Perry, executive director of the National
Alliance of Aging Research in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthroughs are so aston ishing that many involved, afraid
to sound like quacks or stock promot ers, are downplaying the
implica tions of their work. Things are moving faster than anyone
antici pated, Sprott notes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Human Genome Proj ect _ mapping the structure of human
DNA _ started 10 years ago, some scientists predicted that it would
require 50 years to complete the analysis of all 3 billion chemical
pairs that lay down the blueprints for the human body. Supercomput
ers and billion-dollar machines ded icated to the project have
moved up the finish date to five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, doctors will be able to review your genes
and mix drugs especially suited to your DNA. People could find out
at 25 whether they are candidates for osteoporosis and take the
necessary steps to ward it off.
</P>
<P>
   From Perry's point of view, sci ence can't move too fast. The
advances, for example, could help society cope with the aging of
the baby boom generation without breaking the bank, he said. By
2030, the bill for Alzheimer's dis ease could quadruple if means
aren't found to control it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still debating how to pay for nursing home services
based on the biology of today's 80-year-olds, and we're debating
whether to more quickly raise the eligible retirement age from 65
to 67, or to make wealthy individuals pay more for Medicare. That's
just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,'' he said. ``We
should be doing every thing we can to enhance the mental and
physical vitality of older peo ple . . . to avoid some diseases in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate can shift into a new gear, people will have to
understand the wild possibilities of the new medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people see aging as miserable _ not much can be done,''
Caplan said. ``That's why Jack Kevorkian looks more attrac tive
than all the stem cell research. People don't realize what the bio
logical revolution holds in terms of better old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older and ill people, fol lowing the action on new medicine
via Web sites and health magazines, are hoping science will provide
miracles in time for them.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so happy about the progress, especially when it
seems to touch on the use of tissue from donated human embryos, or
where it seems to horn in on God's job description. The scientists
claim they are playing God no more than did the doctors who
introduced antibiotics and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring all this out with the brains God gave us,'' one
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Because anti-aging techniques have attracted quackery since the
first wrinkle appeared on the first human, many people doubt that
any real victory over aging is possible. Separating the real from
the balo ney, especially in media reports, is difficult. Members of
Congress, charged with regulating the outer limits of medical
research, don't know what to believe either.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government currently will not fund biomedical
research involving the use of fetal tissues, which are essential to
stem cell advances. Congress is expected to revisit the question of
fetal tissue bans this coming year or face the loss of major
research labs to overseas locations. As material iden tical to
fetal tissue can now be reproduced in laboratories, the ban may
soon become a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beginning to occur to some members of Congress that they
may have jumped too quickly in blocking this research material,''
Sprott said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal stem cells could someday help treat everything from
strokes to brain diseases, the promise of which will be politically
irresistible, ac cording to Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   The demographic arrival of the baby boomers has shifted interest
and funds toward aging research. The budget for the federally
funded National Institute on Aging has gone from $1 million to $590
mil lion in 25 years. Over the next five years the budget of the
National Institutes of Health is expected to double.
</P>
<P>
   But not all scientists are joyful about the new medicine and its
potential effects on our lives.
</P>
<P>
   There will be new worries, says Dr. Frank Williams of Rochester,
N.Y., scientific director of the American Federation of Aging Re
search, which funds biomedical re search. A former director of the
National Institute on Aging, he worries that the chemicals we will
load into our bodies to fight aging might do damage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about the widespread use of genetic
test ing. ``The question is, how will it be used and what
precautions will there be? What guidelines?''
</P>
<P>
   And he wonders who will have access to the new advances. Most
agree that the rich get better care now, and that is likely to be
true in the future. But Williams believes it ultimately might be
simpler and cheaper to inject someone with new cells than to treat
the conditions of ``old-fashioned'' aging.
</P>
<P>
   The gold rush for breakthroughs may cause a leapfrog problem,
according to Williams. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer and heart
dis ease might be controlled, allowing people to live longer. But
if the accumulating annoyances of an ag ing body, such as bladder
control, vision, hearing and digestion are not addressed, people's
quality of life may not be high enough to allow productive and
enjoyable living even if a few extra years are added to their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting these smaller, non-fa tal problems may get lost in
the shuffle of privatized, profit-based research efforts, he fears.
They won't offer short-term returns on the stock market as some of
the bigger developments will.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan also worries that just as Alzheimer's didn't show up
until people started to live longer, other diseases hiding in our
genes may show themselves as we continue to lengthen the human life
span.
</P>
<P>
   The end of aging as we know it will create enormous social
disrup tions, predicted Michael Fossel, a medical doctor, professor
at Michi gan State University and editor of the Journal of
Anti-Aging Medicine who is finishing a new book on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are things going to change, but they are going to
change in unpredictable ways,'' he said. ``Right now we have a
clear idea of what our life is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But as life spans soon increase, many more people will have
second and third careers, and as many marriages. Retirement may
lose its meaning in a world of brain boost ing and muscle and bone
restora tion.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hopes the promises of better health and a longer life
span will be accompanied by creative ideas about what to do with
the extra time.
</P>
<P>
   The medical establishment could be turned on its head, Fossel
said. Medical specialties in the future could be limited to two:
trauma (the treatment of injuries) and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   While most scientists surveyed were optimistic about all the ad
vances, Rose, of UC-Irvine, said progress will be slow,
particularly because of problems in the biotech marketplace and
with government regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither sector really cares about anti-aging, only dollars and
votes. But progress will occur because too many people want
anti-aging therapies and too much progress is being made,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswerable question is: At what rate? said Dr. Leonard Hay
flick, who did landmark work on the cell 35 years ago. Only
recently have scientists built on his work, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projecting back in time is a good way of projecting what the
future will be like,'' he said. ``In 1970 we thought we knew it
all, and now we look back and realize how little we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back further in time: At the beginning of the 20th
century, air travel, television, radio and antibiotics were
unknown. They all came within the first decades of the century in
an avalanche of change.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists say another avalanche of change is under way,
opening the new century with a wholly new kind of medicine for an
aging world. &QL;

ANTI-AGING CONVENTION BIG ON HYPE, SHORT ON RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ America's bio-medical community is closing in at a
feverish pace on the secrets of aging and disease. If its
methodical and well-funded approach looks like a NASA moon shot, be
advised that there are also others _ a Wild West fringe group of
anti-aging treatment promoters _ whose Las Vegas gathering earlier
this month at moments looked more like a Star Trek convention than
serious science.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine's annual program
drew 3,000 doctors, scientists and customers from around the world.
It was a free-for-all for the wilder thinkers and promoters of
anti-aging's robust frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the presentations and exhibits were credible and
professional in tone. Some left you speechless with their daring
claims and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider them the creative, right brain scientists,'' said
Doe Gentry, a sleek 58-year-old television personality from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Elegant in black, with her blonde hair pulled back from a
glowing face, she is a walking advertisement for successful aging.
She cruised the convention in search of topics for her cable
television show, ``Single in LA,'' where she offers advice on
anti-aging to a potential audience of 4 million single Southern
Californians. &QL; 
`LOT OF HYPE HERE'
</P>
<P>
   She was a believer, though she rolled her eyes at some of the
pitches. One firm offering the latest embryonic stem cell
injections offshore for the modest fee of $10,000 to $25,000 made
her wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my doubts about that one,'' she said. ``How would you
ever know what you were really getting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hype here,'' she said, adding that some
comment that money, not science, is a driving force behind the
show. Compared with last year, the number of new brain supplements
are the big new thing, she said. She thinks there are benefits to
be derived from some of the hormonal products, however.
</P>
<P>
   Many university and institute scientists avoid the meeting for
fear of being linked with ``the Las Vegas crowd.'' As it is, the
field offers any scientist enough opportunities to be branded as a
quack. The more sober scientists criticize the frontier folks for
having ``boundless enthusiasm tempered by a little research.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A word like ``immortality,'' rarely appearing in ``Science,
Nature'' or the ``Journal of the American Medical Association,'' is
frequently heard at the Vegas conference. &QL; 
TIME IS THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   The Vegas participants, in turn, criticize mainstream science as
taking too much time to give the public the fruits of available
research. One current line in the sand between the two groups is
drawn over the use of human growth hormone: The American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine (sponsors of the Las Vegas conference) is
accrediting a new medical specialty _ anti-aging medicine, which
relies heavily on prescribing human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Their proof that it works is largely based on a 1990 research
study by the late Daniel Rudman of the University of Wisconsin. He
reported that growth hormone injections over six months reversed
aging in a group of older men.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want more solid evidence, a 30-year study is under
way. That difference in caution vs. impatience is the primary
difference between traditional researchers and the anti-aging
wildcatters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most baby boomers and older folks agree that waiting
30 years for an anti-aging miracle drug isn't any fun. If it seems
to work, let's get some and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular speakers in Las Vegas was Dr. Eugene
Shippen, author of ``The Testosterone Syndrome, ''which links the
maintenance of testosterone levels in men with the preservation of
youthful vitality and health. He was surrounded by men with
hundreds of questions for two hours following his talk. &QL; 
CLONING, FREEZING
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speaker Dr. Richard Seed of Chicago told the group that
human clones will ``be on the ground in two years _ two and a half,
tops,'' and he thinks they will be the key to the quest for
rejuvenation. As he spoke, a middle-aged woman in a miniskirt
hooted and howled approval, as if the 60-something Seed were Mick
Jagger at a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   On the same panel was Fred Chamberlain of Scottsdale, president
of Alcor, a leader in the cryo-suspension technology. Alcor has 35
frozen heads or bodies in its high-tech fridges, and is considering
establishing a DNA archive, where a person could the blueprints for
future cloning.
</P>
<P>
   When Alcor started its business a decade ago, the possible
outcomes for a frozen head or body were uncertain at best. Science
seems to be catching up with the idea that something can be done
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Although most university scientists are notoriously tight-lipped
about their research until it has been tested and peer reviewed,
some Las Vegas exhibitors and conference goers routinely claim the
blue sky, giving the event a state fair atmosphere. Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers in electro-medicine have not just treated but
CURED 1,000 people of AIDS _ for $5 each. But that news is being
stifled because big drug companies are making $100,000 per patient
now. But we can't just sit on these things while people are dying .
. .'' So goes a not too unusual claim by one conference goer.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal stories of cancer patients who have been cured by this
or that product fall like snowflakes through the exhibit halls.
</P>
<P>
   For sale at the conference: A headband for $99 that gets rid of
depression and insomnia; a device that massages away your double
chin; a home oxidation kit to measure your oxidated stress level; a
gun-shaped home acupuncture kit for $129; your own oxygen chamber
for home or office. &QL; 
KEEPING AN OPEN MIND
</P>
<P>
   Among the skeptical but earnest shoppers was 42-year-old Thomas
Grauer of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my present age, and I want to stay here,'' &UR; said Grauer,
a private investigator. At the booths he was putting his
professional skills to use, asking each vendor questions and
gathering information to take home and do follow-up research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You have to have an open mind about all of this, he said, adding
that he had found good information among the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to age well has to take it in their own
hands,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the sessions and exhibits at the American Academy
of Anti-Aging Medicine is ``time''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to die young, very late in life _ I think that is what
we are all searching for here,'' said Dr. Tom Allen of Oklahoma
State University, one of the more moderate voices on the program.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the attendees that knowledge about medical advances
doubles every 3{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great if our wisdom did as much?'' he asked. &QL;

SANTA ANITA OPENS WITH BIG CROWD, BIG UPSETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ At least for one day, not all of the surprises at
Santa Anita Park came from Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   The track opened its first season under Stronach's ambitious
ownership with an afternoon of upsets Saturday, including a Malibu
Stakes victory by New York's Run Man Run and jockey Mike Luzzi,
confounding the big crowd of 42,348.
</P>
<P>
   Run Man Run emerged from a four-way duel for the early lead and
won the 7-furlong race by 2{ lengths over Artax as unbeaten Event
of the Year finished two lengths back in third. Sea of Secrets
(fifth) and Old Topper (sixth) were the other stars in a 10-horse
field of 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year was favored in his first start since a knee
fracture kept him out of the Kentucky Derby, and after sweating
nervously on his way to the gate, he ran well to be beaten only by
fitter horses.
</P>
<P>
   Run Man Run (who paid $29.20) came out of a Nov.26 allowance
victory at Aqueduct. The son of Theatrical is only the second Grade
I stakes winner for trainer Anthony Margotta Jr. (who won the 1993
Whitney with Brunswick).
</P>
<P>
   ``The race went a little bit different than planned,'' said
Luzzi, who'd planned to drop in behind the front-runners after
starting from an outside gate. ``But that's what we're out there
for, to improvise, and I had to improvise a little bit down the
backstretch. He broke so sharp, I just threw our plans right out
the window.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Santa Anita victory for the New York-based
Luzzi _ on a day filled with firsts.
</P>
<P>
   Both maiden winners on the nine-race card were first-time
starters: Sasha's Prospect ($6.60) and Cape Canaveral ($12.80), D.
Wayne Lukas-trained sons of Mr. Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three turf-course winners were making their first
U.S. starts: French-bred Special Quest ($3.80) for trainer Richard
Mandella and Irish-bred Aliena ($11.80) for Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   Special Quest was the only winning favorite. The day began with
BJ Ballet, the first of jockey Alex Solis' three victories, going
wire to wire at $20.20. It ended with Half Past Ten coming from off
the pace under Octavio Vergara to win at $54. And in the middle,
Mountain Bike and Laffit Pincay sprang a $34 surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The result might be that much of the crowd, the largest in four
years for a Santa Anita opener, will be back today to chase a
$212,430 carryover in the pick-six.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-day meet continues today when stakes winners Brulay, with
Corey Nakatani riding, and Magical Allure, with Gary Stevens, meet
for the first time in the La Brea, the fillies' equivalent of the
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   On the 12:30 p.m. card, 1996 Santa Anita Derby winner
Cavonnier's on-again, off-again comeback from a tendon injury is
finally ``on.'' The 5-year-old from Bob Baffert's barn is entered
in a mile stakes called the Ack Ack.

CHASING YOUR YOUTH ISN'T CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a kid I hated report cards. Now, several decades later, I
still felt nervous as Dr. Charlene DeHaven held my test results and
got a funny look on her face. I knew I was in for it.
</P>
<P>
   While my birth certificate and driver's license say I'm 46, my
anti-aging report card, based on a battery of tests comparing my
reactions and biological conditions with those of about 2,500 other
American office workers, said I should really be putting 52 candles
on my cake. Thank you, Doc. Thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the point of doing all this _ finding my ``biological
age'' _ is to bring that number down. That is what DeHaven does for
a living.
</P>
<P>
   Her anti-aging medical practice in west Phoenix, soon moving to
an upscale Biltmore office, specializes in tests that estimate each
patient's biological age. She then uses that bench mark as a basis
for prescribing nutritional changes, lifestyle changes, vitamin and
hormone supplements and, coming someday, gene therapies. The goal
is to help people regain and retain their prime, and to provide
ongoing monitoring and cheerleading. &QL; 
GET OUT THE WALLET
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like just what you need, get out your wallet _ it's
almost as expensive as having someone work on your car. The battery
of tests and consultations she gives costs about $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   After that, monthly products and services can cost from $100 per
month to $800 or more. Prescribed hormone replacement therapy,
including human growth hormones, is a key ingredient in most
anti-aging clinical programs, including DeHaven's.
</P>
<P>
   The tests include a long interview about personal habits,
examining of blood and urine samples, a physical exam testing
reflexes, hearing and vision, and a battery of mental reaction
tests. That latter area is where I got old; I have never been one
for remembering which playing card was where.
</P>
<P>
   I was born at the leading edge of the baby boom _ the
youth-is-everything generation that is expected to descend on
clinics to try to hang on, by fingernails if necessary, to that
all-important youth. People in their 40s and 50s are the main
market for anti-aging clinics. The next biggest group are those in
their 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who see me in general are focused on their health,''
DeHaven said. ``Others see themselves slipping and want to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   I was, of course, not among the vain; I was just doing research.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in a long morning I was hooked up to a ``Bride of
Frankenstein'' electrical device that measured my body fat. The
fat-o-meter jumped to 20 percent, in the ``almost fabulous'' range.
Good machine.
</P>
<P>
   The whole deal required three visits, not including quarterly
follow-up appointments, which I did not sign up for because I am
not rich enough to stay that young. Note: Your health insurance
voice mail computer will laugh if you call to see if these tests
are covered. And when gene therapies come on the market that some
believe could really roll back aging, the only way to afford them
may be to own an anti-aging clinic yourself.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven and the other physicians now opening such clinics are
not your average family doctors. They are the advance guard of an
emerging specialty accredited by the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine. Along with more than 100 other doctors, DeHaven took
extensive certification tests at the academy's annual conference in
Las Vegas this month. It is not a specialty approved by the
American Medical Association, though many of the practitioners,
including DeHaven, are medical doctors and have specialties in
other areas. She is certified in internal medicine and emergency
medicine. &QL; 
WHAT TO EXPECT
</P>
<P>
   If you go in for the clinic experience, here's what to expect.
In addition to a family health history grilling, the physical exam
and the letting of various fluids, there are 12 tests that include
pushing a button when a zero turns to an eight, pushing a button
when a box stops vibrating, pushing a button when a tiny sound
stops, remembering a sequence of lights, that sort of thing. I was
horrible at it, and will try to be better about taking my vitamins
if I can please not have to do it again for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people enjoy the tests _ they find them fun,'' DeHaven
said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they weren't stressed out by their results that came
up instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 computerized tests, I only scored better than 50
percent, the average, &UR; on three.
</P>
<P>
   I did best in two tests where I blew into a tube and my lung
capacity and velocity were measured immediately. &QL; 
GETTING THE RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   My final appointment was two weeks later, and it was then that
DeHaven gave me the results of the blood and urine tests and
offered some medical advice on how to improve my longevity.
</P>
<P>
   This time the news was better. My risk factor for cardiovascular
disease _ or heart attacks and strokes _ was low based on blood
tests that measured levels of fats and antioxidants. I also had
great levels of growth hormone, folic acid and testosterone . . .
hmmm.
</P>

   ``I find a lot of career women have high levels of
testosterone,'' she said.

<P>
   Had I continued with the program, based on the results of my
tests, DeHaven said she would have designed a special vitamin
regime for me costing about $50 to $150 per month.

<P>
   ``Some people spend that much on vitamins now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Your co-workers, if they hear that you have been going to an
anti-aging clinic, will talk among themselves and wonder if you
don't look a lot younger, even if you have only been filling out
questionnaires and pushing buttons on things that buzz. Their
reactions are the fun part. Worth every penny. &QL;

WHAT NEXT FOR THE LOCKOUT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The NBA and its players have taken their labor war
into its final weeks. Commissioner David Stern has labeled Jan. 7
as the league's ``drop-dead'' date, the point of no return if the
season is to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But already, considerable damage has been done. Most fans are
apethetic about the league, as evidenced by an ``Arizona Republic''
reader poll last week. Only three percent of respondents said the
end of a lockout would be a great sports Christmas gift.
</P>
<P>
   If the season is saved, there will be questions about its
legitimacy. It will be an abbreviated schedule. And if it is lost,
it would give the NBA the unenviable honor of being the first
professional league to lose an entire season to a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long fall from last summer, when Michael Jordan hit the
final shot of the season to win Game 6 and eliminate Utah from The
NBA Finals, putting the finishing touch on Chicago's sixth NBA
championship of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There were many who wondered whether Jordan's shot would mark
the end of his career. Few would have believed that with Jordan's
final follow through he might also be waving goodbye to the NBA as
we have known it. At that point, the NBA had never even lost a game
to labor problems, much less a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been some damage,'' said Suns Coach Danny
Ainge. ``Obviously. How much has to be determined by the quality of
play, the character of our players when we do come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization, the players, everybody has to be on their
best behavior and build it back up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns President Jerry Colangelo, as a member of the NBA Labor
Committee and an active participant in negotiations, was reluctant
to discuss the lockout or its ramifications with the deadline
drawing near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I say right now isn't going to help,'' Colangelo
said. ``It's either going to happen, or it's not. This is
Armegeddon.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is how to divide up annual revenues
approaching $2 billion now, and expected to grow in the coming
years with new television contracts the league signed with Turner
Sports and NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But sports fans, jaded by past strikes and lockouts in the NFL,
NHL and especially Major League baseball, apparently just aren't
interested. It won't be easy to win them back, as baseball learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with it every day,'' said Houston's Mario Elie. ``Fans
asking me when we're going to have basketball. I have to answer
those questions every day. It's tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to win the fans back. That's part of the
job. You just have to try and do some extra things, like hold some
free clinics. You have to do something to try to give back to the
fans. Once football is over, there's going to be nothing on TV, and
the fans are really going to be mad then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, I'm starting to watch rodeo and crap like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge said the fans do care. They're just frustrated, like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the perception is out there,'' Ainge said. ``But
I've had a lot of people tell me they really miss the Suns. During
the fall with college football, pro football and then college
basketball all going on, it's easy to be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of issues still must be addressed, even if the owners
and players can work out their differences in the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If there is a season, how will it be structured?
</P>
<P>
   League sources indicate that the NBA has worked out a shortened
schedule. If the season began in the first week of February, teams
could play as many as nine games every two weeks. With that kind of
schedule, it would be possible to play a season of about 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, teams never play more than two nights in a row. They'll
have to play three nights in a row to make the scheduling work.
</P>
<P>
   And most, if not all games, will be played against conference
opponents. The Suns, for instance, might not play any Eastern
Conference teams such as the Bulls. The NHL did the same thing in
1994 during its shortened season. It provides an opportunity to
determine a truer conference championship, and then the NBA Finals
would pit the best of the East against the best of the West, as
usual. However, it could be their first meetings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team will not be able to face each other on a
home-and-away basis,'' said Deputy NBA Commissioner Russ Granik.
``You'd see more of a conference-type schedule with some mixing of
intra-conference games, but no team is going to see every other
team at home. That's going to be virtually impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What about the next draft?
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the draft order is determined by how well a team
performed during the season. The top 16 teams reach the playoffs,
and the rest are included in a in a weighted lottery to determine
the order. The worst teams get the most chances in the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the draft is ordered according to record _ the team
with the best record picks last.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no season, there is no order of finish from which to
determine the order. And even if there is a season, if teams aren't
playing against every other league team, is the season enough to
determine a draft order?
</P>
<P>
   The league could hold a full lottery, and weight it according to
how teams have done over the past three or four seasons. Or it
could simply rank the teams according to their winning percentage
over several years. If the season isn't cancelled, a combination
might be used _ the team's record in the shortened season and it's
winning percentage over the past two or three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What can players do if the season is cancelled?
 &UR; Will those who were to be in the final years of their contract
become
 &UR; free agents?
</P>
<P>
   A number of NBA players have been approached by European clubs,
and agent James Bryant of Houston has filed a lawsuit to free up
players to sign with those clubs without restriction.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why the NBA announced a drop-dead date of Jan. 7.
Those European teams must, unless the governing body of
international basketball _ FIBA - provides an extension, have their
rosters complete by Jan. 5 for players to be eligible for the
European Championships tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency may be a bigger sticking point. This year, there are
about 200 free agent players. That number would go above 300 _
around three quarters of the league _ if the season is cancelled
and players who would have been free agents at the end of the
season are granted that status.
</P>
<P>
   It could lead to a court battle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is it all worth it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about disastrous repercussions for everybody _
the players, the owners, the league,'' said Carl Scheer, a former
executive with the Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers and
Denver Nuggets in an interview with the ``Charlotte Observer.''
``It took baseball four years, plus an extraordinary season from
(Mark) McGwire and (Sammy) Sosa to recover from the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the so-called national pastime, and we don't even know
if baseball's recovery will be sustained. Basketball is popular,
but it has nothing like baseball's history and tradition. So you'd
have to assume it would take at leave five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheer said owners may have determined that it's worth risking a
season to roll back salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what they end up with, what deal is made,
after the season is canceled,'' he said. ``If you stabilize your
costs on a long-term basis, if the tail stops wagging the dog, then
maybe it is (worth cancelling the season).
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember, it's not just money they're figting over. It's
the power. It's the side issues, like behavior and image. It's
ridiculous, for instance, that marijuana isn't already part of the
drug policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo has said the character issues are his greatest
priority in this round of collective bargaining negotiations. The
incident in which Latrell Sprewell allegedly choked Golden State
Coach P.J. Carlesimo was a galvanizing force for the owners.
</P>
<P>
   But already the owners have gotten considerable concessions from
the players, and whatever deal is made is likely to turn the clock
back somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this deal, they want to set the standard for deals in the
future,'' said Spurs guard Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the NBA may be making a stand for all
professional sports leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the NHL, for example, Commissioner Gary Bettman _ who was
weened in the NBA _ reportedly is beginning to ammass a $300
million ``Labor Dispute Fund.'' And that league's collective
bargaining agreement does not expire until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   What the NBA is doing may be the wave of the future in
professional sports as owners try to stop salaries from spiraling
upward, and players attempt to retain their freedom to earn what
the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, they may all pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is damage,'' Ainge said. ``I just hope it's not
irrepairable damage.'' &QL;

IS DETROIT DYNASTY BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In other sports, they call it a ``threepeat'' when a team wins
three straight championships.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey, they should call it a natural hat trick. That's what
the Detroit Red Wings are shooting for this season, a feat that
hasn't been accomplished since the New York Islanders won four
consecutive Cups from 1980 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, there are concerns in Hockeytown that the
``dynasty'' is showing signs of crumbling. It's early, of course,
but some of the worries are legitimate when considering the recent
slide by Detroit, which had lost four in a row for only the second
time since Coach Scotty Bowman's first season in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that, is Detroit's record against teams above .500.
The Red Wings haven't been able to beat anyone with a winning
record. Panic is starting to set in and sources close to the team
said General Manager Ken Holland is contemplating making a major
trade to jump-start the club.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the most intriguing story to follow in the NHL
during the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be patient and hope in time things turn
around,'' Holland said, ``but certainly we're disappointed in our
play against top teams. ... It's still the regular season, but you
can't just all of a sudden turn it on come April 1 and find your
`A' game. You need to get it going at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   What's been the problem? You name it, Detroit's got it,
according to captain Steve Yzerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing ``anything'' exceptionally well,'' he said.
``You need more than 10 fingers to cover it. We're sruggling in all
areas right now.''
</P>
<P>
   They're giving up a ton of soft goals, No. 1. Part of that
problem stems from the fact the defensemen aren't clearing out the
front of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals we're giving up,'' left wing Brendadn Shanahan said,
``are atrocious. Just gifts. Giveaways. It's been far too easy for
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad sign when you lose four in a row twice already in
the beginn

GAME AND FISH SHOULD SPEND WISELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - OK, so you're the Arizona Game and Fish Department,
and you have this money from the Heritage Fund, a piece of Arizona
lottery profits, and you must spend the $10 million a year or so to
help non-game species.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of land do you look for to do the most for the buck?
If you buy it, it better be good. If you lease it, you have to get
some perks.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the department didn't seem to know what to do. So it
hired more people to help manage non-game species.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, played right into the hands of critics.
Bureaucracy at its worse, they said. You hire people but create no
new resources. It's an attempt to perpetuate your agency. People
don't create wildlife, habitat does. For crying out loud, you're
biologists, you should know that.
</P>
<P>
   But the department grew in its understanding. Time also was
needed to present opportunities. You don't go out blind and buy
land to preserve wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Before you leap into an abyss, you must weigh important factors.
The Norvelle Decree, an enabling law established by Congress when
Arizona was made a state, sets up water rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to change those rights. And agricultural and
livestock interests were considered first. Industry wasn't an
issue. Neither was drinking water for the thundering herd of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, farmers draw huge quantities of irrigation water
from the Gila River and others when reservoirs such as San Carlos
are in peril of drying. These farmers own the water. They aren't
sneaking around to get it, the decree dictates that. Recreational
interests weren't an issue. And recreation might bring more money
to Arizona than agriculture and ranching. Some studies say it does.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. Let's get back to purchasing land for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish has to look at some major factors in purchasing
land. First, it has to come with water rights. That water can be
used locally or traded and used in other areas. It has to look at
riparian areas, where most wildlife, at least at some time in its
life, must have to thrive. It has to consider non-game or
endangered species, but if the land will support other wildlife,
that's even better. If it provides more recreation, the
desirability goes up more.
</P>
<P>
   The department's major purchases have been made in the White
Mountains. There are endangered fishes that must be protected
because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is threatening to drop
the hammer if they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   And elk are a major controversy among ranchers as elk numbers
grow. The ranchers' major problem seems to be the winter range of
elk when they come down into lower, private land and eat the grub.
Buy good, private areas, and the problem can be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's the deal: The Arizona Game and Fish Commission, at
its last meeting, authorized the department to buy 80 acres of land
in Cochise County. The land is irrigated and has water rights.
</P>
<P>
   This particular land has nothing to do with endangered species
or elk. This land will be purchased to enhance waterfowl and
aquatic bird habitat in the Whitewater Draw Wildlife Area near
Willcox. It also would help create sandhill crane habitat and help
the Chiricahua leopard frog.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, $80,000 to pay for this will come from the Waterfowl
Conservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same meeting, commissioners gave permission for the
department to negotiate for the Ocote and Cross L ranches in the
White Mountains near Springerville.
</P>
<P>
   The ranches are adjacent to each other and about four miles west
of Springerville. Ocote includes more than 1,000 acres of private
land and almost 4,000 acres of state land. It owns 50 percent of
the water storage rights to Carnero, Wiltbank, Norton and Sunnyside
reservoirs plus irrigation rights to 269 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   Cross L includes about 1,635 acres of deeded land, 4,200 acres
of state land and 28,544 acres of leased land from
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. It owns about 28.5 percent of
the water storage rights in Carnero, 22.5 percent in Wilbank, 22.5
percent in Norton and 22.5 in Sunnyside. It also has water rights
to irrigate 160 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   The property offers everything from winter elk grazing to
protection of the endangered Colorado River spindace. It also
offers an opportunity to create more cold-water trout fisheries in
the reservoirs. Additionally, it offers more habitat for Arizona's
dwindling antelope populations.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of funds could be used to purchase the ranches.
</P>
<P>
   These purchases have real possibilities. &QL;

REACHING FOR THE STARS: CARDINALS PLAY FOR PLAYOFF BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - This isn't about stadium building or ghost
busting.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about fence mending or score settling.
</P>
<P>
   A win today by the Cardinals that would put them into the
playoffs _ and that's what it really is about _ could have
ramifications for the players, the franchise and the community far
beyond playing in a 17th game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (8-7) have sprouted wings this week. They've
captured the imagination, if not the heart, of the community.
Finally. When they run onto the field at Sun Devil Stadium for the
2 p.m. game with San Diego (5-10), the Cardinals won't be hit by
the accustomed glare of sunlight reflecting off empty aluminum
seats. The stadium will be full of people wearing red.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have yet to play to a sellout that is ``their
crowd.'' Always when there has been a packed house a significant
portion contained Dallas fans, or transplanted fans of a rust-belt
team such as Chicago, Minnesota or Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is not a hotbed of transplanted Chargers fans.
</P>
<P>
   Entering to the roar of a sellout crowd pulling ``for'' the home
team has been Vince Tobin's vision since he was hired in 1996 to
coach the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a dream of mine come true,'' Tobin said. ``This
is what the NFL is all about, having cheering fans there to support
your team and try to get you over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything at this point. Everybody is assuming
we've done something. All we've done is put ourselves into position
to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   A win not only would give the team its first playoff berth since
the strike-shortened 1982 season, it would give the Cardinals their
best record since moving here. That and having second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer under contract for four more years might
carry weight at the polls in May when voters in Mesa, Gilbert and
Queen Creek decide whether to help fund the Rio Salado Crossing,
which would include a retractable-roof stadium viewed as vital to
the long-term future of the team in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A winning record and a playoff berth wouldn't totally erase
scorn and skepticism that has accumulated over a decade, but it
would be a start.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have acknowledged that they haven't done the best
job _ on or off the field _ of making people want to be a Cardinals
fan. They've worked furiously over the past 18 months, largely
under the direction of Michael Bidwill, the team vice president, to
repair public relations. They went out of their way this week to
make tickets available at numerous locations, even on Christmas
day, and to try to get the sellout in time to lift the local
television blackout.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who continue to bash the organization of everyone
from owner Bill Bidwill on down, this is the Cardinals' chance to
quiet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to look back years from now and say, `Here's where
it happened' or `Here's how it happened,' '' Bidwill said. ``But
there is a great deal of enthusiasm, the team is playing well, and
we're in the chase down to our final game. `Over the hump,' that's
a good expression but what we really have to do is get to a level
of competence and consistency. We're getting there. We have to
prove it in this game. In reality, it's win-or-go-home time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to get into the playoffs. A sellout is
a plus where the vast majority of the people there are Cardinals
fans. That means a lot to the players. After all, it still is an
emotional game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too emotional, Tobin hopes. He knows his players will be
pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to play within the framework of our offense,
defense and special-teams structure,'' Tobin said. ``The thing you
always worry about in big games is that somebody is going to try to
do something outside of what their responsibility is and
consequently hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how important and how big a game might be, it's
still 11 people playing together doing their responsibility. I
certainly will remind them of that. It's not 11 individuals, it's a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is the Chargers defense that is stingiest
in the NFL overall and against the rush. Led by Pro Bowl linebacker
Junior Seau, the Chargers have not surrendered a 100-yard afternoon
to an opposing back all season. The Chargers also rank eighth in
the NFL against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   While Plummer and the offense have moved well lately, reaching
400 total yards in four of the past six games, they have bogged
down after getting into striking distance, often watching a long
drive end with a turnover, or with a field goal rather than a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The offense's newfound ability to control the ball coincides
with widespread injuries that weakened the defense. Ball control
won't come as easily today. The Cardinals will need more from their
defense, which will have Ron McKinnon back at middle linebacker. He
missed three games because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me and the guys around me we're excited to face the best
defense,'' Plummer said. ``They're a ferocious group. They play
non-stop. They're great at stopping the run with Seau. He's the
catalyst of the whole thing. I think we can get some passing done
but that's tough, too, because they cover well. They're not going
to give us a lot so we have to be patient and careful with the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our defense will be ready to go full force and shut
them down because offensively we are going to have a challenge
ourselves. Defense is going to be key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau said the Chargers are as motivated to knock the Cardinals
out of the playoffs ``as they are to knock our defense out of our
Number 1 ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yardage-wise, in the last quarter of the season, they're
probably the Number 1 offense out there,'' Seau said of the
Cardinals. ``They have a running game that went 100 yards-plus last
week, a passing game that went 300-some yards. That's something you
normally don't have against a defensive squad that's in the
professional ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, although in only his second season, seemed to speak for
those who've been around longer and suffered through many of those
dark years with a franchise that was neither successful nor
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be huge to win this one and get to the playoffs,
especially with a team that hasn't been there and has the longest
streak in the NFL,'' Plummer said. ``From the day I got drafted, I
set out to do that, to be part of a rebuilding of the whole
franchise to where getting to the playoffs is a yearly thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year (4-12) was tough playing football. Now we're
enjoying coming out here. Winning cures a lot out here. Even if
you're sore, you want to come to practice. It's fun out here. Our
success has come at a good time. We're ready for it. Guys who are
vets and have been here a long time are ready for it. We've just
got to go get it done. Win and we're in a great spot for this
franchise and these players.'' &QL;

HOLMGREN LOVED SF, BUT WOULD HE RETURN? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five victories in 33 games might not be enough to save
San Francisco Coach  &UR; Steve Mariucci's job.
</P>
<P>
   You can blame the Green Bay Packers for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who have beaten the 49ers five straight times,
could eliminate them in the NFC playoffs for the fourth consecutive
year by winning next week's NFC wild-card game between the two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers lose, they could fire Mariucci, who has three years
left on a contract that pays him $800,000 a year, and then make a
run at Packers Coach  &UR; Mike Holmgren, former offensive coordinator
of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren will have plenty of other options. Carolina plans to go
all out to try to hire him to replace  &UR; Dom Capers, who is expected
to be fired Monday. They'll give him the title of general
manager/coach and almost complete control.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also could make a run at Holmgren if the Redskins
fire Coach  &UR; Norv Turner, who might have saved his job by beating
every team except the Cardinals in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers aren't out of the picture, even though General
Manager  &UR; Ron Wolf repeated this week that he thinks there is only a
20 percent chance that Holmgren will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 20 percent because of the financial opportunities he'll
receive,'' Wolf said. ``But it's incumbent upon me to make sure he
never leaves the Green Bay Packers. I will do everything in my
power to make sure he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers already have offered Holmgren a multiyear contract
extension that averages over $3 million per year. It would make him
the highest-paid coach in the league. Denver's  &UR; Mike Shanahan and
the New York Jets' Bill Parcells currently are the highest paid at
about $2.4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Mike will stay in Green Bay unless there is
something of a phenomenal nature that is put in front of him,'' his
agent,  &UR; Bob LaMonte, said. ``It would take a truly wonderful offer.
It won't be just to become a general manager somewhere. He is very
happy in Green Bay. His heart is in Green Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's heart was in his hometown of San Francisco, where his
former boss,  &UR; Bill Walsh, is expected to return to run the team
once owner  &UR; Eddie DeBartolo is back in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's presence wouldn't keep Holmgren from getting the control
he seeks. But he didn't like the way the 49ers pushed former Coach
 &UR; George Seifert out the door, and he could be leery of the way
Mariucci, Holmgren's former assistant with the Packers, is getting
treated.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are the ones that initiated a contract extension for
Mariucci. Now, they're the ones who might pull it off the table. &QL; 
Bloody Monday
</P>
<P>
   The following coaches likely will get axed Monday _ Carolina's
Capers, Philadelphia's  &UR; Ray Rhodes, Seattle's  &UR; Dennis Erickson and
Baltimore's  &UR; Ted Marchibroda.
</P>
<P>
   Still up in the air is the status of Chicago's  &UR; Dave Wannstedt
and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Interim San Diego Coach  &UR; June Jones will take over duties at the
University of Hawaii after today's game against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The job at expansion Cleveland remains open, but Denver
offensive coordinator  &UR; Gary Kubiak appears to be the top choice
there.
</P>
<P>
   If Carolina officials can't get Holmgren, they'll go after
Seifert, who appears to be the No. 1 candidate in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's top choices are Pittsburgh offensive coordinator
 &UR; Jim Haslett and Jacksonville offensive coordinator  &UR; Chris Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens owner  &UR; Art Modell also likes Seifert and wants to talk to
UCLA's  &UR; Bob Toledo, who is expected to stay with the Bruins. A dark
horse for the Baltimore job could be Capers.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego will consider Minnesota offensive coordinator  &UR; Brian
 &UR; Billick, Stanford Coach  &UR; Tyrone Willingham and former UCLA Coach
 &UR; Terry
 &UR; Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   An 0-7 start was thought to have doomed Turner. But the team has
rallied, and the uncertainty of the ownership situation might play
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Bears owner  &UR; Mike McCaskey hasn't made up his mind whether to
retain Wannstedt, who hasn't had a winning season since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt didn't help his popularity in Chicago when he referred
to running back  &UR; James Allen, who rushed for 163 yards against
Baltimore last week, as  &UR; Tremayne Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Tremayne Allen is a tight end on the Bears' practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Changing his story
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the 49ers noticed the $29.7 million deal the Cardinals
gave
 &UR; Jake Plummer last week because he could have been playing in the
Bay area instead of the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwight Clark, the former 49ers executive who bypassed Plummer
in the 1997 first round to take Virginia Tech quarterback  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Druckenmiller, has been under siege over the move.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, now with the expansion Browns, said the 49ers had
questions about Plummer's ability to read defenses. He also
questioned reports that Walsh, who was a consultant, had
recommended the team draft Plummer instead of Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it a long time,'' Clark said. ``Whether Bill
Walsh wants to admit it or not, he thought Druckenmiller had more
ability than anybody in the draft. He really liked Plummer because
he said his mobility reminded him of  &UR; Joe (Montana).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake's in his second year, and he's played a lot more than
(Druckenmiller). He still makes the mistakes of zeroing in on one
guy and either throwing it or scrambling. That was our big knock
against him. It's incredible how he makes things happen, but
reading the field is where we thought he would have problems. That
will take time. Once he gets to where he can learn that, I think
he'll be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark acknowledges that Druckenmiller has some problems. ``He's
very immature and he's already 26 years old. . . . As far as arm
strength, poise in the pocket . . . Druckenmiller won as many games
(in college), maybe more. You could see how he would read the field
and stick the ball in there. He's got ability, but, to me, he
doesn't seem to want to watch while he's the backup. He loses
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do things in practice that are awesome. He's got to play
and be the guy. I don't know that he'll ever be a great player like
 &UR; Steve Young, but he'll be a starter someday.'' &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals Coach  &UR; Joe Bugel, now offensive line coach at
San Diego, is building a home in the Valley near Fountain Hills.
``I'm going to be a Zonie,'' said Bugel, who has two daughters who
live in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams never would have retained Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil
if it didn't cost $10 million to fire him and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins wide receiver  &UR; Michael Westbrook sure isn't a student
of football history. As he waited to do a post-game radio interview
with Hall of Famer  &UR; Sam Huff, Westbrook asked him, ``Hey, man, you
ever play the game?'' &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Cardinals: Sure, this isn't a great team. There are warts on
offense. The defense is beat-up and just trying to hang on. But the
Cardinals are exciting as they try to end the NFL's longest playoff
drought. Their games usually aren't decided until the last two
minutes and often come down to the last play. Second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer is a thrill a minute. He'll try to lead
them to their third straight victory today, which would put them in
the playoffs for the first time since 1982. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Denver Broncos: They've had a wonderful regular season,
regardless what happens today against Seattle. Starting the season
with 13 consecutive victories is quite an accomplishment. Running
back Terrell Davis might be the league's Most Valuable Player. Wide
receiver Ed McCaffrey has 10 touchdown catches. Quarterback John
Elway has been slowed by injuries but still has been brilliant at
times. But nobody likes to limp into the playoffs, and the Broncos
have lost two straight.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Bengals Coach Bruce Coslet, knowing the Buccaneers are 0-16 when
the
 &UR; temperature is below 40 degrees, on today's game in Cincinnati: ``I
hope it's 5 degrees and snowing like hell.'' &QL; 
ARE 'BOLTS DOLTS? &QL; 
Chargers quarterbacks Craig Whelihan and Ryan Leaf each have been
intercepted 15 times this season. That's the biggest reason why the
Cardinals, who own San Diego's No. 1 choice, could pick in the top
10 of next year's draft. At least Whelihan has thrown for seven
touchdowns. Leaf has only two touchdown passes, which is two more
than Philadelphia's Bobby Hoying has this season. Hoying didn't get
a five-year, $31.25 million rookie contract or an $11.25 million
signing bonus. Leaf needs a big off-season to get the players
behind him. &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't good news for the 49ers and Packers, who will play an
NFC wild-card game next week. During the 1990s, only two of the 48
teams that played a first-round playoff game made it to the Super
Bowl. The Bills did it in 1992 and the Broncos last year.
</P>
<P>
   Every Raiders home game has been blacked out this season.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants have sacked opposing quarterbacks 53 times,
most in the league. The Bengals have the fewest sacks with 26.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon of the Seahawks is 903 passing yards away from
becoming the third quarterback in league history to pass for 50,000
career yards, but he said he will retire rather than return next
season as a backup. ``I don't want to come back to this,'' said
Moon, who has lost his job to Jon Kitna. ``I wouldn't want to stick
around just to try to accomplish a milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Jets Coach Rich Kotite, fired after a 1-15
season two years ago, admires the job Bill Parcells has done since
replacing him. In fact, Kotite thinks the Jets will go a long way
in the playoffs. ``When it comes to crunch time, I'll take
Parcells,'' Kotite said.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to St. Louis, the Rams have gotten worse each year.
They've gone 7-9, 6-10, 5-11 and are 4-11 going into today's game
at San Francisco. &QL;

SCOTT INVESTIGATES TURNING PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Arizona junior  &UR; Yusuf Scott, a leading offensive
lineman, has taken a preliminary step toward making himself
eligible for the next NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Saturday he has sent the NFL an official letter of
inquiry in an attempt to determine the round in which he might be
picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inquiry just tells underclassmen about where they'd go,''
said Scott, a 6-foot-3, 337-pound guard and second-team selection
to the ``Football News'' All-America team. ``Six to seven general
managers will tell you whether its the first or second, third or
fourth and fifth to seventh (rounds).''
</P>
<P>
   Scott indicated he would give serious consideration to forgoing
his senior year if he is projected to go in the second round. He
does not expect to be a first-round projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-round would be a no-brainer, of course'' he said. ``But,
as an offensive lineman, I don't figure that will happen.
Second-round would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott expects a response from the NFL on Jan. 4 or 5. He said
he'll make his decision after talking to his mother and Arizona
Coach  &UR; Dick
 &UR; Tomey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do what is best for Yusuf Scott and his family,''
said the junior, who said he comes from a 16-member family that
lives in a three-bedroom house in LaPorte, Texas. ``I love the
University of Arizona. My best friend is a teammate. I'd like to
come back, but I have to consider all my options.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's friend, Arizona running back  &UR; Trung Canidate, is also a
junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trung is a terrific athlete,'' Scott said after a workout for
Wednesday's Holiday Bowl game against Nebraska. ``I don't think
he'll pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Canidate has a better chance at improving his
position in the draft with another college season because he plays
a skill position. This season, Arizona senior cornerback
 &UR; Chris McAlister improved his prospects from a mid-round pick last
year to perhaps a spot among the first 10 at the next draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``But offensive linemen are different,'' Scott said. ``We pretty
much go in our senior year where we would go in an earlier year.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
The 11-1 Wildcats played in front of many empty seats at Arizona
Stadium, despite their march to a No. 5 national ranking. But
apparently a bowl appearance has sparked some interest. Arizona
sold its 11,500 ticket allotment one day before Nebraska did,
according to Holiday Bowl executive director  &UR; John Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona went to Sea World Saturday. The crowd impressed
linebacker  &UR; Marcus Bell, who is from tiny St. Johns in northeastern
Arizona. ``In one day, there were more people at Sea World than
there is in all of St. Johns,'' Bell said. &QL;

IS UA'S TRUNG A CANIDATE FOR HEISMAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ On his driver's license, there have been no changes.
He's not suddenly named Heisman Canidate on the freeway to the 1999
New York Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   He still calls himself Trung.
</P>
<P>
   As a Canidate, he doesn't have much control over the name game
that has helped to put him among the early possibilities for next
year's Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing it all the time now and it's just because people
are having some fun with my name,'' Arizona's junior running back
said Saturday after a workout for Wednesday's Holiday Bowl game
against Nebraska at Qualcomm Stadium. ``People have always had some
with my name. I know it's kind of unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``But talk about this award this is something a lot different. I
hear it, but I don't think about it. I mean, how could anybody
legitimately think about something that big?''
</P>
<P>
   But Canidate, a former Central High School star, has created the
right to dream. Through the second half of Arizona's 11-1 season,
he emerged as one of the nation's most exciting running backs.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up leading the nation in yards per carry at 7.3. Not
even Texas' Ricky Williams, the 1998 Heisman winner, could keep
pace with that average.
</P>
<P>
   The element that separates Canidate from other running backs,
and nearly all defenders, is his explosiveness. He steps through a
seam in defenses as though he's been launched. The result has been
15 career touchdowns of 28 yards and longer.
</P>
<P>
   Those runs make the highlight films, and highlights are pretty
powerful ads in the Heisman campaigns that have come to resemble
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Canidate name is just another element that provides a
marketing edge. Canidate wouldn't be the first to capitalize. Joe
Theisman was the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Theisman name is actually supposed to be pronounced
``Theeseman.''But the former Washington Redskins quarterback told
the Notre Dame publicity department to start pronouncing it so
would rhyme with the trophy. It worked. Theisman won the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that either Canidate or Arizona would be so bold.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Arizona coach Dick Tomey dislikes glossy
publicity campaigns for national awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that can backfire,'' Tomey said. ``Look, we have kids
win national awards all the time without campaigning. Chris
McAlister won the special teams award this year.''
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Arizona doesn't have to launch a campaign
that plays off the Canidate.
</P>
<P>
   The media are already doing it. There were newspaper headlines
after Canidate ran for 288 yards against Arizona State to capture
the Pac-10 Conference's rushing crown. ESPN started playing the
name game two nights later as it repeatedly showed clips of
Canidate touchdown runs of 80, 66 and 48 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The talk is mounting. And so are the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids wouldn't be able to handle it,'' Tomey said.
``But Trung is tough. He's got a lot of wisdom for a young guys.
I'm confident he can keep it all in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a degree of uncertainty. With the media
attention, there also is some speculation about whether Canidate
will forgo his senior season for a shot at the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be back,'' he said Saturday. ``I should be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canidate also hedged. The comment about his planned return
included a suggestion that he could change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything holds true, I should be back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A friendship with offensive lineman Yusuf Scott could be a
powerful factor. Scott, an underclassman, said Saturday that he is
considering making himself eligible for this spring's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, it's about whatever is best for him and his
family,'' Canidate said. ``That's how you got to play it. You
always got to weigh your options. But, yeah, I love college
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey said he has yet to speak to Canidate about his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will talk about it after this (the Holiday Bowl) is
over,'' Tomey said. ``I really believe that Trung knows what
another year can do for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Tomey pointed to McAlister. Arizona's
all-American cornerback had decided to go pro last year, but he
missed the deadline to file for eligibility. Last year, McAlister
probably would have been a mid-round NFL pick. This year, he's
projected to go in the first 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lesson in that for every talented player,'' Tomey
said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Tomey thinks Canidate still is not fully recovered
from an off-season surgery for a stress fracture that sidelined him
for a season-opening victory at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think he's 100 percent,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, forget the game. This Canidate is a contender.

EAGER MITCHELL RETURNS TO PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the Bruins were stretching and waiting for
practice to begin Saturday when No. 3 trotted onto Spaulding Field.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they couldn't identify the mystery man. Was it a
scout-team player? Was it a joke?
</P>
<P>
   No, it was receiver Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after breaking his left femur in a gruesome fall at
Houston, Mitchell returned to practice and gave every indication
he'll play in the Rose Bowl. He has been cleared by UCLA's
physician, Dr. Gerald Finerman, leaving the final decision to coach
Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll get him in there for three, four or five plays,''
Toledo said. ``We'll put some plays in for him. . . . (Wisconsin)
better be aware of where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's recovery has surprised everyone but himself. After he
underwent emergency surgery in Houston to implant a stabilizing rod
and two interlocking screws, the UCLA medical staff predicted he'd
be ready for spring practice in April. Toledo wasn't sure Mitchell
would ever return and certainly didn't expect him to do it three
months early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams,'' Toledo said. ``This is a
miracle. I was wondering if he'd ever play again, it was so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell credited his recovery to a calcium-rich diet, eight
hours of rehabilitation per day, and effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is where most players wish (theirs) was,'' he said.
``I did it in three months. It was supposed to take six-to-eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell ran with a slight limp Saturday but said his 40-yard
dash time has improved to 4.6 seconds. After he caught a touchdown
pass, the Bruins celebrated and quarterback Cade McNown yelled to a
group of reporters: ``Freddie Mitchell's back. Print that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was back, doing what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually talked some trash,'' he said, smiling. ``It felt
good, just to let the boys know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's no freak: Junior tackle Kris Farris, considering a jump to
the NFL, spoke by telephone to several NFL personnel directors last
week in Toledo's office.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus: He'd be a late first- or early second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has assumed an advisory role and will help Farris gather
the information he needs to make a sound decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's a high No. 1 (pick) and he feels he needs to go, he
should go,'' Toledo said. ``I'm not here to hold anybody back. I'm
here to counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Toledo made it clear that Farris isn't among the elite
linemen he's coached _ a group that includes UCLA's Jonathan Ogden,
USC's Anthony Munoz and Oregon's Gary Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Farris) is good, but he's not at that stage yet,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fun and functions: The Bruins visited Disneyland last week as
the first of several Rose Bowl-related events. (One highlight:
315-pound guard Andy Meyers nearly crushed McNown on the
Matterhorn.) They'll dine at Lawry's tonight for the Beef Bowl.
Monday, it's Universal Studios. Tuesday, it's City of Hope Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line,'' Toledo said. ``You want to reward them
for getting to the Rose Bowl and have some fun. It shouldn't be
drudgery. We're going to work hard, meet, and practice, but we're
going to have some fun.''

BRODEUR GIVES UP ONE TOO MANY AGAINST HASEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Dominik Hasek's goaltending was more
vintage than Martin Brodeur's Saturday night in the first clash of
the season between the National Hockey League's best goaltenders of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek denied each of the 34 attempts by the Devils and led the
Buffalo Sabres to a 2-0 victory before a sellout crowd of 19,040 at
Continental Arena. The shutout was Hasek's second in a row, his
seventh of the season and the 40th of his career. It extended his
streak without allowing a goal to 163 minutes 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek is the only goalie in the league who has started every
game this season. He is admired by every goaltender in the league,
and Saturday night he once again demonstrated why. His goaltending
bordered on brilliance, even though a number of his saves were
unorthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur (22 saves) allowed only one goal, to Miroslav Satan.
Satan also scored the second goal, but it came with an empty net
with 50 seconds left because Brodeur was pulled for an extra
attacker. It was Brodeur's first loss in his last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams gave a sample of what is to come in their later
games, perhaps deep into the spring. There were plenty of passing
combinations in all zones, with 43 shots taken in the first two
periods.
</P>
<P>
   It took a brilliant move by Satan to produce a goal. Taking a
pass from Michal Grosek out of Buffalo's zone, Satan skated down
the right flank, cut into the middle and waited for Brodeur to
commit before beating him with a rising shot for his 11th of the
season with 4:26 left before the second intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur had denied Erik Rasmussen moments before Satan's goal,
and was lucky five minutes earlier when three Sabres went in on him
without a Devils defenseman in sight. The play was created when
Scott Niedermayer failed to clear the puck at his blue line, but
Jason Woolley's shot sailed wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur had 17 saves in the first two periods, when the Devils
had the territorial advantage and took 25 shots against Hasek. The
majority of the Devils' attempts were good shots, but Hasek was
equal to the task. His best saves came in the second period when he
stopped a Jason Arnott shot early and stymied Petr Sykora moments
before Satan's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott, on a setup by Patrik Elias, went head on with Hasek, but
Hasek sprawled to his right to deny him from point-blank range. His
denial of Sykora came while he was on his back, but, somehow, he
managed to keep his shutout intact as Sykora skated in with
authority from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both teams viewed this game as a measuring stick.
Both attempted to establish their game from the outset, and since
both teams were equally effective, physical force came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Three first-period fights cost the Devils more because they lost
Lyle Odelein to a game misconduct after his second fight against
Matthew Barnaby. Odelein was ejected from the game because his
jersey was not tied down according to league rules.

NEDVED HELPS RANGERS BREAK OUT IN A BIG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JEFF CARLTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Just when it appeared that the Rangers were
about to duplicate their pre-Christmas frustrations against the
Carolina Hurricanes at sold out Greensboro Coliseum on Saturday
night, Petr Nedved scored when he broke between two defenders on a
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many goals the Rangers hope the center will score
this year, and Nedved's goal early in the second period pushed open
the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (12-14-7) scored five more times over the next nine
and a half minutes, as they rolled to a 6-3 victory over the
Hurricanes in front 11,059 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The second period, in which the Rangers went from a 1-0 deficit
to a 6-1 lead, was an elixir for a team that had lost its last
three games, including Wednesday's 1-0 decision to Carolina at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Coach John Muckler shuffled his lines for Saturday
night's game. Nedved, moved to a line with wingers Mike Knuble and
Niklas Sundstrom, had two goals and two assists in the second
period. Adam Graves also scored twice. One player had his first
goal of the year and another had his first two assists.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's record for goals in a period, eight in a 1971
game, still stands, but it was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   They scored six goals on eight shots, converting three times
against the starter Arturs Irbe and three times against Trevor
Kidd. The Rangers matched the six goals they scored in the second
period of an 8-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Nov. 16,
1997, and this time it only took the Rangers 10 minutes to do the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens put the Rangers ahead at 6:38, slipping a backhand
shot inside the left post after Nedved prevented the puck from
leaving the offensive zone and slid it to the left wing in front of
the Hurricanes' net.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3-1 just 55 seconds later when Nedved, while backskating
toward the right-wing boards, deftly lifted the puck over Irbe's
left shoulder. It was Nedved's seventh goal since joining the
Rangers in a Nov. 25 trade that sent Aleksei Kovalev to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd replaced Irbe, Carolina's third goalie change this season,
and had barely finished strapping on his pads before Graves took a
centering pass from Sean Pronger and flipped it over the sprawling
goalie at 9:00.
</P>
<P>
   The assist was Pronger's first point in eight games, but it
wasn't even his last of the second period. After Peter Popovic's
slap shot made it 5-1 at 10:03, Pronger assisted on goal No. 6.
Marc Savard dug the puck out of the corner and dropped it to
Graves, who one-timed his 15th goal of the year from the left-wing
circle.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Southeast Division-leading Hurricanes
(16-14-5) had given up six goals in a game, let alone one period,
this season. Four of Carolina's top defensemen had been scratched
with various injuries. And two others, Adam Burt and Curtis
Leschyshyn, played sparingly tonight while nursing minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Hurricanes with Marek Malik in the starting
lineup. Malik had been out of the NHL for two seasons.It also
forced the Hurricanes to play the youngsters Mike Rucinski and
Steve Halko a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, which scored Wednesday's only goal early in the third
period, jumped in front by 1-0 eight minutes in tonight on Sami
Kapanen's first goal in almost a month. Kapanen skated into the
slot and received a backhand pass from Ray Sheppard to the left of
the net. On his way through, the Finnish Olympian slid the puck
past goalie Mike Richter to the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   For Kapanen, it was his eighth goal of the season, and first
since Nov. 28 against the Islanders. He had been an offensive
nonfactor of late, going without a point in the Hurricanes' last
five games.
</P>
<P>
   The first period ended with the Rangers having been getting
outshot by 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after the fireworks in the middle period, the opening
20 minutes could be long forgotten by the Rangers. &QL;

A FEW TROJANS ARE LEFT BEHIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ USC left several players at home Saturday as
the Trojans arrived for their game against Texas Christian in
Thursday's Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Windrell Hayes, bothered by a sprained toe, did
not make the trip and will not play in the Sun Bowl. The status of
tailback Frank Strong is also in doubt after he suffered back
spasms while spending Christmas with his family in Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Strong is scheduled to arrive today but probably will not
practice, USC coach Paul Hackett said. Whether he will play in the
game is also in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Jason Thomas was also left home and will
not be with the team this week, because Hackett said Thomas has
been ill and bothered by a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was best if he not come and stay home,'' Hackett
said. ``He couldn't come to practice. I'm very disappointed. I
wanted him here to run the option. He expressed an interest in
coming here. I wanted to bring all the redshirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Thomas' absence is not disciplinary related. With
his absence, USC had freshman tailback Miguel Fletcher of Alemany
play quarterback on the scout team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was expected to make the trip and try to practice this
week, but his toe never improved.
</P>
<P>
   Starting cornerback Antuan Simmons arrived late Saturday night
from Sacramento because his grandmother died. Simmons will practice
today.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance policy: USC junior offensive lineman Travis Claridge
said he has no intention of turning pro but is thinking about
obtaining an insurance policy for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go pro. I've got to get better,'' Claridge said. ``But
I want to talk to Coach Hackett about what I should do for next
season. A lot of people are telling me I should get an insurance
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton may rest: Tailback Chad Morton may rest his sore ankle
today and miss practice after going on the Sun Bowl's hard
artificial surface Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ginger,'' Hackett said. ``I'm not sure he will
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Activity of the day: El Paso wasn't exactly the players' first
choice for a bowl destination, but the Sun Bowl has arranged plenty
of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   The big event Saturday was a barbecue at the Sheriff's Posse
Barbeque Dinner at an El Paso horse-racing track.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans plan to spend part of Tuesday attending a bloodless
bullfight in Juarez, Mexico, which is next to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Although the players have some free time, bowl officials are
advising them not to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing they recommend is to make sure if you cross
the border to do it together,'' assistant coach Larry Petroff said.
``Because of that, it was recommended to stay here. It was strongly
recommended to stay here and I think they understand.''

ISLANDERS SAVE ONE FOR BACKUP GOALTENDER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In the third period Saturday night, probably
more times than goalie Wade Flaherty cares to remember, the puck
dribbled just wide of the Islanders' goal, bounced off of the post
or was stopped by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It is always interesting when Flaherty is tending the Islanders'
goal. Saturday night, the backup playing in place of the injured
Tommy Salo brought fans at Nassau Coliseum to the edge of their
seats as he helped blow a 2-0 lead and the Islanders tried their
best to give away the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Flaherty, who made 25 stops, was saved by two goals in the
third period, giving the Islanders an unlikely 4-2 victory over the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The third Islanders goal was scored by rookie Mike Watt, who
tallied his fifth of the season at 9 minutes 50 seconds of the
third period to restore the Islanders' lead, 3-2. And then Claude
Lapointe sealed the victory with a short-handed, breakaway goal at
14:51.
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy got his first goal of the season in the first
period, giving the Islanders a 1-0 lead at 6:57. After sneaking
behind the Bruins' defense, Palffy tapped in a crisp, cross-ice
pass from defenseman Zdeno Chara. Referee Richard Trottier asked
for the goal to be reviewed, but after an anxious two minutes the
video replay judge decided that the puck entered the crease before
Palffy's skate.
</P>
<P>
   After his eight-month layoff, everyone thought Palffy would need
at least two weeks before he got up to National Hockey League
speed. That has not been the case. After just two games and not
even a full week of practice, Palffy has a goal and two assists. In
his season debut last Tuesday against the Blues, he assisted on two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   And Palffy doesn't just help the Islanders on the scoreboard. He
helps at the turnstile, too. Saturday night, in Palffy's second
game back, the Islanders played before another big crowd _ 15,174.
Palffy's debut drew 16,297, a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy arrived just as several of his teammates had gone down,
or were about to go down, with injuries. On the Islanders' West
Coast swing last week, the team had injuries to several key
players, including goalie Tommy Salo (broken finger), defenseman
Bryan Berard (strained groin), enforcer Gino Odjick (strained
abdomen) and Sergei Nemchinov (hip). None of them are expected to
be back anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   For Ted Donato and Ken Belanger, who were swapped in a
one-for-one deal, Saturday night's game was the first against their
former teams. Donato, who has four goals and seven assists since
the trade, was relatively quite. Belanger, on his first shift,
slammed the Islanders defenseman David Harlock into the back
boards, touching off a skirmish behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger's exuberance, however, cost his team later in the
period. He was in the penalty box for obstruction when Trevor
Linden scored to stretch the Islanders' lead to 2-0. Planting
himself in front of the Bruins' goal, Linden redirected Mariusz
Czerkawski's shot from the point.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders, who never seem at ease when they have the
lead, managed to squander the cushion. Boston scored two straight
goals, the first by the rookie center Chris Taylor at 8:35 of the
second period, the second by Dmitri Kristich at 12:15 of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the injuries the Islanders are coping with, the injury
to Salo has hurt them the most. Saturday night, Flaherty, who made
25 saves, struggled at times. He didn't look good on either of the
goals. Taylor tapped in a rebound that Flaherty bobbled and
Kristich scored from an almost impossible angle, shooting the puck
from the side boards, even with the goal line. His shot bounced in
off of Flaherty, who was scrambling back into position.

A WAREHOUSE IS ROBBED OF $5,000 AT GUNPOINT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; A warehouse that is used to distribute copies of The
New York Times was robbed Saturday afternoon by two armed men who
made off with $5,000 in cash and a delivery truck after tying up
and gagging five people, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, one armed with a shotgun and the other with a
handgun, entered the warehouse, located on Pier 40 near West
Houston and West Streets, shortly before 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They held five people, four employees of The Times and a
security guard, at gunpoint, said Detective Joseph M. Pentangelo, a
Police Department spokesman. The men bound and gagged the victims
and stole $5,000 in cash, he said. The two men then escaped in the
Times' delivery truck, Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was recovered by a transit police officer at the
corner of Hudson and Vestry Streets an hour later. Pentangelo said
that the robbers fled on foot from there and that no arrests had
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Two employees of The Times suffered minor injuries during the
robbery but refused medical attention, said Lisa Carparelli, a
spokeswoman for The Times.
</P>
<P>
   There were no delays in delivering the sections of Saturday's
paper that were being distributed from the warehouse when the
robbery occurred, Mrs. Carparelli said.

DRINKWATER WOULD HATE WHAT'S GOING ON IN SCOTTSDALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER AND CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ A year after the death of Herb Drinkwater,
the city is embroiled in twin scandals and public squabbling that
are attracting headlines the beloved mayor would have hated.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders, many of them tutored by ``Mr. Scottsdale,'' are
trying to salvage the one thing that was most dear to him: the
coveted image of the West's Most Western Town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two things Herb hated the most: damage to
Scottsdale's image; the second thing he hated equally was
incivility to each other,'' said former Scottsdale City
Councilwoman Diane Cusack. ``We've seen both in spades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Herb were here today or could come down like the ghost of
Christmas present, he would be heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   The city Drinkwater cherished is under investigation by a
federal grand jury, and the Scottsdale school district has been
rocked by financial mismanagement and violations of the Open
Meeting Law. There is talk of recalling two elected officials in a
nasty fight over an ice hockey arena, and growth, a Scottsdale
trademark, is constantly under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Drinkwater, the four-term mayor affectionately known as Mr.
Scottsdale, died at age 61 of cancer Dec. 28, 1997, at his home at
the foot of the McDowell Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A full year after his death, residents and city leaders still
mourn him and are grappling to come up with a tribute to the man
remembered for his optimism, humor, penchant for pleasing and role
in shaping the city.
</P>
<P>
   And they wonder how the mayor, who made it his life's work to
put Scottsdale on the map, would react to the year's events. &QL; 
WHAT WOULD DRINKWATER HAVE DONE?
</P>
<P>
   The city and district's current guards quietly battle the
negative publicity and questions about their brand of governing.
But a question resounds through the city: What would the man in the
silver Stetson have done?
</P>
<P>
   Drinkwater, observers say, would have used the sheer force of
his popularity and personality to try to save his city's soul.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that he ``could bring all sides of a debate together
and find the common ground,'' said zoning attorney John Berry.
``And he had a unique God-given ability, that I've never seen
replicated, to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most say the turmoil in Scottsdale hasn't tarnished the
reputation of a city that lures visitors from around the world to
its resorts, golf courses and mountain vistas. But some privately
worry that the federal investigation will affect the city's bond
rating or ability to lure new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them are ones that affect Scottsdale's international
stature,'' Berry said. ``But we don't want to live off our past
glories. We want to continue to be a leader and build off those
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry fears the investigation will deter people with
Drinkwater's vision and leadership from running for public office.
And that would have troubled Drinkwater, who told nearly every
person he met to run for City Council or school board, join a
commission or volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scottsdale has a history, for better or for worse, for
being a leader. And sometimes when you are a leader you get shot
out of the saddle,'' he said. ``A loss of leadership is what can be
a result. And that is something that can have ramifications for a
lot of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was referring to an ongoing months-long federal grand jury
investigation into high-level police and city officials' efforts
against a controversial night club. Investigators widened the probe
to determine if police and city officials launched a campaign to
shut down the former Club Tribeca because it attracted a mostly
minority clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Drinkwater, who kept an ear glued to a scanner and responded
personally to emergency calls, ``would feel especially chagrined
about what the Police Department is going through,'' said
Drinkwater's successor, Mayor Sam Campana.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be particularly hurtful to him, to see his Police
Department under any kind of cloud,'' Campana said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some say Drinkwater would have led the effort, which a
federal prosecutor is calling into question, to banish the club.
Like current police and city officials, Drinkwater would have
wanted to eliminate violence that police said the club drew to the
corner of Scottsdale and McDowell roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been as adamant about getting rid of it because
the neighbors were so adamant. He would have been interested in
supporting the neighbors,'' said former Councilwoman Susan Bitter
Smith. &QL; 
SCHOOL FLAP SADDENING
</P>
<P>
   And Drinkwater, whose wife was a longtime Scottsdale teacher,
would have been saddened by the chaos that has tarnished the school
district this year. The school board admitted to more than three
dozen Open Meeting Law violations. Investigators for the state
Auditor General's Office also said administrators broke laws and
district policy by favoring vendors, accepting gifts and splitting
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, the former councilwoman, believes that, even though
school and city politics don't usually mix, Drinkwater might have
used his ``personal contacts with the board to ease that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale has faced other challenges in the year since
Drinkwater's death. An impassioned battle is brewing over a
proposed arena in south Scottsdale for the Phoenix Coyotes. Angry
neighbors vow to recall Campana and Councilman Robert Pettycrew, a
south Scottsdale resident, who both support using state tax dollars
generated by the redevelopment of an aging mall to help build the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellman Cos. and the Phoenix Coyotes want to build a
20,000-seat arena as part of a $624 million redevelopment of Los
Arcos Mall. The plans have sparked heated debate, because the
developer wants to use a state tax break to pay for $219 million of
the total tab.
</P>
<P>
   Drinkwater, many say, would have supported the 75-foot-tall
arena, and likely would have gotten outraged neighbors to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have gone down there all day long and evening
long to those neighborhoods and talked them into seeing sweet
reason and the viability of the mall redevelopment as a total
package,'' Cusack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Sam, this was Herb's magic to do that.
Even if they didn't like it, he would have really tried to take the
acid out of the argument.'' &QL; 
COALITION DEMANDS RESTRAINT
</P>
<P>
   Some say, though, that even the amenable Drinkwater may not have
been able to calm the increasingly intense debate over Scottsdale's
rapid development. The late mayor is often considered the architect
of the city's fast-growing profile. But he was rarely challenged,
and didn't have to face a new, politically powerful coalition
demanding restraint.
</P>
<P>
   That group cemented its position this year when it elected two
slow-growthers to the council.
</P>
<P>
   The election of George Zraket and Cynthia Lukas is considered a
major break from the traditional Drinkwater style of shaping the
city.
</P>
<P>
   His strength clearly was in coaxing people into seeing things
his way. Now the old guard is being challenged at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Drinkwater lamented that his beloved desert was engulfed
in red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the end, Herb wished he'd done more sooner when it
came to preservation because his heart truly was there,'' said
Carla, a key preservationist who uses no last name. ``And the
important thing to remember is he always encouraged us.''
</P>
<P>
   Campana has proclaimed Monday ``Mayor R. Herb Drinkwater
Remembrance Day.'' As part of his memorial, city officials will
decide in the next several months whether to name Wingate Pass, a
scenic saddle in the McDowell Mountains, after him or to dedicate
part of the downtown Civic Center Mall to the late mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Current debates aside, Campana said Drinkwater, her friend and
mentor, would still proclaim Scottsdale the greatest place on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his bedrock.'' &QL;

Williams has case for niche in pantheon of great backs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Texas' Ricky Williams had set all the records, earning the
distinction as the most prolific running back ever in college
football. He had taken all the awards, making the speeches and
accepting the congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   He had stood at the podium of the Downtown Athletic Club and
accepted the Heisman Trophy in front of a room full of former
Heisman winners including his childhood hero, Marcus Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He would ring the bell to begin trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. In the coming days, he would chat up David Letterman, and
take a seat in one of the comfy chairs on the Good Morning America
set.
</P>
<P>
   But as he looked around the room the night of the Heisman
dinner, saw all the heroes of past seasons, all the greats, he
turned to a friend and said, ``I can't believe I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had joined many clubs this season, and Heisman winners
traditionally return to New York to welcome the newest member to
their fraternity each December. But even his collection of records
and awards did not &UR;  &LR; automatically earn him recognition as a member
of the most exclusive of circles.
</P>
<P>
   To be called the greatest running back of them all, or to at
least earn a place in the argument, Williams would require more
subjective qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   His place as college football's all-time rushing and scoring
leader would seem to earn Williams consideration. But numbers alone
cannot do that. Does anybody argue LeShon Johnson or Anthony
Thompson was a greater player than say, Gale Sayers or Jim Brown?
</P>
<P>
   For college football's all-time leading rusher to be considered
college football's all-time best rusher, more discriminating judges
than the editors of record books would have to offer their
blessing. With that in mind, a panel of an All-American, all-timer
and old-timer, a longtime NFL executive and a longtime college
coach served to determine a place for Williams in college football
lore.
</P>
<P>
   Legends take time to mature, to evolve in the retelling. But
rather than wait, opinions were gathered from a panel of experts:
Craig James, the former SMU running back and CBS college football
analyst; Allen, the Southern California Heisman winner and longtime
NFL star; John David Crow, the former Texas A&AMP;M Heisman winner and
NFL veteran; Gil Brandt, the former Cowboys vice president; and
Grant Teaff, the former Baylor coach and American Football Coaches
Association executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly have to put him in the same category with
the great runners, the greatest players that ever played,'' Crow
said. ``He gained more yards, but that doesn't put him in that
greatest-player-that-ever-played category. You have to watch him to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of great players, a lot. The ones that I
remember, like Doak Walker who is the ultimate, Jim Brown, from my
era, Gale Sayers, Earl Campbell _ Ricky will be remembered in that
same light. Now there's (Barry) Sanders and you say, `How can you
get any better than that?' But then Ricky Williams comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't pass judgment on who the greatest that ever played is.
But Ricky can sit at that table.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the afternoon after he announced he would return to
Texas for his senior year, Williams wore a Barry Sanders Lions
jersey, as if he felt closer to the fans who now wear his burnt
orange than to the stars to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   But after Williams surpassed the statistical achievements of
every predecessor, even if he still seemed in awe of the group of
players he had joined, members of that group saw the qualities that
separate the merely prolific from the all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him play and I could see certain things that make
him special,'' Allen said. ``They're all innate. The way he
maneuvers, the balance and speed. And then there's a certain grace
the way guys do things. It's just a part of their makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the speed, power and moves, and I see a guy as
powerful as Earl, but more elusive. The great backs all possess the
same thing, and that's natural ability, natural instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most runners tell you what they're doing. Most of the great
runners just do it. They have one quality above all, and it's
natural instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   With Williams' unusual combination of strength and speed, his
physical tools are most often mentioned as the source of his
success. But the record books are filled with backs with great
physical talents. The less tangible qualities elevate a few to that
rarer group of legends, the players fans watch with awe and
proclaim the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys that have been great runners just have God-given
ability,'' Allen said. ``They just work hard on getting stronger
and faster. But most of it is so natural. You can put a fine
athlete, a great athlete and try to teach him those things and you
can't. It can't be learned. Guys would ask me, `What did you see,
why did you do it?' I didn't have a clue. Most of the great runners
just do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there running thinking about things, that's
the worst thing you can do. Most runners are just instinctive. When
you think about it, it's almost contrived. You have to be
liberated. You just do your thing. That's the way it is with Ricky.
What he does is just him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that point when a back moves beyond the total of his
athletic parts that he joins the likes of Allen, Campbell, Walker,
Sanders, Sayers, Brown, O.J. Simpson, Herschel Walker, Tony
Dorsett, Archie Griffin, Eric Dickerson and Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big Notre Dame fan asked me what was the difference between
Autry Denson (who became Notre Dame's all-time leading rusher) and
Ricky Williams,'' James said. ``I told him Ricky Williams can make
a play, can make an offense. Autry Denson complements the offense
and Autry is a good player. In order to be the difference-maker,
you have to be able to break tackles. What Ricky does after
somebody hits him makes him as good as anybody that ever played the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue Williams is the absolute greatest from among
that group, or for that matter that any member of that list is the
definitive best. But many observers believe that as time passes and
tales of Williams' achievement are repeated, there will be those
who maintain that the running back of their time was the greatest,
just as others will forever argue in favor of the back from their
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some making the argument in his favor,'' Teaff
said. ``That's rightly so. What you have when someone says he's the
very best, he has to be in that upper ledger to start off and
that's something. Then it depends on time and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can dine at the head table. He's got all the
characteristics any good running backs coach would like to have.
He's mentally tough, very smart. He's humble, which helps an awful
lot with linemen and the people working to make you successful.
That came through loud and clear. His combination of strength and
speed is among the very best. He has all the qualities you'd look
for.''
</P>
<P>
   As years pass, Teaff said, Williams' popularity during his time
would enhance his legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody in 10, 15 years, so many people wanted
to win the Heisman Trophy,'' Teaff said. ``I noticed coaches in the
conference, players in the conference, folks around the country
wanted him to win it. That might be because he didn't just go out
and win it at the finish line, he blew it out, particularly with
his performance against A&AMP;M. People will remember that for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if a back's place in college football history is determined
in part by how he is remembered, his success after his college
football career can help determine his reputation over time.
Griffin is the only back to twice win the Heisman. But because his
NFL career could not rival his collegiate success, his reputation
even as a college player seems diminished, at least in the company
of the all-time greats who added the confirmation of professional
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm Cleveland, I would take him first in the draft,''
Brandt said. ``You watch him on the field and off and he works as
hard as anybody, catches the ball, pays attention. He has the
speed, quickness and acceleration to be a great back, all the
qualities you need to be a top-flight football player, to be a
perennial All-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is somewhere between Herschel and Sanders and
Dorsett. I'd have a hard time comparing him to anyone. I think
that's a great compliment. He belongs in that category. A true
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains if Williams with the greatest numbers
should be considered the greatest back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: It's totally unfair for anybody not to put
him with the top backs all-time in college,'' James said. ``He
earned that.''
</P>
<P>
   But picking one will have to remain subjective.
</P>
<P>
   As Crow said: ``That's the reason they make chocolate, vanilla
and other flavors. It's what fits your style and your taste.''

Some free advice to sort out bowls
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, we'll try to make it easier on you.
</P>
<P>
   We are on the verge of 16 college football games invading the
airwaves in a span of five days. It is an overwhelming proposition,
sure, even for the most avid and experienced veteran of
remote-control clicking.
</P>
<P>
   But we are here to help. In the 16 bowls that will entertain us
between Tuesday and the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl for the national
championship Jan. 4, there are things we know will happen, games we
know we shouldn't miss and others that probably should be clicked
into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, may we offer a few insights, not to be confused with
Insight.coms, for the upcoming matches.
</P>
<P>
   Quotes we'll never read:
</P>
<P>
   From Bill Snyder, coach of the Alamo Bowl's Kansas State
Wildcats, who came within a whisper of playing for the national
championship before screaming bloody murder about the bowl system:
``We're just happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   From Tim Couch, the junior sensation who leads the Kentucky
Wildcats against Penn State in the Outback Bowl: ``I don't care
that my entire offensive line won't be back next season I WILL!''
</P>
<P>
   From any Mississippi State player: ``Well, you see, it was the
funniest thing. Coach Sherrill brought this longhorn steer to
practice one day. And then he pulled out this great, big knife. And
then he gathered us all around that steer and talked about taking
the manhood out of the 'Horns and ''
</P>
<P>
   Say, can I have the remote?
</P>
<P>
   Games that, like brussels sprouts, are one part of this holiday
feast we probably could do without:
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian Bowl: If these folks truly were humanitarian, they
would get rid of that hideous blue AstroTurf. And on top of that,
Southern Mississippi will make potato pancakes out of Idaho in a
yawner.
</P>
<P>
   Music City Bowl: Normally, Virginia Tech-Alabama would be worthy
of this bowl's name _ sweet music. But this year, Roseanne Arnold
might as well sing the national anthem. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest Sun Bowl: USC-TCU? R.U.KIDDING?
</P>
<P>
   Gator Bowl: NBC is counting on Notre Dame sweeping to high
ratings on New Year's Day, despite featuring this unimaginative
team going head-to-head with Penn State-Kentucky, Michigan-Arkansas
and Texas-Mississippi State. The only way the Irish could pull off
this ratings battle would be if Jerry Seinfeld was coach, Elaine
Benes a cheerleader and Art Vandalay started at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Games that might not be for the whole enchilada, but should pack
an entertaining kick:
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Bowl (Arizona-Nebraska): One of these teams could be
playing for the national championship if not for one sloppy half of
football. The other team is Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Orange Bowl: Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb firing bullets
and sprinting away from the athletic Gators defense is a match made
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   A Peach of a bowl
</P>
<P>
   Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl: Virginia-Georgia quite possibly is the
best matchup of teams this year, although something needs to be
done about the matchup of the game and the sponsor. Or are you
comfortable with Chick-Fil-A sponsoring a game in a city known for
the Dirty Bird?
</P>
<P>
   Games you might consider taking if you were a point-spread
player, which, of course, you're not. And neither am I. But if I
were, these would be the teams I would take:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (plus-3) vs. Nebraska: The normally dominating
Cornhuskers offensive line has been on a Holiday all season. Now
the players have the official windbreaker and travel bag to prove
it. It'll be the 'Cats.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (plus-6{) vs. Penn State: You only thought Nittany
Lions coach Joe Paterno wore high-water pants before. Wait until he
gets a load of Couch flooding the field with more passing yards
than Paterno might ever have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (minus-6{) vs. Mississippi State: Ricky Williams will more
than make up for past Longhorns losses, not to mention other lost
Longhorns things, at the hands of Jackie Sherrill.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (plus-12{) vs. Ohio State: Heck, this one should be
easy! With Florida State, Nebraska, Missouri, Texas and Kansas
State among the eight bowl teams A&AMP;M faced this year, the Aggies'
only worry should be overconfidence. OK, maybe not. But they'll be
tough on the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (minus-5) vs. Tennessee: Call it Operation Desert
Fox. No one gets a team better prepared for a big game than Bobby
Bowden and his staff. This one is for it all. It's in the desert.
It's another chance for Bowden to take a title. We have to believe
the old fox will find a way.

Kansas State promises post-A&AMP;M funk has lifted
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ As the Kansas State Wildcats behold the Riverwalk,
their toughest task may be to keep their minds out of the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Big 12 Championship Game at St. Louis, the Wildcats
had an outside shot at a Fiesta Bowl berth and, with a win there,
the national championship. By halftime, with UCLA having lost, they
looked like a shoo-in for the Fiesta. By game's end, having lost
36-33 in double overtime to Texas A&AMP;M, they were also-rans _ at
least when it came to national-championship consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But at 11-1, Kansas State was still one of the top eight teams
in the country, which made it especially maddening when the
Wildcats were passed over for an at-large berth in the Bowl
Championship Series, then snubbed by the Cotton and Holiday bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Their eventual destination was the Alamo Bowl. And while the
matchup with Purdue is a far cry from a Fiesta Bowl matchup for the
national title, coach Bill Snyder said the game presents him with
the toughest coaching job he has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks his team will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the air clears and we have some time, this football team
will want to compete again,'' he said. ``I trust the competitive
nature of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's competitive nature, however, has been just part of
the battle. Ron Hudson, the Wildcats' offensive coordinator and
quarterbacks coach, said that before Snyder could prepare the
Wildcats, he had to recover himself from the loss to A&AMP;M and the
vanished shot at the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This upset him personally,'' Hudson said. ``We have lost some
big games in the past, but to get to where we were at the
particular point and kind of understand the commitment and hard
work we had and to come so close _ it's difficult on anybody. But
he's fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said losing in overtime was what stung so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come as close as we did and have a chance to win the game
and not execute at the end, then that is disappointing when you
know that you have got the people to get it done,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This not only falls on the players, but falls on us as
coaches. It's a direct reflection on what we have done in terms of
preparation, and we didn't get it done. The impact that game had on
this program was resounding. You go from a high to not
understanding why.''
</P>
<P>
   Other blows followed. Defensive coordinator Mike Stoopes agreed
to become defensive coordinator on his brother Bob's new staff at
Oklahoma. Linebackers coach Brent Venables also will join Stoops at
OU, and defensive ends coach Jon Fabris might leave for South
Carolina to reunite with Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kansas State players asked Stoopes and Venables to
remain with the team through the Alamo Bowl, and both agreed to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the players who went to coach Snyder and requested that
Mike Stoopes and Brent Venables remain and help us prepare for this
game,'' Hudson said. ``They want to win this game, and they knew if
they brought in new coaches for their position, it might cause some
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players recognize that these people have to live
their lives and make hard decisions. Mike Stoopes is still getting
in their faces in practice. You just have to realize that this is
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other consolation prizes followed. Michael Bishop won the Davey
O'Brien Award as the nation's top quarterback and was second in the
Heisman balloting. Snyder won the Bear Bryant Coach of the Year
Award presented in Houston. Both were badly needed morale boosters,
said linebacker Jeff Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice _ all the awards,'' Kelly said. ``It really helped
because you had everybody who knew a lot about football telling you
that you had a great season. That was a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   So, slowly but surely, Kansas State is building the same sort of
game-day attitude that made the Fiesta Bowl such a real possibility
before the loss to the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to finish the season with a victory,'' Bishop
said. ``It will be the last time for the seniors to go into battle
and do this one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pressure on us. We know what kind of team we have.
We don't have to go out and prove that. We feel we don't have to
prove anything to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go out with a win. But if we go out with a loss, I
think everything happens for a reason. It would be great to win
your last college game ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever it may be.

Vikings claim record; Oilers mark transition
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The postgame scene outside the dressing rooms at
Vanderbilt Stadium on Saturday was almost surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before, Minnesota had defeated Tennessee 26-16 to become
the highest-scoring team in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings owner Red McCombs celebrated Minnesota joining the 1984
San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears as the league's only
15-1 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been chasing this dream for 30 years,'' said McCombs, San
Antonio's favorite son who bought the Vikings in the offseason for
$245 million. ``To have a dream season like this is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Tennessee guard Bruce Matthews and line coach
Mike Munchak, two of the greatest players in franchise history,
posed for a picture with the other linemen because it was their
last time together in an Oilers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be strange being called something besides the Oilers,''
said Matthews, who was voted to the Pro Bowl for the 11th
consecutive year. ``Being part of the Oilers has been special to
me. Who knows, someday this game might be the answer to a trivia
question.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:44 p.m., a 39-year era ended when Houston/Tennessee played
its last game as the Oilers. But owner Bud Adams didn't make the
trip from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional day for me,'' Adams said. ``I just
thought it was better to spend it with our family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked the name in 1959. That's a lot of time and memories,
but we're ready to start our new era as the Titans. We're excited
about moving into our new stadium next year. We can give people
some new memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, for a team known for choking in the playoffs when it
made the playoffs at all, the Oilers blew two leads, including a
13-8 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the sellout crowd of 41,121 came to Vanderbilt Stadium
to see Minnesota and such stars as quarterback Randall Cunningham,
receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter and defensive tackle John
Randle. After a slow start, the Vikings didn't disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   With Cunningham throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns to
Carter and Moss, the Vikings finished with 556 points, breaking
Washington's 1983 record of 541.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this could be a record-setting offense back in the
spring when we re-signed everybody and added Randy to the mix,''
said running back Robert Smith, who rushed for 73 yards. ``I knew
that if this offense stuck together, we could have an unbelievable
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like being a great quarterback. They're not
considered great quarterbacks until they've been to the show and
won it. This is a great team, but this (scoring record and
finishing 15-1) won't mean a thing if we don't get to the big show
and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The big show is the Super Bowl, and the Vikings never have won
it. Now Minnesota is favored over anything the AFC has to offer,
including Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion that has lost
its past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we have home-field advantage, and we
have to take advantage of it,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green desperately wanted to finish 15-1. He started all of his
regulars who were healthy other than offensive tackle Kory
Stringer. When the Oilers led 13-5 on two Al Del Greco field goals
and Eddie George's two-yard run, the Vikings were not concerned.
That's called confidence, and they have it by the tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were overconfident,'' said Cunningham, who
signed a five-year contract extension this past week. ``It's
amazing, really. We struggled to score 26 points. Some teams would
think 26 points is great, but expectations are so high for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 15-1 record is awesome, but we want to be 18-1. We made too
many mistakes today, and it's important for us to keep plugging and
stay with our style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who might have surpassed Denver's Terrell Davis as
the leading candidate to be the NFL's Most Valuable Player,
completed six passes for 78 yards to Carter and five for 32 to
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who finished with 17 touchdown catches, is expected to be
named Offensive Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchdowns, yards, making things happen, tearing it up _ I
expected all that from myself as a rookie,'' Moss said. ``I didn't
think too much about the winning side, but now that we're 15-1, it
doesn't really mean much until we reach the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are the first dome team with the home-field
advantage. They get a well-deserved break by sitting out the first
round and hosting a second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about history; I'm thinking about the
playoffs,'' said Randle, a Hearne native who lives in Houston in
the offseason. ``Being 15-1 is great, but we have a bigger goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all this hasn't really sunk in. It might be April
before it does. All I know right now is that we have a week off for
everyone to get healthy. We have a chance to relax, but we want to
enter the playoffs with a winning edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we could have lost in this game is the feeling
of victory,'' said defensive tackle Jerry Ball, a Beaumont native.
``You want to go into the playoffs and build, and you would rather
win than lose. Our focus is on the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, the Vikings took a back seat to Denver
when it came to the national spotlight. The Broncos were trying to
finish 16-0. Now, the spotlight is on Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I didn't follow Denver,'' Randle said. ``I followed The
Young and the Restless. Now, if you want to know anything about
that ''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

Ohio State coach still claims shot at No. 1
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ Maybe he didn't invent it, but unfettered optimism
undoubtedly got its anthem from an infamous utterance of Major
League Baseball Hall of Famer and philosopher Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it is over, someone is likely to say, ``It ain't over
'til it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Ohio State football coach John Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   He still believes, or at least he still sounds like he believes,
his Buckeyes are in the hunt for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the same third-ranked Buckeyes, who arrived here Saturday
to begin preparations for a tilt with No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar
Bowl on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the No. 1-ranked team (Tennessee) will face the
No. 2-ranked team (Florida State) in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, in
what the Bowl Championship Series bills as the national
championship game, Cooper says, ``This thing's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the door is not shut on us yet,'' Cooper said. ``We
have just as much claim to the national title as Florida State
would, if we beat Texas A&AMP;M and they beat Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State (10-1) was the preseason No. 1-ranked team and spent
10 weeks of the season atop the national rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But it fell out of the national championship picture with a
28-24 loss to Michigan State at home on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes hope a huge win over the Aggies coupled with a
Florida State victory over unbeaten Tennessee could get them a
share of the national crown, since Florida State and Ohio State
would each end the season with one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State lost by 17 points on the road to unranked North
Carolina State, but the Wolfpack will at least play in a bowl game
(Micron PC), while Michigan State will not.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper sold his argument fast and furiously just after Texas A&AMP;M
and Miami did his Buckeyes a huge favor by knocking off Kansas
State and UCLA the last Saturday of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   How many have bought into it is difficult to determine. The
ESPN/USA Today coaches poll has agreed to vote the winner of the
Fiesta Bowl as its No. 1 team. The Associated Press media poll has
no such automatic alliance, but Ohio State would likely have to be
more than just impressive against Texas A&AMP;M to jump Florida State
in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take nothing away from Texas A&AMP;M and (coach) R.C. Slocum,
because I know they will be prepared to play and they are a very
good team,'' Cooper said. ``We know it's a long shot, but there is
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's proposal of a mini-playoff system would work in his
Buckeyes' favor this season. He would like to see a one-game
playoff after the end of the bowl season, pitting the top two
remaining squads two weeks after the New Year's Day bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has been a proponent of that long before this year's
predicament, but in the current system, there is only one way Ohio
State can claim a share of the national title _ by miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M has heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State was No. 1 in one poll and No. 2 in the other
entering the Big 12 Championship Game, but with its third-place
standing in the BCS ratings, the Wildcats figured they needed a
huge win over the two-touchdown underdog Aggies to possibly get an
invite to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Kansas State not get a huge win, it got beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ohio State wants to talk about how they can possibly
win a national championship by blowing us out, but I'm pretty sure
Kansas State thought the same thing,'' A&AMP;M linebacker Warrick
Holdman said. ``We can't worry about that stuff. We're going out
there to try and win the game just like they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cooper may try as hard as the street vendors here to sell
his product, the Buckeyes know their hopes probably went down the
drain with the devastating loss to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the quietest, coldest feeling I've ever been a part
of in that stadium,'' Ohio State senior safety Damon Moore said.
``You could hear a pin drop _ even on grass you could have heard
it. It was just a sick feeling. It was something about that 8-0
start at that time and all of a sudden it was gone, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like it was the second week of the season, where we
can still get back (in the national title hunt). We pretty much
knew (it was over). Everybody was feeling it, the seniors, the
fans, the people collecting tickets, the cheerleaders _ it was a
bad feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper felt it as well, but he still hopes the loss doesn't mean
it's over, because as you know, ``It ain't over 'til it's over.''
