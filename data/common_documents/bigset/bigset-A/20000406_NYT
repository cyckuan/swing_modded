REV. ROBERT ROSS JOHNSON, 79, FIRST PASTOR OF QUEENS CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Ross Johnson, a leading clergyman in Queens for
nearly four decades and a former chaplain for the New York City
Department of Correction, died on March 29 at a hospital in
Atlanta. He was 79 and had moved to Atlanta in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a long illness, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the founding pastor of the St. Albans Congregational
Church, which was established in 1953 and thrived in a black
middle-class neighborhood of Queens. Its A-frame structure on
Linden Boulevard was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and Johnson
preached from its pulpit until retiring in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Long active in civic and community affairs, Johnson was a prison
chaplain for 23 years and was on his local school board. In 1969,
Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed him to the city's Board of Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the Human Relations Center of St. Albans to serve
southeastern Queens with cultural and social programs. The center
is now known as the Robert Ross Johnson Family Life Center.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Spokane, Wash., Johnson majored in social science with a
premedical minor at Whitworth College in Spokane, from which he
graduated in 1943. He received a Master of Divinity degree from
Colgate-Rochester Divinity School in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Le Roy, N.Y.,
and co-minister of the interracial South Congregational Church in
Chicago. He came to Brooklyn in 1952 to lead the Nazarene
Congregational Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant but was asked the
following year to start a Congregational church in St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   He was a founder of York College in Jamaica, Queens; a founding
director of the Queens Inter-Faith Clergy Council; a former
director of the NAACP and YMCA boards; and a member of the National
Conference of Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is survived by his wife of 54 years, Ernestine Norwood
Johnson; a daughter, Michele J. Tompkins of Atlanta; two sons,
Stephen R., of Manhattan, and John E., of Atlanta; and three
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE QUEST OF JUAN GONZALEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has made the right decision to travel to
the United States on Thursday to affirm his desire to be reunited
with his son, Elian. His presence on American soil is necessary to
dispel doubts about his fitness as a father _ raised maliciously by
Elian's Miami relatives _ and to end speculation that he is
indifferent about reclaiming custody of his son. With Gonzalez all
but out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to
distort the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated
claims that Elian is afraid to see his father.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives are obviously fond of Elian, though their judgment
has clearly been clouded by their animosity toward Fidel Castro,
the Cuban leader. Once Gonzalez comes to the United States _ it
would be preferable if he went to Miami rather than to Washington _
only the most obdurate foes of Castro can argue that Elian should
not be reunited with him. Gonzalez's arrival should also help clear
the way for the Justice Department to make arrangements to transfer
custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have left unclear whether they will
willingly relinquish custody of Elian, and have done their best to
stir passions against the Justice Department among Cuban-Americans
in South Florida. In hopes of trumping the law, they have
unreasonably demanded that a panel of child psychologists determine
Elian's fate. The best outcome would be for the relatives to turn
Elian over to his father as soon as Gonzalez arrives, and to do so
in a spirit of kinship that makes the transition as smooth as
possible for Elian. Once that happens, Gonzalez and Elian, though
technically free to return to Cuba, should remain here to await an
appellate court ruling on the case, which is expected next month.
</P>
<P>
   But if the relatives balk, the Justice Department should quickly
revoke their custody of the child and obtain a federal court order
instructing them and their lawyers to turn Elian over to his
father. The relatives may be less defiant if they are held in
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   If a court edict fails to compel compliance, the Justice
Department will have to consider sterner measures, for the
relatives will then be resisting the rule of law as defined by both
the department and the courts. But Washington ought not to rush to
take Elian forcibly from the relatives. That course would be
psychologically wounding to the boy, and could lead to a violent
confrontation with demonstrators who gather daily outside the
relatives' home. The government yields none of its legal or moral
authority in the case if it gives the relatives and their
supporters time to reflect and to look for a gentler resolution.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of law, compassion and common sense, the government
is entitled to reunite Elian with his father, and it has the power
to enforce that right, despite the bluster of Miami's demagogic
political leaders. But for now, everyone involved should be
searching for an amicable ending. Juan Gonzalez is doing his part
by making the short journey across the Florida Straits to erase any
question about his love for his son.

USC LOOKING TO LAGUNA BEACH
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's chances of landing Laguna Hills High
swingman Travis Hanour could hinge on whether the Trojans sign his
friend and teammate, forward Chris Manker, who was offered a
scholarship this week.
</P>
<P>
   `If Chris goes to USC, it would be a big factor,'' Hanour said.
``We could live together and it would be a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanour is trying to decide between Arizona and USC. Officially,
he is also considering Utah and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arizona and USC) are both right there,'' Hanour said. ``I'm
still confused. I'm trying to figure out after four years, where I
would get the best education and the best possibility to play pro
basketball afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Manker is deciding between Oregon State and USC. Both schools
would like to redshirt the 6-foot-9 forward.
</P>
<P>
   Manker and Hanour left Wednesday for a recruiting trip to Oregon
State, though Hanour said he ``probably'' would not be interested
in playing for the Beavers. Manker visited USC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   USC has a scholarship to offer Hanker following last week's
departure of point guard Rashad Jones and shooting guard Malachi
Thurston. Hanour had committed to USC in late February, before
changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will make a decision early next week, possibly as
early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris and I will probably make our decision together,'' Hanour
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's basketball shakeup: USC women's basketball coach
Chris Gobrecht has decided to alter her coaching staff, reassigning
assistants Erika Lang-Montgomery and Traci Nemechek to
administrative jobs within the athletic department. Gobrecht will
hire two new assistants, possibly in the next two or three weeks.
Assistant coach Stacy McIntyre will remain on the staff.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's sensible plan to ensure that human
organs donated for transplants are allocated according to medical
need, not geographic happenstance, encountered a new roadblock on
Tuesday. By a vote of 275-147, the House approved legislation that
would move authority to decide how organs are distributed across
the country from the Department of Health and Human Services, where
it belongs, to the private agency now under contract with the
government to coordinate distribution, the nonprofit United Network
for Organ Sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is the latest turn in a fierce turf war with
potential life-or-death consequences for the estimated 68,000
Americans who are currently waiting for a heart, lung, liver,
kidney or pancreas. If enacted, it would nullify a federal
regulation that directs the network to revise its allocation system
so that organs are shared broadly across regional lines to allow
them to reach the neediest patients. President Clinton is right to
threaten a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The existing system directs most organs to be used in the local
area where they are donated. If a matching patient is not found,
the organ is then offered regionally, or in rare instances
nationally. The unfortunate result is waiting times that vary
greatly from region to region, and unfairness to desperately ill
patients who have the misfortune of residing outside the
procurement area.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to a more rational distribution system stems from
fears that it would put small transplant centers out of business
and discourage organ donations if they might end up outside the
local community. These concerns were judged to be overblown by the
Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, in a 1999 report commissioned by Congress. That report
affirmed the good sense of sharing organs across wider regions and
the need for active federal oversight of the sort the House has now
voted to remove.

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - In broad daylight Wednesday, April 5, a group of
suspicious-looking characters armed with highly explosive ideas,
hair-trigger convictions and fully loaded brains slipped right
under the noses of police and security personnel and onto the
grounds of the state Capitol.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exactly how a security breach of this magnitude could have
occurred is currently un der investigation, especially be cause the
suspects not only were younger and better looking than everyone
working at the Capitol, but quickly re vealed themselves as
political outsiders by speaking in com plete sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there they were _ stu dents.
</P>
<P>
   They'd come to the Capitol to rally in favor of additional edu
cation funding. It is their belief, they say, that Arizona's Instru
ment to Measure Standards, or AIMS test, is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the young people be lieve our tax money might be better
spent on higher pay for teachers or expanded facilities for schools
or broader opportu nities for pupils.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that such poli cies would go further toward lifting
Arizona from the bottom of the national rankings in edu cation than
would cheesy gim micks or lip service.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing these eager, in telligent, dedicated youngsters,
I'm convinced Arizona legisla tors will get the message.
</P>
<P>
   They'll see that, in spite of their best effort to deconstruct
the public school system and completely demoralize educa tors,
Arizona schools continue turning out young people who aren't as
stupid as our politi cians would like them to be.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. The legislators will keep working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, they've tried to build on statistics show ing
Arizona to be worst in the Union when it comes to high school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   When the legislative session began, Senate Appropriations
Chairman Randall Gnant told a reporter, ``Education requests are
important, but so are a lot of other issues. Get in line and make a
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a philosophy places edu cation issues somewhere behind
proposals to build a stadium for fat cats, closing down strip bars
and seceding from the Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hear the talk from the politicians about edu cation,
but we never see the walk,'' said Mickey Goldman, one of the
organizers of the student demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, a senior at Thun derbird High School who plans to
attend Arizona State Univer sity, added, ``The legislators don't
want to deal with the issue,and we thought a student-organized
rally could help. Who better to rally in support of education than
the students, who deal with it every day?''
</P>
<P>
   He's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when students visit the Capitol and have a chance
to speak with elected officials, they quicklylearn there's no AIMS
test for legis lators.
</P>
<P>
   They also find out that just about all of our politicians would
be capable of passing a political GAMES test, in which officials
avoid dealing with edu cation problems by proposing such idiot
schemes as allowing guns in city parks and play grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Students discover as well that legislators would ace any BLAME
test by aggressively pointing the finger at each other or the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   And that our elected officials would do very well on a false
CLAIMS test, during which they would contend it's the other guy
who's stalling reform, not them.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable lesson taught by a visit to the Capitol,
however, is that Arizona politi cians would score an absolute zero
on the SHAME test.
</P>
<P>
   They have none. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TEST CASE FOR EQUAL JUSTICE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial of Thursday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has accepted a case that will decide the
constitutionality of a critical element of Congress' harshly
punitive attack on the federally financed legal services program,
which assists poor people with legal problems. The court's ultimate
ruling will say much about the justices' commitment to free speech
and equal justice under law.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Congress violated the First Amendment in
1996 when it limited the sorts of arguments that lawyers supported
by the federal Legal Services Corp. can make on behalf of clients
seeking welfare benefits. Poverty lawyers whose offices receive
federal money may seek welfare benefits for individual clients but
may not file suits seeking to ``amend or otherwise challenge'' the
statutes or regulations that prevent their clients from gaining
benefits. That is particularly onerous in the new era of welfare
reform experiments by the states when poorly conceived provisions
may harm the poor unless changed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a federal appeals court in New York correctly struck
down the provision because its attempt to ``discourage challenges
to the status quo'' amounted to impermissible ``viewpoint
discrimination'' by the government. But the Clinton administration
is defending the restriction, arguing that government has broad
leeway to attach strings to the use of federal money. The
administration cites a regrettable 1991 Supreme Court decision that
upheld a ban on counseling about abortion in family planning
clinics receiving federal money.
</P>
<P>
   That argument too willingly accepts the restriction's affront to
free speech and ignores the larger assault on justice when lawyers
for poor clients are barred from using the same advocacy tools that
private lawyers use. The net effect, as New York University's
Brennan Center for Justice aptly observed in its brief, is to place
``low-income legal services clients at a substantial disadvantage
as they seek to vindicate their rights.''

MCCAIN HITS `PORK' FOR ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 Republic Washington Bureau 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ While Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was crusaded to halt
``pork-barrel'' spending, his state's congressional delegation
doubled its haul of pork projects for the folks back home,
according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   As its members gained seniority and power, Arizona's delegation
tapped into the tempting windfall of the budget surplus to deliver
nearly $100 million in specially targeted money for all kinds of
home-state projects that critics dubbed ``pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the projects _ ranging from downtown Yuma improvements
to an Army wastewater treatment plant _ were passionately defended
Wednesday, April 5, by the Arizona members who sponsored them in
the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Their protests pitted them at least indirectly against McCain,
who appeared at a news conference Wednesday to support a watchdog
group in the release of its annual report chiding Congress for
``unnecessary and wasteful'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Citizens Against Government Waste, said lawmakers
brought home 4,326 pork projects nationwide costing a record $17.7
billion. To dramatize their point, McCain and the group's
president, Thomas Schatz, stood next to a 200-pound Vietnamese
potbellied pig that stood in a trough and rooted around in fake
dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fiscal 2000, Congress went whole hog, porking up the
various spending bills with billions of dollars in worthless
earmarks,'' Schatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's total bounty was double the $49 million it raked in
during fiscal 1999, moving the state from 48th in the nation in
``pork per capita'' to 28th, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Arizona pork in this year's budget includes
$11.6 million for family housing at the Yuma Marine Corps Air
Station, $150,000 for a downtown Yuma rejuvenation project, $1
million for a science center in Tempe, and an unspecified amount
for University of Arizona research on raising shrimp, research that
is being shared with four other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know there was enough water in Arizona for
shrimp,'' Aaron Taylor of the citizens' group said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's battle against wasteful spending was a centerpiece of
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's self-appointed role as fiscal watchdog has occasionally
antagonized members of his own delegation and the Senate Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never made an issue of it publicly, Rep. Bob Stump,
R-Ariz., is still sore about the ``pork'' label attached to $10
million in funding for a land purchase a few years ago at the Barry
M. Goldwater Range.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens' group, backed by McCain, included the range
funding in its 1998 ``Pig Book'' because the project wasn't
requested in advance by the Air Force and didn't appear in
President Clinton's budget plan. McCain insists that federal
agencies or military include its pleas for funding in the
president's budget so Congress doesn't add projects later that
aren't really needed.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said, ``Citizens Against Government Waste often identifies
spending as pork simply because it was proposed by Congress rather
than the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the range funding, Stump said a presidential
budget request would have been impossible because the land was
still the subject of a legal dispute between the federal government
and the state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Stump was the only Republican in the state's House delegation
not to endorse McCain's presidential bid. While the pork dispute
may have helped create distance between the two, Stump has said it
wasn't the reason for not backing McCain. Stump says he simply
wanted to stay neutral during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said Wednesday's report cited as
``pork'' an ambulatory health care center and a family housing
project he fought for at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The report
said the projects hadn't been requested in the president's budget,
as required.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe said the center replaced trailerlike facilities on the
base and the housing was needed because the units were obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``No apologies,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not return calls to his office seeking comment. &QL;

PADRES SHUT OUT METS, 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a pitcher's success is determined by how well he
spots his pitches, Bobby J. Jones would have gotten progressively
better as Wednesday night went on.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets right-hander worked a 1-2-3 first inning against the
San Diego Padres, but he felt his fastball was too high in the
strike zone. He improved on his location the next two innings, but
the results were drastically different: the Padres scored four runs
and Jones was gone before the final out of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes good pitches get hit,'' he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start since last May, when he was sidelined with
bursitis in his pitching shoulder, Jones fell to the Padres, 4-0.
The outcome displeased the right-hander, but the way he pitched did
not discourage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never happy with a loss,'' said Jones, who allowed four
runs on six hits in two and two-thirds innings, ``but I look back
and they weren't hitting balls in the gap all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine removed Jones after a bases-loaded walk
to Bret Boone forced in the Padres' fourth run. Jones had been
getting ahead of the hitters, and threw 49 strikes among his 74
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he could have left Jones in longer, but decided
against it because it was Jones' first start and the weather was so
cold. It was 41 degrees at game time, but it felt colder; several
Mets said they saw snow flurries on their way to the park, and some
wore ski caps during pregame warm-ups. Far fewer fans than the
announced crowd of 17,585 showed up at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jones walked Phil Nevin to lead off the second, and Boone drove
him in two batters later with a double to the right-center warning
track. Ruben Rivera followed by blooping a double down the
right-field line, scoring Boone. After Carlos Hernandez's chopper
deflected off Jones' glove for a single, Rivera scored, and the
Padres led, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starting pitchers had allowed only three runs in the last
21 innings before Wednesday night; Jones permitted that many in a
span of five hitters in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The final run came in the third on the walk to Boone, who fought
back from an 0-and-2 count and took first base on a slider that
just missed the strike zone. Jones had also gotten to 0-2 against
the previous hitter, Eric Owens, who fouled off two pitches before
eventually topping a curveball to third. Robin Ventura was playing
back to keep a hit from going through the hole, and his throw to
first arrived too late to get Owens, prolonging the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' offense, which has only 10 runs while batting .185
over four games, had several opportunities against the Padres
starter Woody Williams. But the Mets stranded 11 runners, seven in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Mike Piazza said. ``I think we have to be
a little more disciplined and swing the bats better. We're getting
into situations where we're overswinging and not getting good
pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' best chance came in the fourth, when a single by
Ventura and back-to-back walks loaded the bases for Rey Ordonez.
But he swung at the first pitch, popping up to second, and the
pinch-hitter Jon Nunnally followed with a strikeout. Rickey
Henderson grounded sharply to first, but Ryan Klesko fielded the
ball and beat Henderson to the bag, ending the inning and keeping
the Mets scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Williams allowed no runs on five hits and was removed for Carlos
Almanzar to start the seventh. Almanzar allowed a leadoff double to
Edgardo Alfonzo in the eighth, and with runners at first and second
and one out, Derek Bell struck out looking on a pitch that appeared
to be well outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bell returned to the dugout with eyebrows raised, in obvious
disagreement with Umpire Wally Bell's call. Todd Zeile, who had two
hits (including a double for the second game in a row), ended the
inning with another strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who is making the transition from third base to first,
committed his second error of the season last night. He drifted
back on a pop-up by Williams in the fourth. The second baseman,
Alfonzo, raced over and had a better angle on the ball, but Zeile
was calling for it all the way, and it dropped just behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to second on a single by Al Martin, but the
reliever Pat Mahomes escaped the jam. Mahomes, Rich Rodriguez, Turk
Wendell and Dennis Cook provided scoreless relief over six and
one-third innings for the Mets.

PLANETARY ALIGNMENT TO BEGIN TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Look to the western skies tonight to see a rare
clustering of three planets and the crescent moon, a 20-year event
that some fear is the beginning of the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It all will start about 8:15 tonight when Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn will bunch up next to the moon. And it will all climax when
Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn align with the sun
between May 5 and May 16, an occurrence some predict will trigger a
stock market crash, unleash earthquakes and cause all manner of bad
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all lined up in Taurus _ that's the monetary, that's
the stock market. Things are getting crazy already,'' said Carol
Krause, owner of Astro Connections, an astrology shop in Sherman
Oaks. ``Whatever happens is going to make a lot of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, however, view the alignment with a cosmic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have no interest in it at all,'' said John Mosley,
an astronomer at the Griffith Observatory. ``The only way we know
about it is because people ask.''
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrable effect of six planets falling in line with the
sun is that Earth will experience greater gravitational stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said that influence will amount to just about zip,
however. On Earth, where the moon alone lifts tides as much as four
feet, the tug of the assembled planets will lift them
three-thousandths of an inch more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be looked at in perspective. There's not going to be
any catastrophes,'' said Roger Sinnott, associate editor of Sky and
Telescope magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers believe the pull of gravity will set loose a swarm of
quakes and more activity on the sun's surface, causing Earth's
poles to shift.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation, author Richard Noone issued a warning in his
book, ``5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster,'' in which he predicts
bizarre weather and general calamity. On his Web site he offers his
book, a survival catalog, for $2 and ``Basic Preparedness,'' a
how-to book, for $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine editor Sinnott said the alignment of planets has long
intrigued people and crept into popular mythology and even the
language, as those experiencing good luck, bad luck or general odd
situations have attributed it to planetary alignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astrology for thousands of years has been concerned with
planets being lined up. I'm sure that's how the expressions have
crept into the language,'' said Sinnott, whose magazine is devoting
the bulk of its content to the alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Alignments, which take place about every 20 years, have been as
good a reason as any for soothsayers past and present to predict
the worst, never the best.
</P>
<P>
   If alignments haven't influenced history significantly, they
have at least influenced historic figures. Sinnott notes that Nazi
Rudolph Hess timed his moves by planetary alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was right in the middle of World War II, when Rudolph Hess
flew to Scotland,'' Sinnott said. ``He picked the date of early May
1941 to escape Germany, based primarily on the advice of his
astrologer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley's money, tonight's spectacle, when the three planets
are bunched tightest, is the more important event _ if for no other
reason than it is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Patient viewers will have a chance to observe something most
people have to wait years to see: the movement of planets. Mars
will spend the next few nights drifting past Jupiter and then
Saturn before all set in the western sky. Normally, such easy
reference points are not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see three planets that you can cover with your outstretched
hand, that's pretty cool,'' Mosley said. ``A lot of people don't
look at the planets at all, so this will be significant.''

PACERS DEFEAT NETS, 105-101 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Depleted by injuries and deflated by the
realization that they are not going to make the playoffs, the New
Jersey Nets showed some courage on Wednesday night. They fought
back from a 20-point third-quarter deficit and threw a scare into
the Indiana Pacers here at Conseco Fieldhouse before losing,
105-101. It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Nets (31-44).
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who trailed by 79-59 late in the third period, rallied
to come within 98-97, with 47 seconds to play, on a 3-point basket
by forward Keith Van Horn, who had 26 points. But they could not
overtake Indiana. The Nets had a defensive lapse and left Pacers
forward Dale Davis alone under the basket with 33 seconds to play.
He scored on a layup to make it 100-97. Nets forward Scott Burrell
then missed a driving baseline layup, and New Jersey was forced to
foul the Pacers to get the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're out of the playoffs, but we still have to come
out and be professionals and work,'' said guard Kendall Gill, who
had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that three of the Nets' starters were on the
bench when the team started its furious rally. Point guard Stephon
Marbury did not play because of a painful left knee. He will have a
magnetic resonance imaging scan on Thursday when the team gets back
to New Jersey. Marbury could very well be lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, 23, is dreading the MRI because he fears what the
doctors may find. But he will not gamble on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play if my leg is hurting like this,''
Marbury said before the game. ``There's no sense in me being out
there if I can't blow by nobody and can't play defense. That's no
fun. What makes basketball fun for me is to be able to dominate my
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles, the Nets' other starting guard, was also on the
bench. He was limited to 21 minutes tonight because of a sore right
knee. He will have the knee examined by the team doctor, Michael
Kelly, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nets' starting center, Evan Eschmeyer, left the game
early in the second quarter because of a severely sprained left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach Don Casey was very pleased with the effort that he
got from guard Johnny Newman, who had 20 points, and Elliot Perry,
who had 14 points and helped the team get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hanging with the best even on the road in one of the
worst situations,'' Casey said. ``That's what I said about these
guys. They can regroup and come back even with limited forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey mixed and matched players through out the game. Everyone
played except Marbury and Jim McIlvaine, who has missed the last
seven games because of a bulging disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers (50-24) went right after the Nets in the first half,
feeding the ball to center Rik Smits in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Smits had 17 points in the first quarter. But Smits was quiet in
the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, when he failed
to score as the Nets rallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have been able to control Rik Smits in the first
half, it might have been a different game,'' Van Horn said. ``You
know great players like Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose are going to
get their shots. We can't let someone like Rik Smits, a
second-option guy, hurt you.''

KOBE SAYS HE WON'T APPEAL FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Kobe Bryant's suspension wasn't all bad. He caught a
movie (``Romeo Must Die'') and got a good night's rest, and in
between he watched his Lakers teammates pull out a dramatic victory
at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' Bryant said of his forced day off, ``but it
wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. I knew they were
going to pull it out. I had complete confidence in them, so I
wasn't biting my nails or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   With another day to think about his Sunday-afternoon fight with
New York's Chris Childs, Bryant said he'll ``absolutely'' respond
differently if provoked in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably put my arms to the guy's throat, so he couldn't
throw a punch. Punches wouldn't be thrown,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, who as the fight's instigator got an even heavier
punishment _ two-game suspension and $15,000 fine _ is appealing
the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's agent, Arn Tellem, reportedly said he would appeal
Bryant's one-game suspension (which cost him $109,756 in pay) and
$5,000 fine as well. Bryant said that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tellem) mentioned it to me, but I said I really don't want
to,'' he said. ``I don't really care about that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The day off did make Bryant a little antsy for Wednesday
morning's shootaround and the coaching staff got his attention
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant coach) Frank Hamblen said that he thought (Warriors
guard) Larry Hughes picked him up with his own chauffered limousine
at the airport, so he could play against him; I think Kobe perked
up a little bit,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``He knows that
(Hughes) got one game here at Golden State that he'd like to redeem
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Bryant, who gave up 41 points to Hughes last time
here, ``Phil is always doing something like that, man.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Down time: Ron Harper played 39 minutes at Phoenix, and that
earned him a night off here Wednesday. Harper stayed in street
clothes and the Lakers listed him as having a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that after 39 minutes of a hard game, this is
the kind of game that we can avoid at this time,'' said Jackson,
who's been looking for opportunities to rest the 36-year-old
veteran. ``If he was in uniform, the temptation to play him would
be too great.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said he didn't need the rest, ``but I can use off this
game. We've got a large game (against San Antonio) in two days.
This rest will help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, though . . . . I could have played easily
tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching Harper miss two crucial free throws at
Phoenix, Bryant endorsed the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he stepped to the free-throw line at the end, I said
there's no way in hell he's gonna make this,'' Bryant said with a
laugh. ``He's too tired, man. That ball's not going in the hoop.''

DISARCINA SAYS THIS IS BEST TIME TO MEET EAST

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels opened the season with three games
against the defending champion New York Yankees, and after today's
off day will take on the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays, two
more teams expected to compete for playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought is the Angels would prefer an easier
schedule to open the season, so they could get a few wins and build
confidence after last season's disaster. But that's not their
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to face those guys some time,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``It might as well be now. Maybe they don't have
their act together yet coming out of spring training. Playing them
in the middle of the season might be a tougher task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played very competitive games against the Yankees,''
left fielder Darin Erstad said. ``The games could have gone either
way, it's not like we didn't have opportunities. We can play with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Heart stopper: The heart of the Angels' lineup _ Mo Vaughn,
Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson in the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 spots _ were
a combined 4 for 27 with eight strikeouts in the first two losses.
Offense was the club's biggest on-field problem last season, but
manager Mike Scioscia isn't worried about his big guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are going to hit,'' he said. ''You think, out of
all the things on the club that could go wrong, those three are the
last thing you have to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Short hops: Pitcher Ramon Ortiz is expected to pitch seven
innings for Single-A Lake Elsinore tonight in the Storm's season
opener. Ortiz, who says he feels no pain despite a small tear in
his shoulder tissue, is expected to make his season debut Tuesday
at home against the Blue Jays. . . . The Yankees will wear black
armbands for the 2000 season to honor former manager and Hall of
Fame pitcher Bob Lemon, a Long Beach native.

 REPORT ON GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS HIT AS PRO-AGRIBUSINESS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A scientific panel that waded into the debate over genetically
engineered foods drew fire Wednesday from environmental opponents
for taking a narrow, pro-industry view of the possible human and
environmental risks posed by gene-splicing technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a 261-page report issued Wednesday, a 12-person National
Research Council panel said it ``was not aware of any evidence
suggesting foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result
of genetic modification.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves the transfer in a laboratory of
genes from one plant or animal into a crop. Traditional plant
breeding tries to introduce new genes through pollen transfer, or
sexual reproduction, from one plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists, who spent a year hammering out a consensus
report, said the Environmental Protection Agency should revise, and
then implement, a genetic plant review process that it proposed in
1994 but has not completed.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested revision involves EPA's proposed exemption of
plant breeders who use sexual reproduction to introduce alien genes
into a crop. The panel questioned why the review process focused
solely on gene-splicing.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also said the EPA needed to work more closely with the
Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, two
other agencies involved in the review process, to improve safety
testing and alleviate concerns that genetically modified foods
might pose health or environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledged that their report focused on only
gene modifications that make plants resistant to pests and
diseases. It did not study other common types of alterations, such
as adding genes to make plants herbicide-resistant or to improve
their vitamin content.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the report discuss whether genetically modified foods
should be labeled, a move opponents have demanded to alert people
who may be afraid of allergic reactions to new genes or who simply
do not like the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was issued, environmentalists complained
that the committee was stacked to favor agribusiness. The
committee's original staff director, for example, is now a lobbyist
for the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the conflicts of this study, this is not credible as an
independent scientific report,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal
director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C. His
group has filed federal lawsuits challenging the FDA and other
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.,
co-authors of bills to force the labeling of genetically modified
foods, also accused the panel of pro-industry ``bias.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference where the report was released, panel
Chairman Perry Adkisson, an entomologist and chancellor emeritus at
Texas A&AMP;M University, stressed that the report reflects a consensus
view that included the opinions of Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist
with Environmental Defense in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides ...
it's not surprising that our work has come under such strong
scrutiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Goldburg acknowledged that ``the committee members
worked hard to get out a consensus recommendation,'' she declined
to give the report a ringing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should look at the criticisms and look at the report
and draw their own conclusions,'' she said.

EXPOS MANAGER MAKES HIS POINT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Montreal manager Felipe Alou didn't appreciate
Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser hitting Vladimir Guerrero with a
pitch high on the shoulder, and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
didn't particularly care for Alou's finger-pointing reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   The ire of both managers was evident after the Expos' 6-5 win
Wednesday at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to believe that he hit Guerrero purposely,''
Alou said. ``I have a right to believe it. If I'm wrong, I already
asked God for forgiveness. I also believe that at my age (64) I
have the right every once in a while to become what I became. I
really lost my head. I really did and I was not inviting anyone to
fight or anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just saying, `This is between you and I.' Sometimes you
think you're right to lose your top when something like that
happens. I don't want anyone hitting my kid because he's having a
good night or a good series, and at that time I thought Guerrero
was hit purposely. I have a right to believe that because I've been
in the game more years than Hershiser is old (41).''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who had thrown behind the head of Expos pitcher
Javier Vazquez, hit Guerrero with a pitch with runners on first and
second and two out in the fifth. Hershiser quickly walked toward
home plate to apologize and Guerrero said he was fine and went to
first.
</P>
<P>
   Alou met Guerrero at first base. But before returning to the
dugout, Alou yelled at Hershiser and pointed his finger. Once back
in the dugout, Alou continued to holler at Hershiser. Second-base
umpire Jim McKean issued a warning to both benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alou precipitated that, it was uncalled for,'' Johnson said.
``Here's a guy (Guerrero) hitting good, trying to throw the ball in
on him and nicked him . . . . pointing his finger. I don't like to
see the second-base umpire call it, but he really had no choice
after what Alou did. He had to put a warning after that. I didn't
appreciate the whole thing. I thought it was awful. We're not
trying to hit, we're trying to pitch him in tight. Here's a guy
hitting .700.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said the only intention was to pitch Guerrero inside
to set him up for the rest of the at-bat. Guerrero's 6 for 9 with
two homers and five RBI in the first three games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to hit him, I'm just trying to throw it up and
in to get him off the pitches,'' Hershiser said. ``It's pretty
obvious during the season he's been hitting the ball away very
well. You don't think anyone is going throw the ball on the outer
half of the plate without setting him up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hundley, Mills progress: Todd Hundley could have played and
Alan Mills might be ready to pitch tonight, both good news for the
two injured players.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Johnson feared Mills, one of four right-handed
set-up men in the bullpen, could be heading for the disabled list,
but Mills' injured right ankle progressed to the point where he did
agility running in the outfield before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trainers did a great job,'' Mills said. ``It's just about
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who injured his right knee when he spike caught in the
dirt, said he's relieved and raring to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up (Tuesday), I was worried it was a broken leg,''
Hundley said. ``Luckily, it turn out like this. But the clay (in
the infield) here is brutal. It's the worst in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Lost in Monday's opener was Hundley's final
at-bat, a right-handed single through the middle. It was his first
hit right-handed since July 18, 1999, at Pittsburgh. ``How `bout
that. It's a new year, bro. Hitting 1.000 from the right side,''
Hundley said. . . . Johnson worked Todd Hollandsworth and Jose
Vizcaino into the starting lineup for the first time in place of
Devon White and Kevin Elster, respectively. Johnson said he wanted
White to get a day off the turf and give Elster a chance to catch
his breath.

CLINTON, ECONOMIC STARS TALK STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ President Clinton hosted a star-studded White
House conference on the ``new economy'' Wednesday, headlined by
soothing, albeit cautious, comments by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and Goldman Sachs market-mover Abby Joseph Cohen.
<P>
   The timing was exquisitely coincidental, coming the day after
$1.19 trillion in stock value nearly evaporated before the markets
staged an astonishing recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our
history and an economic transformation as profound as that that led
us into the Industrial Revolution,'' Clinton told leading
economists, Cabinet secretaries, Wall Street investment bankers and
high-tech titans gathered in the ornate White House East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Seating arrangements delivered additional ironies, with Clinton
next to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. Clinton gave a warm
introduction to Gates, draping his arm over the software
billionaire just two days after his administration won a stinging
antitrust verdict against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the ``phenomenal commitments'' of Gates and his
wife, Melinda, to donate $750 million to fight global poverty and
health problems, while Gates provided assurances that the
technology boom ``has really just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The super-seminar in economic policy mirrored a similar
conference Clinton held in December 1992 in Little Rock, Ark., just
before first taking office as president. But while that conference
focused on budget deficits and unemployment, Wednesday's explored
how to keep the record-setting expansion running even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan called the economic expansion ``without precedent in
our annals,'' fueled by a boom in high-tech investment and a
consequent surge in worker productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be little doubt,'' Greenspan said, that the growth
in productivity ``has continued to rise, with scant evidence that
it is about to crest ... I see no reason that productivity growth
cannot remain elevated, or even increase further, to the undeniable
benefit of American businesses and workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Greenspan cautioned that ``some misalignments have
arisen,'' citing high stock and real estate prices that are fueling
consumer spending well beyond the capacity of the economy to
satisfy without igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But while Greenspan noted that ``inflation has remained largely
contained,'' he cautioned that the two ``safety valves'' that have
kept inflation at bay despite rapid growth _ a large pool of
available labor and cheap, abundant imports _ will not remain open
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan warned that the overall pool of available labor has
been falling steadily and is now at the lowest level as a percent
of the population since such measurements started in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   If labor shortages develop, Greenspan said, they will ``almost
surely'' make wages rise faster than productivity and produce
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that the rising trade deficit could reach a point
where foreigners are no longer as willing to hold U.S. debt. ``At
that point,'' he warned, ``the safety valve of net imports could
narrow or close.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment banker Cohen, whose consistently bullish forecasts
for technology stocks have made her a star on Wall Street, was
likewise optimistic but cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that my day job is as a stock market
strategist,'' Cohen said. ``For the past decade, we have been
enthusiastic about the outlook for stock prices in the United
States, and we remain so.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a later session on risks facing the economy, Cohen
repeated earlier warnings _ which had already rocked the markets _
that the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock market average is no longer
undervalued, and that she has ``less and less confidence in the
relative value of technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft chairman Gates, who in the afternoon found himself
wrapped under one of Clinton's arms (the other rested on World Bank
president James Wohlfenson) had paid a visit to Capitol Hill
earlier Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gates met privately with five groups of lawmakers, including
Senate Democrats and House Republicans, as well with Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who has suspended his bid for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Members said Gates was relaxed and confident that his company
will ultimately prevail on appeal in the government's antitrust
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did not talk with reporters, but his visit was swiftly
followed by a blistering statement from House GOP conference
chairman J.C. Watts laying the blame for Tuesday's near-crash of
the stock market on the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dive in the Nasdaq market is a direct result of the
Clinton-Gore administration meddling with the private sector,''
Watts said. ``The Justice Department has demonstrated that, with
one major decision, they can send the entire world's economy into
disarray ... If the United States is to be a player in the
high-tech world, the federal government is going to have to step
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading San Francisco Bay Area economists attended the
conference, including Stanford University economist John B. Taylor,
who broadly agreed during his presentation on economic risks with
Greenspan's focus on inflation threats.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said every recession since World War II started with a
run-up of inflation that led inevitably to rising interest rates
and an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk is still letting inflation rise,'' Taylor
said. ``I do not see a stock market correction as a risk. If
anything, it would reduce the pressures'' in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Bay Area economists and industry leaders
participated, including Hal Varian, dean of the School of
Information and Management at the University of California at
Berkeley; economists Nada Eissa, Bronwyn Hall and Janet Yellen,
also of UC Berkeley; and E. David Ellington, co-founder and chief
executive officer of NetNoir, headquartered in San Francisco.

DOM DIMAGGIO DOESN'T NEED MO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ So Joe DiMaggio's family doesn't want his name
on North Beach Playground?
<P>
   So sayeth Joe's attorney, Morris (Joltin' Mo) Engelberg, who
demands a bigger memorial and threatens to sue the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe's only living brother, Dom, says baloney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has been very good to my family, starting with my
immigrant parents and continuing to this day,'' says Dom DiMaggio,
also an ex-big league star. ``As far as I'm concerned, the city can
determine for itself the way in which it wants to honor its native
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom, 84, said he and Joe spent countless hours chasing fly balls
at that playground, developing into All-Star center fielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Joe would favor the playground memorial,'' Dom
said, ``especially if lending his name would bring with it a city
commitment to modernize the playground for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Say, this Dom sounds like a classy guy. How about some kind of
local tribute to him, too?
</P>
<P>
   And Supervisor Gavin Newsom says the city isn't backing down to
Engelberg, but is seeking the best legal way to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   MORE DiMAGGIO: It's not surprising that Dom and Mo don't see eye
to eye. When Joe was hospitalized before his death, Engelberg kept
visitors away from Joe's bedside. Including Dom.
</P>
<P>
   Dom and Mo actually scuffled in the hallway outside Joe's
hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Engelberg zealously guards against those who
would slap the DiMaggio name on just any old thing, there is an
office building in Engelberg's own Hollywood, Fla., named Yankee
Clipper Center.
</P>
<P>
   The building's owner: Joltin' Mo Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAN gets around.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown is on billboards and on a million taxicab roofs.
Hey, he's a photogenic guy.
</P>
<P>
   And now he stares into the Chronicle newsroom 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   A mural featuring Brown touting the census has been painted over
the historic Hotel Chronicle sign (no connection with the
newspaper), just across Mission Street from this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   There's Willie, peering approvingly into the third-floor
newsroom as the world's hardest-working editors and writers crank
out another sparkling edition.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, just about wherever you are, Little Brother is watching
you.
</P>
<P>
   IF WALLS could talk, maybe the mayor would explain how it is
that a trucking company that was rejected for the city's minority
contracting program under a previous mayor got a golden pass under
Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Krystal Trucking was granted minority status and access to huge
contracts, with Brown's apparent blessing. This despite a strongly
worded independent report that Krystal is controlled by a
white-owned company, as reported in Sunday's Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Krystal was admitted to the minority program at Brown's apparent
urging, and after a couple of meetings in Brown's office. If the
mayor was not aware of the independent report exposing Krystal's
bogus claim of minority ownership, he should fire the person who
kept that information from him, a person whom Brown subsequently
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   If murals could talk, maybe Mayor Brown would explain why this
isn't a case of laws and ethics being broken, ignored and twisted
to benefit the mayor's friends and campaign contributors, at the
expense of the minorities whom the program is designed to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but how can I be mad when I see that smiling face across the
street?
</P>
<P>
   WANT GIANTS' TICKETS? No problemo!
</P>
<P>
   Want seats in Pac Bell Park? That's a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketvision.com, a ticket sales site not affiliated with the
Giants, posts a current Giants' schedule and a seating chart _ of 3
Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's an overflow plan for cheapskate Candlestick
nostalgia buffs,'' says Doug Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   NOT A TOPIC for Jerry Springer, but a real-life San Francisco
story: ``My ex-wife found me a new bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Mayerson and former city Supervisor Carol Ruth
Silver were amicably divorced several years ago. And a few years
later, Carol Ruth said to Stanley, ``Have I got a girl for you.''
</P>
<P>
   And she did, and Stanley and Irene were married last Sunday
aboard the Larkspur ferry to San Francisco, by the ship's captain.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TAX TIME, and Ted Helman owes a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual there, but Helman is a Muni driver on the 22
Fillmore, and he found a fat wallet with $1,300 in cash outside his
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Helman instantly gave it to the cops, who returned wallet and
cash to owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ted got a nice commendation from Muni, but no reward from the
wallet owner. Hey, I got a buck for Ted, and if anyone wants to
match it, send it along.
</P>
<P>
   ASSORTED PEOPLE: Yes, that familiar face strolling the Union
Square area was Robert Kennedy Jr., in town to give a speech. ...
And yes, that guy working out with a babe at Gold's Gym on Brannan
was Gregory Hines, a recurring guest star on ``Will and Grace,''
though none of the 200 gay men in the gym seemed to notice. ... And
FYI, the big utility board member who abandoned her car with the
keys in it when she couldn't find a parking place, and had it
stolen _ it was  &UR; not  &LR; anyone associated with the PUC.

SWEEPSTAKES COMPANY AGREES TO PAY $50 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A giant San Fernando Valley sweepstakes firm that
often took advantage of the elderly with misleading promotions has
agreed to pay $50 million in restitution and clean up its marketing
practices, Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge-based United States Sales Corp., which does business
as the United States Purchasing Exchange, agreed to the terms as
part of a global settlement reached between private parties,
California, 47 other states and the District of Columbia. Iowa and
Connecticut are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lockyer, USPE has agreed to pay California more
than $1.3 million for the cost of the investigation, and set aside
another $3.6 million for restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The restitution will go to consumers who spent at least $1,870
with the company in 1997, 1998 or 1999, Lockyer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers eligible for a refund will be notified by mail in the
early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, USPE sends out tens of millions of pieces of direct
mail nationwide that contain a sweepstakes entry form and sales
offers for household and personal products, Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, especially the elderly, have purchased products
believing their chances of winning the sweepstakes would be
enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement includes more than $30 million that will be
distributed to consumers by the states and the District of Columbia
and an additional $20 million to settle a class-action suit filed
in Illinois, said USPE spokesman Harvey Englander.
</P>
<P>
   ``These settlements allow USPE to continue to serve our
satisfied customers with our mailings offering a variety of
merchandise products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, USPE has agreed to include ``a clear and
conspicuous sweepstakes fact sheet in all of its future sweepstakes
mailings,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact sheet will include a statement that the consumer has
not yet won; that buying products will not help the consumer win
the sweepstakes; that the consumer doesn't have to buy anything to
enter; and the odds of winning a prize.
</P>
<P>
   The fact sheet also will contain the entry form which consumers
will have to use to enter the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through these disclosures, California consumers will not be
lured into buying goods with the mistaken belief they are improving
their chances of winning big prices,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly look to having other sweepstakes companies follow
the disclosure standard and protections for high-activity consumers
being set by USPE,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   USPE, which has been in business since 1967 and has undergone a
recent downsizing, admitted no wrongdoing under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement, USPE defended its business practices,
saying, ``Consistent with all sweepstakes programs, people do not
have to order items from USPE catalogs in order to enter the
sweepstakes, in fact, many of the entrants do not order
merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the first reached with the National Association
of Attorneys General since the multistate group held hearings into
sweepstakes activities in Indiana in February.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, USPE also has agreed to contact so-called
``high activity'' customers with a separate letter to let them know
that they can enter the company's sweepstakes as often as they like
and they don't have to purchase anything to win a prize.
</P>
<P>
   To stop unnecessary purchases by high activity customers, the
company will discontinue mailings to any person who makes 25
purchases or spends more than $935 in a 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will immediately stop mailing sweepstakes
opportunities to anyone who in the past 12 months has purchased
more than $2,500 worth of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers entering sweepstakes should understand they don't
have to buy anything for a chance to win and that buying will not
help their chances of becoming instant millionaires,'' Lockyer said
in a statement.

 PROFESSOR SUES OVER ONLINE PERSONAL ATTACKS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ College students have long dished dirt about
professors, warning their classmates about whom they should avoid.
While the practice may have ruffled a few academic feathers, it has
been seen mostly as an innocuous part of campus life.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Internet. Now that such student
critiques have gone online, the practice has started a controversy
over free speech and libel that could have effects far beyond the
ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   At the City College of San Francisco, an English professor who
was the object of some particularly vicious written attacks by
students has filed a lawsuit that challenges the entire notion of
the Internet as a forum for unfettered speech.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Curzon Brown, an openly gay author, has been called
``homomanic,'' ``racist'' and ``mentally ill'' on the
 &UR; teacherreview.com  &LR; Web site, which posts anonymous reviews of
teachers at the college. Other professors have been the subject of
sexually explicit stories.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, scheduled to go to trial in San Francisco Superior
Court on Wednesday, is an attempt to shut down the Web site. ``It
is wrong. It is evil. I don't see how anyone can justify it,''
Curzon Brown said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has attracted the attention of the American Civil
Liberties Union and Internet experts, who have lined up behind Ryan
Lathouwers, the 27-year-old former computer science student who
started the site in 1997 as a way for students to find classes best
suited for them.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU staff attorney Ann Brick said the future of the Internet as
a free and open means of exchanging views may hinge on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment means that sometimes feelings get hurt,''
Brick said. ``The value in preserving those freedoms far outweighs
the harm of hurt feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, she noted, is ``just full of'' bulletin boards and
chat rooms where opinions are exchanged. ``You are not going to
have those on the Internet if the creator of those forums are at
risk of being held liable for what is posted.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that the Internet is not subject to the rules
of libel and defamation that govern newspapers. In the 1996
Communications Decency Act, Congress gave Internet service
providers immunity from liability to encourage them to police their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to induce people to be willing to (remove
objectionable material), we need to offer them immunity,'' said
Pamela Samuelson, professor of information management at Boalt Hall
School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lathouwers should fall under the law because he is
essentially providing an Internet service. But how the court
interprets his role in this case could set the precedent for small
Web sites, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important for public discourse that little guys
who run sites are not chilled out of the picture,'' Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lathouwers, who is now working at an Internet startup in
Sausalito, defended his Web site. ``I'm just a conduit for student
opinion,'' he said. ``People have a right to express their
opinions. The opinions are not always positive.''
</P>
<P>
   City College was also named in the suit because the site can be
reached from its Web page. Chancellor Phillip R. Day Jr. said the
college would not close down the Web site, even though it has the
power to do so, because of First Amendment concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Day said, he is working with Lathouwers on a system
that will maintain anonymity while verifying that only students who
have studied with a professor are submitting the reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The college is also developing its own site, which would provide
detailed information about professors to help students choose
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the college's 1,750 professors refuse to get
involved, Curzon Brown has support among some colleagues, including
the head of the English department and a physics professor who was
deluged with poor reviews and saw enrollment in his courses drop
after he criticized the site.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has roiled City College, a community college with 10
campuses across San Francisco. Students bicker about the merits of
the postings, and meetings about how to deal with the site
degenerate into hostile debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jesykah Forkash, 20, a student in Curzon Brown's English class,
said she did not agree that it should be used for personal attacks
but said it is ``totally valuable'' and has been accurate about
every teacher from whom she has taken a class.

   But Justine Heinze Giardello, 18, whose father is a professor at
the University of San Francisco, said students do not understand
how hard professors work. Students should not be able to bash
teachers in a forum that is out there for the world to see, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is horrible,'' she said. ``How would we feel if
there was a student review judging us on a personal basis?''
</P>
<P>
   Cady Eearnest, 18, said she does not agree with the ugly reviews
of Curzon Brown, who has been attacked as egotistical and abrasive.
``We have very interesting discussions. The papers are good, and he
is a fair grader,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Curzon Brown said the battle has worn him down. It
has created an atmosphere, he said, in which professors are
hesitant to uphold standards for fear that students who receive
poor grades will vilify them on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm depressed and I'm afraid,'' said Curzon Brown, who has
taught at City College for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lathouwers should be held responsible for what is posted
on the site, just as a newspaper publisher would be held liable for
printing libelous statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change the idea that the Internet is holy and that
it does not have to abide by the normal laws of civilization,''
Curzon Brown said.

PALFFY MAKES PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VANCOUVER _ Bryan Smolinski is gone for the season with a knee
injury and it appears Nelson Emerson (broken finger) won't be back
until the second round of the playoffs if the Kings are around.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is getting healthy. Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy had his most rigorous workout since spraining his
right shoulder March 15 in Anaheim. He will undergo a strength test
today at the team training facility in El Segundo and probably
won't return until the playoffs start Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   `'We'll know more after the test,'' Kings coach Andy Murray
said. `'The question is whether it will do more good to hold him
out of those few days between the end of the regular season and the
first round ofthe playoffs. But he is making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake, sidelined the past two games with a bruised
knee, will skate today for the first time since getting injured
last Saturday against the Mighty Ducks. It is uncertain whether he
will be ready for Friday's game against the defending Stanley Cup
champion Dallas Stars at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, injured March 23 on a slash by Philadelphia's Daymond
Langkow, will remain in a cast for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Reinprecht debuts: Steven Reinprecht, signed last week as a
free agent from the University of Wisconsin, made his NHL debut
Wednesday. He played on the fourth line with Brad Chartrand and
Jason Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Reinprecht, 23, led the nation in scoring this season with 26
goals and 66 points and is a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as
the top player in college hockey. He was the Badgers captain the
past two years but went undrafted several years ago because of a
broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Because he signed after the trade deadline, Reinprecht is not
eligible for the playoffs. But coach Andy Murray wanted to get him
into a game before the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   `'I told him to call his parents and tell them to set the VCR,''
Murray said. `'We watched him in practice and he has more speed
then we thought. He looks like he could be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Kings allowed Blake to play in the season
finale after he was signed out of the University of North Dakota.
Like Reinprecht, Blake was a Hobey Baker finalist. Blake had a goal
in his NHL debut.
</P>
<P>
   Reinprecht was called for a hooking penalty early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: It probably wouldn't hurt to have back Len
Barrie, the Vancouver-area resident who was waived by the Kings
last month. Barrie, who scored a goal for the Kings in a 5-2
victory here on Feb. 25, has scored four goals in 12 games since
getting picked up by the Florida Panthers. Barrie had five goals in
46 games for the Kings.

INVENTOR IN HIS 80S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you're in your late 40s, firmly entrenched in
that 9-to-5 job and disappointed that you will never have the time
or money to put that great product, the one you've been designing
in your head for years, on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Koehler doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, an 80-year-old resident of Woodland Hills in L.A.,
teaches golf at L.A. Pierce College, shoots skeet and trap, fishes,
walks his dogs every morning and plays pool with his buddies every
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``spare time,'' he runs his own company and oversees the
distribution of the ``Reel-E-Good Winder,'' which recently
completed its fourth production run.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three years back, I was out looking for a winder, and
there just didn't seem to be anything worthwhile on the market,''
Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of them looked like clothes hangers, so I decided I
could make one that fishermen would like to have and I went ahead
and designed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler and friend David Hanggee incurred all of the start-up
costs _ ``We didn't want to take out loans and have somebody else
run our business'' _ and in less than a year, they had a product
ready for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for Koehler was to create a product that was portable,
versatile and relatively inexpensive, and he is pleased with the
outcome. The winder, which retails for $39.95, allows for better
line maintenance through several features.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's winder loads stock spinning line without the worry of
the line twisting. It can be used right-handed or left-handed,
hooked up to an electronic screwdriver for automatic loading and
used to load line on fly, saltwater or conventional bait casting
reels. This is important, Koehler said, because many spin/bait
fishermen eventually turn to fly fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The small size allows the winder to be brought along on trips
for respooling damaged or lost line. The base contains soft plastic
``feet'' so the winder can be used on the hood of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fishing since I was 5 years old,'' said Koehler, who
grew up in New Jersey but has lived in his Woodland Hills home for
43 years, ``so I've spent a lot of time on streams, and I tried to
come up with something that would help fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   The response has been steady, and Koehler expects the business
to break even by the end of the year. Since the Hanggee-Koehler
Corporation is a one-product business, there have been some
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies that have several products, they can just pull
their ad for one product and substitute,'' said Koehler, who said
he has shipped units all over the country and to Australia, France,
Japan and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more difficult, being a single manufacturing entity,
because we don't have income from other products to rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler said he has also faced some opposition from dealers, who
are reluctant to stock his item.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dealer can wind line himself and get $1,200 to $1,400, so
they are afraid that if they sell our product, the customer won't
come in,'' Koehler said. ``I think that's ridiculous because a
person who wants to wind line himself isn't going to go to a dealer
anyway. He doesn't care if he has to do it in the garage and have
line tangled all over the place, he's going to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from the dealers' perspective, they think it will hurt
them. In the old days, it would be like a laundry service selling
washing machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler has relied on his background in advertising to market
the product, and recently received a three-quarters page write-up
in Field and Stream magazine, which he said was worth $56,000 in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler plans to market other outdoors products in the future
and was disappointed to discover that one of his ideas had been
recently patented by another company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a push-button net drop and I had been thinking about it
for the past two years,'' Koehler said. ``I still want to buy it
and see if it's the same type of deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of fun and I've been fishing for so long that
I think I know what a fisherman needs.''

LAWYER SAYS ELIAN'S FATHER IS HEADED TO THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 9th and 10th grafs with reaction of Elian's Miami
relatives; subs 11th graf for rewriting)  By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The father of Elian Gonzalez will travel to the
United States from Cuba on Thursday morning to reclaim his son, a
lawyer for the boy's father announced Wednesday night after
returning from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sets the stage for a final legal showdown over
the boy, who has been in the custody of relatives in Miami since he
was rescued clinging to a rubber inner tube in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the Washington lawyer who represents Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, told reporters that he expected
Attorney General Janet Reno and the Doris Meissner, the
commissioner of immigration, ``to take immediate action aimed at
reuniting Elian with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who traveled to Havana Wednesday night to consult with
Gonzalez and Cuban government officials, said that the father, his
new wife and 6-month-old baby will arrive in Washington Thursday
morning. His comments suggest that he was able to persuade Cuban
authorities to allow the father to come to the United States even
though the State Department had not provided visas for all 27
people the Cuban government wanted to accompany Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel has now been separated from his 6-year-old son for
over four months,'' Craig said in a statement read to reporters in
front of his office building in downtown Washington Wednesday
night. ``This separation occurred through no fault of his own and
has continued against his wishes. It is time for the reunion to go
forward and he has come here and is prepared to stay here until he
has achieved that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, who have said they want to
reunite the boy with his father, have hoped for Gonzalez to come
here to help strengthen the case against the Miami relatives, who
have been taking care of Elian and insist the boy should remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many weeks, people have asked why the father has not come
to the United States to take custody of his son,'' Craig said.
``For just as many weeks, Juan Miguel has stated that he would
happily travel to the United States and was fully prepared to do so
if he could be assured that, when he came here, he would in fact be
given custody of his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that he and the father were now both satisfied that
the immigration service would immediately begin to transfer legal
custody of the boy from his great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who has
cared for him in the Little Havana section of Miami, to the father.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that the father was expected to arrive in the
United States, Elian's Miami relatives invited him and his family
to their house in Little Havana to try to ``work this out as a
family,'' said Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the relatives.
``He's welcome in this house,'' Gutierrez added.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the two sides should have a meal and work out
their differences without lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the reunion could take place as soon as
Thursday. A physical transfer of custody would occur soon after,
the officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has granted special visitors visas to
Gonzalez and five others. But the Cuban government has asked that
22 others be allowed to come, including Ricardo Alarcon, the
speaker of the national assembly and a robust critic of the United
States government.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday
that officials believed that ``the six visas we have provided are
sufficient to provide an environment appropriate for the child in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions between Justice Department officials and Elian's
relatives in Miami were expected to resume on Thursday morning at
the offices of the chief federal prosecutor in the Miami area.
Justice Department officials have insisted that the only issue open
for discussion is how the family will surrender Elian to the
father. The relatives are still arguing for ways to keep custody of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Cuban-Americans in the Miami area have
been conducting regular demonstrations outside the home where Elian
is staying, vowing they would not allow federal officials to take
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued in the Atlantic off Florida on Thanksgiving
Day. His mother was among 10 people who died after their boat sank
while crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great tragedy when a young child loses a parent as
Elian did during his trip to the United States,'' Craig said. ``But
it is an equal tragedy for any parent to face the loss of a young
child.'' (JT) &QR;

THROWN AWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Everything was nice and cushy for the Dodgers. They
pitched well and although they had made a few mistakes, it was
nothing Dave Hansen couldn't overcome with a pinch-hit homer in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Then . . . oops. The defense everyone questioned in spring
training turned downright ugly.
</P>
<P>
   With two gaffes already on their record this game, the defense
completely collapsed and allowed Montreal to score twice in the
ninth to win 6-5 Wednesday at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   First, with everyone expecting a bunt, Montreal's Peter Bergeron
dragged one between pitcher Jeff Shaw and first baseman Eric Karros
to put two runners on. Then, a perfect double-play grounder was
hitto Mark Grudzielanek at second, but he fumbled it trying to flip
it to shortstop Jose Vizcaino and everyone was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of two outs and one on, bases were loaded with none out.
Then, Rondell White singled to center to score two and give the
Dodgers their first loss in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses, I lost the game,'' said Grudzielanek, playing his
third career game at second. ``By not making the play, I lost the
game. My feet were in bad position on the play. I have to get a
little more comfortable. I was leaning the wrong way. I hate to do
that. It (stinks). I just need to make the play. I should have
taken my time and just got one out.''
</P>
<P>
   It put Shaw in the miserable position of having to face White
with hot-hitting Vladimir Guerrero on deck and looking for payback
after getting hit by a pitch, which drew the ire of Expos manager
Felipe Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was ahead in the count 1-2 to White but couldn't get the
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a (strike) out there and I wound up with a flat
slider,'' Shaw said. ``Once you get two strikes on Rondell, and you
know Guerrero's on deck, you have to go for the punchout.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-inning fielding blunders weren't the only woes the
Dodgers experienced in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Guerrero singled but twisted his ankle
rounding first. He was caught off the bag with Dodgers third
baseman Adrian Beltre in possession of the ball. However, Beltre,
worried about Jose Vidro at third, quickly threw to second hoping
to get Guerrero in a rundown and that allowed Guerrero time to
hobble safely to first.
</P>
<P>
   And the Expos were aided by more miscommunication on a Bergeron
bunt when they scored two runs in the fifth. The speedy leadoff
hitter placed the ball between pitcher Orel Hershiser and Karros to
put runners on first and second with none out.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens hit a two-run single to make it 4-1 and then went to
second when Vizcaino failed to look in that direction when the ball
was thrown in from left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baseball really didn't go our way and we didn't execute
perfectly and we end up losing,'' said Hershiser, who admitted to
being surprised by the bunt. ``If we execute at the level we could
have, then even the baseball breaks probably wouldn't have beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen momentarily rendered the mistakes inconsequential when he
hit a three-run homer off Montreal closer Ugueth Urbina in the
eighth to give the Dodgers a 5-4 lead, but neither Shaw nor the
defense could make it hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to watch it fall apart than actually getting the
hit,'' Hansen said. ``We still had six more outs to get (after the
homer). It obviously doesn't mean anything.''

DUCKS HAVE SINKING FEELING

<P>
   CHICAGO _ For the better part of seven seasons, Guy Hebert has
played well when the Mighty Ducks needed him. But on Wednesday
night, the Anaheim goalie was a no-show in the team's biggest game
of the year _ a 5-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks before 15,112 at
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert gave up three goals on shots of more than 40 feet and was
easily beaten by Bob Probert on a breakaway. Meanwhile, Chicago
goalie Jocelyn Thibault's 27 saves put the Ducks' Western
Conference playoff hopes on life support.
</P>
<P>
   With two games to play, Anaheim (33-35-12-2) needs help, and
lots of it, after it was unable to help itself against a Chicago
team it had beaten eight times in the previous 10 meetings (8-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goalie and the goal posts were the difference,'' said
Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, who watched as Paul Kariya hit the
post twice in a game that was up for grabs until the middle of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who was a threat each time he stepped on the ice, beat
Thibault with a backhander at 9:40 after taking a breakaway pass
from Teemu Selanne to tie the game 2-2. Suddenly it looked as if
there was a real chance the Ducks might pick up two points on
Edmonton, which had lost to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 38 seconds later, Jean-Yves Leroux wristed a 40 footer
from the top of the left circle that beat Hebert and give the
Blackhawks a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be our game, then boom, the next
shift it's 3-2,'' said Selanne, who assisted on both Anaheim goals.
``We had great scoring chances and they throw a puck at the net and
it goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroux's goal was the third of three 40-foot-plus shots that got
by Hebert, who continues to suffer through the most inconsistent
year of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sullivan beat him with a long one-timer at 14:47 of the
first period and Kevin Dean's harmless looking wrist shot slipped
past him at 5:32 of the second to give the Blackhawks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was some traffic in front of Hebert on two of the goals,
but Hartsburg was in no mood to defend his veteran goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't score from there at this time of year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, as they have in so many games the second half of the
season outchanced their opponent, but goals, not chances, go up on
the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because they are scoring on what aren't even
scoring chances,'' said Hartsburg, whose Ducks outshot the
Blackhawks 29-22. ``It's not like there are guys standing alone in
front of the net. We have to get a breakaway and make a great play
(to score) and they wrist one and it's in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Probert did break in all alone when Oleg Tverdovsky and Steve
Rucchin got tangled up at the Chicago blue line as the Ducks were
desperately pressing to score the tying goal. Hebert could have
kept the Ducks in the game with a big save, but instead Probert
made it look easy, beating him on the stick side at 16:37 of the
third period to give Chicago a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Amonte scored his 42nd goal of the year into a empty net at
18:54.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's goal was his 20th, but realistically the Ducks were
done in by two players scoring their third goals of the year (Dean
and Leroux) and one scoring his fourth (Probert).
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in the first period when Thibault stopped
Kariya in the first 30 seconds, made a fine stop on Antti Aalto and
an even better one on Selanne's one-timer from the left circle
while Anaheim was on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the first wave of attack the Blackhawks took a
1-0 lead when Sullivan beat Hebert cleanly from the top of the left
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya hit the first of his two post just over two minutes into
the second period and a Tverdovsky's bid was turned aside by
Thibault before Dean's floater from the blue line gave the
Blackhawks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The goal put the Ducks in a desperate situation and less than a
minute later a gamble by Ruslan Salei paid off. The Anaheim
defenseman jumped into the play deep in the Chicago zone and was in
position to pick up a deflected Selanne pass in the left circle and
beat Thibault on the glove side at 6:26.
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave the Ducks a ray of hope, but their playoff hopes
are fading fast.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ In the days preceding this season-opening series,
several Astros referred to the Pittsburgh Pirates as the scariest
team in the National League Central.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the first two days of the season are any indication, no one
has more reason to be afraid than Pirates manager Gene Lamont, who
has watched his team blow up twice.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Lamont's pitching staff went wild with its
generosity, walking seven batters in the Astros' 11-2 victory
Wednesday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont doesn't have a contract beyond this season, and his
pitchers haven't done anything to help his cause. The Pirates have
issued 13 free passes in two games, and nine have led directly to
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get us one or two times through the order,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``But eventually, we'll get you.
If you give us a chance with walks, we'll hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   With the count in their favor most of the night, Astros hitters
churned out 10 hits, four for extra bases. They turned the score
lopsided with a six-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, they kept the Pirates at a safe but
still-threatening distance behind Jose Lima, who overcame a shaky
start. The Pirates scored in the first inning as Lima was trying to
acclimate himself to the chilly conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any feeling in my hands in the first inning,''
he said. ``I'm not making any excuses; I just had to make some
adjustments. I'm from the Dominican; cold weather is not my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Tony Krizmanich, the official scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Lima made a bid to match his RBI production for the entire 1999
season in his first at-bat of 2000. But his smash to the right side
of the infield, which scored two runners as it glanced off the
glove of first baseman Kevin Young, was ruled an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed they didn't give me a base hit,'' said
Lima, a career .106 hitter. ``I guarantee you that if one of (the
Pirates' pitchers) had hit that ball, they would have called it a
hit. I'm not going to say anything else about it, but everyone who
was watching the game knows that was a base hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima's teammates no doubt appreciate his competitive juices
regarding the credibility of his offensive statistics; what they
welcome most is what he does on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's quick-working style is a thing of beauty to a fielder
when the temperature is in the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get my guys off the field as fast as I could,''
Lima said. ``They made some great plays behind me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Kris Benson hardly resembled the pitcher most
considered the top rookie in the NL in 1999. Although he was
responsible for only two walks, he struggled with his location from
the beginning, and the Astros made him pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Benson,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``But it was his first start of the season, and there was a little
more emotion involved. I would have to guess by watching his
control and by seeing him last year that he was probably a little
more up for this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't show his emotions outwardly the way Lima does, but
I'm sure he was probably feeling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima found himself in an early hole after he allowed the Pirates
to load the bases in the first. Two runs scored on Aramis Ramirez's
ground ball to the left of second base. Shortstop Bill Spiers got a
glove on the ball but couldn't make a play on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took the lead with three in the third, two of them on
the questionable error charged to Young.
</P>
<P>
   So potent is the Astros' lineup that Richard Hidalgo, who drove
in five runs Tuesday, was slotted seventh in the batting order
Wednesday. He was pushed down one spot by Daryle Ward, who was
2-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy outs in the lineup, and that's a good
feeling,'' Bagwell said. ``That gives your pitchers confidence and
makes them feel like all they have to do is keep you in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like 1998 when we didn't care if we were losing in
the fifth or sixth inning, because we always felt we could come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's two-out homer capped a two-run third inning for the
Astros. The offense then went silent until the eighth-inning
explosion, which was aided by three walks and highlighted by
Spiers' three-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   By winning Wednesday, the Astros already have won more games
(two) at Three Rivers Stadium than they did in six tries last
season.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PORTLAND, Ore. _ It says ``Rose Garden'' on the marquee outside the
Portland Trail Blazers' palace, but you'll have to excuse the
20,384 fans in attendance Wednesday night, and quite a few of the
Trail Blazers themselves, if they thought it was the ``Morose
Garden.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, in the wake of the Rockets' stunning 118-105 victory,
what else could be said?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets entered the game with a nine-game road losing
streak, and the Blazers, one of the Western Conference's top
contenders, came in with a three-game string of wins.
</P>
<P>
   But as has happened so many times for the Rockets in this
upside-down season, they tossed expectations out the window _ or,
more to the point, they flat-out ignored them _ and cruised to a
victory that could only be called unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest road win of the season for us,'' said
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``We hadn't beaten a contender,
even though we've been close. And we haven't had a road win in a
long, long time. This is a young, inexperienced team, and we let a
lot of games get away from us this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these guys have progressed, as you can tell by how we
played tonight. We made play after play, and that's how you win on
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps when Shandon Anderson simply decides that the Rockets
aren't going to lose, no matter who they are playing. Anderson
zipped through, around and over the Blazers for a game-high 30
points, making 10 of 12 shots along the way, and added 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even more delightful to Houston fans was the fact most of
Anderson's work came against Scottie Pippen, who had just 15 points
while shooting 5-of-14 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rotations were tremendous,'' Tomjanovich said. ``And
Shandon was tremendous. He did it in all areas _ from the outside,
inside, on the offensive boards, defense. He just gave us an
all-around game.''
</P>
<P>
   They all did, as evidenced by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one of the best defensive teams in the league, the
Rockets shot 62 percent from the floor _ 73.5 percent in the second
half, and a staggering 84.6 percent (11 of 13) in the fourth
quarter. And playing one of the biggest teams in the league, the
Rockets fielded a team that looked more like a 6-6 and under squad,
yet they still managed to hold their own on the boards, with
Portland finishing with a slim 35-34 edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was a very disappointing loss for us,'' said
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy. ``Their one-on-one players took over
the game in the second half. Houston just played a marvelous game.
It's a big win for them, but a lot of teams in their position can
come in here with nothing to lose, and we have to be ready for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how did the Rockets manage to pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   Well, one reason was the Rockets' game plan _ make the Portland
big guys play like little ones, and make Houston's relative runts
play like big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a great scheme the coaches came up with,'' said
Steve Francis, who added 18 points, seven assists and a pair of
steals. ``That was the best thing we could possibly do. We knew
that the only way they thought they could stop us was to
double-team our isos (isolation plays), trying to limit our
mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They double-teamed, but that took their guys away from the
bucket and we were able to get Shandon cutting to the bucket and
Cuttino (Mobley) out there hitting from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, in particular, took advantage of the open lanes to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rasheed Wallace leaves the basket, then there's nobody
you really look at and you're not afraid to go in there,'' said
Anderson, who scored 15 points in the third quarter. ``They have
some guys who can get off the floor, but when Rasheed leaves, their
biggest guys are Scottie and Detlef (Schrempf), and they're not
intimidators when you want to go to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 53-50 at the break, the Rockets opened the third
quarter with a 17-2 blitz, coming out with an aggressive,
to-the-basket attack that put the Portland defenders on their
heels. And when they got the Blazers to collapse around the basket,
the Rockets often found wide-open 3-point shooters, who were more
than happy to knock down the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson began his assault with 8:35 remaining in the quarter,
driving to the hoop to give the Rockets a 60-55 lead. The shot
sparked a brilliant run in which Anderson scored 15 of the Rockets'
20 points, allowing them to build an 80-67 lead with 2:48 to play
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Smith (24 points) went to work, scoring seven straight
points to quell the Rockets' run, and Portland crept within 85-80
at the close of the period on a hook shot from Wallace with 3.4
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fold, however, the Rockets took every punch the
Blazers dealt and came back with a counter.
</P>
<P>
   Portland managed to pull within 93-90 with 7:41 left in the game
on a pair of free throws from Smith, but again the Rockets
withstood the hit. They put together a 13-3 run to boost the lead
to 106-93 and cruised from there, laughing all the way to the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fun, fun team,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's a real
positive group of guys. This is just like planting seeds and
watching them grow. This is the closest team I've been around in a
long, long time. We have a good feeling about the future here.''

IT'S HOMECOURT ADVANTAGE FOR L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Another season-defining moment was on the agenda
Wednesday night, but as usual, the Lakers were in no rush to
embrace it. Heck, they weren't even in a rush to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers took their time putting away the Golden State
Warriors at the Arena in Oakland, their closest rivals, the
Portland Trail Blazers, were losing to the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blazers fell, the Lakers automatically clinched the
NBA's best record and homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, entirely unaware of what had happened in the
Pacific Northwest, were not celebrating the occasion, and the only
things chilling on ice in the fourth quarter were Robert Horry's
gimpy knees.
</P>
<P>
   When the fourth arrived, the dawdling Lakers did, too, and, with
a strong finish, defeated the Warriors 111-104 to make it all
official. At 64-12, with six games to play, no one can catch them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's been the case all season for the Lakers, who have won
11 straight and 30 of their last 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   It took a monstrous night from Shaquille O'Neal (49 points, 19-
of-27 shooting) and an eye-opening performance from rookie Devean
George (14 points) to realize the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant was shaky in his first night back from a one-game
suspension and finished with 16 points (on 5-of-14 shooting) and 11
assists in 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall led a spirited Warriors attack with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game was in doubt throughout a sloppy first half,
the outcome was fairly predictable. Whereas the Lakers now have
three double-digit winning streaks this season, the Warriors lost
their 10th in a row for their third double-digit losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the homecourt advantage guarantees nothing, as the
eighth-seeded New York Knicks proved last season by going to the
Finals without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win without it. A lot of teams have,'' Jackson said.
``But it's usually the first or second teams in the league in
records that come up with the wins at the end. What it does is it
gives you that confidence _ you spend more time on your homecourt,
in you're home bed and in front of your home crowd. Sometimes that
can work against you in the playoffs, especially if you have 50
relatives coming in for a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a cautionary thing, and sometimes the good teams end
up winning on the road, like the Chicago Bulls did during the
'90s,'' said Jackson. ``They won a lot of games on the road in the
playoffs, and that's important, too. You have to learn how to win
both places. But ultimately, when push comes to shove, you want
that homecourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Lakers dawdled for a while before deciding to
exert themselves. After briefly leading in the first quarter, they
trailed throughout the second and third quarters by as many as 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't take the lead again until Bryant hit a 3-pointer
with one-tenth of a second left in the third quarter, for a 77-75
lead to head into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw and George opened the final period with back-to-back
3-pointers, and after an O'Neal fast-break slam dunk, the Lakers
had opened a 10-point lead, 87-77. The Warriors mounted a late
charge that cut the deficit to 102-98 with less than three minutes
to play, but the Lakers held off the charge, with nine points from
Bryant and O'Neal down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Lakers have matter-of-factly rolled through the
season, they greeted their clinching moment with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're conscious of it,'' Jackson said before tipoff.
``I wasn't, until this morning when a journalist asked about it. I
wasn't conscious it was the game. In fact, last night we were
debating upon whether it was tonight or Saturday, as to the final
game. But here it is.''

KINGS HOLD ON TO TIE CANUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ The Kings are in the playoffs, but they also are
spoilers for those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Vancouver Canucks are on the outside looking in,
Wednesday night's 1-1 tie also was critical for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Although they would earn an easier playoff opponent by
droppingfrom fifth to sixth in the Western Conference, there is no
turning backnow.
</P>
<P>
   They've lost Ziggy Palffy, Nelson Emerson and now Bryan
Smolinski to injuries and can't stand to lose any momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sluggish loss Monday night in Phoenix, the patchwork
Kings held their ground.
</P>
<P>
   The tie enabled them to stay a point ahead of the Coyotes
(90-89), who defeated Nashville earlier Wednesday. Both teams have
two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings will remember how they might have gotten more
against the Canucks. They failed on a great chance late in the
second period when they had a five-on-three advanage for 1:15 after
Jozef Stumpel was pulled down on a breakaway by Mattias Ohlund.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison also was called for a double-minor penalty, but
the Kings couldn't take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not without a litle luck.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:55 remaining in regulation, Vancouver's Denis Pederson
hit the right post that would have given the Canucks the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had offset an early surge by the Canucks, who
alreadyknew the Mighty Ducks had lost in Chicago. Both teams have
80 points, three behind San Jose for the eighth and final playoff
spot with two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver also had the added emotional advantage of returning
strongman Donald Brashear, who made his first appearance since he
was struck down by Boston's Marty McSorley in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings withstood all that and the raucous sellout crowd. They
just had trouble scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Withouth Smolinski, who suffered a season-ending knee injury
Monday in Phoenix, the Kings went with a second line of enforcer
Ian Laperriere at center, Luc Robitaille at left wing and Glen
Murray at right wing. The unit produced just three shots in the
first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   If not for goaltender Stephane Fiset, who matched is spectacular
performance from Saturday's clincher against the Mighty Ducks,
there is no telling where this game would have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver outshot the Kings 34-18 in the first 40 minutes and
took a 1-0 lead a minute into the second period on a goal by Mark
Messier.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiset, who will be the Kings starting goaltender in the
upcoming playoffs, kept it close. He stopped many difficult shots,
including a point-blank blast by Peter Schaefer with nine minutes
remaining in the third period. With 7:25 remaining, he turned away
Todd Bertuzzi , whodouble clutched on an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray, who met individually with players
during Tuesday's offday, said there is great confidence in Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   `'Everybody was talking about the effort he has been giving
us,'' Murray said. `'This time of year you need a hot goaltender.
Fiset hasbeen great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset used to play for No. 3 Colorado and probably wouldn't mind
facing them in the first round. But that would mean dropping below
No.6 Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was strong enough to let the Kings find themselves after
the early flurry by the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes are Messier scored his 14th goal of the season,
Kings seldom-used defenseman Jaroslav Modry tied the game on the
power playwith a blast from the point.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shot usually reserved for captain Rob Blake. But Blake
is back in Los Angeles with a bruised knee and has missed two games
Blake will skate today for the first time in five days, but his
status for Friday's game against the defending Stanley Cup champion
Dallas Stars is uncertain.

HOT ERSTAD LEADS ONSLAUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ After being mesmerized by Orlando Hernandez one night
and stifled by Roger Clemens the next, the Angels hitters took out
their frustrations on David Cone and a slew of New York Yankees
relievers Wednesday night before 24,560 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels failed to score in only one of the first seven
innings and went to defeat the Yankees 12-6 for their first victory
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   No Angels hitter is off to a better start than Darin Erstad, who
went 4 for 5 Wednesday, including a home run, two doubles and a
career-high-tying five RBI. He had three hits in the season opener
Monday and two more Tuesday. Not a bad start, considering he had
been in a slump since being named to the All-Star team in the
summer of '98.
</P>
<P>
   But Erstad, despite his desire to bounce back, said there isn't
a need to put up big numbers early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about statistics,'' he said. ''As long as I'm
feeling good and hitting the ball hard, it doesn't matter if I'm
getting hits or making outs. I don't need to get off to a fast
start to give myself confidence. If I'm executing, that's all that
matters because hits come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   They're coming now.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games, all five of Erstad's hits were singles,
and all of them were hit to the opposite field or up the middle.
Wednesday, he got his first extra-base hit, leading off the game
with a home run to right-center field off Cone. It was the ninth
time in his career Erstad led off with a homer.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, he hit the ball into the right-center
field gap for a two-run double. In the third, he pulled the ball
down the right-field line for another two-run double. He got his
fourth hit of the night with a single up the middle in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta use the whole field to hit,'' Erstad said. ``You
take what they give you.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's success rubbed off on the rest of the team in the third
inning when they knocked Cone out of the game and scored six times.
Mo Vaughn began the inning with a single and eventually scored on a
single by Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio drove in the second run of the inning with a
sacrifice fly, and one out later Gary DiSarcina singled home
another to make it 6-1. That was it for Cone, but the Angels
weren't done yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Allen Watson entered the game and allowed Erstad's
two-run double. Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge) followed with
an RBI single but was caught rounding first too far and was thrown
out to end the inning, but not before the Angels had taken a 9-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiary of the offense was Angels starter Scott
Schoeneweis, who was making his first career major-league start. A
sinker-ball pitcher, he got ground-ball double plays in the first
two innings before Clay Bellinger's RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis took the 9-1 lead to the mound in the fourth and
gave up back-to-back homers by Shane Spencer and Tino Martinez, but
after pitching coach Bud Black paid a visit to the mound,
Schoeneweis escaped further damage.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn led off the bottom of the fourth and was hit on the right
elbow by a pitch from Watson. Two pitches later, despite a 9-3
lead, Vaughn took off for second and dived in head first for his
first stolen base since May 26, 1997. He did have two steals in
spring training this year.
</P>
<P>
   After going to third on a single by Tim Salmon, Vaughn scored on
a sacrifice fly by Anderson to give the Angels a 10-3 lead.

ONE-TIME CHILD DEFECTOR VISITS CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT HALLERAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ (Editor's note: Glendale, Calif., resident Scott
Holleran, a freelance writer and frequent contributor to the Los
Angeles Daily News, traveled to Miami over the weekend to cover a
meeting between Elian Gonzalez and Walter Polovchak, who 20 years
ago was a child refugee seeking political asylum in the United
States from communism in his Ukrainian homeland. Holleran was the
only journalist allowed inside the home of Elian's Miami
relatives.)
</P>
<P>
   The house where Elian Gonzalez lives might seem an unlikely
flashpoint for a philosophical conflict over a little Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   But, in many ways, Lazaro Gonzalez's small, two-bedroom house,
where he lives with his wife, Angela, his daughter, Marisleysis,
and his great-nephew, Elian, is a powerful reminder of the nature
of the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   It stands as a monument to the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sunday afternoon in Miami's Little Havana, where Elian
Gonzalez has become the personification of Cuban-Americans'
struggle against the communism of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa music blasts from a neighbor's home on the street where
Elian lives with his great-uncle, Lazaro.
</P>
<P>
   The block is full of tightly packed homes and late-model cars.
The modest Gonzalez home sits in the middle of the narrow street
behind a fence on a small lot with a back yard the size of a small
truck.
</P>
<P>
   An army of TV broadcasting trucks lines adjacent streets,
leading to a police car and a barrier. At the street's entrance, a
tented media camp stands to the left and Elian's quiet, gated home
is on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Dead ahead is another barricade - where hundreds of
demonstrators stand vigil over the small slice of Miami that has
become Elian's corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is inside taking a shower after a day at the fair. He is
tired but also curious to meet a special visitor who has come to
proclaim support for Elian's freedom. As Elian prepares, with help
from Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who has become
his surrogate mother, Lazaro Gonzalez entertains family and a few
guests on the patio, extinguishes his cigarette and greets a man
named Walter Polovchak.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak was once the world's most famous young defector. He
ran away from his Ukrainian parents at age 12 and refused to return
to the Soviet Union. He fought his parents in court - opposed by
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Soviet Union - and lived
with the constant threat of KGB kidnappers while he was moved among
numerous foster homes. The boy's defiant declaration of
independence became famous across the globe:
</P>
<P>
   ``Never I go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 32 and the father of a boy Elian's age, he decided to travel
from his home outside Chicago, where he is an office manager, once
it became clear the government intended to return Elian to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this boy - it
is more important than a family. If his family really loves him,
they will understand,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting on the patio to meet the 6-year-old boy whose
mother drowned trying to flee to America with her son, Polovchak is
flooded with the memories of his own struggle.
</P>
<P>
   He is wearing a short-sleeve shirt with an emblem of the
American flag and sipping a Cuban coffee. Seeing that Lazaro lights
a cigarette, Polovchak lights up, too, and the men discuss their
common bond through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Elian bursts from the house with the boundless energy of a child
unleashed on a playground. Followed by Marisleysis, Elian runs
about the yard, eventually obeying his cousin's requests that he
come meet the man whose story is not unlike his own.
</P>
<P>
   When Polovchak meets Elian, who moves close to Marisleysis at
the prospect of meeting the pale-skinned outsider, Polovchak tells
the child that his son, Alec, is the same age and wants to say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   Elian runs from the patio to ride in his motorized race car
without so much as an acknowledgment of Polovchak's greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very shy in the beginning because he didn't know if I
was coming to help him or take him away,'' Polovchak said later,
after they met privately. ``But he warmed up to me and allowed me
to play with him and throw him up in the air. Marisleysis explained
my story to him in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   As Elian leaps, tumbles and runs in the back yard, Polovchak
watches him carefully and talks with Marisleysis. The boisterous
boy who played with his puppy, Dolphin, who Elian named after the
dolphins that he said surrounded him and protected him from sharks
at sea, is genuinely spontaneous out of the camera's range.
</P>
<P>
   A guest is taking pictures of Elian - whose behavior ranges from
a chronic refusal to wear his shoes to a carefully executed effort
to reach the box of chocolate that sits in the kitchen cupboard
above his reach - and he suddenly runs over, snatches the camera
and, aware that everyone is watching him, takes a picture - of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the boy who is perhaps the most photographed child since
Shirley Temple, it is either the mischievous act of a young boy or
a bold demonstration that, despite the hordes of cameras that
transmit his every move outside these boundaries, he is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the depth of his understanding of the past four months'
dramatic events, he is off and running and trying to run over the
guests in his race car.
</P>
<P>
   Before Polovchak boards the plane back to Chicago, he walks over
to the demonstrators, tells them about his own fight against
communism and rallies them with the cry: ``Long live freedom!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheers wildly at Polovchak's words - some have offered
him Cuban sandwiches and water and others tell him to continue the
fight for Elian's freedom - and shows him their rosaries, Virgin
Mary icons, posters and placards.
</P>
<P>
   A weary-looking Cuban exile holds the handwritten sign:
``Elian's Right 2 the Persuit (sic) of Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the house, Polovchak says goodbye to Elian. After
hearing Polovchak's story, the Cuban boy, who has settled down and
returned to the patio to bid his visitor farewell, quietly asks
Marisleysis whether the visitor's story means that he, too, can
stay in America.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak, who knows that public opinion, many newspaper
editorials and the U.S. government think he should be returned to
his father, seeks to reassure the boy that the world is a wonderful
place and that Elian belongs in it.
</P>
<P>
   As Polovchak crouches before Elian and looks him in the eye, a
hush falls over the guests and family and all eyes are on the man
once known as the ``littlest defector'' and the child who is heir
to his legacy. Elian, still and serious, listens to the stranger.
</P>
<P>
   In a solid Chicago accent that bears no trace of the Ukrainian
language of his youth, Polovchak tells Elian: ``Hang in there, stay
strong and this will end soon. One day, you can come up to Chicago,
visit me and my son and play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian says he would like that and, remembering their
introduction, asks Polovchak to say hello to his son for him.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak promises that he will. The little boy walks Polovchak
through the front yard to the padlocked fence that could become the
point of entry for those who would return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian waves good-bye to his new friend.

   AFRICA-DIAMONDS (Undated) _ The value of diamonds, coupled with
the anonymity and portability of the stones _ millions of dollars
worth can be smuggled in a sock without triggering a metal detector
_ have made diamonds one of the most potent, and dangerous,
currencies of modern Africa. This article was reported by Alan
Cowell in Zambia and Belgium, Ian Fisher in Congo, Blaine Harden in

   NY-LAPD-RECRUIT (New York) _ Faced with calls to increase the
diversity of its force and an expected exodus of officers, the New
York City Police Department embarked on an ambitious recruiting
drive over the past several years. But the department has learned
that the drive produced only 5,500 people interested in taking the
qualifying test this year, a 50 percent drop from the year before.
As New York struggles to lure its residents to its own department,

   SCI-DRUG-ACCESS (Undated) _ Cancer patients and others with
severe pain who live in nonwhite neighborhoods may have trouble
getting treatment for their pain, because local pharmacies often
refuse to stock morphine and related drugs, doctors are reporting.
A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City found that in nonwhite
neighborhoods, only 25 percent of pharmacies had enough
morphine-like drugs, known as opioids, to treat severe pain. But in
white neighborhoods, 72 percent of the stores had adequate
supplies. Doctors say that the problem, which they say is not
limited to New York, fits into a disturbing nationwide pattern,
revealed by recent studies showing that blacks are less likely than
whites to be referred for kidney transplants or surgery for
early-stage cancers, or to be given painkillers for broken bones or
pain follwing surgery. By Denise Grady.

   SCI-HORMONE-REACT (Undated) _ Doctors officers were beseiged
with calls Wednesday from women and their husbands, wondering if
they should stop taking estrogen, following latest news that shows
it might slightly increase heart attack risk, rather than lower it.
But while many doctors pushed the concept, there has never been any
real evidence that estrogen was good for the heart. Still, the

Gorton of Washington, a mainstream Republican senator, is
complaining about the disparity between prescription drugs in
Canada and the United States. Although Democrats have been making
this point for months, the drug lobby is in a panic now that
Republicans are adding a voice to the criticism. And in the Senate,
Democrats have forced a symbolic vote on the issue as an amendment
to a budget resolution. By Robert Pear.

   GENERAL-SEX-CHARGE _ The general accused of sexual harassment in

sexual misconduct, Pentagon officials said Wednesday. The movement
of the officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, into that job has been

   MARKET-TRADERS (New York) _ At high noon Tuesday, after a rocky
morning of trading, U.S. stocks pitched into a 90-minute freefall.
By the time the dive ended, shares in some of the market's biggest
and most important companies, from technology leaders like Yahoo to
corporate titans like General Electric, had fallen 5, 10 or even 15
percent. There was no news bulletin to explain the decline, no mad
rumor of presidential ill health war in Asia, only a tidal wave of
selling. Then, just as quickly, the market turned, and many stocks
finished the day close to where they began or even up slightly. So

LITTLE E SURVIVES A SCARY CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the euphoric rush surrounding his first NASCAR Winston Cup
victory Sunday, Dale Earnhardt Jr. disarmed himself long enough to
give us a glimpse of what it's really like to be Little E.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's more than a little scary.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Earnhardt Jr.'s life wasn't going to be worth a flip
until he won that first Winston Cup race somewhere. And after 11
non-winning Cup starts heading into Sunday's DirecTV 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway, Earnhardt Jr. had begun hinting that his
25-year-old life had become borderline miserable.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 29th-place finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where a
broken part had hurled Earnhardt Jr. into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   A week later in the garage area at Darlington Raceway, Earnhardt
Jr. _ without naming names _ criticized crew chief and ``second
father'' Tony Eury Sr. for keeping him on the track in a car so
loose he eventually lost it and crashed-out en route to a
40th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Racing at Bristol Motor Speedway the following Sunday, Earnhardt
Jr. joined his famous father, seven-time Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt, as one of six cars involved in a crash on Lap 2 of the
scheduled 500. His red-and-black hot rod and psyche damaged,
Earnhardt Jr. rolled home 38th, a mere 99 laps behind winner Rusty
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   That was the most visible baggage Earnhardt Jr., a
third-generation driver, carried into Fort Worth last week.
Mercifully, most early media attention at the racetrack here
focused on the Cup debut of Adam Petty, NASCAR's first
fourth-generation driver, and a member of perhaps the only family
that could relegate the Earnhardts to sidebar status.
</P>
<P>
   That's because during the past two years, of course, Little E
has grown accustomed to making headline news. He won a combined 13
races on the way to NASCAR Busch Grand National Series
championships in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The victory-starved executives at Anheuser-Busch were so
enamored that they signed Earnhardt Jr. to a reported $10 million
sponsorship deal to get Budweiser baseball caps back into Victory
Lane for the first time since September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His Cup debut at Lowe's Motor Speedway last May was preceded by
a mass-marketing blitz, posing a distraction that might have cost a
lesser young man and his team that second BGN championship.
</P>
<P>
   Little E's fans, including crossovers from his daddy's camp and
those merely looking for someone to swift-kick Jeff Gordon while
he's down, were multiplying exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Earnhardt Jr. began beating up on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' Earnhardt Jr. said on Sunday
evening, after he had bellowed an obligatory ``Wassssuuuupppp'' _
his sponsor's chic slogan _ into the TV cameras. ``You put yourself
in position to win. You put yourself in position to lose. You put
yourself in position to wreck. I felt like I still had control and
could have made a difference the past three weeks. But you can beat
yourself up only so much before you take a lot of confidence away
from yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   His famous father/car-owner apparently up to his elbows in
``Fortune 500''-related business, Earnhardt Jr. first sought out
buddy and BGN regular Hank Parker Jr. for counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank has been through some stuff is his racing career, like
me,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``Talking to him ... makes you chill out
and get ready to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Earnhardt Jr. sat down and spoke with Gary Nelson,
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Director. Nelson's job puts him into
close proximity with every template in the garage area. But
Nelson's status as a former trend-setting crew chief has allowed
him to deal with every type of driver's temperament, every type of
troubled driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though a lot of good things have happened to me in my
career,'' Earnhardt Jr. said, ``I sometimes need to be told that
I'm a good race car driver. When we crash out of a race or
something, I go to the house and the phone don't ring. You sit
there and wonder if anybody gives a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson told Earnhardt Jr. to forget about that, that he knew he
was going to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard that from anybody else,'' Earnhardt Jr. said.
``To hear it from somebody like Gary Nelson, who can't play
favorites and who has nothing to gain by telling me that I'm going
to make it, that sounds pretty good to me.''
SPOTLIGHT ON Wood Brothers working to ease Sadler's pain Seven
races into their 50th anniversary season, the Wood Brothers had
assumed they had witnessed every act of weirdness possible in
NASCAR Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   And then the left rear tire on Elliott Sadler's car shredded and
began attacking the second-year driver during the DirecTV 500 at
Texas Motor Speedway last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's car was hit by Sterling Marlin's on a restart on Lap
120. The impact flattened Sadler's left rear Goodyear Eagle radial,
with the damaged bodywork on the No. 21 Citgo Ford Taurus acting
like a knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept on cutting it \Rthe tire\S and cutting it, and just
made it like a whip,'' Sadler said. ``I could feel it barely
hitting me and then it really came apart all at once and hit me
four or five times on top of the shoulder before I could get the
car stopped. It was hitting me every time the tire rotated.''

   Sadler said the shredded rubber slapped its way through two
layers of metal before reaching him inside the protective roll
cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a sledgehammer hitting me on top of the
shoulder,'' Sadler said. ``It was so powerful that it ripped the
roof off the car _ and that's the first time I've ever seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said he suffered ``a mild separation'' of his left
shoulder, as well as lacerations and bruises. The affected area
measures approximately three inches wide and eight or nine inches
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts on the top of my shoulder and goes all the way to
about the middle of my back,'' said Sadler, who has been treated by
his doctor since Sunday night. Undaunted, Sadler plans to drive in
the appropriately named Goody's Body Pain 500 at Martinsville (Va.)
Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said he and crew chief Mike Beam have been looking at
ways to prevent a repeat of such a freak occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run a safety net on the left side, but it's real
straight,'' said Sadler, a native of Emporia, Va., who is adamant
about driving at his home track. ``We're thinking about curving it
behind the seat to form like a wall, or put up some more aluminum
or another roll bar or something right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Car co-owner Eddie Wood said his crew hopes to fabricate a
protective ``steel net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like mesh, an eighth-of-an-inch thick,'' Wood said.
``Welding it from the roll bar all the way back across behind the
seat would keep anything from coming up in there. Fortunately, he
wasn't hurt any worse than he was and now maybe it should be made
mandatory to make some kind of thing around the driver right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, 24, said he won't need a second opinion on that
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit the wall many a time in racing, and I've had
surgeries and everything else,'' Sadler said. ``But I've never had
anything that painful. I don't wish that on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Force backs off Bowing to pressure from his peers and fans,
nine-time and reigning NHRA Funny Car champion John Force has
canceled plans to field a third car this season.
</P>
<P>
   Force said his impetus behind a third car, with Tommy Johnson
Jr. the most likely driving candidate, was to provide aspiring
drivers and crewmen a chance to learn professional drag racing.
Force, driver of the Castrol GTX Ford Mustang, said the perception
was that he and teammate Tony Pedregon were trying to kill off the
competition, round-by-round, by adding another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the competition doesn't get us and we're lucky enough to
win a 10th championship, I don't want to hear that it was because
of a third car,'' Force told ``National Dragster.'' ``It's about
what I feel in my heart is right. We're trying really hard to grow
this sport, and I don't want to be one of the guys who muddies the
water.'' Papis pumped for Naz Buoyed by his first CART FedEx
Championship Series victory, Team Rahal's Max Papis figures to be
flying during the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Given the confines of the cramped 0.946-mile Nazareth (Pa.)
Speedway, that's mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Papis, winner of the season-opener at Homestead, Fla., will take
a 20-16 points lead over Roberto Moreno of Patrick Racing into
Round 2 of the 20-race schedule. Papis has finished fourth or
better in his past five Championship Auto Racing Teams starts
dating to last year at Laguna Seca, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Team Rahal \Rin 1999\S we were happy to
finish in the top 10, and we hoped to finish higher,'' said Papis,
driver of the No. 7 Miller Lite Ford/Reynard. ``Now we expect to
run in the top-five, and have raised our expectations to the
podium.'' Valvoline tops air-time Mark Martin won only two NASCAR
Winston Cup races and finished third in the points championship in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin and the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus emerged as the
undisputed champions in network TV exposure for the seventh
consecutive year, accumulating nearly $49 million in value.
</P>
<P>
   That figure was compiled from research provided by ``The
Sponsors Report'', which documents advertising exposure on national
sports telecasts. Total value for all Winston Cup sponsors topped
$1.4 billion last year, up from $1.2 billion in 1998. Martinsville
digs in Martinsville (Va.) Speedway often is mentioned as a likely
candidate to lose one of its two NASCAR Winston Cup dates to newer
and bigger facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Campbell, president and general manager of NASCAR's
oldest-sanctioned racetrack, begs to differ. Management of the
0.526-mile, paper clip-shaped oval have no intention of giving
NASCAR an easy-out.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sheppard, Martinsville's director of corporate
communications, said 5,000 seats have been added for this weekend's
Goody's Body Pain 500. In addition, eight suites, a new press box,
new concessions stands and restrooms have been constructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay builds from 2,000 to 7,000 seats a year, depending on
demand,'' Sheppard said. ``We try not to overbuild. We already have
plans for more seats between Turns 1 and 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard said that negotiations are under way to move the
railroad tracks that run past the backstretch grandstands, and have
prevented expansion in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you moved the railroad tracks, you could put another 40,000
seats back there,'' Sheppard said, ``as much as the frontstretch.''
Last words ``I was talking to \Rcar owner\S Roger Penske and he
said that statistics are all nice, but you've got to remember that
the most important thing is the very next race.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Until recently, trying to predict the winner of any
golf tournament was foolish exercise. We writers, presumed experts
that we are, would take our stabs because people expected us to,
but the exercise has always been pure guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   In a game between two teams, you have a 50 percent chance of
being right. Here at the Masters, in contrast, maybe 20 guys would
tee off Thursday with a realistic shot at visiting Butler Cabin in
Sunday's twilight. Hence, the odds of a prognosticator being right
dropped to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, in Jack Nicklaus' prime years, and there were about
two decades' worth of them, he won four green jackets (his other
two were claimed as long shots). Yet he probably went out as the
consensus Masters betting favorite at least 15 times. So the
prevalent notion that Tiger Woods is a slam-dunk, lead-pipe cinch
of a lock to finish first this year ranks somewhere between
ludicrous and preposterous, right?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely. Nonetheless, he's my pick in a nanosecond. Woods
will live up to the overwhelming burden of expectations with which
he has been saddled. He will win the 2000 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Not easily, perhaps. He'll blow a putt or two on the glassy
greens. He'll get himself in trouble on one of the six holes with
the skinnier fairways and the more intrusive rough. Somebody
somewhere in the field will make Tiger sweat, although he probably
won't let us see the perspiration. But in the end, nobody will
possess either the shots or the guts to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's that good right now. And accordingly, that confident.
You would be, too, if you were 77 shots under par barely three
months into the new PGA Tour season and had placed worse than
second once in seven events.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nobody else is either that good or that confident.
</P>
<P>
   While Hal Sutton tried to rally the PGA's also-rans a couple of
weeks ago at The Players Championship, exhorting his peers to stop
deifying Woods, then actually beating him in a head-to-head
showdown, all that really accomplished was to harden Woods'
resolve. He wants this Masters in the worst way, and we saw three
years ago what can happen at Augusta National when Tiger shows up
with the eye of same.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's not a fellow former champion in the field
who can touch him. Most of that group, in fact, wouldn't be allowed
anywhere near Magnolia Lane if not for the Masters' quirky
qualifying rules. Last year's winner, Jose Maria Olazabal, is all
over the place with his driver, and he can't buy a putt once he
does finally locate the green. Still, the Spaniard looms as the
only one of the 22 besides Woods with a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wannabes
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson comes in hot, arguably slightly hotter than
Woods, and he draws mention for being the best player never to have
won a major. But there's a reason why he hasn't, and it will bite
him again this week. Also, being that he's a lefty, history isn't
his friend here. None has won the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval contends that being a semi-forgotten figure, with a
trimmer figure to boot, helps his cause. Of course, the reason he's
no longer touted as a would-be peer of Woods is because he isn't in
the ballpark. Duval hasn't won a tournament since last April, 10
fewer than Tiger over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia appeared to be Woods' worthiest new foil when he
made his swashbuckling charge at the PGA last summer, but he, too,
has faded. The charming Spanish Wunderkind we recall
scissor-kicking across the Medinah fairway has turned sullen,
frustrated by a faulty swing and overburdened by his own heavy
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie, in turn, is due, given that he has never won
on this side of the pond, and he did place third at The Players
Championship. Previously, however, his play had been middling to
mediocre, and he has heretofore failed to crack the top 10 at the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on, but why?
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's the man. That's just how it is. His game is made for the
Masters _ with the changes to the course, hitting the ball long and
high has never been more requisite _ and his game is now the likes
of which we have rarely, if ever, seen. Nicklaus never mounted a
run on par with the one Woods brings to Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been targeting this,'' Tiger said, a statement that could
traumatize the rest of the pack. ``I'm excited to be here. I've
been getting better week by week. It's nice to see the fruits of
good, hard labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice for him, maybe. Bad for anyone who thinks a golf tournament
should be a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's going to win,'' Garcia argued, revealing
his youthful naivete. ``Nobody knows that. Some guys have beaten
him. We realize that he is beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, in Augusta, he isn't.

ANGELS BEAT YANKEES, 12-6 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A dejected David Cone surrendered the baseball
to his manager on Wednesday night, arm extended, like a defeated
general handing over his sword. Many times in his career Cone has
argued to stay in the game, but there was no reason to debate Joe
Torre over this decision. Cone was terrible in his first outing of
the season, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   He jogged off the field and into the New York Yankees' dugout,
where the coach Don Zimmer rose off the bench and onto his
surgically replaced knee to greet Cone. Zimmer patted Cone on the
back and offered an encouraging word as he passed, and then sat in
the far corner of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cone was charged with eight runs in two and
two-thirds innings as the Yankees lost, 12-6. The Angels' Darin
Erstad had five runs batted in and the lumbering Mo Vaughn stole
his first base since May 26, 1997, in the midst of the onslaught,
more than offsetting Jorge Posada's four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Having won two games in this three-game series, the Yankees will
take a day off Thursday before starting a three-game series at
Seattle on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had looked ahead to this start with enthusiasm, mentioning
Tuesday how he and Roger Clemens had talked about how modern
hitters dive over the plate so much and make themselves vulnerable
to breaking balls on the inside corner. A key to his pitching, Cone
said, was in varying the velocity of his pitches _ his fastball
might travel 90 miles an hour and his slow curveball goes 70
m.p.h., and the change of speed can deceive hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's radar gun readings were fine tonight, his fastball
reaching 90-91 mph consistently, and his slow curve checked in, as
he said, about 70 mph But Cone's command _ particularly his control
of his fastball _ was awful, and he never developed a suitable
secondary pitch, like a consistent slider or split-fingered
fastball, to compensate. He had no weapons and he was pounded, from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the first inning for Anaheim and with the count 2
balls and 2 strikes, Cone tried to sneak a slider over the outside
corner. Catcher Jorge Posada set his target on the edge, Cone threw
and the ball drifted over the middle of the plate, Erstad blasted
it deep into the right-center-field stands. One batter in the new
millennium, one home run.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out the next batter, Adam Kennedy, but struggled to
do so, Kennedy fouling off five pitches during the at-bat _ the
first of 16 fouls hit against Cone, most of them rapped sharply,
the Anaheim swings aggressive and sure. The inning ended when
Garret Anderson blistered a line drive to first baseman Tino
Martinez, and Cone's shoulders sagged before he returned to the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Troy Glaus and Gary DiSarcina, the No. 9 hitter, in
the second; Cone snapped at the return throw from Posada after the
second walk, frustrated. Erstad was next and with the count at 2-1,
Cone threw a benign splitter and Erstad ripped a double into
right-center, two more runs scoring.
</P>
<P>
   American League hitters gripe privately that Cone receives an
additional fraction of space on the edges of the strike zone and
uses it to his advantage, spinning sliders over the expanded
corners.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone certainly did not receive any help on the fringe on
Wednesday night. Paul Schrieber, an umpire affiliated with the
National League, called a strike zone from the textbook, without
fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Having worked in the other league, Schrieber does not know Cone
and Cone does not know him, and there were crucial moments when the
Yankees' right-hander would fire a ball just off the edge and hold
his pose for just a moment, emphasizing his desire to have that
pitched call a strike. He got nothing. It is one byproduct of the
new system of umpire rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's night of work concluded before the end of the third
inning. Vaughn dropped a single in front of right fielder Paul
O'Neill, Tim Salmon walked for the second time _ Cone pausing to
glare at Schrieber briefly after an unfavorable ball-strike call _
and Anderson singled, scoring another run. Glaus walked, and Allen
Watson started warming up in the bullpen. After Scott Spiezio flied
out and there was a fielder's choice, DiSarcina hit a single and
Torre was coming out to get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As Cone watched silently from the corner of the dugout, seeing
the two runners on base come around to score after Erstad smacked
Watson's first pitch for a two-run double, he might already have
been thinking about his next start. Cone is coming to grips with
the reality that every time he pitches poorly, speculation mounts
about how much longer his career will last. He might pitch a
perfect game, finish second in the league in earned run average,
but the questions will persist because he is 37.
</P>
<P>
   He uses this to motivate himself. The inspiration will come in
handy before he pitches in the Yankees' home opener on Tuesday. &QL;

TVERDOSVKY RIPS LACK OF FOCUS

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Ducks might have outshot and outchanced the
Blackhawks on Wednesday, but several players weren't thrilled with
the way Anaheim played in such a crucial game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played only one period, they played better than us, it's as
simple as that,'' said Oleg Tverdosvky, who felt the Ducks weren't
as prepared to play as they should have been. ``We were losing all
the battles. We have to play all 60 minutes; you don't beat people
by playing 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya didn't think the Ducks played poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't awful,'' he said. ``We had good intensity but not
the kind of intensity you need to win must-win games. We didn't
really let it all out until the third period and then the third
goal really took the wind out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not converting: The Ducks have outshot their last four
opponents (Phoenix, the Kings, Nashville and Chicago) 130-81, but
they have been outscored 11-10 and are 2-2 in the four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were unable to take advantage of three power plays in
the game, but it wasn't because they didn't have any chances.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne appeared to have a wide-open shot on Anaheim's
first opportunity 3 minutes into the game, but Jocelyn Thibault
made a sliding two-pad save on the winger's one-timer from the left
circle.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:11 of the second period, Kariya ripped a one-timer from the
slot off the right post. Kariya, who also hit the right post in the
third period, thought it went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's possible for it to hit the post like that
and not go in,'' said Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Wednesday, the Ducks' power play had converted 25
percent, scoring goals in 21 of 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back on the ice: Fredrik Olausson returned to the lineup
Wednesday after missing Monday night's game with the flu, but it
wasn't a night to remember for the veteran defenseman _ Olausson
was on the ice for four of Chicago's five goals.

<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ In his three years behind the Bruins' bench,
coach Pat Burns has gotten mad before, plenty of times.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, after the Bruins' 6-3 loss to the Florida
Panthers, Burns's upset was different. During the second
intermission, after his club had surrendered six goals to set a
Panthers record, Burns yelled at his players. It was short, it was
intense, and it was different in a very anguished way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and addressed the embarrassment, that we completely
let it go,'' said goalie Rob Tallas, who came on in relief of John
Grahame when it was 5-1. ``He showed a lot of frustration and I
don't blame him. We give him three periods a game to do that
sometimes. He's held his cool and he's been cool about everything.
It was a tough night for him. He's a proud coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes pride in the jersey he coaches behind the bench of
and it's just as frustrating for him as it was for us. He was mad.
I've seen him a lot madder, but I know he's a proud coach and it
was an exhale, I think. A huge exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was so distraught after the game that he declined to meet
the media for the first time in his tenure in Boston. Tallas said
he didn't blame him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose games like this, for a while there it was
embarrassing,'' Tallas said. ``It could've been a scary game. That
team can be a selfish team over there. They love to score goals and
they weren't going to quit. I thought we did a good job of keeping
our composure in the third period and not giving them too much, but
we're going into a bigger building (in Philadelphia Saturday), a
bigger team that needs a lot of confidence going into the playoffs,
and then Pittsburgh, who's in a playoff fight. This is not how I
want to go out on the season. It's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were vastly undermanned, with more AHL players on the
roster than NHLers. But they actually took a 1-0 lead on Cameron
Mann's goal at 16:39 of the first. However, that was followed by
six Panther goals: two by Ray Whitney, two by Ray Sheppard, one by
Mark Parrish, and one by Scott Mellanby. The first three came in a
span of 2 minutes 50 seconds. It was the first time the Bruins gave
up six goals in a period since Feb. 23, 1991, when they were blown
out in St. Louis, 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster right now,'' said Tallas. ``It's hard to
imagine that we're ending the season on this kind of note. (Burns)
showed a little frustration tonight for the first time in a long
time and I don't blame him. He's struggling just as much as all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said part of what has made it so hard to bear is that the
roster is full of inexperienced players who should be having the
time of their lives playing in the NHL. But, by the same token, the
players who have been in Boston all season are in agony over the
losing and are walking around like zombies while trying to stay
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see guys who have been here like Stevie Heinze
and Donnie Sweeney, the look in their eyes,'' said Tallas. ``We're
all lost souls. It's so frustrating, you can see that in each
other. Those guys who have been here for a long time have a lot of
pride in that jersey. To end like this, it's so frustrating . . .
It's embarrassing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 6-1, the Bruins played better in the third period, but
the Panthers relaxed a bit. (And who could blame them?) Antti
Laaksonen and Eric Nickulas (power play) potted goals for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some brutal mistakes,'' said Tallas of that fateful
second period. ``Their speed kind of caught up to us and caught us
by surprise a little bit. It was disastrous. This is just not the
way to end the season. I know it's been a disastrous season, but
you don't end it anything like this.''

<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The Celtics' much-heralded and, lest we
forget, guaranteed playoff berth became officially lost Wednesday
night. Picking up where the Bradley campaign left off, Rick Pitino
&AMP; Co. dropped their ninth straight game to officially drop out of
the postseason picture.
</P>
<P>
   The score, opponent, and site were, of course, incidental, for
this one was predetermined at least 10 days ago. It was the Pistons
and Grant Hill who got to preside over the mercy killing in a
half-filled arena, with Hill scoring 27 points in a 111-106 Detroit
victory. Pitino can now save owner Paul Gaston some money by going
for the nonrefundable fare to Secaucus, N.J., next month for the
draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   This one looked a lot like many of the previous eight defeats.
Boston stayed close, led in the second half, but eventually
succumbed. Wednesday night, the villains were Hill and free throws.
The Pistons, as the Hornets did the night before, feasted at the
free throw line, attempting 56 freebies to the Celtics' 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough mountain to climb and get over,'' said Pitino,
whose team had seven more field goals and four more treys but still
couldn't get it done. ``We played a good, hard basketball game. But
our margin of error is so slight. All this is a very good learning
experience for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it: next season. The Celtics knew it was going to
come to this since their devastating, double-overtime loss in
Philadelphia March 24. But they were mathematically alive until
now. They will miss the playoffs for the fifth straight year and
now need to win their remaining seven games (six at home) to pass
Pitino's first team in total wins. The nine-game losing streak is
the fifth worst in franchise history and longest since a 10-gamer
in March-April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, now 11-5 under George Irvine, put this one away with a
34-21 advantage in the third quarter. Hill (10-of-17 shooting) got
rolling in the quarter after what had to be a pointed halftime chat
by Irvine. The Pistons, who had lost three straight at home,
trailed by 4 at the break and could ill afford to let this one slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed them to score too many points (38) in the second
quarter,'' said Jerry Stackhouse. ``I guess we had a mental
letdown. Things were kind of easy (23-12 after one quarter), and we
started to coast a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lindsey Hunter, ``Coach wanted us to get the game back
under control, and I think we did a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill poured in 13 points in the quarter and the Detroit defense,
such as it is, surfaced in spurts. The combination was enough to
give the Pistons an 80-71 lead after three quarters. From there,
Detroit went into its Constitutional Defense _ preserve, protect,
and defend _ and had enough, barely, to hold off the Celtics in a
fourth quarter that lasted longer than the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics trailed by 12 with 2:34 to play, but made it
interesting with a hail of treys down the stretch. But all that
succeeded in doing was getting more Pistons free throws and more
timeouts. Detroit attempted 22 freebies in the fourth quarter
alone, making 18. They made 43 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson led the Celtics with 24 points, including four
treys. Paul Pierce added 20 points but had no luck getting to the
line, which Pitino duly noted afterward (but in a diplomatic way,
of course).
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse suffered through a miserable shooting night (5 of 19)
but still had 22 points thanks to 10 freebies. Hunter added 18
points, including four treys.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had hoped that this season-ending home stretch would
be meaningful for them. For a while, it looked like it would be. No
one could have envisioned nine straight losses after the buoyant,
back-to-back road wins in Atlanta and Dallas last month.
</P>
<P>
   They're still waiting for their next win. Whenever it does come,
it may well be at the expense of someone who needs it more. The
Celtics still can have a say in the race, albeit a muted one. That
wasn't the plan, but results sometimes get in the way.

   SEATTLE _ A day after Bud Selig and Pedro Martinez made their
pitches, the official opening of Panic Season arrived Wednesday
night, just about the time they were wrapping up the 11 p.m. news
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez made the 261st start of his big-league career,
and it was the shortest of any in which the 13-year veteran was not
injured or warming up for a playoff start. It lasted only four
outs, at a cost of seven runs, four walks, a hit batter, and a
monster home run by Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's performance in Wednesday night's 9-3 loss to the
Seattle Mariners was positively Rappian and reinforced all the
nagging doubts from spring training that the rotation is one part
Pedro and four parts prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the night was over, six home runs _ three by the
Mariners, two by the back-to-bashing Brian Daubach and one by John
Valentin _ also punched a crater-sized hole into the theory that
long ball in the Northwest died when the Kingdome went kaboom.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, Alex Rodriguez, and returning native John Olerud went
deep on successive Sox pitchers _ Martinez, John Wasdin, and Tim
Wakefield. Thursday night, the Mariners turn their sights on former
Mariners lefthander Jeff Fassero, who last season gave up 35 home
runs, a total eclipsed by only Rick Helling of the Rangers (41) and
Pedro Astacio of the Rockies (38).
</P>
<P>
   Ramon the Elder has had shorter outings only twice before. On
April 6, 1996, in Chicago's Wrigley Field, Martinez lasted just an
inning before straining his groin attempting to field a ground ball
and missed the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the last day of the '96 regular season, Martinez
pitched only an inning against the Padres because he was scheduled
to start the first game of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in 49-degree weather Wednesday night, it was obvious
from the outset that Martinez was laboring. Mike Cameron lined his
first pitch to left for a single, Mark McLemore walked on four
pitches, and Martinez hit Rodriguez in the left elbow with an 0-2
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 1-0, John Mabry
blooped a single to make it 2-0, and Buhner _ who sat out the
opener because he had eight whiffs in eight at-bats against Pedro
the Younger _ smoked an opposite-field home run deep into the
right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was no better in the second inning. Martinez walked the first
batter of the inning, Carlos Guillen, on a full count. Cameron
popped out, but McLemore walked on four pitches and a full-count
pass to Rodriguez loaded the bases. Jimy Williams lifted Martinez
for Wasdin, who walked in two runs before getting out of the
inning, then gave up a long home run to Rodriguez to start the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox answered only with the bases-empty home runs by Daubach,
in his first two at-bats of the season, and Valentin's solo shot in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's home runs came off Freddy Garcia, the Venezuelan
righthander who came to the Mariners from the Astros in the Randy
Johnson deal two years ago. Johnson pitched two months for the
Astros before signing with the Diamondbacks as a free agent.
Garcia, meanwhile, went 17-8 as a rookie last season. How
impressive is that? The last Sox rookie to win as many as 17 games
in a season was Dave Ferriss, who went 21-10 in 1945, when many
big-leaguers were away at war.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki made his big-league debut in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had seven hits in their 2-0 win in the opener, had
nine Wednesday night, or one more than the Sox pitchers issued
walks.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second straight game Nomar Garciaparra went to bed
without one. Garciaparra went hitless in back-to-back games only
four times last season. He lined out in his first two at-bats
Wednesday night, the second time into the glove of the leaping
Rodriguez, who turned what could have been a hit into an
inning-ending double play in the third.

LAKERS CLINCH HOMECOURT ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OAKLAND _ Another season-defining moment was on the agenda
Wednesday night, but as usual, the Lakers were in no rush to
embrace it. Heck, they weren't even in a rush to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers took their time putting away the Golden State
Warriors at the Arena in Oakland, their closest rivals, the
Portland Trail Blazers, were losing to the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blazers fell, the Lakers automatically clinched the
NBA's best record and homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, unaware of events in the Pacific Northwest, were
not celebrating the occasion, and the only things chilling on ice
in the fourth quarter were Robert Horry's gimpy knees.
</P>
<P>
   And they labored through three quarters before deciding to put
the game away and make it all official. With a patchwork lineup, 49
points from Shaquille O'Neal and a strong finish, they did, with a
111-104 victory over the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   At 64-12, with six games to play, no one can catch them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's been the case all season for the Lakers, who have won
11 straight and 30 of their last 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew tonight was a clincher, so we just had to come out and
do the job,'' said O'Neal, 19 of 27 from the field and 11 of 16
from the line. ``We didn't do the job at all in the first half, but
we were able to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they took a minute to note their achievement, but
that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just business,'' Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   A moment to celebrate? ``No,'' O'Neal said. ``No, no. Never
that. It's not over. . . . It means that we've done our job in the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   They finished it off without Horry, whose tendinitis kept him
off the floor for the final period, and without Ron Harper, who got
the night off. And they did it for most of the night without Kobe
Bryant, who struggled in his first game back from a one-game
suspension and finished with 16 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the heroics came from rookie Devean George, whose
eye-opening performance netted him 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting,
including 4 for 4 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's nice to have that one over with and to go on home
and take a day off,'' said coach Phil Jackson. ``(The league's best
record) is what we went after this year and we finally got it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second straight night, there was little support from the
supporting cast: Glen Rice got six points, Horry just two, and
without O'Neal, the Lakers shot 40 percent. So the Lakers just kept
pounding the ball inside to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just about carried us all year,'' Fisher said of O'Neal.
``He's done more than be the MVP of this league. You can't really
say enough about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall's 32 points paced the Warriors, who with a
spirited effort took a 10-point lead in the second quarter and held
the advantage throughout the second and third.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't take the lead back until Bryant hit a
3-pointer with one-tenth of a second left in the third quarter, for
a 77-75 lead to head into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw and George opened the final period with back-to-back
3-pointers, and the Lakers raced to a 10-point lead, 87-77. The
Warriors mounted a late charge that cut the deficit to 102-98 with
less than three minutes to play, but the Lakers held off the
charge, with nine points from Bryant and O'Neal down the stretch.

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ After being mesmerized by Orlando Hernandez one night
and stifled by Roger Clemens the next, the Anaheim Angels hitters
took out their frustrations on David Cone and a slew of New York
Yankees relievers Wednesday night before 24,560 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels failed to score in only one of the first seven
innings, finished with 12 hits and won their first game of 2000,
12-6, over the defending champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw some pretty good pitchers at us in this series,''
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``For us to jump on a pitcher of
Cone's caliber is a big plus for us. They know how to pitch. It was
a real well-played series by both clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Scioscia's first win as a major-league manager and he had
a bottle of champagne sent to him by former Dodgers teammate Don
Sutton waiting to be opened. But Scioscia wouldn't call it ``his''
first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep saying it's my first win, my first win . . . it's not
my first win,'' Scioscia said. ``Those guys did it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys'' included Scott Schoeneweis, who went six innings
and got the victory in his first career major-league start. And
Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge) and Mo Vaughn, who had two hits
each. But no Angel is off to a better start to 2000 than Darin
Erstad, who went 4 for 5 Wednesday, including a home run, two
doubles and a career-high-tying five RBI. He had three hits in the
season opener Monday, two more Tuesday and is hitting .643 (9 for
14). Not a bad beginning, considering he had been in a slump since
being named to the All-Star team in the summer of '98.
</P>
<P>
   But Erstad, despite his desire to redeem himself, said there
isn't a need to put up big numbers early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about statistics,'' he said. ``As long as I'm
feeling good and hitting the ball hard, it doesn't matter if I'm
getting hits or making outs. I don't need to get off to a fast
start to give myself confidence. If I'm executing, that's all that
matters because hits come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   They're coming now.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games, all five of Erstad's hits were singles,
and all of them were hit to the opposite field or up the middle.
Wednesday, he got his first extra-base hit, leading off the game
with a home run to right-center field off Cone, the ninth leadoff
homer of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, he hit the ball into the right-center
field gap for a two-run double. In the third, he pulled the ball
down the right-field line for another two-run double. He got his
fourth hit of the night with a single up the middle in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta use the whole field to hit,'' Erstad said. ''You
take what they give you.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's success rubbed off on the rest of the team in the third
inning Wednesday when they knocked Cone out of the game and scored
six times. Vaughn began the inning with a single and eventually
scored on a single by Garret Anderson. Scott Spiezio drove in the
second run of the inning with a sacrifice fly, and one out later
Gary DiSarcina singled home another to make it 6-1. That was it for
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Allen Watson entered the game and allowed Erstad's
two-run double. Kennedy followed with an RBI single but was caught
rounding first too far and was thrown out to end the inning but not
before the Angels had taken a 9-1 lead.

A-ROD POISED TO FORGE NEW MARINERS TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking out across the infield at Safeco Wednesday night, Nomar
Garciaparra looked bulkier than usual. His legs were one thing, the
way the thighs stretched the limits of the Red Sox uniform
doubleknit.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shoulders and upper arms that were a dead giveaway,
though, like the guy swallowed a set of barbells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me about his workout routine,'' said Alex Rodriguez,
himself no slouch when it comes to off-season conditioning. ``It
sounds pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Not intense if you are Garciaparra, though. During the
off-season, the Boston shortstop was apparently hellbent on using
his Navy Seal training regimen to whittle his ``doughboy-esque''
5.5 percent body fat down to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can you say about him?'' Rodriguez said. ``He's a
future Hall of Famer. The guy's flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the triumverate of American League shortstops who are all
on the trail of Hall of Fame inductions, World Series rings and
glossy magazine covers, there is no jealousy. Not even the annual
All-Star vote race can't dent the loyalty the Three Amigos feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who gets the most votes. I won twice. Nomar
won. Derek (Jeter) is going to win. I don't know who is the most
deserving between us and it all depends on whose fans are dialing
in,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the psychology of being in the gang that is
made up of Garciaparra, Jeter and A-Rod, very little escapes the
attention of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some healthy competition going on,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we motivate each other in a way where we're trying to
subconsciously try and out-do each other. It's fun. Those guys are
great competitors, great team players and more than anything, the
common denominator is we're all focused on the 24 guys on our
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that, after a good night at the ballyard, A-Rod hasn't been
above leaving a message on Jeter's answering machine, telling the
Yankees shortstop to tune into ``SportsCenter'' for the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an uncommon topic, this Gang of Three Shortstops
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is interesting, peculiar almost, that on the Mariners'
opening homestand _ the start of the season in which Rodriguez's
fate and future will be determined _ Garciaparra and Jeter are
trotting through Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Rodriguez and his agent, Scott Boras, waded through a
series of meetings with Mariners officials, the crux of which was
to determine whether the team should trade Rodriguez or wait.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garciaparra and Jeter squared off in the American
League Championship Series. They were under the lights, on display
and loving it.
</P>
<P>
   With Garciaparra and Jeter right in the thick of things, the '99
ALCS was a fitting collision between the Yankees and Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing Rodriguez knows about Seattle and the
Mariners, it is the relative absence of that kind of tradition. And
with the Mariners' move to Safeco Field, the franchise has an
especially blank sort of slate on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome and its quirky place in time has been frozen in
memory. The Mariners' '95 run seems a streaky bit of magic that
dissipated with the club's inability to take the next step in time
to build on that energy and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   This is where A-Rod comes in. This is why he was not traded. It
is his role to figurehead this new era. He and the Mariners were
eager for A-Rod to play this role in the first post-Ken Griffey,
Safeco Field season.
</P>
<P>
   Bless Rodriguez for attempting to put the franchise on his back.
It is a noble task and one the smooth 24-year-old seems to be
taking seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the infield at Safeco the best in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He is taking leadership responsibility, more visibly now whereas
before it was a behind-the-scenes variety.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to commence a new era of baseball in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be the one to kickstart tradition, a winning one,
something that will set a standard for the Mariners for the future,
even if it seems a very tall order, even for A-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone, Garciaparra holds the Mariners shortstop in high
esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching him play,'' Garciaparra said. ``He's got all
the tools. He's got a great arm. He can steal bases. He's
unbelievable offensively. He can hit for power, average. He's got
all the tools you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez may have all the tools you need upon which to build a
franchise but Rodriguez has an eye for the big picture. He has an
eye for looking out to the infield this week and seeing his two
shortstop peers and knowing where they were last October and what a
Red Sox or Yankees uniform means in the historic context of things.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez fashions himself the kind of player who can be the
foundation. He also wonders if there is another cap that would be a
better fit for the bigger plans he has. He isn't jealous of
Garciaparra and Jeter. It doesn't mean he isn't extremely curious.

DUCKS HAVE SINKING FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For the better part of seven seasons Guy Hebert has
played well when the Anaheim Mighty Ducks have needed him.
Wednesday night the Anaheim goalie was a no-show in the team's
biggest game of the year _ a 5-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks
before 15,112 at United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert gave up three goals from over 40 feet and was easily
beaten by Bob Probert on a breakaway, while Chicago goalie Jocelyn
Thibault's 27 saves put the Ducks' Western Conference playoff hopes
on life support.
</P>
<P>
   With two games to play, Anaheim (33-35-12-2) needs help, and
lots of it, after it was unable to help itself against a Chicago
team it had defeated eight times in the previous 10 meetings
(8-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks fell to 10th place and lost any chance of catching San
Jose, which clinched a playoff spot with a victory over Dallas on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's faint hopes of catching eighth-place Edmonton now
depend on ninth-place Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks must win their two remaining games and hope the
Canucks defeat Edmonton on Friday and then loss to or tie the
Sharks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goalie and the goal posts were the difference,'' said
Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, who watched as Paul Kariya hit the
post twice in a game that was up for grabs until the middle of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who was a threat each time he stepped on the ice, beat
Thibault with a backhander at 9:40 after taking a breakaway pass
from Teemu Selanne to tie the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it looked as if they was a real chance the Ducks might
pull within two points of Edmonton, which had lost to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But 38 seconds later Jean-Yves Leroux wristed a 40 footer from
the top of the left circle that beat Hebert to give the Blackhawks
a 3-2 lead and likely end any dreams of postseason hockey in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be our game (after Kariya scored his
39th goal of the year), then boom, the next shift it's 3-2,'' said
Selanne, who assisted on both Anaheim goals. ``We had great scoring
chances and they throw a puck at the net and it goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroux's goal was the third of three 40-foot plus shots that got
by Hebert, who continues to give up soft goals at an alarming rate
as he suffers through the most inconsistent year of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sullivan beat him with a long one-timer at 14:47 of the
first period and Kevin Dean's harmless looking wrist shot slipped
past him at 5:32 of the second to give the Blackhawks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was some traffic in front of Hebert on two of the first
three goals, but Hartsburg was in no mood to defend his veteran
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't score from there at this time of year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Hebert was healthy the coach said, ``If he wasn't 100
precent healthy, he wouldn't have been in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, as they have in so many games in the second half of
the season, outchanced their opponent, but goals, not chances, are
what count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because they are scoring on what aren't even
scoring chances,'' said Hartsburg, whose Ducks outshot the
Blackhawks 29-22. ``It's not like there are guys standing alone in
front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get a breakaway and make a great play (to score)
and they wrist one and it's in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Probert did break in alone when Oleg Tverdovsky and Steve
Rucchin got tangled up at the Chicago blue line as the Ducks were
desperately pressing to score the tying goal. Hebert could have
kept the Ducks in the game, but Probert made it look easy, beating
him on the stick side at 16:37 of the third period to give Chicago
a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Amonte scored his 42nd goal of the year into a empty net at
18:54.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's goal was his 20th, but realistically the Ducks were
done in by two players scoring their third goals of the year (Dean
and Leroux) and one scoring his fourth (Probert).
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in the first period when Thibault stopped
Kariya in the first 30 seconds, made a fine stop on Antti Aalto and
an even better one on Selanne's one-timer from the left circle
while Anaheim was on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the first wave, the Blackhawks took a 1-0 lead
when Sullivan beat Hebert cleanly from the top of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya hit the first of his two post just over two minutes into
the second period and a Tverdovsky's bid was turned aside by
Thibault before Dean's floater from the blue line gave the
Blackhawks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The goal put the Ducks in a desperate situation and less than a
minute later a gamble by Ruslan Salei paid off. The Anaheim
defenseman jumped into the play and was in position to pick up a
deflected Selanne pass in the left circle and beat Thibault at 6:26
of the second.

   SEATTLE _ Opening day for many of the Mariners was Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Jay Buhner, it was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And if the evening wasn't accentuated by the rockets' red glare
of the traditional pre-opener fireworks, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner came prepared. He brought his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the lineup Wednesday night against Boston's Ramon Martinez
after being relegated to the bench against Ramon's brother Pedro
Tuesday, Buhner rid himself of some of the last two seasons' worth
of frustration with a three-run homer in his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   With Buhner lighting the torch and leading the parade, the
Mariners scored five runs in the first inning en route to a 9-3 win
over the Red Sox that was as comfortable as your daddy's old
beat-up recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, plagued by injuries that even now have him talking about
post-2000 retirement, drove in four of the runs himself, adding a
second-inning bases-loaded walk to the homer. He also singled to
continue where he left off in the spring _ leading the Mariners
with seven homers while driving in 23 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay took charge and got us going,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   With that lead suitably Buhner-ized for him, Seattle starter
Freddy Garcia survived a couple of Brian Daubach solo homers to
pilot the Mariners home to their first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting five runs like that, you want to stay in the game,''
said Garcia, who battled his control throughout his five innings.
``I had trouble finding my focus, but it helped having those
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the start that Red Sox's starter Ramon
Martinez, a once-dominant pitcher who has had success leeched from
him by a series of injuries, wasn't going to match the panache
displayed by his brother, Pedro, a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A Mike Cameron single set the play in motion, and soon the stage
was set with runners all around after Martinez walked Mark McLemore
and hit Alex Rodriguez. John Olerud brought the first run of the
Seattle season home with a run-scoring fly ball to center, and an
instant later it was 2-0 on an end-of-the-bat flare by John Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Buhner. Exit baseball. For the last two years Buhner has
battled upper body _ right elbow ligament replacement _ and lower
body _ arthroscopic surgery on his left knee _ ailment that have
cut the heart of what should have been two of the most productive
seasons of his career.
</P>
<P>
   After half a year of determined rehabilitation, Buhner says he
feels great. His bat is punctuating that message.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who rose to prominence last year on the strength of an
iron-willed fastball and 17 subsequent wins, didn't have the kind
of command that shows him at his best. Even so, he was more than a
match for the Red Sox's offense, which blitzed him twice in the
person of Daubach, but was otherwise docile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers felt a little fat tonight,'' Garcia said when asked
about the chilled air of Safeco Field. ``I was behind in the count
a lot. I wasn't that sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston leadoff hitter Jose Offerman reached base three times
against Garcia, but he got no support from the batters behind him
and was left stranded in scoring position each time.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was pulled after 92 pitches and five innings, enough to
qualify for the win on a night when the evening started at a brisk
49 degrees and tailed off. He was relieved by Frankie Rodriguez,
Arthur Rhodes and Kazuhiro Sasaki, the all-time Japan saves leader,
who pitched the ninth inningin making his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see (Rhodes and Sasaki) do what they did in
the last two innings,'' Piniella said. Past Mariner bullpens had
had troubles with leads, but the Mariners have high hopes that's
all behind them. ``We've had real nice pitching the first two
games. I'm just hoping it stays like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle padded its early 5-0 lead with a couple of runs in the
second inning. Well, the Mariners didn't have as much to do with it
as did the out-of-control Martinez and his replacement, John
Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was unceremoniously shown the door after walking three
of the first four men he faced. Wasdin, brought into a reliever's
no-man's land _ the bases loaded _ walked Olerud, the first man he
faced, and Buhner, the third, to bring the Seattle runs home and
get the lead fluffed up after Garcia had allowed a Daubach bomb to
land in the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach was back at it in the fourth, mangling a Garcia serve in
classic style, wresting the ball out over the center field wall.
But Rodriguez was able to answer for Seattle in the bottom of the
inning with his first homer, to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The teams weren't done decorating Safeco with baseballs. Olerud
his hit first homer out to right in the bottom of the sixth to run
his RBI count to three, and Boston third baseman John Valentin
countered with his No. 1 to left field in the seventh.

THIS COULD BE THE YEAR FOR DAVID DUVAL AT AUGUSTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Inside these secretive, hedged walls, where
golfers such as Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus have been afforded
a fountain of youth, where golf fans are so desperate for
admittance they will pay anything, where no stray blade of grass or
piece of trash is permitted to skip freely through the grounds, you
search for a sign. You search vainly for the anointed one.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite rarely wins here. And if he does, often a huge toll
is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain Larry Mize, Ian Woosnam and Jose Maria
Olazabal (twice) shyly pulling on green jackets when others seemed
so deserving?
</P>
<P>
   Or a graybeard Nicklaus prevailing at 46 and a fresh-scrubbed
Tiger Woods having his way at 21?
</P>
<P>
   Or the sudden, almost cruel banishment of Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle
and Seve Ballesteros from the throne room, or Greg Norman's
complete isolation from southern glory?
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National chooses its victors carefully, almost with
religious rite.
</P>
<P>
   Say a golf prayer for David Duval. This week, it might be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   This message was personally delivered to him late Tuesday
morning, as wind whipped through the pines and intermittent rain
made everything a little fresher and greener. The greatest player
to have never won a major was playing alone, just him and a crush
of spectators, when he stepped off the 18th tee and someone
whispered anonymously from the crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, David.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida native and former Georgia college student never
looked up as he strode up the fairway, 10 yards behind his caddie,
lost in his thoughts. But that doesn't mean he wasn't listening.
Minutes later, Duval was reminding a somewhat skeptical press corps
of the vast possibilities that once surrounded his career, now
seemingly swallowed up by the seductive power of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the rest of the PGA Tour has kowtowed to its marquee
draw, surrendering before the first divot is drawn. For a change,
the normally staid Duval, an 11-time winner, is pushing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think any event he plays in is Tiger's event to win,
which not too long ago was the case with me,'' Duval said. ``I
think this is my event to win or lose this week. Point being, it's
not going to change, no matter what anybody else feels.''
</P>
<P>
   His thought process might remain unaltered, but not so his body
tone. Duval has gone through a physical transformation not unlike
an Augusta National fairway _ once frumpy now almost anorexic. He
weighs about 175 pounds, down 15 or 20. But he claims he's fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's beneficial to my golf,'' the former Georgia Tech
player said. ``I don't think there's any way it can be harmful. So
I'll continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has not won in 12 months, since capturing the BellSouth
Classic the week before last year's Masters. But he has four top-10
finishes in nine events this season, lending credence to his
contender status. And he points out his victories weren't all that
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't take them away,'' he said. ``You know, I know how
to do it. I've been there a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Duval went with shrinkage, Woods has picked up
weightlifting and tried to bulk up. What we're left with, of
course, is Beauty and the Beast.
</P>
<P>
   To pick another trip to the coatroom for Woods would almost be
too easy, but it can't be discounted. He has won or nearly won
every tournament he has entered since the turn of the century. He
has won wire to wire, won walking a tightrope wire.
</P>
<P>
   And with each nearly unchallenged step, he has kept the Masters
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been targeting this,'' Woods said. ``My game has been
getting better week by week. I'm excited about some of the shots
I'm hitting now and the control I have. I've been working hard to
get to this point, and it's nice to see the fruits of good, hard
labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods also has witnessed Augusta National tinker with its layout
every year since his 12-stroke victory in 1997, attempting to make
the course ``Tiger-proof.'' So far, this has worked.
</P>
<P>
   There is 1{-inch rough where once there was none. Fairway
landing areas have been altered, sloped to send dead-center tee
shots rolling unheeded into the higher grass. Trees have been
moved. New pin placements promise to have even his Stripeness
chasing his own tail.
</P>
<P>
   Players say the biggest change comes with the 485-yard 10th
hole, a par 4 that serves as the gateway to Amen Corner. The green
was rebuilt, with new pin placements to the front and rear. And
rather than funnel the ball into the fairway, a tee shot hit long
and right will end up in deeper rough on a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   The 430-yard ninth hole also pulls fairway balls into the right
rough, a departure from the downhill straightaway it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The aim has been to neutralize the longer hitter, to update the
course against the modern player. Outwardly, Woods seems unfettered
by it all, offering a mild protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's such a great golf course, I don't see the need to
always have to change it every year,'' he said. ``They always add a
little something here and there. I guess that's something they like
to do around this place. I don't know. Maybe they get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people seem to be getting tired of Tiger. People other than
Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered Woods the Masters favorite, Spaniard
Sergio Garcia responded, ``I don't know if he's going to win. This
course is a tough course. Anybody in this field has a chance of
winning. I don't think you need to focus on one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, two players who used to own the spotlight, Palmer
and Nicklaus, won't win this week. But every April, they show up _
one 70, the other 60 _ unable to cut their ties to Augusta magic.
</P>
<P>
   In this land of a thousand red-brick churches, Duval could be
the subject of Sunday's sermon. He's been mentioned before.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Duval finished second by a stroke, beaten by Mark
O'Meara's final-hole birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Duval was sixth, five strokes behind the winner,
Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger or no Tiger, the lean one looks relaxed. He feels good.
He's not afraid to share this with anyone either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident and I think I'm going to have a lot of good
things happen this week,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Destroying reputations in cyberspace
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, April 9, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad news travels fast, getting faster. In these days, it travels
at cyber speed. And as we have learned when things travel too close
to the speed of light, they can become bent and distorted.
</P>
<P>
   It is not news that lies and misinterpretations corrupt the
Internet. It is a regular occurrence, one that confounds
authorities. Last year at this time, e-mail messages poured
chain-like to people informing them that fashion designer Tommy
Hilfiger had slurred Jews and African-Americans on the Oprah
Winfrey show. Despite the fact that Hilfiger had not, in fact had
not even appeared on the Winfrey program, there were incessant mass
e-mail messages calling for a boycott of Hilfiger products.
</P>
<P>
   Now, such a thing is happening to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site purveyor of books, music, videos and just about
anything else, is under fire principally by Jewish people for
offering for sale the notoriously anti-Semitic book ``The Protocols
of the Elders of Zion.'' This book, allegedly authored in Russia at
the turn of the last century, has had a long shelf life among those
who would foster anti-Semitic feelings.
</P>
<P>
   None other than the openly anti-Semitic Henry Ford was one of
its most arduous circulators in the 1920s through a newspaper he
published in Dearborn, Mich. Now, decades later, mass mailings of
e-mail messages are pouring across the Internet calling for a
boycott of Amazon.com based on ... what?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that's the issue: What?
</P>
<P>
   In all the messages, it is acknowledged that Amazon.com has a
perfect right to sell this scurrilous book, just as it does other
objectionable material. One in case is Joseph Lewis's 1926
anti-religious diatribe ``The Bible Unmasked.'' Amazon.com also
offers that book, but I do not see a similar reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Then why should there be a call to boycott? Well, as best I can
tell, the originator of the ``Protocol'' e-mail complaint alleged
that Amazon.com wrote a favorable review of the book. Anyone who
knows Amazon.com's Web site knows that Amazon.com does not write
reviews of any books; instead it opens its site for readers to
write reviews, and also carries the reviews of the book's
publishers _ in this case, Book Tree Press, a house that claims to
specialize in publishing controversial books.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the wave of e-mail response to the reaction caused
the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to offer a review of its
own, and for Amazon.com to publish a disavowal of any approval of
the book on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the e-mail message continues to circulate.
</P>
<P>
   And the question remains. If no one is calling for a book ban _
all citing speech freedoms _ and if Amazon.com did not favorably
review the book, then why is the message continuing to circulate
calling for a boycott of Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   It's because it's like a runaway freight train; no one knows how
to stop it. That's what happens with the Internet. There are no
checks and balances. Likely, there are people all over the world
still harboring a notion that Amazon.com wrote a favorable review
and should be rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   It is frightening how a person or company can be destroyed
simply by posting something harmful about them in cyberspace, even
if it is untrue. The message, if it plays properly to the
sympathies or vagaries of its recipients, can become an evergreen,
constantly there to unfairly damage its target.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The case against the case against Gore
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case a former top federal prosecutor made for the Justice
Department appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Al Gore's
political fund-raising turns out to be just about as good a case
for Attorney General Janet Reno's decision not to.
</P>
<P>
   We have testimony for that from no less than the prosecutor
himself, Charles LaBella. Well, after a fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While you've been idling away the time with trivialities like
keeping body and soul together these last few years, the LaBella
memo has been a particularly noisy sideshow on the midway of
Washington's Scandalrama.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella had argued strongly, it was widely said, for the
appointment of a special prosecutor. But he had been quashed and
his memo with him. To all in the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy, Reno's
disagreement and the fact that Justice kept the memo private were
more evidence of a cover-up by the criminal Clintons and their
underworld lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that the author himself sees no cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking recently on ``Meet the Press,'' LaBella said, ``I
really don't believe the attorney general in any way, shape or form
was protecting anybody, or anybody else at the Justice Department
was politically protecting anybody.'' The issues, he said, were
bureaucratic, not partisan.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, LaBella doubts any prosecutions would have
resulted from an independent counsel's investigation. ``It's a long
shot,'' he said, ``of whether or not charges should be filed,
whether or not anything really happened that was wrong, illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBella felt unanswered questions justified a special prosecutor
and that if exoneration followed, it would be more credible from an
independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a jump ball _ it's too close a call for us to make,'' he
said in the TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Let's freeze-frame the ball in midair.
</P>
<P>
   At that crucial moment, Reno has already sicced special
prosecutors on the president and three Cabinet officers. Kenneth
Starr's supposed Whitewater investigation has metastasized into
several White House operations _ and we haven't even come to Monica
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ceaseless opponents have mastered the trick of
boosting obscure charges against him into the media and then using
their very presence in the media to clamor that only the
appointment of special prosecutors could clear the air. They've
been shopping for ways to get the vice president in similar hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, a premier Justice Department attorney holds
that referral to a special prosecutor is justified and called for,
in part for appearances' sake _ though, we now know, he doubts that
much, if anything, would come of it. On the other hand, we have the
prospect of an already spreading legal chaos surging from the
presidency to the vice presidency, and on iffy grounds, in effect
placing the whole executive branch of government in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Reno knew she'd be slammed for it by the Clinton-hunters, but
more and more it looks as though she was right to go for the jump
ball.

 PM-ELIAN-0406-COX &HT;    ELIAN'S FATHER ARRIVES IN U.S. TO CLAIM HIS 6-YEAR-OLD SON
 &HT;    With Rick McKay Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: For PMs of Thurs., April 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW ALEXANDER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The father of Elian Gonzalez arrived in America
Thursday morning to claim his son, accusing Miami relatives of
exploiting the 6-year-old boy and demanding a halt to ``endless,
confusing procedures'' in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I will soon be able to embrace my son,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzales said in what he called a ``message to the American
people'' delivered on the tarmac shortly after arriving at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington. ``I am confident that the
U.S. authorities will not allow my child to continue to be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The father's arrival is a dramatic turn in the custody battle
for Elian, who saw his mother and 10 others drown off the Florida
coast last November as they fled Cuba on a small boat for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was subsequently placed in the care of Miami relatives,
who are expected Thursday to return to negotiations with U.S.
immigration officials over the terms of his possible return to his
father. A psychologist is also expected to visit with Elian and the
family to counsel them on the possible trauma of separating them.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington
this morning that federal authorities will continue to seek a
``cooperative arrangement'' by which Elian would be transferred to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father and the son need to be together,'' Holder said,
``and in the coming days, we will do everything we can to see that
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has allowed the Miami relatives to retain
custody of Elian while they appeal a U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service ruling that they boy should be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old father was accompanied to Washington by his wife
and 6-month-old son. They arrived from Havana about 6:30 a.m. EST
on a private, U.S.-flagged Learjet along with a small group of
Cuban officials that included Fernando Remirez, the head of the
Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They will stay at the Remirez residence in suburban Bethesda,
Md., while the negotiations over Elian's transfer continues.
Remirez is temporarily moving out of his home and waving its
diplomatic immunity, reportedly to lessen the appearance that the
father is under the control of communist Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As if his mother's disappearance before his eyes and the
miracle of his arrival have not inflicted enough damage,'' the
father said, Elian ``has had to spend time under the temporary
custody of some distant relatives who had never seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzales, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter,
said it has been an ``agonizing experience to see my son submitted
to cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his
personality, already weakened by the terrible trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse still, Elian's been paraded and exhibited in public
rallies and by the media with a clear intent to obtain political
advantage from this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was seen this morning playing in the yard of the Miami
home where he has been staying. He reportedly had not been informed
that his father had come to the United States on a mission to take
him back to his home in Cardenas, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood remained
tense, as some in the Cuban exile community vowed to form a human
chain around the house in an attempt top prevent Elian from being
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Washington, there was a visible police presence
around the home where the father will be staying. As he delivered
his remarks at Dulles Airport, a handful of protestors could be
heard shouting: ``Welcome to freedom.'' The father appeared to hear
their chants, but did not acknowledge them.
</P>
<P>
   For months, many members of Miami's politically influential
Cuban exile community have vowed never to allow the boy to be
returned to what they view as the oppressive regime of Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramon Saul Sanchez, a spokesman for the anti-Castro
Democracy Movement in Miami, sounded conciliatory when interviewed
this morning on CNN. He spoke of the need to negotiate a peaceful
``transition'' to the father.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when a reunion between father and son might take
place, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot happen in one or two days,'' Linda Osberg-Braun, a
lawyer for the boy's Miami relatives said on the NBC ``Today''
show. ``That would be like Elian losing his mother a second time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Juan Miguel Gonzales said he is ``truly
impatient to have (Elian) returned to me as soon as possible and go
back to Cuba together immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in recent days INS officials have indicated they will
seek to have Elian transferred to the custody of his father and
then have them both wait in Washington until appeals are exhausted
in U.S. courts.

 PM-ELIAN-0406-COX &HT;    ELIAN'S FATHER ARRIVES IN U.S. TO CLAIM HIS 6-YEAR-OLD SON
 &HT;    With Rick McKay Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The father of Elian Gonzalez arrived in America
Thursday morning to claim his son, accusing Miami relatives of
exploiting the 6-year-old boy and demanding a halt to ``endless,
confusing procedures'' in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I will soon be able to embrace my son,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzales said in what he called a ``message to the American
people'' delivered on the tarmac shortly after arriving at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington. ``I am confident that the
U.S. authorities will not allow my child to continue to be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The father's arrival is a dramatic turn in the custody battle
for Elian, who saw his mother and 10 others drown off the Florida
coast last November as they fled Cuba on a small boat for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was subsequently placed in the care of Miami relatives,
who are expected Thursday to return to negotiations with U.S.
immigration officials over the terms of his possible return to his
father. A psychologist is also expected to visit with Elian and the
family to counsel them on the possible trauma of separating them.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington
this morning that federal authorities will continue to seek a
``cooperative arrangement'' by which Elian would be transferred to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father and the son need to be together,'' Holder said,
``and in the coming days, we will do everything we can to see that
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has allowed the Miami relatives to retain
custody of Elian while they appeal a U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service ruling that they boy should be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old father was accompanied to Washington by his wife
and 6-month-old son. They arrived from Havana about 6:30 a.m. EST
on a private, U.S.-flagged Learjet along with a small group of

TIME TO BRUSH UP ON THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bad enough that I don't have a computer science degree; now
I'm starting to wish I'd gone to law school. Some of the most
interesting computing developments of recent months have more to do
with torts than with tech. It's not just antitrust law either; many
of the legal disputes involve questions of free-speech rights and
the limits of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Cyber Patrol case, for instance. Microsystems
Software of Framingham, Mass. makes Cyber Patrol, a program that
blocks out Internet sites that some people might find offensive.
Well, there are others who find the very existence of Cyber Patrol
offensive _ ``censorware,'' they call it. Two such ``hacktivists''
unscrambled Cyber Patrol and used their knowledge to build CPHack,
a program that reveals the sites that Cyber Patrol blocks, and that
also makes it easy to deactivate the program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsystems went to court, saying that CPHack was a violation
of its copyright, because it was created with Cyber Patrol's own
code. A federal judge in Boston has ordered pretty much everybody
on the Internet with a copy of CPHack to remove it from their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Can the judge do that? The American Civil Liberties Union says
no, announcing Wednesday that it's appealing the ruling. I wish I
could take this delightfully simple view of the matter. But to a
mind uncontaminated by legal expertise, it seems like a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   If the CPHackers had merely revealed the list of sites Cyber
Patrol blocks, they'd probably be untouchable. You can't copyright
a list of factual information _ even I know that. But do the
hackers have a right to use someone else's code to create a program
that prevents the original program from working? Isn't that a sort
of theft or vandalism?
</P>
<P>
   That one's not clear. The Boston judge, in issuing his
injunction, seemed to think this is unacceptable. But there's this
1988 case, Vault v. Quaid, that suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Vault Corp.'s program prevented software piracy, by making it
impossible to copy data from a floppy disk. Quaid Software studied
Vault's program and used that knowledge to write software that
defeated the Vault system. And guess what? A federal court said
Quaid's software was A-OK, even though it effectively destroyed
Vault's business. I can see why the ACLU appealed the Cyber Patrol
injunction. Odd though it might seem to my untrained mind, the
CPHackers could yet win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more such litigation ahead too, as other
hacktivists use their programming skills to protest various
corporate practices. We'll probably hear a lot about a group called
RTMark, best known for an international Internet campaign to shut
down the popular toy retailing Web site eToys.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that eToys had found out about an arts Web site called
etoy.com, and demanded that the site change its name. But etoy.com
had been founded years before eToys came along, and said it had
every right to its Internet domain name. eToys got a federal judge
to issue an injunction against its tiny adversary. But outraged
RTMark members publicly vowed to launch hacker attacks against
eToys during the 1999 Christmas shopping season, to crash the site
and punish the company for its arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, but all the bad publicity forced eToys to back
down. Score one for the good guys, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   But if RTMark had roasted eToys' servers, wouldn't that be a
crime? After all, the FBI is still chasing the vandals who recently
shut down some of the world's biggest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think we can get away with it, we do it, yeah,'' says
RTMark spokesman Ray Thomas _ not his real name, by the way. ``The
legality of it is really a touchy issue.'' Because RTMark has never
been taken to court over an Internet sabotage campaign, Thomas says
it is willing to consider launching more acts of civil
disobedience, aimed at the overwhelming power of greedy
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``electrohippies,'' a group bitterly opposed
to genetically modified food crops. They're currently recruiting
volunteers to help them launch crippling attacks on corporate Web
sites beginning next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hacktivists still seem to believe the old myth that Internet
technology will always keep them a step ahead of the laws. Bill
Gates has lately learned otherwise, and so will these lads, in
time. I'd better get used to reading legal briefs. I expect to see
quite a few of them.

CHRISTMAS IS OVER, FOLKS, NO MORE EXCUSES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toysrus.com ducks an e-mail message. Eddie Bauer's Web site
grinds to a near halt. And at Lands' End's Internet call center, a
busy representative gets testy. The Christmas-time crunch?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. It was March, one of the slower selling times for
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the conventional wisdom, consumers who shop during
off-peak periods should be able to experience a smoother and less
glitchy shopping experience. But so far, analysts say they aren't
convinced that Web merchants are making good on their promises to
beef up customer service _ whether it be via phone, email or simply
making it easy to buy things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of religion that came after
Christmas,'' said Gina Paglucia Morrison, an analyst with the
Cambridge, Mass. Internet consulting firm MainSpring. ``But I don't
know if too many dollars went toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, some Internet merchants appear to be placing a
greater emphasis on improving customer service. In an informal
survey of 14 Web stores by The Boston Globe, the Gap Inc. and
800.com Inc. showed they could both operate speedy sites and
respond quickly to even the most offbeat customer questions.
</P>
<P>
   In eight minutes, the Gap's Melissa Hare responded to an
electronic message requesting help finding a children's sweater in
pink, suggesting a blend of ``mohair/wool/cashmere/silk.''
</P>
<P>
   It took three hours for 800.com, an online retailer of music,
videos, and consumer electronics, to respond to an e-mail. But an
employee not only explained to us the reason why the price of the
``Sixth Sense'' videotape was more than quadruple the cost of the
DVD equivalent _ but also gave us skinny on the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios mark the price up high so that people will rent
the videos from rental stores instead of purchasing them first,''
the employee wrote. ``The reason that DVDs are so much cheaper when
first released is because the rental demand at this point is very
low.''
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, Toysrus.com and 1800flowers.com did not
respond to e-mail questions. Other Web retailers, like bookseller
Borders.com and online education store SmarterKids.com, took
several days to return e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, thank God you don't need an ambulance,'' cracked
Adam Phillips, a vice president with the online florist
Geraldstevens.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips isn't laughing too hard. When informed that his
company took six hours to respond to an e-mail question _ a time
that he says should be shortened. To hear that, he said ``is
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, busy customer service employees didn't seem interested
in helping. Reached by telephone, an abrupt Lands' End
representative told us we needed to look up stock numbers for cuff
links before she could answer questions about the items.
</P>
<P>
   At eddiebauer.com's call center, an employee claimed she knew
nothing about the catalog retailer's Internet store. CDnow Inc., an
Internet music and video store, placed its toll-free telephone
number in a tiny corner of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the retailer did not want to hear from customers,
an employee giggled. ``Sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say online retailers seem to be spending more time on
developing features that allow consumers to virtually try on
clothing, listen to music, or personalize Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The latest craze _ trying to improve sales by predicting
customers' likes and dislike and suggesting suitable purchases _
can have unexpected results. Order a California guide for a
vacation, and Amazon.com keeps recommending books about that state.
Tell 800.com that you adore Nina Simone, the Dave Matthews Band and
Sarah McLachlan _ and the retailer informs you that you may enjoy
listening to the Butthole Surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest aggravation is the increasing demand for passwords in
order to make a purchase. E-merchants argue that it allows them to
better serve you. But busy consumers aren't looking for another
password. And who needs the extra steps when all you really want is
to have the flowers arrive on time?

REINVENTING THE TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the hoopla over high-speed-Internet this and wireless
that, a lot of American businesses would still love to just find a
better, cheaper, and more flexible office telephone system.
Innovations in ``plain old telephone service'' are what they are
looking for, and two area companies are among those aiming to meet
the demand.
</P>
<P>
   BizFon of Salem, N.H., recently began offering a $1,500 box that
provides all the services associated with big-company phone
systems, including voice mail, five-way conferencing, and even your
own selection of music on hold.
</P>
<P>
   MCK Communications Inc. of Needham, Mass., meanwhile, has just
rolled out a product called Extender 100 that turns a
telecommuter's laptop computer into an extension of the home-office
switchboard. That allows users to answer their office line from
whatever phone they have plugged into the computer and use the
company's outgoing long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are targeting what are estimated to be big
markets. As of two years ago, 90 percent of US small businesses had
no automated phone system, according to Framingham, Mass.
researchers International Data Corp., largely because there were
few low-end, do-it-yourself options available from telecom giants
like Lucent Technologies or Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   And within three years, the number of US telecommuters is
expected to reach 40 million, according to the Gartner Group, a
leading telecommunications consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the companies are selling products that can be
set up by anyone who can plug in a telephone, record a voice-mail
greeting and, in the case of the MCK product, use a computer
keyboard to dial phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The basic $1,500 BizFon box, which can also be leased for $80 a
month, supports up to six incoming lines fed out to eight office
lines. Up to four boxes can be stacked for companies that need 25
to 32 phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've plugged in the phone lines, a simple press of a
button launches the BizFon 680. The base unit supports up to 100
minutes of recorded voice mail, with plug-in ``Voice Vault'' cards
available for $300 to add another 120 minutes and $400 to add 240
minutes more. And you can also record your own on-hold music from a
compact disc as an alternative to Muzak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically been designed as a consumer product,'' said
BizFon engineering vice president Bob Laroche. ``We're trying to
take the mystery out of office telephony and keep you from needing
the guys who show up in a white truck to install it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some special features: By dialing extension 299, anyone who has
bought the box is instantly connected to BizFon customer service.
And extension 290 is an in-house conference call bridge, so you
don't have to pay AT&AMP;T or another carrier a dollar a minute to put
together a multiparty conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The BizFon device can also turn remote lines (like a home office
phone) into the functional equivalent of another office extension,
so a telecommuter can reach other people by dialing their extension
and answer calls to their office line as if they were right there.
</P>
<P>
   MCK's Extender 100 uses a connection to a telecommuter's laptop
to link whatever phone they are using to the office switchboard, as
long as they have a high-speed data connection such as a cable
modem or digital subscriber line.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that takes some adjustment is that you have to
click on an icon on your computer desktop to open a program to use
it, then dial all your calls from the laptop screen. When the
product is in use, the telephone connected to the laptop becomes
just a ``dumb handset'' through which you speak, although coming
versions will allow you to dial on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Extender 100 runs $400 per individual using it, plus another
$3,900 or $4,900 for a box at the company offices to support eight
to 12 off-site users. Your company has to pay for a daylong phone
call to where you are working to keep you connected, even during
times when you are not using the phone.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston uses an MCK system for graveyard shift clerks to work
from home without having to schlep downtown, while Circuit City
uses a version to route tech-support calls to people scattered all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   MCK officials see their products as being an especially useful
bridge between conventional ``private branch exchanges,'' or PBXs,
the lifeblood of a big company switchboard, and devices now hitting
the market that will link all voice calls into a data switch. PBX's
are the devices that allow people within a company or organization
to dial each other by extension number and pools outgoing
long-distance calls to save money, among other functions.
</P>
<P>
   While converged voice-data systems are widely expected to render
obsolete the millions of old-fashioned PBX's in use, in recent
years the number of traditional voice-circuit PBX's has still been
growing by over 1.5 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think PBX's are nowhere near dead,'' said MCK's Al
Brisard. ``As new devices come along, we will plug right in to the
next generation. We think we are in a good place, because nobody's
today really giving you an idea of how you will get from the old to
the new.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Stock prices, weather forecasts and traffic reports may be handy
things to get from your wireless phone, but for some people far
less compelling than the Holy Grail: A Saturday morning golf
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   As the wireless industry races to make you see your cell phone
as an indispensable Internet tool, a Billerica, Mass. company is
rolling out a new service for golf nuts to beat the midweek rush
for a prime weekend tee time.
</P>
<P>
   Later this spring, CSP Inc.'s ModComp subsidiary will unveil a
system allowing members and guests of the Club Henri Chappelle in
Belgium to use their wireless Net phones to book foursomes. By
using the phone to visit a special Web portal set up by the club,
golfers can scroll through a list of available times on selected
days and enter a confirmation number to book a time.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious question is: Who would want to go through the hassle
of maneuvering around a tiny phone screen to reserve a golf time
when you could just use the phone to call the pro shop and ask,
``Do you have a time for four Saturday at 8 a.m.?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander R. Lupinetti, chairman and chief executive of CSP,
said, ``If it was easier doing it some other way, you'd do it some
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The wireless system could be a way around the mad pro-shop phone
crush on Wednesday or Thursday mornings when many courses begin
taking reservations for the weekend. And while many US golf courses
use automated voice-response systems that respond to touch tones to
reserve times, Lupinetti thinks many golfers would find it faster
and easier to scroll through a list of times directly. Plus,
golfers would be able to call any hour of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The software necessary to run the system, which supports a wide
range of other transaction- and inquiry-oriented business purposes,
starts at about $5,000, and the overall cost of launching a
wireless phone reservation system would likely run less than
$20,000 per club, Lupinetti said. So after the first, say, 100
foursomes at $50 a head used the service who might otherwise go
elsewhere, a club could quickly make more money by filling up
unused tee times.
</P>
<P>
   Lupinetti said the company has no current sales prospects in New
England. Within the next three years, as many as 700 million
Internet-capable wireless phones are expected to be in use around
the world, but Lupinetti said how soon New Englanders can make tee
times wirelessly is ``all a function of how quickly these phones
will become available here.''

VETERAN TECH INVESTOR SHOWS HOW TO KEEP COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy with a good chunk of his money in technology stocks,
Steve Demirjian didn't look too ruffled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably because Demirjian has been investing in
technology for the past 17 years, first at Essex Investment
Management and for the past four years at Westfield Capital
Management in Boston. Westfield manages about $2.1 billion for
institutions and wealthy individuals. Last year, riding the tech
wave, many of its accounts were up better than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We sat down with Demirjian Wednesday to sort out this
topsy-turvy week in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you been doing a lot of buying and selling this week?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think in a market like this the best thing to do is
nothing. You have to know what you own and not get swayed one way
or another. These short-term moves can be scary, and you can lose a
lot of money very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you own the stocks that have gotten creamed this week?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fortunately, we didn't own the high-flying, big-momentum tech
stocks that had no earnings. We didn't own Akamai, Amazon.com,
Navisite. We didn't buy companies whose absolute losses were
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wait a minute. Are you saying that earnings matter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right. I think investors now are going to focus on companies
that have earnings, companies that will be around in two to three
years, companies that are not just a flash in the pan. Take a
company like drkoop.com. It went public, was a high-flier, it got
jacked way up, and the next thing you know there are questions from
its auditors about whether it is viable as a going concern.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It sounds as if you were not a big investor in e-tailing.
</P>
<P>
   A. E-tailing is a low-margin business with low barriers to
entry. The companies are burning up cash, and there are more
competitors coming in all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think what we've been through the past six months
would qualify as a mania?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. We had a lot of uninformed investors. There was a lot of
cocktail chatter. You see your friend on the street and he tells
you he made 50 percent in no time. It used to be that if you made
50 percent in two years it was a great investment. Now if you don't
make it in two weeks there is something wrong with the company.
People got greedy and their expectations got too high.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you level most of the blame for the big swings on
individual investors?
</P>
<P>
   A. That would be unfair. Wall Street got greedy, too. Wall
Street said we want more deals, and investment banks were happy to
bring out as many deals as they could. There have been 400 Internet
IPOs since Netscape went public in August '95. There are 155
Internet companies in registration right now. There is a lot of
supply still coming. That is going to put a cap on any big moves
up.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has anything fundamentally changed about the technology
business?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The fundamentals are still very strong. Internet growth
is still extraordinary, both here and overseas. The addition of
more bandwidth to homes is going to cause more people to spend more
time online. We still think technology is the best place to be for
the next five to 10 years. People are not going back to the old way
of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kinds of technology investments do you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. We like the infrastructure companies. Companies that do Web
hosting, application service providers, telecom equipment, cellular
phones. It is a cliche, but if this is a war, we want to buy the
guys who supply the ammunition, because they don't care who wins.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If people are going to stay invested in technology, are they
going to have to learn to live with volatility?
</P>
<P>
   A. Technology is inherently a volatile sector. Why? Because
there are a lot of companies, and there is always a competitive
threat. Someone is always coming up with a technology that is
faster or better. There are going to be companies that do well and
companies that go bust.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the one thing that worries you most in the short run?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think there is still a lot of complacency out there on the
part of the individual investor. I don't think people have been
scared enough. Eventually, there will be a time when it won't pay
to buy on the dips, because we will get a correction where stocks
don't just snap back. People are still complacent about technology
and the new economy. They don't know as much as they think they
know.

O'MEARA FEELS GAME IS WITHIN HIS GRASP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It was a small step, nothing that made headlines,
but when Mark O'Meara finished tied for ninth at The Players
Championship two weeks ago, it was cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A small one, that is.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Meara's first Top 10 in a year, or since he finished
tied for sixth at the 1999 TPC. ``The last 10 months have been a
little bit of a battle,'' said O'Meara. ``I haven't played as well
as I've liked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just turned 43, there was speculation that O'Meara was in
cruise control, that he didn't have the drive or ambition anymore
to keep pace on the very deep and talented PGA Tour, that after his
two-major campaign of 1998 he was too comfortable to care.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth to all that, he said, but some
misconceptions, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 certainly was a fantastic year. Two majors. I knew 1999
would be tough, and certainly it was, but there were a lot of
opportunities out there at 42, 43 (years old) to take, and I did.
But I traveled a lot in 1997, too, and throughout my career.''
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't the overseas appearance money, he said, but more a
question of mental attitude. ``My confidence wasn't very good.
There would be strides on the practice tee, but then I'd get on the
course and wouldn't believe it. I'd hit some bad ones, and
self-doubt would creep in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what plummeting to 45th on the money list (his $868,796
in earnings a big drop from three consecutive million-dollar
campaigns) will do for you. He had just three Top 10s (none after
March) in 19 starts, after having had 29 in the previous four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark O'Meara who got beat, 1 up, by Padraig Harrington in
last September's Ryder Cup was nothing like the Mark O'Meara who in
1998 won both the Masters and British Open. But the Mark O'Meara of
1998, he said, wasn't necessarily the best he's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had years when I have struck the ball better (than
1998),'' said O'Meara. ``But in 1998 I was just the best at certain
times when I had to be. Like the last five at Royal Birkdale and
the last four or five holes at Augusta, when I hit really great
shots, hit clutch putts.''
</P>
<P>
   None was more clutch than the birdie at the 72d hole to win at
Augusta. It is just such a memory, said O'Meara, that lifts his
spirits as the first major of the season prepares to tee off. He
has found himself thinking back to the days that led to his 1998
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998 I didn't play that well in the practice rounds at
Augusta. Sometimes when you're not playing as well you don't put as
much pressure on yourself. But if you putt well and you know the
course, that's the whole secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference being, he is a good putter and does know the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly where I'd like to be,'' said O'Meara, who
finished tied for 31st in his title defense a year ago. ``You want
to go there hitting that high draw, and that's what I have to keep
working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have something to prove? Yeah, I have something to prove
to myself _ that I can still play.''

MIND YOUR E-BUSINESS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They look like boutiques, with their tasteful decor and
luxurious offerings. But what's behind those Internet storefronts
may surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   At CSAJewelry.com, a Web store so well designed that it looks
like it's operated by a jewelry chain, the owner is packing orders
herself in Longwood, Fla. At an online tobacco shop, an annoyed
woman picked up the phone and muttered, ``No one's here.''
</P>
<P>
   In this booming economy any entrepreneur with a computer can
seem like a legitimate business. While there are some online
bandits, in general, there's nothing sinister about most of the
virtual stores dotting cyberspace, including CSAJewelry.com. The
problem for many small and inexperienced sellers is that they may
not have the staffs or inventory systems needed to deliver goods
during peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we tell people is, `Don't judge the product
you're buying based on a nice-looking Web site,' '' said Tara
Finck, a spokeswoman for the National Consumers League. ``Just
because they have all of the bells and whistles doesn't mean they
are an up-and-up company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts can't always tell who's who. Finck, for
instance, assumed that the humidor she bought online came from a
large, established retailer. But the humidor was slow to arrive,
and when she called the retailer about the delay, a company
representative greeted her with an informal ``hello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `OK, this is a really small operation,' '' Finck
said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago that Internet retailers were boasting
that they could handily steal sales and shoppers from Old World
merchants. But it turns out that selling on the Web is the simple
part. Filling orders, on the other hand, requires strong
distribution facilities and a small army of employees to answer
e-mails and pack products.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers that flocked to the Web before the holiday
shopping season may have built pretty sites, but they couldn't
always handle the crowds. Swamped with orders, several online
beauty shops did not ship merchandise in a timely fashion. Even
large merchants, like Toys R Us Inc., disappointed Web shoppers by
failing to deliver before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   After the winter holidays, about a quarter of Internet stores
surveyed by the research firm Jupiter Communications confessed that
they had problems filling orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more expensive to do it well than people realized,
said Jeff Wiles, a senior vice president with Fingerhut Companies
Inc., a large catalog retailer that also fills orders for Internet
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that many online retailers have not
developed systems that allow them to quickly update inventories,
Wiles said. That means a customer who places an order for Barbie
may be informed two days later that the doll was not in stock.
These are costly mistakes for online retailers, because most
consumers cancel their orders after receiving such notices, Wiles
said.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome to consumer advocates are the rapidly rising
number of Internet fraud complaints. Customers reported 10,660
incidents of fraud last year, up from just 690 in 1996, according
to the National Consumers League. Online fraud cost shoppers about
$3.2 million, with the average customer losing $580.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaints emerging are about the Wild West of the
electronic marketplace: auction sites. The list of gripes includes
bogus bids, mysterious merchants and criminals who never intended
to ship goods.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Merring, a law firm librarian in Newport Beach, Calif.,
said a seller at eBay, the Web's biggest bazaar, cashed her check
and promised to ship her a $20 purse. ``I didn't get it before
Christmas and at the end of January, I said, `Wait a minute,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to contact the seller, all she got was ``a song
and dance.'' Last month, she was trying to work with the seller to
get her money returned.
</P>
<P>
   Although wary online shoppers can scan reviews of sellers
written by previous customers, some say the ratings aren't
reliable. One problem: disreputable merchants create different user
identities at eBay and then give themselves rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, shoppers also have to wonder who's doing the
complaining: Is it a truly burned customer or someone who's angry
about losing in the bidding process? The brawls between buyers and
sellers provide entertaining reading, but they aren't likely to
help users make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one of your satisfied customers today,'' a user
wrote in the feedback section for an online jewelry seller at eBay.
``He says you sell fake Rolexes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This person is a total liar (and) holds two screen names,''
the merchant responded in a subsequent message.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile hoaxes have embarrassed auction officials.
A New Jersey teenager, using his parents' credit card, bid $900,000
on an antique bed. eBay itself was offered on another auction site.
</P>
<P>
   In response, eBay, which had more than 10 million users last
year, has been trying to clamp down on online marauders. All
comments on the seller feedback rating must now be related to
transactions _ or users risk being suspended or expelled from the
site. In September, the auction site required new sellers to give
eBay their credit card numbers. To protect merchants, eBay plans to
begin asking bidders to hand over their credit card numbers on
offers above $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have been a pioneer in this area,'' said Kevin
Pursglove, a spokesman for San Jose, Calif.-based eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're doing what they think is appropriate,''
said Finck of the National Consumers League. ``We wish they would
do a lot more.''

TOYS ON THE BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a presidential candidate gave a speech and no one was there
to capture it on a mini digital voice recorder, would anyone hear
it?
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the candidates of Campaign 2000 will find out.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ way back in the 1970s _ reporters routinely
used paper notebooks. They dragged 10-pound manual typewriters on
the road. They fought over the sole pay phone. They made tapping
sounds as they wrote, then handed a piece of paper to a ``Western
Union man,'' who trancribed it and sent it, via Telex, to a central
newsroom. And as recently as five years ago, photographers shot
their pictures on film _ film! _ and sent it by courier back home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it seems almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after newspaper reporters first began carrying
portable tape recorders (during, appropriately enough, the 1972
reelection campaign of Richard M. Nixon), the election trail is
awash in electronic devices capable of recording every word of a
candidate's speech, reconfiguring it on a 1.7-pound laptop, and
transmitting it around the world via the Internet. Within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the world wants that close a view is up for debate. So
is the efficiency of the technology itself. Reporters on the
campaign trail still carry at least 10 pounds of electronic gear _
only now it's phones, computers, and connector cables. They are
still plagued with logistical inconveniences, except they now
appear in the form of dead cell phone zones and dying laptop
batteries. And they still have to get questions answered quickly,
whether it's by calling a candidate's press secretary or by calling
up his Web site via cellular modem while riding on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   And of course they still have to cover the candidates. Who are
still giving the time-honored stump speech _ whether anyone is
listening or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Judy Keen, political reporter, USA Today:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, when I was covering the Dukakis campaign, we had to
put acoustic couplers over phone handsets to file,'' says Keen,
motioning with both hands to try to demonstrate just what an
acoustic coupler was. ``And look at us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen's latest acquisition _ a Sprint PCS Touchpoint cell phone _
is becoming more commonplace on the cellular market. But it verges
on revolutionary in presidential campaign land, where reporters
reconvene only every four years with a set of tools virtually
unrecognizable from the campaign before.
</P>
<P>
   What's so great about the phone? For one thing, it is a direct
link to the Internet, which Keen can use to read headlines off
Yahoo, Amazon.com, and Fox Sports _ on the face of the phone _
while riding a bus. Or read her e-mail as the campaign plane taxis
down the runway. Or file a story for the next day's paper from a
remote field in Iowa, by simply attaching the phone to her IBM
Think Pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be we'd be on a bus in Iowa and have no idea what
the other campaign was doing,'' Keen says. ``Now there's instant
info. There's no excuse for not reporting what the other campaign
is doing. You can't ever relax.''
</P>
<P>
   One method of blocking out work: audio caller ID.
</P>

<P>
   --John Berman, editorial producer, ABC News:
</P>
<P>
   There is one essential piece of techno-fashion in Campaign 2000.
And there is one place to find it: lodged in John Berman's ear.
</P>
<P>
   The toy is a near-invisible headset, which Berman uses to talk
on his cellular phone hands-free for hours each day. It is simply a
wire running from the base of his Nokia 5100 series to his ear _
making him appear, at times, to be talking to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Berman says it has altered his cellular experience
dramatically, especially on the noisy campaign bus, where the
wire's improved sound quality blocks out nearby conversations and
background sound. At the same time, it keeps him from having to
hold the phone up to his head _ a big deal for a producer who goes
through one or two cell phone batteries a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ear would start to hurt, and my arm would start to hurt,
with the amount I was holding it up to my head,'' he said. ``It was
more a medical decision than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   His collection of other electronic devices _ including a
Panasonic Shock Wave Metal CD player, a Kodak zoom digital camera,
and a Palm V _ has a slightly different therapeutic effect. Even
Berman admits his Olympus digital audio recorder is ``just plain
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The slim, palm-sized recorder, which holds up to two hours and
42 minutes of sound, tracks what time each recording was made. On
the campaign trail, that means Berman can keep a perfect record of
each sound-bite. Which in turn means he can explain the gadget to
his bosses as a ``very crucial television device.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Mike Roselli, political producer, CNN:
</P>
<P>
   You'd think the backbreaking luggage would have disappeared from
the campaign trail with the advent of miniature electronic gadgets
_ especially the latest generation of featherweight laptops.
</P>
<P>
   But as Roselli has discovered this year, the ever-shrinking
computer has simply made room for more technical supplies. Even
though his Toshiba Portegelaptop is half the weight of the one he
carried during the Dole campaign in 1996, Roselli's gear bag is
nearly twice as heavy this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Four Nokia phone batteries. A Motorola text pager. A
lithium battery. A Palm Pilot. Double A Batteries. A Motorola
``talk about'' walkie-talkie transmittor.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest drag: Cell phones. Three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Because as technology has improved, expectations have soared.
Now that cell phones are ubiquitous, every reporter demands to be
able to make and receive calls anytime, anywhere. But with cellular
service still wildly unreliable across the country, especially in
the key primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa, a frequent cry on
the campaign bus during rural stops is still: ``You're breaking
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Roselli carries three separate phones (Nokia 5100
series, a StarTac Digital, and an Ericsson), with different service
providers (Bell South and Sprint), to increase his chances of
getting a signal.
</P>
<P>
   Or in case any of his five batteries happen to die.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Carl Cameron, senior political correspondent, Fox News:
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computer size does still matter _ to some reporters,
anyway. One of them is Cameron, a former reporter for WMUR in New
Hampshire who got his first laptop when Ronald Reagan was
president.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he still proudly carries _ sometimes, in the palm
of his hand _ the 1.9-pound Toshiba Libretto 70 he bought two years
ago. Despite its 5-inch monitor, the computer has many features of
a regular laptop, allowing Cameron to write TV scripts on it,
compose e-mail, and send faxes. It also has a 56K cellular modem,
allowing him to log on from anywhere. And in the moments _ rare, of
course _ when he isn't working, Cameron attaches a tiny camera to
the computer and connects with his computer at home for a
teleconference with his young kids.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he would ever use his computer for pure fun. ``Gadgets
are key to hard-hitting, ethical journalism,'' he says.

GETTING IN THE GAME

<P>
   Life wasn't easy for Gary Willoughby those first few days in
Europa. Despite his skills as a Web page designer, the only job he
could find was as a woodcutter. After a week of exhausting labor,
he'd finally chopped enough timber to earn a bit of money. He
trudged back into town with his burden, only to find himself
face-to-face with a homicidal maniac lusting for his blood.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most fun Willoughby had in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time you face a human opponent in a fight is quite
frankly one of the most nerve wracking experiences I have ever
had,'' he recalls in an e-mail message. ``It is so funny and scary,
and downright fun!''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, if he'd been killed, Willoughby would only have to
log off his computer and retire to bed in his London home. His
ghost would patiently haunt Europa, awaiting his return.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really dies in Europa, a land where reincarnation happens
all the time. But while life is eternal, everything else changes.
Residents come and go, houses are built and enlarged as their
owners grow wealthy, murderers slay and are slain, and both
monsters and heroes stride across the land.
</P>
<P>
   It's a magical place, not quite real of course, but real enough
to hold the attention of 175,000 people around the world. Europa is
one of several worlds that these people regularly visit via the
Internet, as participants in a vast electronic society called
Ultima Online.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ultima is a computer game, but in the same sense that
``Star Trek'' is a TV show. ``Star Trek'' transcended the tube to
become a culture all its own. In similar fashion, Ultima began as a
crude desktop amusement, and has spawned a global fantasy culture.
It's a digital realm inhabited round the clock by characters
dreamed up by the players, characters whose lives go on for months
and years, characters who can change and grow, turn good or evil,
become rich or poor, all depending on the whims of their creators
and the luck of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ultima characters needn't be knights in shining armor; many
choose to be laborers, tradesmen, or sages. Some become PKs _
player killers _ and seek to bump each other off. Others have no
interest in harming a soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore off fighting and revenge,'' says Karen Lofstrom, a
52-year-old mother and student in Honolulu. ``I slipped once but
otherwise I've been a good online Buddhist.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that ability to choose the artificial life you desire that
appeals to Michael Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is what you make of it, says Miller, a 35-year-old
civilian network administrator for the Air Force in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``If you are looking for adventure and to see new
places you can. If you want to get a job and make a nice life for
yourself you can. If you want to isolate yourself and drop out of
society you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious players often meet in the real world to chat about their
characters and adventures. Lasting friendships have sprung up among
players, even a few marriages. And because an Ultima Online player
can own and develop land and property in the game world, some
passionate gamers will pay real money for properties, tools, and
weapons to be used in the game. The online auction site eBay
features hundreds of auctions where Ultima Online players buy and
sell items from each other. Once money changes hands in the real
world, the players log on and complete the bargain in the Ultima
universe.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about the basic concept behind Ultima. Its
creator, renowned game designer Richard Garriott, is an old player
of the tabletop fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons, where he earned
the nickname he uses to this day _ Lord British.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the teenage Garriott created one of the first graphic
games for the old Apple II computer. Akalabeth: World of Doom was
laughably crude by modern standards _ ``Graphics in those days were
quite primitive,'' says Garriott, now 38 _ but it did a good job of
creating a simple fantasy universe where a hero could smash into
fortresses, seize treasures, and slaughter monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by the success of Akalabeth, Garriott launched a
series of games titled Ultima, featuring ever-more-demanding and
sophisticated adventures, as computers got more and more powerful.
The trouble was that these games still lacked one of the chief
attractions of tabletop fantasy games _ the ability for multiple
players to easily join the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   It took the development of the Internet to solve the problem.
Garriott realized that it would now be possible to turn Ultima into
a new kind of computer entertainment _ what's known in the industry
as a ``massively multiplayer game,'' in which players from around
the world would compete over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such games have been around even before the Internet became
popular. The software company Kesmai Corp. began sponsoring games
on the CompuServe online service in 1982. These were text-based
adventure games; the crude personal computers of the era would not
alllow for pretty graphics. Instead, the players would type in
simple commands, like ``turn left,'' and the game would describe
the result _ for instance, ``You come face to face with a hideous
demon!''
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, the Apple Macintosh computer had brought major
improvements in computer graphics. Kesmai responded with Air
Warrior, a graphic-based World War II air combat game hosted on the
now-defunct Genie online service. Military buffs found the game
irresistible. Thousands signed on to play, even though online
services charged by the hour in those days. Faithful players might
run up hundreds of dollars in online bills every month, but kept
coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are many such online games, where a player can log
in on the spur of the moment and fight furious land, sea, or air
battles. Many popular games are designed so that the players can
hook up with rivals over the Internet. Most of these services are
provided at no charge, as an extra incentive to buy the game
software. For instance, owners of Microsoft Corp.'s Combat Flight
Simulator who want to slug it out in the skies over Europe during
World War II can log onto the Microsoft Gaming Zone and play all
day for free.
</P>
<P>
   But this sort of game is over as soon as the players log off.
There's no continuity, no sense of being a permanent character
rooted in a permanent world.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Ultima Online is different. Garriott and the team
at his software firm, Austin, Texas-based Origin Systems, wanted to
add something new to the mix-something that game designers call
``persistence.'' They wanted a gaming universe built around an
established society, in which the absence or presence of any one
member would be of little significance. When a player entered this
new world, he'd be like a visitor to a strange country, surrounded
by other players going on about their lives. When he left, the rest
of the world would go on without him. And when the player returned,
everything in his world might have changed, because of the
activities of all the other players.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Origin had finished their first version of such a game,
Ultima Online. ``We thought the total marketplace for this game
would be (5,000) or 10,000 copies,'' said Garriott. At first, he
planned to give away the software disks, and charge only a monthly
subscription fee to play.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was time to test the software, Garriott didn't want
to give away thousands of free test copies. A certain number of
people would try the game, then quit. But that could overload the
crude early server computers of the Ultima network. So Garriott
decided to filter out the unserious gamers by charging for the test
software.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work; 50,000 people asked to buy the unfinished
software. Says Garriott: ``That's when we suddenly realized we had
a real good problem.'' Today, there are 175,000 registered Ultima
Online players, each paying around $20 for the software and $9.95 a
month to live in the Ultima universe.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott last week announced that he was leaving Origin Systems
to pursue other interests. But his fantasy world will survive his
passing, just as it's survived a number of upstart competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Microsoft Corp. signed a contract with Turbine
Entertainment Software Corporation of Westwood to have Turbine
create such a game, titled Asheron's Call. It took the company more
than three years to pull it off. Asheron's Call came to market late
last year. Microsoft has not yet revealed the number of players
who've signed up. But on a typical night, it's easy to find 10,000
players signed on at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Ultima settled for an attractive, but relatively simple
two-dimensional game, while Turbine insisted on creating a game
with the kind of three-dimensional graphics players had grown
accustomed to seeing on popular games like Quake. As a result,
Asheron's Call offers a far richer visual experience than Ultima
Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else is going to be playing catch-up to the
technology we've already developed for the next generation of
games,'' says Toby Ragaini, lead designer of Asheron's Call.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. has done well enough
with its multiplayer adventure game EverQuest to draw the attention
of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. He's chosen the EverQuest
team to create an online game that will allow people to play out
ongoing stories in the ``Star Wars'' universe. That game is set for
release sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   There's virtually no limit to the kinds of worlds that can be
simulated this way. Eventually, we could see games set in
Washington or the Kremlin during the Cold War, or in Chicago during
the era of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   But for players like Gary Willoughby, there's a special appeal
to life in a never-never-land of medieval fantasy. After much toil
and terror, he's found himself a home in Ultima.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have chopped many trees, made many bows, and been killed and
looted a lot, but now I'm much stronger and a better fighter,'' he
writes. ``I find murderers now run away from me. . . . Not to
mention I have met a rather lovely young lady in there too.''

CAN TIGER HIT THE GRAND SLAM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Reality commands your attention, but you can
barely focus as you gaze down the tree-lined fairways of Augusta
National. Surely, the shadows from majestic pines that soar
hundreds of feet toward the heavens block your view.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it something else? The blazing sun that is at work drying
the morning dew? No, something else interferes with your senses.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hits you _ the shadows that block your vision are not
from the trees that are so overwhelming; they belong, instead, to
the spirit of a man who was larger than life and they stretch from
the first tee, around Amen Corner, over Rae's Creek, all the way to
the 18th green of America's most hallowed golf course.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot escape the presence of Robert Tyre Jones Jr. as you
walk upon the pine needles and rich soil of this onetime fruit
nursery. He has been dead nearly 29 years, but he is here and all
that he represented can be felt. The shadows are his, and on the
eve of the 64th Masters, only one living soul has the chance to
step outside them.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   What defined the life of Jones was what the legendary
sportswriter Grantland Rice called ``the impregnable
quadrilateral.'' Poetic license for what is commonly referred to as
the ``Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1930 and Jones, already a national sports hero,
embarked upon 36 holes of golf that would forever solidify his
unquestioned stature as legend. At Merion Golf Club outside of
Philadelphia, Jones defeated Gene Homans, 8 and 7, to win his fifth
US Amateur title and prove that the impossible was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had won the US Open, the British Open, the British
Amateur, and the US Amateur in the same calender year. The world
did not quite stand still, but it stopped long enough for Jones to
take stock of all he had accomplished. There was nothing more he
could do, he concluded, and so that US Amateur _ his 13th major
championship _ was his final encore.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, he left the spotlight to others, but for 70 years, no one
has been quite able to command it as he did. Better golfers have
come and gone, both professional and amateur, but it has always
been accepted as impossible that anyone else could win the
``impregnable quadrilateral'' as Jones did in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods makes us stop and think. Can he, too, prove that the
impossible is possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't place it out of the realm of possibility,'' said
Ben Crenshaw. As a passionate historian, it took a lot to get
Crenshaw to acknowledge even this much. The mere sequence of words
made him shake his head. Never, he said, did he imagine himself
saying such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will not strike his first shot in the season's first major
championship until 10:38 this morning. The mere thought of him
winning all four majors in 2000 before he has won this is beyond
ludicrous. Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put yourself in there enough times,'' said Woods, ``you
never know. I won, what, eight times last year? If I won the right
four of those, I'd be doing all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price pondered the question and stared the stare that pro
golfers stare when the situation is critical. There was a moment of
silence, but he didn't laugh you away. ``That's a tall order. Even
for him.'' In 1994, Price won half a slam (British Open, PGA
Championship), so certainly he would tell you you were thinking the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I would love to see it done, just like everyone else.
I'd like to see it done in my lifetime. He certainly is the person
who could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mere speculation seemed to arouse Price's enthusiasm. The
venues, he thought aloud. Just think about where they are playing
this year's four major championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters? ``He has won at Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Open? ``He has won at Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Open. ``St. Andrews is perfect for him. He's a long
hitter. It's a bomber's and a putter's course, so that's perfect
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship? ``Valhalla?'' and Price scratched his
head. Not much is known about this relatively new course in
Louisville, Ky., except that Mark Brooks captured the PGA there in
1996. ``He's not that long, so who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I tell you, it would be a great thing for golf. And he
could do it. There's no doubt about it. I guarantee you this: In
his life, in his career, he'll come very close to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones's grand slam is not Woods's grand slam. Different era.
Entirely different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was an amateur, thus ineligible for the PGA Championship.
No matter, for in 1920s, the pro golfer took a back seat to the
gentleman amateur. Jones was treated to ticker-tape parades and
Hollywood stardom because of what he accomplished in amateur golf _
his four US Opens and three British Opens a proof that he was
better than his colleagues who played the game for money.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam that remains the ultimate goal for today's
professional golfer is a relatively young experience. It was born
out of Arnold Palmer's quest to challenge himself to the fullest.
Having won the Masters and his only US Open in 1960, Palmer thought
it would make sense to play the British Open. He had never done so
_ very few American golfers did in those days _ and this was
unsettling to Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The British Open is golf's oldest championship, dating back to
Willie Park's victory in 1860. To win that, reasoned Palmer,
irregardless of the puny purse, was a mandatory entry on any great
golfer's resume. Money be damned, he said. This was about honor,
tradition, and accepting the ultimate test.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1960 Palmer ventured to no more appropriate a place than
St. Andrews to set in motion golf folklore. He shot 279 and lost by
one shot to Kel Nagle. His quest for the slam was stopped, but not
before he had framed the route his predecessors would have to
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer remains just one of four players to win the Masters and
the US Open in the same year, though none have ever done the
impossible and won the other half. Ben Hogan came close in 1953,
but this was long before media hype, before the words ``Grand
Slam'' were part of our sports jargon. His only appearance in the
British Open (and a successful one, at that) prohibited Hogan from
playing in the PGA Championship because the events overlapped.
There would be no grand slam for Hogan not out of failure, but out
of effort.
</P>
<P>
   It just wasn't part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But after Palmer threw down the gauntlet in 1960, it was. But
since then, only Jack Nicklaus has won the Masters and US Open. It
was 1972, but Nicklaus, like Palmer, fell short in the British, by
one shot to Lee Trevino at Muirfield. Eerily, the score was the
same as 1960: 278-279.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been others who have won two majors in a
season, but the Masters-US Open quinela hasn't been seen since
Nicklaus 28 years ago. And, as the saying goes, on early evening of
the Masters' final round, only one person has a chance to win that
year's grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That golfer, in 2000, will be Woods. Or so it is assumed. There
are a number of reasons why he is favored, not the least of which
is his course record 270 here three years ago that ignited what has
become known as ``Tigermania.''
</P>
<P>
   Things he has done since then have not diminished its strength.
At 24, he is the world's most dominant sports personality, not just
his sport's best player. He has teed it up in 77 PGA Tour events
and won 18 of them. In his last 17 starts, 10 times he has taken
home the winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   His second major title came at the PGA Championship last August
and helped set off this most incredible roll he's been on, one that
has his left his peers in awe. ``The thing you have to really be
amazed at is that every time he tees it up, everyone expects him to
win,'' said Mark O'Meara. ``But if anyone could win the grand slam,
certainly Tiger Woods has the ability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's phenomenal,'' said Price, one of those who was left to
pick up Woods's divots at the PGA Championship last summer. ``The
guy hits the ball a long way. He hits it straight. He is a wizard
around the greens. I mean, you put all those things together and
throw in the fact he's motivated. He's got big-time fire in his
belly . . . and I think that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers in England aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger manages to win all four (majors), it will mean the
biggest golf betting payout ever for William Hill of up to $10
million,'' said Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for the bookmaker. ``And
the whole industry could be hit for over $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Is winning the grand slam an impossible task? Consider the
numbers out of England, where betting is legal and very much a part
of the sporting culture. Three major bookmakers _ Coral, Ladbrokes,
and William Hill _ have lowered the price to 2-1 to win the
Masters, the shortest price ever.
</P>
<P>
   But more strikingly, they have taken huge bets on Woods winning
all four majors this year. At the start of the year, their odds
were 250-1 (1,000-1 for everyone else), but that has since fallen
to 33-1. 33-1!
</P>
<P>
   It is a ratio that narrow even further if Woods rises to the
occasion this weekend.

   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ His Gallic flair for words did not disappoint.
Jean Van de Velde stood on the knoll above the 18th green at
Augusta National Golf Club, looked out at American golf's holiest
grass, the Frenchman saying, ``For all my life to be here was a
dream; now it's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scot, Paul Lawrie, was a bit more understated with his
words, the British Open champion saying of his first look at
Augusta National, ``Very hilly . . . the second . . . never saw
that hole much on TV . . . the fairway is steep. You know, I've
watched in years gone by on television, you can't understand how
hilly it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, the Spaniard and defending Masters champion,
Jose Maria Olazabal had said Augusta National ``is a true piece of
art. You know, when you have a great painting or whatever, you
don't try to change much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers the world over know Augusta National by images flashed
on TV screens for years and years, but this year, rules changes
have allowed more first-timers than usual to come to the Masters.
And the course they see in real life is virtually identical _
except for a few tweaks and subtle changes here and there _ to the
Augusta National they have seen for years on television.
</P>
<P>
   But the course also is so different. So, so different.
Television, as usual, can mislead.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the course, said Van de Velde, is as advertised.
``It's magical, the landscape is beautiful, the trees are
spectacular and, from that point of view, it is what you have seen
(on TV).'' And Van de Velde is determined to enjoy it all, from
having his 8-year-old daughter be his caddy (with a cut-down bag)
in Wednesday's par-3 tournament to soaking in all of Augusta's
charm.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Frenchman was quick to add, ``What you don't see on TV
is the elevation. How much hilly it is . . . because the TV
flattens out everything it sees. And what you see from the 11th
(tee) on TV, it looks so very, very narrow, but, actually it is
very, very wide. And like the 18th green . . . on TV, it looks very
huge, but actually it's very small.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18th green may not be as small as Van de Velde believes it
is after first glance, but any wayward perceptions are an
indication of what the tournament's first-timers are going through.
Their minds are spinning with the undulations of the greens and how
all shots to the greens must be studied and analyzed and plotted
with an engineer's precision.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet himself could stand on the tee of the tiny 12th hole and
not be torn as much as Lawrie was after his first look down the 155
yards across Rae's Creek to the green. Lawrie had seen on TV Fred
Couples, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo, Olazabal, and golfers one and all
stand on that tee and look up at the trees behind them, peer over
to the trees to their left behind the adjacent 11th green, gaze
even at that temptress of a flag on No. 12, or even glance over to
the trees beyond the 13th tee, just to the right of the 12th green,
hoping to find a clue as to which direction the wind is blowing.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood on that 12th tee for the first time, Lawrie finally
understood the doubts, confusion, and endless reaching into the bag
for another club he had seen time and again on television. Fellow
Scot Colin Montgomerie was his guide, and Montgomerie gave him
various clues to solving the puzzle of wind direction but finally
said, according to Lawrie, ``He said the wind was into us and also
down at 12 . . . it was just incredible. Obviously, it's going to
be great fun there trying to get the wind right.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Van de Velde put it after two practice rounds, ``This is
as tough as it gets in golf. There is no harder than the 12th. You
need to select a shot, know exactly where you want to go. For me, I
decided there are not going to be too many chances (taken) on the
12th. For me, it's going to be over the middle bunker and (into)
the middle of the green. I will let the pin be where it wants to
be. I will go safe. I will select a club, I will pull the trigger,
and I will accept what comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers, one and all, intuitively realized after one go around
Augusta National that all their years of watching telecasts or tape
replays of the Masters golf meant little. They all needed savvy,
wily and wise guides to uncover the nuances.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, that's why I played with Seve (Balesteros) and Jose
(Olazabal),'' said Van de Velde. ``And (Tuesday) I played with
Bernhard Langer. And I ask them all questions, big-time. I'm not
going to go around here and try to invent anything. I'm just trying
to go out there and learn pretty quickly. It's good to learn from
these guys; I've never played here before and they know . . . I
mean, look how many times they have won here.''
</P>
<P>
   An example or two, Jean, of what you asked Ballesteros, Olazabal
and Langer?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the 12th standing on the tee, I wonder which direction
the wind is blowing and do I look at the 11th flag, the 12th flag,
or what is the trick? So they debate, and one says one (thing) and
one says the other. And so I ask, do you play conservatively or
what? But they gave me good tips, particularly Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Geiberger also is a Masters rookie, but Geiberger is no
stranger to Augusta National, having trailed after his father, Al,
several times when the senior Geiberger was a Masters player ``when
I was 10 or 12 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger gave his son a few tips before Brent headed to
Augusta, but, tips and all, the younger Geiberger soon found after
arriving here that there was a great deal more to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger played a practice round with Lee Janzen ``and when
we'd get around the greens, we'd talk about pin placements. Lee
really helped me out there, because that's the hardest part of
being a rookie here,'' said Brent. Putting is first and foremost
the toughest thing out here _ it's just so tough _ and this is a
course you've got to play backwards. First, you've got to think
(during an approach shot) where you want to be putting from. You
never want to be above the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   For Padraig Harrington, Ireland's rookie in the Masters, ``the
last 2 1/2 days have been a cram session. There is so much to
learn. I played a practice round with Bernhard (Langer), and he was
out there on the course taking notes. And he's been coming here 18
years. And I'm trying to learn all I can in 2 1/2 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest shock for Harrington, from the Augusta he has seen
on TV and the Augusta he played this week was the 11th hole. For
years and years, Harrington explained, he could not understand what
he was seeing on TV, that the best golfers in the world almost
always aimed their approach shots to the right edge of the green to
avoid the pond, even if the pin was located on the left part of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfers always see holes protected by water and they're not
afriad to go for the pin,'' said Harrington. ``But now that I am
here, I understand why they would go to the right and not dare the
pin. It's a very difficult shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian amateur Aaron Baddeley also was surprised by the real
Augusta, even though he has played tapes of past Masters
tournaments over and over, ``the first in memory is when Langer
holed that eagle putt in '93 and Jose (Olazabal) in '94. I just
watched the tape until it's nearly worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   But, his first real-life view of the course surprised him, said
Baddeley. After driving up Magnolia Lane, ``you see the trees
overhanging, and you can see the flowers with the Georgia shape and
you're thinking, `I'm at Augusta.' (But) I thought the first hole
was going away from the clubhouse instead of running with it. You
know, you sort of imagine things because you've never seen it
before and you've heard stories. You sort of get a picture in your
head, but it's sort of different.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, even with Baddeley getting tips from fellow Australian
Norman, and even with Lawrie helped by Montgomerie, even with Van
de Velde helped by Ballesteros, Olazabal, and Langer, all will
learn the most important trait of playing Augusta only through
experience, said Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, playing in his
third Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And that one trait?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is patience . . . only now do I know that patience is all
important here.''
</P>
<P>
   And not until Saturday and Sunday will all of the tournament's
rookies understand the magnitude of Augusta National's great
equalizer, its fast, undulating greens. ``Have you ever played in
Australia?'' asked the Van de Velde, saying he is no stranger to
fast greens. ``Greens there are so hard and fast. Like concrete. So
quick. Frightening. So I imagine they are like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience, as Jimenez said. Time. And time will tell these
rookies that no greens are like Augusta's. None.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So you're thinking that these wireless telephones that can get
information from the Internet sound pretty interesting _ but not
necessarily so interesting that you want to shell out an extra $10
a month plus burning up airtime to read stock quotes and news
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, a Seattle company called Xypoint.com last
month began offering a cheap way to get wireless data on your phone
that makes an end-run around the Net portals set up by Bell
Atlantic Mobile, Sprint PCS, and others.
</P>
<P>
   For just the $4 a month or so you would generally spend to get
text messaging capability on your digital cell phone, you can use
the Xypoint system to access much of the information you would pay
more to obtain through a wireless Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Once you have made sure your digital phone
can get text messages (basically setting up and paying for an
e-mail account for the phone), you use your computer to visit
webwirelessnow.com. There, you set up a list of information sources
you want to get on your phone, which requires divulging your name
and e-mail address among other personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the offerings include up to five stock quotes at a
pop, airline flight information, a weather forecast by ZIP code,
lottery results for Powerball and the Big Game, ski conditions, and
a horoscope (for now, you can only get traffic conditions in
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   Xypoint then corresponds each data source to a phone number,
which currently would be a 206 Seattle number. But you only get
billed for one initial call; the rest of the time it's free. The
trick Xypoint has perfected is that when you speed-dial the number
corresponding to, for example, your stock quotes, you only let the
phone ring once and disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Without answering and making you pay for the call, Xypoint uses
caller ID technology to register that it is your phone calling this
specific number, which means you are asking for a portfolio update.
It then shoots back to your phone a digital text message containing
the current price of your five stocks, or the ski report for your
favorite mountain.
</P>
<P>
   While you have to wait for the system to respond, Ken Arneson,
president of Xypoint, said, ``I guarantee it will be two times as
fast as any Wireless Application Protocol phone. It's just two
buttons you have to push'' instead of having to toggle through a
browser on the phone screen to get to what you want.
</P>
<P>
   And, Arneson adds, ``Who wants to pay the 25 or 30 cents a
minute while you have the browser on?'' when for a little upfront
effort you can get the information you want free.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Xypoint is a national leader in providing
services to complete 911 calls for several major carriers,
including GTE Wireless, Vodafone AirTouch, and US Cellular. It is
working to get more sites added to the Net content delivery
service, which would generate new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like the kind of service cell companies spending
millions on wireless Net access would want to kill in the crib. But
Rick Pearl, a spokesman for Sprint PCS's New England operations,
said of Xypoint: ``We don't fear them, and we don't hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   From Sprint's perspective, Xypoint could drive new business for
digital text messaging, enticing people to spend a little more who
otherwise might balk at spending at least $50 a month for a calling
plan that includes wireless Web access, then pay $10 a month more
plus airtime for Web surfing. (Sprint does frequently have
six-months-free promotions for the wireless Web service).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to hate anybody who uses this
service because, obviously, they're using the phone, and that's a
good thing,'' Pearl said. ``If people just want access to a few
limited things, that's fine,'' and could get them hooked and
willing to pay for the full Sprint wireless Web package.
</P>
<P>
   Arneson said he is optimistic other wireless carriers around the
country will see things the same way. ``They can have a little bit
of a huge market with us,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``Spirit of Seattle'' serves as a source of
pride for the tens of thousands of protestors descending upon
Washington this week, but to police officials here it evokes images
of chaos and a breakdown of order.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators stream into this already crowded capital city
to protest everything from free trade with China to global poverty
at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, Washington D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey is determined to
prevent a re-occurrence of the violence that derailed the World
Trade Organization summit in Seattle last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Washington, Ramsey promises, will not turn into another
``Battle in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   He promises that security will be tight throughout the city,
anchored by 1,500 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   They will be working closely with up to 500 additional officers
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Capitol Police,
Park Police and Secret Service, Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest role, and thus the largest burden for containing the
upcoming demonstrations falls to Ramsey's district police. And,
having witnessed the Seattle protests _ shut down the WTO meetings,
tarnish the city's reputation and force the ``retirements'' of its
two top police officials _ district police are confident they can
control what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, local law enforcement intends to back up such tough
talk. (Ramsey himself attended an FBI seminar on lessons learned
from the Seattle protests.) But the anti-globalization protesters
that have been salivating at the prospect of these spring meetings
_ which typically garner no more than two dozen hard-core activists
_ appear equally determined.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of their Seattle success, these protesters have
targeted the IMF and World Bank as institutions they claim serve
corporate ``big business'' interests while impoverishing ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will demonstrate that the IMF and World Bank have not
alleviated global poverty; instead they have exacerbated it,'' said
Kevin Danaher, one of the protest organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want to reduce the role of the IMF and World Bank
in countries' domestic financial affairs. Uniting under an umbrella
organization called Mobilization for Global Justice, the
protesters' stated goal is to ``shut down the spring meetings,
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, protest leaders have vowed to follow a
policy of civil disobedience, including marches and human chains
around the IMF and World Bank buildings _ only two blocks west of
the White House. These tactics were effective in the Seattle
protests, where demonstrators were able to trap finance and trade
ministers in their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ramsey acknowledged that the protesters have a right to
peacefully demonstrate, he emphasized that ``the ministers also
have a right to have their meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the demonstrations will remain peaceful,'' the chief
said, hastening to add that the department has trained extensively
to deal with any outbreaks of violence. For example, officers are
learning riot-control tactics and watching videos of the Seattle
police losing control.
</P>
<P>
   The district police department has made sure its officers will
be well-equipped. If necessary, riot gear, tear gas, gas masks and
rubber bullets will be readily available for officers at the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   While the police department has kept many of its security plans
confidential, Ramsey has made it clear that his officers will not
allow violence or non-compliance with police orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow people to freely roam our streets and engage
in violence,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spokespersons for the Mobilization for Global Justice
have said repeatedly that their demonstrations will remain
peaceful. They admit, however, that it is difficult to control
radical protestors. The instances of rampant violence and vandalism
during the four-day WTO summit, for example, resulted mainly from
radical fringe groups not directly associated with organized
protest demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Seattle drew heavy criticism for not being
prepared for the possibility of violent demonstrations. So much so,
that the city's police chief and his deputy chose to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey does not want that scenario repeated. So his department
began security preparations early, beginning with the chief's
attendance at the FBI seminar on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he learned during the session, Ramsey replied,
``that these groups will resort to acts of violence to achieve
their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The protestors have threatened to block Metro stations and/or
traffic on downtown Washington streets during the spring meetings.
Similar tactics succeeded in shutting down a portion of Seattle
during the WTO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a proactive approach, Ramsey aims to smother any violence
early, before it has the chance to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many of the planned demonstrations will be on
national park grounds under the jurisdiction of the Park Police,
and requiring groups to have permits.
</P>
<P>
   Park Police spokesman Robert McLain said so far, protestors have
obtained permits for official demonstrations on Sun., April 16, in
Lafayette Park and on the Ellipse _ in front of and behind the
White House, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the protests remain peaceful, McLain noted that the
Park Police will allow the demonstrations to proceed. Should
protesters assemble without a permit, however, they would first be
asked to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   If they refuse, McLain added, ``They would be subject to
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramsey said he hopes that no arrests will be necessary,
the protestors ``are the ones responsible for their behavior and
for demonstrating peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he anticipated a Seattle-like shutdown of downtown
Washington, Ramsey replied emphatically, ``Absolutely not.''

   WASHINGTON _ The ``Spirit of Seattle'' serves as a source of
pride for the tens of thousands of protestors descending upon
Washington this week, but to police officials here it evokes images
of chaos and a breakdown of order.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators stream into this already crowded capital city
to protest everything from free trade with China to global poverty
at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, Washington D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey is determined to
prevent a re-occurrence of the violence that derailed the World
Trade Organization summit in Seattle last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Washington, Ramsey promises, will not turn into another
``Battle in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   He promises that security will be tight throughout the city,
anchored by 1,500 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   They will be working closely with up to 500 additional officers
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Capitol Police,
Park Police and Secret Service, Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest role, and thus the largest burden for containing the
upcoming demonstrations falls to Ramsey's district police. And,
having witnessed the Seattle protests _ shut down the WTO meetings,
tarnish the city's reputation and force the ``retirements'' of its
two top police officials _ district police are confident they can
control what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, local law enforcement intends to back up such tough
talk. (Ramsey himself attended an FBI seminar on lessons learned
from the Seattle protests.) But the anti-globalization protesters
that have been salivating at the prospect of these spring meetings
_ which typically garner no more than two dozen hard-core activists
_ appear equally determined.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of their Seattle success, these protesters have
targeted the IMF and World Bank as institutions they claim serve
corporate ``big business'' interests while impoverishing ordinary
citizens.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We will demonstrate that the IMF and World Bank have not

Kevin Danaher, one of the protest organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want to reduce the role of the IMF and World Bank
in countries' domestic financial affairs. Uniting under an umbrella
organization called Mobilization for Global Justice, the
protesters' stated goal is to ``shut down the spring meetings,
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, protest leaders have vowed to follow a
policy of civil disobedience, including marches and human chains
around the IMF and World Bank buildings _ only two blocks west of
the White House. These tactics were effective in the Seattle
protests, where demonstrators were able to trap finance and trade
ministers in their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ramsey acknowledged that the protesters have a right to
peacefully demonstrate, he emphasized that ``the ministers also

</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the demonstrations will remain peaceful,'' the chief
said, hastening to add that the department has trained extensively
to deal with any outbreaks of violence. For example, officers are
learning riot-control tactics and watching videos of the Seattle
police losing control.
</P>
<P>
   The district police department has made sure its officers will
be well-equipped. If necessary, riot gear, tear gas, gas masks and
rubber bullets will be readily available for officers at the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   While the police department has kept many of its security plans
confidential, Ramsey has made it clear that his officers will not
allow violence or non-compliance with police orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow people to freely roam our streets and engage

<P>
   Indeed, spokespersons for the Mobilization for Global Justice

<P>
   For example, many of the planned demonstrations will be on
national park grounds under the jurisdiction of the Park Police,

</P>
<P>
   Park Police spokesman Robert McLain said so far, protestors have
obtained permits for official demonstrations on Sun., April 16, in
Lafayette Park and on the Ellipse _ in front of and behind the
White House, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the protests remain peaceful, McLain noted that the
Park Police will allow the demonstrations to proceed. Should
protesters assemble without a permit, however, they would first be
asked to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   If they refuse, McLain added, ``They would be subject to

GREENS HAVE PLAYERS ON PINS AND NEEDLES

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ A brilliant late afternoon sun was no brighter
than the story Gary Player was telling two acquaintances from Japan
Wednesday on the front lawn of the clubhouse of the Augusta
National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as Player was saying goodbye to them in Japanese, one
piped up, in English, ``The Ginza . . . the putter?''
</P>
<P>
   Player's eyes lit up and he said, ``Yes, yes, yes. The putter I
bought on the Ginza. I just picked it out of a barrel, in 1965. I
just liked the feel of it. I kept that putter for many years. You
know how much I paid for it? Sixty-five dollars. I won the (career)
Grand Slam with it. In 1965, I remember. I won 100 tournaments with
that putter. And I only paid $65 for it. Yes, I remember the
Ginza.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale was so fitting for these hours before the Masters,
because it is a putter _ no one knows whose _ that probably will
decide the 2000 Masters. Some so-called rough (turf no more fierce
than a good New England fairwway) has been added to Augusta
National, changing the look of the course. But it will be the
greens, not rough, that will decide things this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be the pin placements _ many of them diabolical _
that may determine whose putting will rise to the occasion. Augusta
National is not an unusually difficult golf course, but its greens
_ and those pin placements _ are devilish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single pin placement on this golf course is tough,''
said Player. ``But I think the (par-4) 14th, with the pin on the
back right, is very difficult. And 16 (a par 3), when they put the
pin on the back right. Aw, gee, how do you get to that pin on 16?''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, Player naming the 14th, which has a green that
slopes sharply left and the pin placed atop the slope. Player was
alone in naming the 14th, and he scoffed at the notion that
Sunday's traditional pin placement on 16 _ on the left edge of the
green below a plateau and near a pond _ is tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the easiest (pin placement) on 16,'' he said. ``You
can just roll the ball in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard Langer has won two Masters titles and, like Player,
said, ``all the pin placements are tough.'' And, like Player,
Langer said the Sunday pin placement on 16 ``is not that hard,
because you can work the ball in there with the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike Player, Langer said ``(the par-3) fourth is always a
difficult one, and (the par-4) third is very tough. There's not
much green to work with either of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the third and fourth holes are seldom seen on
television, and while the third (par-4, 350 yards) seems
beguilingly easy, its pin placement on Sundays is diabolical, very
close to the front of a very short green that slopes sharply.
Seemingly perfectly hit balls to the pin often roll back off the
front, while shots struck long leave golfers with nasty downhill
putts.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the fourth, a par-3 with a seemingly easy saucer of a
green, is deceptive. On Sundays, the pin is placed on the very
front of the green, just above a bunker, ``and you just cannot go
for that pin,'' said Langer. ``You are happy to leave that hole
with a 3.''
</P>
<P>
   As Langer put it, ``I've had so many things happen to me over
the (18) years with those pin placements. I've had all things
happen to me, good and bad, on all those holes. But if I were to
say one pin placement is most difficult, I'd say, the third hole.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, the ninth hole seems devilishly diabolical on
Sundays, the pin placed near the front center on a thin plateau of
a sharply sloping green. To land pin-high is an artistic feat of
golf, the margin of error is so thin. A shot that lands above the
hole leaves the player with an extremely delicate snake of a putt.
</P>
<P>
   And Greg Norman could quote chapter and verse of what happens
when a seemingly perfect shot to the ninth lands a fraction short.
Norman's six-shot lead beginning the final round in 1996 was
already beginning to dissipate, but his approach to that ninth
green appeared to be perfect, with the pin placed in the front
center. However, Norman's shot was a tad short and his ball rolled
back yards off the green. Norman's bogey led to a collapse of his
body English and his game. By the 11th hole, Nick Faldo had the
lead and, soon later, the title.
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzy Zoeller needed less than a blink to respond ``the 15th''
when asked about his most challenging pin placement. ``Sure, when
they put it on the left side there . . . it's so hard to hit in to
that little neck (of the green) over there.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Zoeller went on, ``probably the 12th, when they put
it in the back right there. They put the pin there, you just get
your par and get the hell out of there fast. No more than a 4, then
get out fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is the 12th hole,'' Seve Ballesteros said. ``On
Sundays, it is to the right on a small green, and it is not safe to
go for that pin. It is just not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th is the middle hole in Amen Corner, a tempting par-3 of
a mere 155 yards, but the green is placed just above Rae's Creek,
and the right part of the green slopes back down to the creek. Gene
Sarazen's double-eagle on the 15th hole in 1935 still may be the
Masters' most memorable shot, but Fred Couples's tee shot toward
that right pin placement on the 12th hole in 1992 is still regarded
as the most otherworldly shot.
</P>
<P>
   When Couples's shot toward the pin fell short, the ball rolling
back to the creek, it seemed certain to follow the path of several
others that day that rolled smartly down into the water. But
Couples's ball somehow stopped inches short of the water, and from
that moment on, destiny ordained Couples for that '92 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much green to work with there on 12 when the pin
is to the right,'' said Langer, as did golfer after golfer. But
Mark O'Meara, who won the tournament two years ago, said it would
be unfair to pick out any one of innumerable difficut pin
placements.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pin placements are challenging, right from the
get-go,'' said O'Meara. ``From the first hole, when the pin is on
the back left, it is very demanding. There're just no easy pin
placements, to be honest with you. They're all difficult. You can
pick (No.) 3, with the pin up front, or (No.) 4, right behind the
bunker, or (No.) 12 _ there're just so many of them that are
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Watson, ``the most challenging pin placement I had was
when I won in '81 and it was on the 17th hole.'' Johnny Miller and
Jack Nicklaus were on Watson's heels on the next-to-last hole, and
the pin on the par-4 hole was on the back right. As Bobby Jones
himself once wrote, ``When the pin is placed to the right, there is
no other option (except to run up the ball) because of a bunker in
the face of the green.'' Watson hit a perfect shot and contends,
``I still say that is the most challenging pin placement I've seen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Player was asked if it was fair, the Devil himself planting the
pins at Augusta, especially on Sundays?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair?'' Player replied. ``Golf isn't supposed to be fair.''

<P>
   When the world's imagination engages with a human tragedy as
poignant as that of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old refugee boy who
survived a shipwreck only to sink deep into the political mire of
Cuban-American Miami, it instinctively seeks to enter into the
hearts and minds of each of the characters in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Any parent can grasp something of what Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, has been going through back in Elian's hometown of
Cardenas _ the pain of losing his firstborn son, a child who
arrived only after seven miscarriages; next, the joy of learning
that Elian had improbably survived, floating toward Florida on a
rubber ring; and then, the seismic shock of being told by a gang of
estranged relatives and total strangers that they were resolved to
stand between him and his child.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we can understand Elian's inside-out state of mind a
little, too. After all, this is a boy who watched his mother slip
into the dark ocean and die. For a long time after that, his father
wasn't by his side. So if Elian now clutches at the hands of those
who have been with him in Miami, if he holds on to them for dear
life the way he clung to that rubber ring, who can blame him? If he
has constructed a kind of provisional happiness in his new Florida
backyard, we should understand that as a psychological survival
mechanism, not as a permanent replacement for his father's love.
</P>
<P>
   And if politicians play politics with a small boy's life, nobody
likes it much, but nobody's very surprised, either. Al Gore weighs
in with a poorly thought-through scheme to turn Elian and his
father into U.S. residents (a scheme which Juan Miguel Gonzalez
instantly rejects), and we know that he's trying _ and almost
certainly failing _ to win a few Cuban Republican votes. The mayor
of Miami-Dade County, Alex Penelas, irresponsibly declares that his
police force will not execute any order to hand Elian back to his
father, and we know that he's playing to his particular gallery,
too. Fidel Castro comes up with a succession of grandstand plays,
turning Elian simultaneously into a symbol of national pride and of
the folly of emigration to the U.S.A., and this, too, comes as no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez has become a political football and _ take the
word of someone who knows what that's like _ the first consequence
of becoming a football is that you cease to be thought of as a
living, feeling human being. A football is inanimate, and its
purpose is to be kicked around. So you become what Elian has become
in the mouths of most of those arguing over him: useful, but
essentially a thing.
</P>
<P>
   You become the proof of the addiction of the United States to
litigation, or of the pride and political muscle of a locally
powerful immigrant community. You become the location of a battle
between mob rule and the rule of law, between rabid anti-Communism
and Third World anti-imperialism. You are described and
redescribed, sloganized and falsified, until, for the howling
combatants, you almost cease to exist. You become a sort of myth,
an empty vessel into which the world can pour its prejudices, its
poison and its hate.
</P>
<P>
   All of the foregoing is more or less comprehensible. But what's
going on in the minds of Elian's Miami relatives - that's a tough
one. This poor boy's flesh-and-blood family has elected to place
its own hard-line ideological considerations over his obvious and
urgent need for his father; which looks, to most of us on the
outside, like an ugly, unnatural choice.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong evidence _ for example, in a powerful New York
Times article written by the great Gabriel Garcia Marquez _ that
Juan Miguel Gonzalez is a loving father; so when the Miami
relatives' lawyers assault his good character, it sounds like a
cheap shot. And while there is also evidence that Juan Miguel is
being used by Castro for political ends, most of us would say, so
what? Even if Senor Gonzalez is a full-fledged Red of the sort most
hated by the Florida Cuban community, this does not override the
rightness of returning his son to his care, and to argue that it
is, well, inhuman. When the Miami relatives hint that Elian will be
``brainwashed'' if he goes home, it only makes us think that they
are even more blinkered than the ideologues they seek to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Marquez concluded his article by deploring ``the harm
being done to Elian Gonzalez's mental health by the cultural
uprooting to which he is being subjected.'' This routinely
anti-U.S. gibe is surely wide of the mark. President Clinton,
Attorney General Janet Reno and the U.S. federal courts have taken
a sensible line throughout the protracted crisis, and American
public opinion has generally backed their view that Elian's place
is with his dad. This compares very favorably with, say, the
actions of the German authorities, who have in a number of
notorious recent cases refused to return children to non-German
parents living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the Elian story is not an American but a Cuban tragedy;
and yes, ``cultural uprooting'' is at its heart, but not in the
sense that Garcia Marquez meant. It is the Miami Cuban community
that has evidently been harmed by being uprooted from its island in
the sun. What began as a flight from bigotry has bred dreadful
bigotries of its own. What began as a flight from tyranny has
ended, or so it now seems, in a flight not only from reason, but
from simple humanity, too.

   And if politicians play politics with a small boy's life, nobody
likes it much, but nobody's very surprised, either. Al Gore weighs
in with a poorly thought-through scheme to turn Elian and his
father into U.S. residents (a scheme which Juan Miguel Gonzalez
instantly rejects), and we know that he's trying _ and almost
certainly failing _ to win a few Cuban Republican votes. The mayor
of Miami-Dade County, Alex Penelas, irresponsibly declares that his
police force will not execute any order to hand Elian back to his
father, and we know that he's playing to his particular gallery,
too. Fidel Castro comes up with a succession of grandstand plays,
turning Elian simultaneously into a symbol of national pride and of
the folly of emigration to the U.S.A., and this, too, comes as no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez has become a political football and _ take the
word of someone who knows what that's like _ the first consequence
of becoming a football is that you cease to be thought of as a
living, feeling human being. A football is inanimate, and its
purpose is to be kicked around. So you become what Elian has become
in the mouths of most of those arguing over him: useful, but
essentially a thing.
</P>
<P>
   You become the proof of the addiction of the United States to
litigation, or of the pride and political muscle of a locally
powerful immigrant community. You become the location of a battle
between mob rule and the rule of law, between rabid anti-Communism
and Third World anti-imperialism. You are described and
redescribed, sloganized and falsified, until, for the howling
combatants, you almost cease to exist. You become a sort of myth,
an empty vessel into which the world can pour its prejudices, its
poison and its hate.
</P>
<P>
   All of the foregoing is more or less comprehensible. But what's
going on in the minds of Elian's Miami relatives - that's a tough
one. This poor boy's flesh-and-blood family has elected to place
its own hard-line ideological considerations over his obvious and
urgent need for his father; which looks, to most of us on the
outside, like an ugly, unnatural choice.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong evidence _ for example, in a powerful New York
Times article written by the great Gabriel Garcia Marquez _ that
Juan Miguel Gonzalez is a loving father; so when the Miami
relatives' lawyers assault his good character, it sounds like a
cheap shot. And while there is also evidence that Juan Miguel is
being used by Castro for political ends, most of us would say, so
what? Even if Senor Gonzalez is a full-fledged Red of the sort most
hated by the Florida Cuban community, this does not override the
rightness of returning his son to his care, and to argue that it
is, well, inhuman. When the Miami relatives hint that Elian will be
``brainwashed'' if he goes home, it only makes us think that they
are even more blinkered than the ideologues they seek to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Marquez concluded his article by deploring ``the harm
being done to Elian Gonzalez's mental health by the cultural
uprooting to which he is being subjected.'' This routinely
anti-U.S. gibe is surely wide of the mark. President Clinton,
Attorney General Janet Reno and the U.S. federal courts have taken
a sensible line throughout the protracted crisis, and American
public opinion has generally backed their view that Elian's place
is with his dad. This compares very favorably with, say, the
actions of the German authorities, who have in a number of
notorious recent cases refused to return children to non-German
parents living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the Elian story is not an American but a Cuban tragedy;
and yes, ``cultural uprooting'' is at its heart, but not in the
sense that Garcia Marquez meant. It is the Miami Cuban community
that has evidently been harmed by being uprooted from its island in
the sun. What began as a flight from bigotry has bred dreadful
bigotries of its own. What began as a flight from tyranny has
ended, or so it now seems, in a flight not only from reason, but
from simple humanity, too.

<P>
   When the world's imagination engages with a human tragedy as
poignant as that of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old refugee boy who
survived a shipwreck only to sink deep into the political mire of
Cuban-American Miami, it instinctively seeks to enter into the
hearts and minds of each of the characters in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Any parent can grasp something of what Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, has been going through back in Elian's hometown of
Cardenas _ the pain of losing his firstborn son, a child who
arrived only after seven miscarriages; next, the joy of learning
that Elian had improbably survived, floating toward Florida on a
rubber ring; and then, the seismic shock of being told by a gang of
estranged relatives and total strangers that they were resolved to
stand between him and his child.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we can understand Elian's inside-out state of mind a
little, too. After all, this is a boy who watched his mother slip
into the dark ocean and die. For a long time after that, his father
wasn't by his side. So if Elian now clutches at the hands of those
who have been with him in Miami, if he holds on to them for dear
life the way he clung to that rubber ring, who can blame him? If he
has constructed a kind of provisional happiness in his new Florida
backyard, we should understand that as a psychological survival
mechanism, not as a permanent replacement for his father's love.
</P>
<P>
   And if politicians play politics with a small boy's life, nobody
likes it much, but nobody's very surprised, either. Al Gore weighs
in with a poorly thought-through scheme to turn Elian and his
father into U.S. residents (a scheme which Juan Miguel Gonzalez
instantly rejects), and we know that he's trying _ and almost

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: CASTRO AND THE CHILD SAVIOUR
 &HT;    Eds: This column, normally for Sunday release, may be used
immediately.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Neither Fidel Castro nor Janet Reno were actors in
the most striking spectacle yet to occur in Elian Gonzalez drama.
</P>
<P>
   That scene was played out when Augustin Roman, Miami's auxiliary
Catholic Bishop and a Cuban exile, led a street mass at a city
intersection to create a giant human cross. The bishop read from
the Holy Scriptures, citing the story of Herod to compare Elian,
then splashing away in a backyard pool, to the Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   God knows politics plays a robust role in this struggle _ one
that by all rights should focus on family values. But a potent brew
of religious mysticism is also at work here, wafting even through
the quiet Washington suburb where the father of the Cuban castaway
went to be reunited with his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where Elian's Cuban immigrant relatives have fought a
rear-guard custody battle to keep the boy from ever being hugged by
Castro, those religious factors must be weighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray for Elian,'' read the signs under a giant mural depicting
the boy as the new Messiah, bearing the prophesy of Castro's
impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the open hands of God, the protective gaze of the Virgin
Mary and splashing dolphins, Elian rides happily in a rubber tube,
hands outstretched to the Promised Land, represented by the Statue
of Liberty. In the twin scales of justice sit the busts of
President Clinton and Pope John II, who looks away from they boy's
serene visage.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Florida Straits, the pope has been assailed
for keeping his silence. But a satiric essay in the counter-culture
Miami New Times, which argues that the Cuban exile community would
rather see Elian dead than red, reflects the real passions
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives fostered the notion of a child Saviour,
rescued on Thanksgiving Day. (The boy believes dolphins circled him
to keep him safe after his mother, her boyfriend and nine others
drowned.)
</P>
<P>
   These hero-caretakers to the nearly 1 million Miami Cubans
exiled from Castro's domain cite the apparition of the Virgin, who
they say came to their modest home to offer comfort in the form of
a smudge on a mirror in Elian's bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuban-Americans see Elian as possessing supernatural
qualities, a lad saved from the sea by divine intervention. It was
a miracle, they say, that he was found unharmed and suffering no
sunburn, although he had been floating in shark-infested waters
under a blistering sun for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Others liken the rescue to the tale of the three drowning
fishermen saved by La Ermita de la Caridad, Our Lady of Charity,
and the patron saint of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of Santeria, an Afro-Cuban mix of Catholicism and
pagan ritual, see Elian as Eleggua, the messenger of the gods, who
escaped the heavens in a rebellion against the old order. The chief
of the gods, Obbatala (i.e. Castro), must now bring him back under
his control to retain his power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no small matter that Castro, an atheist who last year
warmly welcomed a papal visit, remains acutely aware of the power
of a child Saviour on his impoverished island. That's one key
reason why he wants him back.

 FAMILY IS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR MORALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: Where do people who are not religious in any way
get their morals? Where should people get their morals? Do morals
change with time or are they written in stone? _ D.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I think most of us _ even before we were aware of being
religious or not _ got our sense of right and wrong from our
parents. They are our first source of moral behavior and moral
limits. A parent tells us that a behavior is acceptable or
unacceptable. This may be why some people are lamenting a perceived
lack of morals in our society, which they attribute to families not
spending enough time together to transmit this type of information.
</P>
<P>
   A strong religious belief can be a traditional source for morals
_ although some horrible acts have been committed in the name of
religion. For many people, however, a moral sense starts much
earlier and closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: This is the situation my friends are in: Steve,
41, and Patty, 36, are married. They have a mutual friend named
Scott, who is 22. My wife, Steve, Patty and Scott all work
together. Patty and Scott work beside each other, often go for
lunch together and spend a lot of time together on weekends. Scott
will often go over to Steve and Patty's house.
</P>
<P>
   Steve recently confronted Scott and asked him to lay off. Scott
then told Patty about the conversation. Patty seems to feel that as
long nothing is going on that the relationship is fine, and she
gets upset at Steve. Steve called my wife in confidence to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   We both feel that nothing is going on between Patty and Scott,
but I can see that the situation is very stressful for Steve. I
don't think we can do anything, but what should Steve do? _ F.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I think you're probably right. Nothing is going on
between Patty and Scott, but it sounds as if Steve is feeling like
the odd-man out.

   Patty is being flattered by a young man's attention. I would
quietly suggest to Patty that most of her emotional eggs are in
Steve's (not Scott's) basket, so she should spend more time making
her husband feel like he's special. She should ask herself how she
would feel if the roles were reversed and some cutie from work were
spending a lot of time with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think anything is going on but it's time for Patty to
make her husband feel more important. You're right, the guy should
cool it for a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I have been married for six years, and my husband
and I dated for two years prior to marriage. We are best friends.
He is the most dependable person that I know. Problem: lack of
passion in our relationship.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoy sex, but it is always the same way _ no variety or
passion. I am experiencing some unspoken sexual tension with a
co-worker. Nothing untoward has happened, but I am thinking about
it constantly. Any suggestions? I want to be dedicated to my
husband but worry for my future happiness. _ L.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The ice that you're skating on is so thin that I can
hear it breaking up at this very moment. You stay away from that
co-worker!
</P>
<P>
   If your sex life isn't interesting, do something about making it
more interesting. Go get a book, take a course, but don't you dare
start using up your sexual energy on a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   You're telling me that this is a great guy, someone you really
trust and love. Don't even think about jeopardizing that
relationship. The same things that make you attracted to this guy
may be part of the problem. You may feel very comfortable with your
husband and not put as much sexual energy into your marriage as you
should.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a store and buy ``The Joy of Sex'' or anything else that
you think might jazz up your sex life at home. Take responsibility.
Stay away from that co-worker and get a lot closer to your husband.
</P>

   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

FORMER PREMIER OF PAKISTAN IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pakistan's former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who was deposed
by a military coup six months ago, was sentenced Thursday to life
in prison after he was convicted of terrorism and hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who was put on trial in a special anti-terrorism court
by the coup's leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was found guilty of
trying to stop a commercial airliner carrying Musharraf from
landing in Karachi Oct. 12, when the coup took place, thereby
endangering the lives of everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer any justice in Pakistan,'' Sharif said
after the verdict was announced, The Associated Press reported.
``Now my case rests with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, and his other supporters in the
courtroom vociferously protested the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a personal vendetta against my innocent husband, who has
not committed any crime,'' Nawaz was quoted as saying by Agence
France-Presse. ``A lion cannot be caged.''
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister was spared the death penalty usually
imposed in hijacking cases when the judge, Rehmat Hussein Jafri,
sentenced Sharif to two life terms in prison instead. Jafri also
declared Sharif's property forfeited and ordered him to pay a fine
equivalent to about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Jafri found Sharif not guilty of charges of kidnapping and
attempted murder. Six other defendants _ including Sharif's
brother, Shahbaz _ were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants asserted their innocence throughout the trial,
saying that it was being staged to give a veneer of legitimacy to
the coup's victors.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's lawyers said they would appeal both the verdict and his
sentence. The prosecutors said they would appeal his acquittal on
the kidnapping and attempted murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The overthrow of Sharif's democratically elected government and
his subsequent trial had triggered protests around the world, with
President Clinton nearly bypassing Pakistan during his tour of the
region last month. Clinton did make a one-day visit and appealed
for clemency for Sharif, which may have spared him from going to
the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, expressed
concern about how Sharif's trial was conducted, noting that judges
had been forced to take an oath of allegiance to the military
rulers and that Pakistan's anti-terrorism laws had been changed to
include hijacking after the event took place.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharif set up the special anti-terrorism courts last year to
combat rising crime and terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf contended that as prime minister, Sharif ordered that
the airliner carrying the general back from Sri Lanka be denied the
right to land in Karachi, thereby creating ``terror and
insecurity'' among the 198 passengers and crew members. The former
director of Pakistan's civil aviation authority, Aminullah
Chaudhry, testified for the prosecution in return for not standing
trial with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had dismissed Musharraf as the army's chief of staff, but
the general later landed in Karachi after his troops took over the
airport. He made himself Pakistan's new leader, suspended its
constitution and detained the former prime minister.

   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

<P>
   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

<P>
   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.

&HT;     CULTURAL LESSON FROM THE ELIAN DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Elian Gonzalez drama being played out in
south Florida has lessons for all Americans in an era of heightened
multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles who want young Elian kept in Miami in defiance of
the U.S. government are showing their true loyalties. Even though
some have lived in the United States for 40 years, they still
consider themselves Cubans, not Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bragg, a reporter for the New York Times, wrote, ``The
truth is, said many Cuban-Americans, they do not mind if they are
seen as a separate country. Not only do they not want to be part of
middle America, they do not care very much what middle America
thinks of them.''
</P>
<P>
   These exiles are obsessed with hatred of Fidel Castro, the
communist leader whose revolution in the late 1950s precipitated
the exodus of thousands of Cubans to south Florida. Many have
become American citizens and have exercised their right to vote.
Most are Republicans. The GOP is perceived to be more
anti-communist than the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, however, they are Cuban to the core. Older
Cuban exiles especially await the day when Castro is cast aside so
they can return to their homeland, presumably to reinstall their
brand of exploitative capitalism that was wiped out by the Castro
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile community of south Florida isn't a singular
American phenomenon. Other American ethnic groups harbor similar
feelings about their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vietnamese-Americans, for instance, become apoplectic at
the very sight of communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh on a
poster or in artwork. Mirroring the Cuban exiles, rabidly
anti-communist Vietnamese-Americans are absolutely intolerant of
political views that do not square with their own.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the diverse Chinese-American community are more driven
by homeland politics and issues than by concerns rooted in America.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans may view these exile enclaves as examples of
multiculturalism run amok in a society that once looked on itself
as one big happy family, reflecting western European political,
economic, cultural and religious values. This despite the fact that
it had a significant African-American minority and a smaller
amalgam of other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last third of the 20th century, a revolution of sorts
has been taking place in America. Oppressed minority groups have
begun to assert themselves, demanding equal opportunities and equal
access to power. They have used both legal and extra-legal means to
achieve their social-justice goals.
</P>
<P>
   This quasi-American revolution has shaken up Americans who were
content with the 1950s-style status quo. These Americans have
lamented the ``loss'' of a common culture and voiced their
displeasure in many different ways at the increasing colorization
of America, with ethnic groups everywhere demanding this or that.
</P>
<P>
   Even some minority-group Americans, benefiting from civil rights
gains, have joined in the backlash against the idea of a kinder,
gentler multicultural America.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian case certainly can reinforce the paranoia felt by some
Americans about an impending divisive Balkanization of what was
once thought to be a pristine commonweal stitched together by
democratic principles, free-enterprise economics and
Judeo-Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   That danger exists. But there are distinctions to be made. By
definition, exiles harbor emotional feelings about their root
countries that for many tend to supersede all other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the burgeoning multiculturalism America is
experiencing comes from either homegrown sources
(African-Americans, American Indians) or from immigrants who have
chosen to become part of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently some Cuban exiles have not. Other immigrants are
better representatives of those newcomers who want to add their
values to making this society, not their homelands, stronger and
better.

   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ First, we have www.tigerwoodsisgod.com. Now, Gary
Player has nominated the golfing superstar for president.
</P>
<P>
   Player, addressing a crowd of about 450 on hand for the annual
golf writers' dinner Wednesday night, got up to introduce Lee Elder
and ended up making a rambling political statement that touched on
everything from apartheid in his native South Africa to golf
etiquette to, yes, Tiger for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had Ronald Reagan, an actor, and I think this man could be
president someday if he wants to be,'' Player said, figuring Woods
has the popularity, money and Stanford education. ``And it's a lot
easier than playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who had already been to the podium to accept his player
of the year award, neither accepted nor declined the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He did join in the standing ovations for Elder.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia was a budding amateur only a year ago, and already
he's a struggling pro. He missed the cut at the Players
Championship and Phoenix Open and wasn't in contention in his three
other PGA Tour events this year; he hasn't won in Europe either.
</P>
<P>
   What's a young man to do? Change caddies, of course. Fanny
Sunesson, who left Nick Faldo because he wasn't supporting her well
enough in recent years, is gone and South African Glenn Murray,
formerly Retief Goosen's porter, is in her place.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 20, was diplomatic about the change on Wednesday, saying
that he and Sunesson were having problems matching clubs to
yardages. Just after the Ryder Cup, he fired caddie Jerry
Higginbotham, who in turn had replaced Garcia's Spanish caddie a
few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia says he hopes Murray is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great caddie, but he's also very funny and he makes me
laugh a lot,'' Garcia said. ``I don't usually pick caddies for one
week.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay III is here hoping to make a cut for the first time
since his week in jail on drunken driving charges. He is looking
much more svelte than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't weigh myself, so I'm not sure how much I lost, but I
go by how my fat pants fit,'' he said. ``It's when I have to lay on
the bed to put my pants on that I know I'm in trouble. These are my
normal pants, and they have a lot more room than they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay played a practice round with green jacket holders Woods
and Mark O'Meara and thought he might be able to make a splashy
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Not splashy as in Rae's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to play well,'' he said. ``I like the
course, I'm hitting the ball pretty well, so we'll just see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry defeated Jay Haas, Jerry Pate and Hunter Haas on the
first playoff hole to win the 41st Par 3 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Perry rolled in a birdie putt for the victory after the four
golfers finished at 4-under 23 in the nine-hole event, played on
the eve of the Masters' opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Begay had the only hole-in-one of the day, sinking his shot at
No. 9. There have been 41 holes-in-one since the Par 3 tournament
began in 1960 on a picturesque course adjacent to the 18-hole
layout.

LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM COUNTRY MUSIC  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you like to listen to loud music in your car, you may want to
avoid the town of Alexandria, La.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you like country music. I mean, really like it.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Associated Press story, Henry Nelson, 20, and
Jon Driggers, 26, pleaded guilty to violating Rapides Parish's
ordinance prohibiting ``loud and offensive noise'' after cranking
up the volume too high on their car stereo.
</P>
<P>
   They were fined, given a suspended jail sentence and probation,
and ordered to attend a ``music appreciation'' session where they
would spend three hours listening to their least-favorite kind of
music _ country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if they had to listen to stuff they hate, it would
teach them to respect other people's rights,'' state District Judge
Tom Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a 14-year-old in the house, I know something about loud
and offensive noises. I think the dulcet strains of Dysfunction and
Anthrax wafting from his bedroom window could explain why I can't
get any grass to grow in that part of the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I am not sure that making him listen to three hours of
country songs like ``I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go
Bowling'' or ``You Broke My Denture Slap in Two'' would do anything
to improve his taste in music, let alone the condition of my lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the judge's thinking is that the two young men will
emerge from their music appreciation session so broken and
despondent that they will never want to listen to any music ever
again, let alone groups like Korn and Anti-Flag, which, if played
at a high enough volume, may cause cancer in laboratory rats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is supposed to be a civilized country, which makes
me wonder if it might not be cruel and unusual punishment to force
these young men to listen to ``Does The Spearmint Lose its Flavor
on the Bed Post Overnight?,'' ``A Woman Is Just a Woman but a Cigar
Is a Good Smoke'' and ``How Can I Miss You if You Won't Go Away?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the judge is of the opinion that there are lessons in
morality in country songs, raising the possibility that the young
men will listen to ``I'm My Own Grandpa,'' ``She Feels Like a New
Man Tonight'' and the classic, ``My Uncle Used to Love Me but She
Died.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that the judge is not so much concerned with
the volume of modern music as its satanic undertones. In that case,
he may choose country songs with a more spiritual side to them like
``Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show?,'' ``Thank God
and Greyhound She's Gone'' and ``I've Been Roped and Throwed by
Jesus in The Holy Ghost Corral.''
</P>
<P>
   Family values are big these days, and country songs contain
plenty of them, such as ``You're The Reason Our Kids Are So Ugly''
or ``Baby's Got a Mustache.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people always need to be reminded of the dangers of
substance abuse, which is why the judge may have chosen such
country hits as ``You Won't Be Back But George and Jack Will Help
Me Make It Through The Night,'' ``She's Actin' Single, I'm Drinkin'
Doubles'' and the unforgettable ``The Pint of No Return.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that young men will be very angry after enduring their
three-hour ``music appreciation'' session.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Judge Yeager may want to play one last song
for them as they head out of town:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's A Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares.''

&HT;     TIGER'S LASTING GIFT TO GOLF 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has a deep, dark secret that could ruin everything.
</P>
<P>
   There.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have your undivided attention, let us turn to more
mundane matters.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has accomplished a lot of things. He became a millionaire
more than 50 times over before he took his first professional
swing. Lapped the Masters by 12 shots at age 21. Won six
tournaments in row from the end of 1999 to the beginning of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More amazingly, Woods made golf cool to the masses. Ponder the
magnitude of that.
</P>
<P>
   Before Woods came along, the general sporting public considered
golfers about as manly as Richard Simmons, quiche and knowing all
the numbers in ``Cats'' by heart. Though the PGA Tour had the good
sense to outlaw too-short shorts, some of the polyester pastel
ensembles that made the rounds weren't much of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in golf is so high these days, PGA Tour events
regularly clobber the NBA in the television ratings. People of all
ages, races, sexes and faiths are discovering the wonders of a good
walk spoiled. Don't believe what you may have heard about stuffy
country clubs. Golf is the most inclusive of sports. Sooner than
later, it brings everybody who plays to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about this boom in interest is all the new fans.
They bring energy and enthusiasm to a sport steeped in tradition
and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about this boom in interest is all the new fans.
They bring energy and enthusiasm and a glaring lack of knowledge
and appreciation of the sport's tradition and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   The only gentlemanly thing to do is embrace these newcomers.
Well, not actually embrace them, because that would make everybody
either uncomfortable or too comfortable, but give them a nice firm
handshake. Make them feel welcome. Patiently teach them about some
of the finer points of golf.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secrets to a happy golfing existence is finding the
right place to play. There are so many courses out there, public
and private alike. Well, what's a new golfing consumer to do? How's
he supposed to know if he's in a suitable environment to fully
enjoy the golfing experience? Here are some tell-tale signs that
the course you're frequenting does not promote the splendor of
golf:
</P>
<P>
   _ There are metal detectors on every hole.
</P>
<P>
   _ The driving range is located between the barn and the
outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   _ The signature hole is the 19th hole.
</P>
<P>
   _ The beverage-cart girl has a five o'clock shadow and a bulging
Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your backswing constantly gets interrupted by mooing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The foursome on the first tee is wearing blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The foursome on deck on the first tee is wearing tank tops and
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   _ The foursome on the 18th green is wearing no pants.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sand traps come equipped with anti-venom kits instead of
rakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The layout has so many doglegs, the snack bar serves
Vietnamese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greens fees are double on days when the greens are actually
green.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tournaments with shotgun starts inevitably result in standoffs
that require police intervention.
</P>
<P>
   _ The water hazards double as restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Before
a novice gets caught up in shopping for the right course to play,
it's crucial to get the proper instruction. The golf swing is about
as natural as hopping on one foot while yodeling the words to
``Stairway to Heaven.'' Jack Nicklaus likes to start every year
with a lesson to tune up his swing. If Nicklaus needs lessons, then
you need lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But where do you go? Whom do you trust? The wrong instructor can
do more damage than a 1-iron on a water hole. Take heed of these
signs that your swing doctor is a quack:
</P>
<P>
   _ The instructor's nickname is Mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you ask about his/her greatest success story as an
instructor, he/she brags about all the work with Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you ask for a suggestion of a helpful instructional
video, he/she tells you to rent ``Caddyshack.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When you ask for a suggestion of a helpful instructional book,
he/she tells you to buy ``The Joy of Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The first time you take a practice swing in his/her presence,
he/she begins laughing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you ask for a helpful swing thought, he/she suggests the
Tarzan yell.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've found an instructor and a place to play, you need to
know how to act. This goes for spectators as well as players. The
golf establishment frowns on rainbow wigs and shouts of ``It's in
the hole!'' the instant the ball leaves the clubface on the tee
shot of a par-5. Golf is a civilized sport _ so aboveboard, players
are expected to call infractions on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Imagine Kurt Warner insisting the officials
take away a touchdown because he knows for a fact that one of his
linemen was holding. Imagine Patrick Ewing instructing the refs
blow the whistle on his game-winning shot because he got open with
a travel move. On the PGA Tour, players regularly penalize or
disqualify themselves for the most seemingly harmless
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   So please, be considerate of the players around you.
</P>
<P>
   Never, ever cough in the middle of someone's backswing _ unless
you're in America, and it's the Ryder Cup, and one of the Europeans
is hitting an approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   Never, ever make flatulent noises while somebody is standing
over a putt _ unless you have money at stake, and you're trailing
in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Never, ever walk in somebody's putting line _ unless that
somebody made flatulent noises when you stood over your last putt.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Tiger, a lot more people have begun to appreciate the
wonders of golf. As a show of appreciation, any deep, dark secrets
will remain secrets. Still, there are times _ sometimes 100 or more
in one round _ golf truly feels like a good walk spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart. Take heed: A bad day at most golf courses is still
better than a good day at the office. Just beware of courses with
metal detectors. Steer clear of places where shotgun starts have
been known to lead to shotgun finishes.

DALLAS FACES DEEPENING WATER CRISIS BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION OF
LAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY DOCLAR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ City officials, facing the worst water crisis in 50
years, are preparing to impose tougher use restrictions, build two
pipelines and possibly take legal action in response to a gasoline
spill that contaminated a major source of water.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions come despite assurances from Explorer Pipeline Co.
of Tulsa, Okla., the company that owns the ruptured pipeline, and
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission that the water
from Lake Tawakoni can be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   Gas from a 500,000-gallon spill near Greenville on March 9 was
carried downstream to Lake Tawakoni, prompting city officials to
stop using the lake, which provides nearly a third of Dallas'
water. Dallas, in turn, sells water to 21 customers, including
Grand Prairie and Irving.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stop using the lake came after laboratory tests
found that the water contained the gasoline additive known as MTBE,
or methyl tertiary-butyl ether, which is used to reduce air
pollution but is also believed to be a carcinogen that can cause
kidney and liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious situation,'' Water Utilities Director
Terrace Stewart told the City Council during a briefing on
Wednesday. ``Our effort and hope is to continue to provide
high-quality drinking water to the citizens of Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Explorer officials said the city is overreacting. Scott Van
Dyke, the company's president and chief executive officer, said the
MTBE levels in the lake meet safety standards set by the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission, or TNRCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTBE levels are well below the standard set by the TNRCC,
so we're confused by Dallas water utilities' recommendation because
other communities over there are using that water,'' Van Dyke said.
``We don't understand why Dallas seems to be setting a different
standard than the TNRCC.''
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC toxicologist Michael Honeycutt said that the most recent
sample from Lake Tawakoni shows MTBE levels of 2 parts per billion.
The TNRCC said that any level below 240 parts per billion is safe
but that the agency advocates a level of 15 parts per billion
because higher concentrations cause taste and odor problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water's fine,'' Honeycutt said. ``I can't tell you what's
going to happen if it rains next week. I don't think anybody can.
It's just a real sticky situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart said that any MTBE level above .67 parts per
billion, the level at which the additive is detectable, is
unacceptable. He said that he could taste the turpentine-like
additive at 5 parts per billion. He also said that he is concerned
that high levels of MTBE in adjacent soil could leak into the lake
when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the same quality water we had before,'' Stewart said.
``Until we get there, I'm sorry, but I'm not using the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's not known when the water can be used again, Stewart
recommended that the council approve tougher water restrictions.
For residential users, that means limiting landscape watering to
once every five days, prohibiting runoff from landscapes and
banning hosing of paved areas. The restrictions, which will be
voted on at Wednesday's council meeting, go into effect May 1 and
carry a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions will extend to cities that buy water from
Dallas, including Grand Prairie, which gets 90 percent of its water
from Dallas and a third from Lake Tawakoni. At Tuesday's City
Council meeting in Grand Prairie, members were briefed on the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also proposed that the city begin design and
construction of a $12 million pipeline that would bring additional
water from Lake Ray Hubbard to supplement the city's supply. A
second recommendation is to expedite construction of a previously
planned $180 million pipeline that would provide water from the
Lake Fork reservoir, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Ray Hubbard line could be built by July 1, Stewart
said. However, he said that lake could be depleted in 18 to 24
months if Lake Tawakoni remains out of use and drought conditions
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really in a pretty critical position here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members expressed frustration with the
situation, demanding that Explorer Pipeline pay for all of the
city's costs related to the spill. In addition to the upcoming
pipeline costs, the city has spent $410,000 on environmental and
contamination consultants, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Miller, who criticized Explorer's response as
``inadequate,'' said she is ready to file a lawsuit if the company
balks at paying for costs related to the gas spill.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is owned by a consortium of oil companies
including Conoco, Chevron, Citco and Texaco, should have plenty of
funds to pay what is expected to be an expensive bill, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I for one am publicly wanting to sue them quickly if they
don't pay for this,'' Miller said. ``Why should we have the
taxpayers paying for industry's egregious mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Ted Benavides said the city has told the company
that it expects to be compensated for all costs related to the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Dyke said his company has no intention of paying for
pipelines that it believes are unnecessary, even if the city files
a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their prerogative,'' he said, adding that some cities
affected by the spill have commended his company's effort to
rectify the problem. ``We're getting high praise for what we're
trying to do over there. I can't stop a lawsuit.''

US LEGAL VETERAN BECOMES A KEY TO CUBAN BOY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He is cast alternately as an unfit father and as
the other helpless victim, as he is shown, eyes swelling with
tears, on Cuban television considering the long separation from his
six-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   But if Juan Miguel Gonzalez wins the battle over Elian, it may
have less to do with his image or emotions than with his powerful
Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, known here as the ``quarterback'' for
President Clinton's impeachment legal team and a longtime adviser
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has taken on the father's case. And
the effects of his $400- to $500-an-hour talent are being felt.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's associates say his involvement has nothing to do with
his close ties to the Clinton White House, which has advocated
reuniting Elian with his father. Craig has said he is involved
because he has a six-year-old son of his own. But his entry onto
the scene underscores how tightly intertwined politics, law and
personal diplomacy have become _ even by Washington standards _ in
this highly unusual case.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 55, for example, was once director of policy planning at
the State Department, the agency that issued a visa to Gonzalez. He
spent time as a foreign policy adviser on Capitol Hill, where
legislators are considering a bill to let Gonzalez stay.
</P>
<P>
   He seeems to have the skills of a Washington insider. He
attended Yale Law School with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and
cultivated strong ties with Kennedy. (All advocate returning Elian
to Cuba).
</P>
<P>
   And he is no stranger to controversy; long before representing
Clinton in the US Senate trial, Craig helped to defend John
Hinckley, the attempted Reagan assassin, and guided Kennedy through
his nephew's Palm Beach rape trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have someone who had access to the courts and was
well-connected,'' said Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, formerly of
the National Council of Churches, who travelled to Cuba to
introduce Craig to Gonzalez last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father's wishes were taken much more seriously when he
came on board,'' Campbell said of Craig. ``He can speak to lawyers
at INS and at Justice. These are not conversations we were able to
have before. He's had direct access which no one ever had before.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the change has been in simply gaining respect for
Gonzalez _ and access to the Miami relatives of Elian, who had kept
the boy's Cuban family at arm's length, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, at a news conference outside his office last week,
blasted Elian's Miami guardians for giving the media wide-ranging
access to the boy. He said they had decided to ``parade Elian in
front of demonstrators,'' and added that one point was not
negotiable: ``Elian's best interests lie with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Craig is, in fact, a negotiator. At once
charming and self-deprecating, he is noted for trying to keep his
opponent talking: In this case, Kendall Coffey, the lawyer for the
sometimes-hostile Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   And while participants declined to specify details, they said
Craig, in general, has brought the Cuban father's perspective more
fully into the national spotlight since coming on board.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harvard senior in 1967, while other students protested in
the streets, Craig chaired a meeting between more moderate college
Vietnam war protesters and US Secretary of State Dean Rusk. It was
an off-the-record gathering, but afterward, Craig went public with
his disappointment, writing an editorial in the Harvard Alumni
Bulletin that described the students' reactions to Rusk's opinions
thus: ``quite literally stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later, when he was brought in to head
Clinton's impeachment team, Craig found himself once again a voice
of moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with two sets of Clinton advisers, the lawyers who wanted
to keep revelations under wraps, and the political strategists who
saw the value of releasing damaging information fully and fast,
Craig pressed for a certain degree of information to be released in
the interest of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   But ``he really understood that there were different interests
that had to be reconciled,'' said the former White House press
secretary, Michael D. McCurry. Craig wasn't just concerned with
legal issues, he said. ``I always felt he was someone I could talk
to who wouldn't take a real hard line and say, `We can't do X, Y
and Z in the public arena,' '' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, who has
been friends with Craig since his Harvard days, agreed: ``He pulled
the administration's position into a clear, strategic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Craig, reporters ``didn't write any stories about how
they were going off in different ways, or about differences among
his advisers, which was really unusual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of foreign policy, Craig's dealings have not always
won such unmitigated praise. As a foreign policy adviser to Kennedy
in the 1980s, he pressed for sanctions against apartheid-controlled
South Africa _ and did, Kennedy now says, a ``brilliant job.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in private practice, however, Craig represented a Haitian
family with close ties to coup leaders in Haiti. In fighting to
lift sanctions on their behalf, Craig prompted criticism from some
former allies who believed he was tarnishing his idealistic image.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department aide said in his defense: ``Lawyers defend a
lot of people and have a lot of clients.'' But the official added
that in the case of Elian, ``it is natural for him to be on this
side _ more so than representing members of the Haitian elite
class.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, of course, being paid to help Gonzalez. Although Craig
has reduced his fees, the group that is paying them, the General
Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, says it
is raising up to $100,000 for Craig's services. Neither the Cuban
government nor Gonzalez himself is helping foot the bill, said the
group's general secretary, Thom Whitewolf Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   Craig has a fellow Democrat to thank for having landed the case:
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who called Campbell to suggest
she hire Craig to help Gonzalez. Craig has deep family roots in
Vermont, where his father attended college and ran for governor as
a Republican in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell believes that what drew Craig to the case was much
more personal. A father of five, Craig talked more than anything
about his own children during his visit with Gonzalez in Havana
last month, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't come to this intellectually. He comes to this as
the father of a six-year-old, and he said quite clearly, `I don't
know how I would function if someone took him away from me,' '' she
said. ``He knows a lot of people. He's very well-connected in a lot
of agencies. But he makes no bones about the fact that he thinks
the father is a good father. That's what his representation is
about.''

TIME TO BRUSH UP ON THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bad enough that I don't have a computer science degree; now
I'm starting to wish I'd gone to law school. Some of the most
interesting computing developments of recent months have more to do
with torts than with tech. It's not just antitrust law either; many
of the legal disputes involve questions of free-speech rights and
the limits of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Cyber Patrol case, for instance. Microsystems
Software of Framingham, Mass. makes Cyber Patrol, a program that
blocks out Internet sites that some people might find offensive.
Well, there are others who find the very existence of Cyber Patrol
offensive _ ``censorware,'' they call it. Two such ``hacktivists''
unscrambled Cyber Patrol and used their knowledge to build CPHack,
a program that reveals the sites that Cyber Patrol blocks, and that
also makes it easy to deactivate the program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsystems went to court, saying that CPHack was a violation
of its copyright, because it was created with Cyber Patrol's own
code. A federal judge in Boston has ordered pretty much everybody
on the Internet with a copy of CPHack to remove it from their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Can the judge do that? The American Civil Liberties Union says
no, announcing Wednesday that it's appealing the ruling. I wish I
could take this delightfully simple view of the matter. But to a
mind uncontaminated by legal expertise, it seems like a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   If the CPHackers had merely revealed the list of sites Cyber
Patrol blocks, they'd probably be untouchable. You can't copyright
a list of factual information _ even I know that. But do the
hackers have a right to use someone else's code to create a program
that prevents the original program from working? Isn't that a sort
of theft or vandalism?
</P>
<P>
   That one's not clear. The Boston judge, in issuing his
injunction, seemed to think this is unacceptable. But there's this
1988 case, Vault v. Quaid, that suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Vault Corp.'s program prevented software piracy, by making it
impossible to copy data from a floppy disk. Quaid Software studied
Vault's program and used that knowledge to write software that
defeated the Vault system. And guess what? A federal court said
Quaid's software was A-OK, even though it effectively destroyed
Vault's business. I can see why the ACLU appealed the Cyber Patrol
injunction. Odd though it might seem to my untrained mind, the
CPHackers could yet win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more such litigation ahead too, as other
hacktivists use their programming skills to protest various
corporate practices. We'll probably hear a lot about a group called
RTMark, best known for an international Internet campaign to shut
down the popular toy retailing Web site eToys.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that eToys had found out about an arts Web site called
etoy.com, and demanded that the site change its name. But etoy.com
had been founded years before eToys came along, and said it had
every right to its Internet domain name. eToys got a federal judge
to issue an injunction against its tiny adversary. But outraged
RTMark members publicly vowed to launch hacker attacks against
eToys during the 1999 Christmas shopping season, to crash the site
and punish the company for its arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, but all the bad publicity forced eToys to back
down. Score one for the good guys, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   But if RTMark had roasted eToys' servers, wouldn't that be a
crime? After all, the FBI is still chasing the vandals who recently
shut down some of the world's biggest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think we can get away with it, we do it, yeah,'' says
RTMark spokesman Ray Thomas _ not his real name, by the way. ``The
legality of it is really a touchy issue.'' Because RTMark has never
been taken to court over an Internet sabotage campaign, Thomas says
it is willing to consider launching more acts of civil
disobedience, aimed at the overwhelming power of greedy
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``electrohippies,'' a group bitterly opposed
to genetically modified food crops. They're currently recruiting
volunteers to help them launch crippling attacks on corporate Web
sites beginning next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hacktivists still seem to believe the old myth that Internet
technology will always keep them a step ahead of the laws. Bill
Gates has lately learned otherwise, and so will these lads, in
time. I'd better get used to reading legal briefs. I expect to see
quite a few of them.

FOR BENNETT, STUART CASE STILL HURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A decade after he was cleared as a suspect in one of
Boston's most notorious crimes, William Bennett is still very
angry.
</P>
<P>
   In autumn of 1989, the ex-convict was named a suspect in the
killing of Carol DiMaiti Stuart, a pregnant, suburban white woman
shot, allegedly by a black man, in what looked like a random street
robbery. Bennett's arrest seemed to solve a high-profile murder
case, quieting an outraged city whose leaders promised swift
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But when suspicion shifted to the husband, Charles Stuart,
Bennett went from cold-blooded murder suspect to a symbol of police
abuse and Boston's lingering racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in a rare interview, Bennett told The Boston Globe
the case still haunts him. He blames it for his mother's premature
death and frayed family ties. And he refuses to hide his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust anybody. I barely trust myself,'' said Bennett,
now 50. ``The police falsely pinned a crime on me once and they can
do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no faith in the law enforcement and I don't like
cops,'' said Bennett, who does kitchen work for a food service
company. ``Nothing has changed. You still have those same racist
cops on the police force.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Oct. 23, Carol Stuart was driving with her
husband from a childbirth class at Brigham and Women's Hospital
when she was shot at close range. She was killed and the couple's
unborn child was fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stuart, who was shot once in the stomach, told police
that a black gunman with a raspy voice forced his way into their
car at a stoplight, ordered them to drive to Mission Hill, robbed
them, then opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Crack cocaine and gang violence had become epidemics in the
city's Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods, but the murder of a
pregnant white woman, allegedly by a black man, was shocking,
front-page news. To police and outsiders, the murder exemplified
the evils of a growing drug problem in a poor, lawless
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Charles Stuart's description, police made a crude
composite of the gunman. Over the objections of community leaders,
patrolmen and detectives stopped black men at random in
predominantly black neighborhoods, in an intense search for the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   And Bennett, who had a long rap sheet dating to the early 1970s,
quickly became a prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-year-old drifter whose family lived in Mission Hill, he was
suddenly dragged before the national spotlight, a reluctant
character in an infamous crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he was pulled out of my home'' in suburban
Burlington, recalled Brenda Nelson, his longtime companion. Bennett
had spent the night with her; she was pregnant at the time with
their daughter, Ebony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the bed and he was in the shower. My own mother was
in the bed,'' Nelson said. ``The police were surrounding the home.
It was all so crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrested on a separate armed-robbery warrant, Bennett was never
directly charged with Carol Stuart's murder. Still, the case was
considered solved _ until detectives began to suspect Charles
Stuart was the real killer. As the investigation closed in, Stuart,
in an apparent suicide, jumped to his death from the Tobin Bridge
in January 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, however, was convicted and served nearly 10 years in
prison for the 1989 armed robbery of a Brookline video store. To
this day, he maintains he is innocent and believes that conviction
was payback for the Stuart case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all lies,'' said Bennett. ``I felt they always wanted
to get me for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bennett and Nelson live quietly in a rented house in
Worcester with their family: daughters Ebony, now 10, Aisha, 11,
Whitney, 10, and son Nathaniel, 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be left alone,'' said Nelson. ``Sometimes
people recognize him and ask if he is Willie Bennett and we say
`no' and walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 10-year anniversary of Carol Stuart's murder _ and her
husband's plunge into the Mystic River _ prompted a number of
forums examining the case and its impact on race relations in the
city. Bennett had stayed in the background until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he surfaced in the audience of a televised panel
discussion sponsored by WGBH. Bennett rose from the crowd and told
the gathering that the case directly led to the death of his
mother, Pauline Bennett, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moderator Charles Ogletree of Harvard University was stunned. So
was Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans, who was a panelist. The
audience gasped and then broke out in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Though the racially charged case divided the city, there have
been efforts to make amends to the African-American community:
Carol Stuart's foundation has sponsored 160 college scholarships
for Mission Hill children, and Bennett's family received a $12,000
settlement in a civil lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, former police commissioner Francis ``Mickey'' Roache
told The Boston Globe he believed at the time that Bennett should
never have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these developments are enough for Bennett. He said
he can't be repaid for the time he missed with his family: his
children's first steps, his mother's last breaths, and the funerals
of his father and two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what _ they are giving scholarships. They haven't done
anything for me,'' he said. ``I really don't give a damn about this
Stuart case anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is not here today because of this mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Nelson brought the children to the prison to
make sure they knew their father, and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love their father; you can't tell them nothing wrong
about their father,'' she said. ``And they know enough about the
(Stuart) case'' to realize he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release from prison last year, Bennett said, he has
become a recluse and struggles to reclaim his life, but his past
keeps getting in the way. Most employers, he said, are reluctant to
hire him because of his criminal background.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to watch or read anything about the Stuart case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just trying to keep a low profile,'' said Bennett. ``Some
people don't know who I am and I don't want them to ever know.''

A RUSH TO CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston's latest First Amendment case is distinguished by a
singular feature: Virtually no one has mentioned the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the jungle display in the South Boston bar hardly
seems worth all the dust it kicked up. On Feb. 25, the Boston
Herald reported that Tom English's Cottage had been decorated with
stuffed monkeys and parrots, fake vines, a stuffed gorilla wearing
a crown, and statuettes of native warriors holding spears. A sign
behind the stuffed animals proclaimed, ``Hey, hey, we're the
monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   And why was this news? Because the guy tending bar supposedly
cracked an ugly joke. ``When asked . . . what the crew of stuffed
monkeys symbolized,'' the Herald story alleged, ``a bartender
responded, `Black History Month.' '' The story claimed that a
patron laughingly chimed in, ``What else would it be for?'' and
that the bartender said the crowned gorilla represented Martin
Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   Was it true? Neither the bartender nor the patron were named,
and the reporter provided no corroboration. The bartender flatly
denies that the exchange took place. The owner says _ and he has a
stack of photos to back him up _ that the jungle display is part of
a rotating series: monkeys in the winter, frogs in the spring, fish
in the summer, elephants and donkeys at election time.
</P>
<P>
   But all disbelief was suspended in the rush to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not accurate. A rush to condemn would have been
understandable, if perhaps premature. What took place was a rush to
(itals)censor(unitals) _ to demand that the government punish the
pub's owner because his bartender and a customer supposedly made a
racist joke.
</P>
<P>
   And the government was eager to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tantamount to a hate crime,'' the chairman of the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, an agency charted
with enforcing the state's civil rights statutes, told the Herald.
The next day he opened proceedings against the bar. ``This kind of
conduct,'' he said to The Boston Globe, ``is deeply offensive to
all decent Americans as well as being illegal.'' Illegal? It is
(itals)illegal(unitals) to make a joke _ even a tasteless joke _
about Black History Month? Anyone who believes in freedom of speech
should have been outraged. Yet as the MCAD commissioner set about
to punish an opinion he disapproved of, no one objected.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone. One city councilor urged the Boston Licensing
Board to strip Tom English's Cottage of its permit to do business.
``A liquor license is a privilege, not a right,'' he said. ``If you
abuse it, you should lose it.'' The licensing board promptly agreed
to hold a hearing on the matter. ``This board has zero tolerance
for any type of prejudice,'' its chairman said. ``If they were
running something that's offensive to the community, we can take
action, up to and including taking away their license.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the board took no action, but only because there was
no evidence to back up the charge. (The MCAD case is still
pending.) And if there had been evidence? Can a business be shut
down just because somebody in it says something ``offensive?'' In a
country whose Bill of Rights bars the government from ``abridging
the freedom of speech,'' aren't citizens in a bar free to say
anything they like without having to fear retribution by agents of
the state?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the answer is no. The First Amendment is being
crucified on a cross of political correctness. Proprietors of
public establishments who tolerate boorish jokes or bigoted remarks
are now accused of creating a ``hostile environment.'' More and
more, that is held to suffice for a finding of discrimination _
even if no one was actually discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   This is alarming. It should not have to be said that there is no
right not to be offended. The law guarantees that you will not be
barred from a place of public accommodation because of your race,
religion, or sex; it does (itals)not(unitals) guarantee that you
will be welcomed with hugs and kisses. Freedom of speech means
nothing unless it means that no one may be punished by the
government just because he _ or his employee _ said something that
somebody else didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be punished next? Suppose the bartender in a black
neighborhood pub admires the Nation of Islam. Imagine that he
adorns the bar with photographs of Louis Farrakhan and Elijah
Muhammad, and displays literature describing whites as ``blue-eyed
devils'' and ``demons.'' Will the bar lose its license because the
material is ``offensive to the community?''
</P>
<P>
   What if a bookstore at a women's college showcases works by
authors like Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, who are known
for their virulence toward men? Suppose it sells male-mocking
novelty items, such as T-shirts listing ``10 Ways A Cucumber Is
Better Than A Man.'' Should MCAD go after the store because of its
``hostile environment?''
</P>
<P>
   What was said in that South Boston bar (if the story was true)
was despicable. But the First Amendment protects our right to say
even despicable things. ``If there is any principle of the
Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any
other it is the principle of free thought,'' Oliver Wendell Holmes
Jr. wrote in 1928. ``Not free thought for those who agree with us,
but freedom for the thought that we hate.''

HIS DECK ISN'T WEATHERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to get a weathered effect on my deck floorboards.
They are four years old and I have been using a sealer every year.
What else should I do?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD MAGUE, Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the deck is pressure-treated and the sealer is a clear
sealer, it should have turned to a nice weathered gray by now.
Ditto for a mahogany or cedar deck.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is pressure-treated or mahogany, you can stop
applying the sealer or continue with it; the deck has been through
enough cycles of contraction and expansion not to splinter, spall,
or split.
</P>
<P>
   If it's cedar, it may not weather very attractively, so it might
be best to continue the sealer treatment, even though it's an
annual pain. If it were my deck, I would not treat it at all, and
let it weather.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more of a light-gray weathered look, you can treat
the deck with semitransparent stain of a medium to light gray. This
will last for three to five years, and only one coat is needed each
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the toilets on the second floor is leaking; the drain
in the basement is wet and dripping. How can I locate the leak?
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE, and wasting water
</P>
<P>
   A. The leak may be where you see the drain dripping water or it
may be higher up, and is telegraphing down the outside of the pipe
and dripping where it goes from vertical to nearly horizontal on
its way to the main sewer pipe. You could try wiping the pipe and
inspecting it for a possible leak, or more likely, a break in the
drain where it makes a turn. If you find nothing suspicious, you
may have to break into the wall amd make a visual inspection. Have
a helper flush the toilet while you make the inspection; the leak
should manifest itself immediately. And if the drain is leaking,
you really are not wasting water; it just is not going to the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 55-year-old house has painted cedar shingles. Recently, I
noticed brown stains at the bottom of some shingles on the north
side of the house, especially just under the eaves. My neighbor has
the same thing on the south side. What is it, and how can I prevent
it?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL ANDERSON, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is the dreaded cedar bleed, which has become a plague in
New England with our red cedar shingles and clapboards, all nicely
painted or stained a light color.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is moisture behind the shingles, which leaches out the
tannins in the red cedar, dissolving them into that brown ooze.
There is little you can do except wash the stains; power washing
will be even more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   But the stains will return if the water is allowed to remain.
So, check for leaks in the wall or roof, or a blocked gutter, which
overflows down the face of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you fix the leaks, the stains may continue, because the
moisture may be behind the shingles. It arrives there as water
vapor that migrated from inside the house, through walls and
insulation, and condensed on the cool sheathing, turning into water
that penetrated the sheathing and resulted in the brown stains.
Ventilating or dehumidifying the house may help some.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I stripped the top of my maple Hitchcock tabletop where
something dripped and took off the stain. I sanded to the bare wood
and planned to stain it, but the maple will not take stain. How can
I get the original stain color back?
</P>
<P>
   GLENN DEMERS, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Maple is a very hard hardwood, and dense, too, making it
difficult to impossible for ordinary oil stains to penetrate. So,
you have to use a different stain. Use a stain made from
water-soluble or alcohol-soluble analine dyes. As a bonus, regular
oil stains can be applied over dried analine dyes to get the
desired color.

   It all began with a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeneys.net is an offbeat New York literary journal edited by
acclaimed author David Eggers, while McSweeneys.com is a family Web
site created by the McSweeney clan of Stoneham, Mass. The magazine,
officially called McSweeney's Internet Tendency, publishes such
articles as ``Election 2000, as Seen From Chile'' and ``Fragments
from `Elian! The Musical.' '' The family site is all about, well,
the McSweeneys _ Gerry and Wendy and their four young children, who
enjoy such activities as swimming and skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, people were confused.
</P>
<P>
   When the McSweeney family began receiving unfamily-like e-mail
intended for the magazine, they weren't amused. ``It wasn't
particularly nice,'' says Wendy McSweeney. ``We got some raunchy
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of mix-up is becoming increasingly common. Internet
domain-level designations were originally meant to define a Web
site's purpose: dot-com stood for commerce; dot-net designated an
Internet company; and dot-org indicated a nonprofit organization.
But now the three designations are virtually indistinguishable, a
fact that is exploited by cyber-squatters eager to reap a profit by
selling variations of desirable Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the dot-com nor the dot-net McSweeneys had any
interest in domain-name bartering. The Stoneham clan simply wanted
to put an end to the unwelcome e-mail. In February, the family
contacted the editors in New York. ``They were peeved at first,''
says associate editor Todd Pruzan. After they all got to know each
other, however, an unlikely friendship was forged. ``We thought it
was neat,'' Wendy McSweeney says.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens, though, that McSweeney's (the magazine) was
experiencing growing pains around the time McSweeneys (the family)
called. Traffic to the site soared early this year after the
publication of Eggers's celebrated memoir, ``A Heartbreaking Work
of Staggering Genius,'' and operating costs skyrocketed. At the
same time, the magazine's Web master decided to pursue a real job
(as in one that pays money). The editors were considering folding
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When the McSweeney clan heard this heartbreaking tale, they came
up with an offer of staggering generosity. They would pay the
operating costs for both sites, and computer expert Brendan
McSweeney, 12, would step in as Web master (running the technical,
not content parts) of the magazine. In turn, the editors
volunteered to keep the content of future articles fit for a family
publication; in a note posted on the site this week, the editors
vowed to stay away from ``sexual, scatological, or otherwise
profane writing.'' And that goes for reader mail, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any 6-year-old readers until now,'' says
Pruzan. Molly McSweeney, the youngest of the Stoneham clan, just
turned 6. ``It seemed like we're all grownups now, and we know what
it means to be responsible in front of children. But this affects
almost none of our content, since we don't have a lot of profane or
sexual content anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, needless to say, is highly unusual, especially
in an age when anyone and everyone is trying to milk a profit out
of the Internet. Cyber-squatters routinely buy up Internet
addresses and try to resell them for huge profits. Last year, a
Jamaica Plain man bought 65 domain names incorporating the words
Harvard and Radcliffe and tried to sell them for more than
$300,000. Also last year, a Los Angeles company paid a record $7.5
million for the name business.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the McSweeney arrangement isn't about the money or even
about the rights to the name. Both sides refuse to disclose how
much cash is involved, although Pruzan hints that it isn't cheap.
``I can only say that they're very generous,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   And the family members don't seem to be in the deal for their
literary edification, either. These days, Wendy McSweeney's reading
taste doesn't go much beyond books about raising children, and her
favorite magazine is Life. Her husband, who is in real estate,
works long hours and has little free time. Neither one has has
gotten around to reading Eggers's memoir, an astonishing tale about
how he raised his younger brother after their parents both died of
cancer within the same month.
</P>
<P>
   So why become publishers? ``We thought it would be neat for the
kids,'' Wendy McSweeney says. The family's only requirement is that
the two sites be linked together, an odd pairing of wholesome
family photographs with outre articles. What's in a name, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   The young editors are discovering that it is possible to rely on
the kindness of strangers, albeit strangers who share your name.
Oddly enough, the magazine draws its name from a bizarre family
connection. Eggers's mother's maiden name was McSweeney, and
decades ago, she received dozens of letters from a mysterious
Timothy McSweeney desperately begging for money. ``He became this
apocryphal figure for Dave,'' says Pruzan. ``He's probably dead by
now, but it's certainly a strange story.''
</P>
<P>
   This strange story has a happier ending: The Stoneham clan took
over as publisher April 3. As for Wendy McSweeney, she doesn't plan
to contribute any interviews with lunch truck drivers or
meditations on school lunches (two pieces that actually ran in the
magazine). ``No, I won't be doing anything like that,'' she says.
``But it's very interesting stuff.''

TONS OF DEBRIS DOING DAMAGE TO BUDGETS AS COST OF STORM CLEANUP
CLIMBS
</HEADLINE>

By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Hour after hour, day after day, the dump
trucks and tractor-trailers have rumbled west on Interstate 30 to a
privately run landfill on the rolling prairie near the
Tarrant-Parker county line.
</P>
<P>
   Overflowing with reminders of the March 28 storms, the trucks
have disgorged tons of glass, roofing shingles, old-growth trees,
and bent and broken remnants of homes. It's enough rubbish, so far,
to cover a football field, end zone to end zone, more than 20 feet
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the sheer amount of debris staggering, but the cost
is on the way up as well. The city of Fort Worth is expecting tens
of thousands of dollars in expenses for the cleanup and is prepared
to ask the federal government to help pay for part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major expense,'' said Pat Svacina, a spokesman for
the city. ``We've had crews working overtime, on Saturday and
Sunday. We've had wear and tear on equipment. We budget every year
to cover the normal things, but this is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said Wednesday that Tarrant
County's request for a presidential disaster declaration was to go
to the governor's office Thursday and from there to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``An enormous amount of work has gone into documenting the
damage; the numbers indicate the damage is more significant than we
originally thought,'' Barr said after meeting with federal and
state emergency assessment officials. ``Hopefully, they will sign
off on it in Austin and send it to the president'' today.
</P>
<P>
   City trucks, drawn from several departments, have picked up an
estimated 33,500 cubic yards of debris from downtown and the
Linwood neighborhood north of West Seventh Street. Waste
Management, the city's primary garbage collector, has collected
another estimated 10,000 cubic yards in 450 loads from the
Monticello neighborhood near Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management had to bring in trucks, tractor-trailer rigs
and workers from Dallas, and that still wasn't enough to clean
Monticello. The company also had to call in subcontractors to help,
because Waste Management crews had to continue regular trash pickup
around the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the start, too,'' said Stephen Kellar, marketing
manager with Waste Management. ``Right now, we're just picking up
what's on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the city is counting another 5,000 cubic yards of debris
to be picked up, and that doesn't include the anticipated razing of
several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup started in the wee hours March 30 and moved quickly
enough, at least in most areas, that tornado researchers wished it
were slower.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Letchford, a professor in the wind engineering program at
Texas Tech University, said some of the rubble was removed from the
streets before it could be studied. The team from Lubbock
considered Fort Worth's storm important because it offered a rare
chance to study a tornado that hit an urban area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more debris we can study, the better,'' Letchford said.
``It gives us the chance to see where it traveled and how it
impacted the buildings around it. I know there's some we didn't get
to see. It was gone before we could get there.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Wendy Davis, who represents downtown and the
Linwood neighborhood, said she is ``incredibly pleased'' with the
cleanup in Linwood, a working-class neighborhood heavily damaged in
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going way above and beyond anything we're required to
do to help people in that area,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and Waste Management representatives said they
incurred significant expenses from overtime, equipment use, fuel,
damage to equipment and use of the landfill. But they still have
not arrived at an amount that they can pass on to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal procedures, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency will offer residents and businesses a package of grants,
loans and benefits if the president declares a disaster in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster designation is far from automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, such a request must come from the governor's office,
and counties must meet certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies will help only if the amount of uninsured
damage far exceeds the resources of city and county governments,
officials said. Unexpected city expenses, including employee
overtime, are included in the estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The storms caused an estimated $400 million to $450 million in
damage in River Oaks, Fort Worth, Arlington and Grand Prairie,
according to the Southwestern Insurance Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   However, city and county officials have not announced how much
of that damage is not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of landfill space consumed in the past week is
significant, city officials said, but ``it's not going to make
landfill space critical in the next two years,'' Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the amount of glass, wood, cardboard and other
traditionally recyclable items left by the tornado, every scrap of
debris has gone to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is usefulness and part is convenience,
officials said. Much of the glass downtown either was rendered
useless even for recycling or it was not the right kind of glass,
Russ said.
</P>
<P>
   But work crews also haven't taken the time to separate debris,
Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just being swept off the street and taken straight to the
landfill,'' he said. ``It's a mess. You've got paper, shingles,
trees, glass all mixed together and that would be difficult to
separate. We don't have time to do that.''

<P>
   It used to be you paid a fixed price for frozen fish sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hated haggling. And supermarket clerks certainly
couldn't offer 20 cents off at the checkout counter.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, America _ long the landscape of fixed prices _
is turning negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Name your price online, and you could pay less for the fish than
on triple-coupon day. The same goes for paper towels, cars, and
mortgage rates _ and it's not just on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Dial your long-distance carrier and get a deal on calls to Japan
by playing a little hardball. If you walk into a chain electronics
store and appear undecided over a video camera, it may suddenly get
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Once limited to flea markets and car dealerships, bargaining for
everyday items such as toothpaste and televisions is slowly going
mainstream, specialists say. The popular Priceline.com is even
entertaining bids to fill up your gas tank this spring.
</P>
<P>
   US consumers, long believed to suffer from shyness, guilt, or
just plain awkwardness when engaged in face-to-face dickering,
don't seem to mind it at all when it's anonymous. Or when it's with
huge conglomerates that increasingly sell everything from blue
jeans to compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new way of bargaining, we don't usually have to look
someone in the eye and say, `I don't want to pay this price.' It's
the anonymity of the Web and the anonymity of these large, faceless
corporations we deal with that makes it easier,'' said Mary Lou
Roberts, a professor of pricing and e-commerce at University of
Massachusetts at Boston. ``It's an impersonal setting. It makes all
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The distaste for face-to-face haggling is never more apparent
than when buying a car, at the very least making some uncomfortable
while striking fear in others.
</P>
<P>
   To counter those experiences, car makers including Saturn have
begun offering fixed-priced cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the interaction with (car) salesmen. I don't feel
like I get a good deal. I wouldn't trust them,'' said Denise
Mowles, a mother who in the past has successfully bargained with
big retail outfits for a cheaper TV and video camera. Now, she bids
and shops online for everything from Beanie Babies to Disney
clothes for her children.
</P>
<P>
   The new, online bargaining, however, is a strange, slower-paced
back and forth compared to the bargain banter that defines Turkish
bazaars. Shoppers often submit isolated bids for products and must
wait to hear back. Sometimes they don't get a second chance. Other
sites actually play let's make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. Once, the American marketplace
pulsated with the same one-on-one negotiating that was the hallmark
of souks, or markets, in the Middle East, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The American general store changed that in the 1800s.
Manufacturers wanted to make sure they got full price for their
goods _ even if someone else was selling them. Selling became
standardized. The supermarket was born.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have always been price-conscious, they often
saved bargaining for high-ticket items such as houses and cars, and
clipped coupons and shopped on discount days for other items. Even
now, in a flush economy, consumers always want the best deal. In
supermarkets and chain drug stores, consumers can get what they
want _ exactly when they want it. No dickering over cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American citizen likes to get things quickly. We
want instant gratification,'' said Bruce Weinberg, assistant
professor of marketing and e-commerce at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   While make-a-deal, bidding, auction, and electronic negotiating
sites have helped fuel it, the bargaining craze started pre-Web,
marketing specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this competitive intensity now,'' said Kathleen
Seiders, marketing professor at Babson College. Many industry
monopolies have been dismantled, and competition for customers has
become fierce. And there are many places to get the same products.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, while the bargaining has yet to hit places like
Filene's or Parade of Shoes, it is happening in chain stores or
companies selling highly competitive items such as electronics or
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   So while the sale of the century may not be listed in the shop
window, employees are more free to offer a discount to customers
who need a little push to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, what do you have to lose when you bargain against a
listed price?
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse thing that can happen is you pay the fixed price,''
Seiders said.
</P>
<P>
   All that means, bargainers and specialists say, is that
consumers are realizing the power of their pocketbook. And for
some, doing it anonymously gives them even more confidence. They
can walk away. They can be the tough customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went to a mom-and-pop store, they would care if you
came back. You'd treat them a little differently because they
really need you,'' Mowles said.
</P>
<P>
   In big stores and online ``it's not personal,'' she said.

THE NEW CADILLAC DEVILLE DTS: IT'S LARGE BUT STILL SPORTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in Cadillac's history when virtually every
model screamed, ``Yo, look at me.'' Fins, chrome, whitewalls, gaudy
paint (yellow and pink among chosen hues), and sheer size turned up
the visual volume.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain the 2000 DeVille DTS _ big but unimposing,
staccato rumble burbling from its twin exhausts, yet quiet and
silky smooth, subtle but possessed of an attitude, as in (with
apologies to Ratso Rizzo) ``Yo, I'm drivin' heah''?
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing finned, abrupt or gaudy about this new Caddy.
It's bigger than today's sports sedans, but it has the same
crouched-on-steroids look they have _ not too long at the nose,
hunched and muscular in the middle, high and chopped at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Even the view from the driver's seat has changed from the
Cadillac of old _ you no longer peer down an endless expanse of
hood. Instead, there is a subtle hump at the center of the
windshield and the fenders drop from view.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the Lincoln LS _ but bigger. Like German luxury sedans
_ but bigger. And it's very luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment includes variable, self-sensing suspension,
traction control, front- and side-impact air bags for driver and
passenger, the OnStar emergency-convenience communications system,
12-way power leather front seats with power massaging lumbar,
adjustable headrests, and heated front and rear seats. You get this
for about $45,000; add a navigation system ($2,000), Night Vision
(at $2,000 the only such system offered on an American car right
now), a sunroof (a bit pricey at $1,500), and other goodies such as
a garage door opener and rear parking alarm sensors, and you can
quickly be into the mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, this is a huge car. Big doors let you in. Big seats
greet you. Legroom and headroom are superb _ particularly headroom
for the rear seat where the roof is scooped above the seatbacks for
crucial extra inches.
</P>
<P>
   The seats themselves are theater-quality with lateral side
supports for trunk and legs forming stiff flanks for front buckets
with wide butt and back surfaces. The rear bench holds three adults
comfortably _ not common in ``five-passenger'' sedans these days.
</P>
<P>
   Audio and navigation controls are easy to read with big buttons
and touch-screen features that you can learn to use without
glancing constantly from the road. Climate control buttons are
large as well.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is ample with bins in all four doors, a big, two-level
bin between the seats, and major pouches built into the backs of
the front seats. The glove compartment, however, is lost to the CD
changer.
</P>
<P>
   All this size and luxury, of course, does not come in a
lightweight package. We're talking a little more than 2 tons here.
</P>
<P>
   To get the DeVille on down the road, it's powered by a
4.6-liter, DOHC, V-8 Northstar engine. It's heavy on aluminum _
cylinder block, heads, pistons _ and even has a nylon intake
manifold. It is also heavy on the horses _ 300 _ and moderately
hungry for fuel (I got 16.1 miles per gallon).
</P>
<P>
   Booted up for passing on the highway, the engine sounds more
NASCAR than luxury sedan, a nice touch. Straight ahead, there was
nothing distinctive about its handling, slightly light up front
like many big American cars. But the front-wheel drive seemed to
dig in when it was pushed into corners and it was surprisingly firm
and agile for a big sedan. You get the cruiser of old with a good
taste of some of the best handling features of the sports sedan of
today.
</P>
<P>
   And the front-wheel drive made what could have been a tricky
machine in the snow (hopefully the last dumping of this spring)
into a sure-footed, strong rig that moved stubbornly through the
slop.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the weight and performance in balance are a front
suspension with independent struts, coil springs and antiroll bar,
and an independent rear with semi-trailing arms, coil springs,
electronic level control, and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Brakes are vented discs with ABS and they stop this heavy rig
straight and sure in a way smoking old brake shoes never could have
matched.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic, with overdrive, was smooth through the
sequence _ better than what I've seen in Lincoln automatics. But
why, oh why, in a luxury car, do they drop the shifter into a
notch-plate on the center console made of cheap plastic? Wood or
aluminum would add so much more class and probably not affect the
profit margin all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The thin wood band that bisects the dash and continues its
line through leather along the interior side panels of the front
and rear doors.
</P>
<P>
   --The individual reading lamps for rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The placement of a cheap, loose flap of rubber in the dash bin
just ahead of the console.
</P>
<P>
   --The placement of the coin holder-sorter at the back of the
bottom level of the console bin. Hard to reach, impossible to look
at while cruising into a toll both.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers

<P>
   Base price: $45,095

<P>
   Sorting through reader mail, which flows here not only in great
volume but also in remarkable diversity of tone, from praise to
outright rancor with some interesting technical questions tossed
in:
</P>
<P>
   I remain amazed at the blind rage with which some folks look at
SUVs. When I claimed while reviewing a Chevrolet Suburban that
carried seven people on a ski trip that I had the high
environmental ground over four smaller cars that whizzed by me
carrying, in total, seven people, it set the anti-SUVers into full
attack mode. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   --``I was so saddened to see your incredibly stupid comment
about having the environmental high ground because you had seven
people in your Suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the other 99 percent of the time you drive this
thing and occupy the environmental sub-basement?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face the fact . . . that 95 percent of the time these cars are
driven by unemployed wealthy suburban dwellers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do you see a big SUV with more than one or two
people in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people in a Suburban is the way the vehicle should be
used. Far too often I see them driven by a lone commuter or a
driver and one passenger. In past columns, I have called people who
commute alone in SUVs ``jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   My feeling is that if you can afford a big SUV and the gas to
run it, you can also afford an additional, smaller commuter car and
you should buy one and drive it most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   --``In your review of the 2000 Volvo Cross Country, you did not
mention the problem with Volvo headlights, which are burning out
after only 100 hours of driving time. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not occur in the 2000 model year. It is a
problem that cropped up in the V70 and S70 models in 1999. Volvo
says the 4-year, 50,000-mile warranty covers the lights in these
models and dealers should replace them. There is a shortage of the
long-life bulbs they want to install (1,000-hour bulbs), but that
should end in about a month. Meanwhile, if you have to replace your
bulbs with what they have on hand, those, too, will be replaced by
the 1,000-hour bulbs as they become available.
</P>
<P>
   --``I read your column on driving with ABS brakes. Did I have a
(gaseous cranial event) or isn't this the same as anti-skid
systems?''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes and anti-skid or stability systems are not the
same. Anti-lock brakes work when a central monitor senses wheel
lockup and briefly eases the brake at the wheel that is about to
lock up. ABS can, however, be a part of an overall anti-skid
system. The latter uses not only brakes, but can also monitor the
position of the front wheels to tell where the driver is trying to
go, as well as the steering wheel, brake pedal pressure, gas pedal
pressure, the clutch and transmission. It can send torque to
nonslipping wheels, cut engine torque, and use the ABS system at
the same time, all aimed at helping you regain control.
</P>
<P>
   --``You completely missed the point about using EPA estimated
gas figures. Your rambling nonsense . . . will never take the place
of objective testing such as that done by the EPA.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time you are at an auto dealership, look at the price
sticker. Look at the fuel economy section. You will find two
numbers are presented in large print: CITY MPG and HIGHWAY MPG. I
just did it with a Mercedes C-Class and the City/Highway figures
were 21 and 27. Now read the fine print: ``Actual mileage will vary
with options, driving conditions, driving habits and vehicle's
condition.'' Now, note this line: ``Results reported to EPA (my
emphasis) indicate that the majority of vehicles with these
estimates will achieve (again, I am quoting the Mercedes sticker
here) between 17 and 25 mpg in the city and between 22 and 32 mpg
on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency gets its numbers not from
its own testing of every vehicle, but from the manufacturers. They
run the cars on dynomometers and simulate 20 minutes of city
driving and 20 minutes of highway driving. They measure carbon
emitted at the tailpipe. This gives them the mileage figures. The
EPA does spot checks to make sure nobody's cheating.
</P>
<P>
   I drive each car I test 800-1,000 miles. I try to drive the way
most people would drive, mixing city, back roads, highways, short
trips, long trips, hauling lots of kids, hauling one kid, going to
the landfill, commuting in and out of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Is it perfect science? Of course not. Does it give me a good
feel for what kind of mileage an auto will get? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   --``Without sounding or feeling stupid, how do I tell if I have
ABS brakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Check your owner's manual. If that's not clear, return to your
dealer and ask. If you want to find out on your own, drive the car
on a deserted stretch of road at about 30 m.p.h. Stamp the brakes
and hold them on. If you have ABS, you'll get a noticeable chatter
in the brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   --``On a column about the growth of high-tech tracking and
navigation equipment in cars: Is it a good thing to make it
possible for a $9-per-hour computer operator to track upscale
people in their cars? We look for our writers to think, not take
the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   If I am in a car that hits a tree at night on a desolate stretch
of road, I'd love to have an electronic device alert an operator
that my air bag has deployed. If my car is stolen, I'd love to be
able to remotely lock the doors and set off the horn, making life
miserable for the thieves. If I lock myself out of my car, I'd find
it wonderful to be able to call that operator and, after giving the
proper code word, have the car unlocked from afar. Telematics is a
good thing, and it won't always be for the rich. Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   --``I've read columns that describe understeer and oversteer.
Can you explain?''
</P>
<P>
   Understeer, or ``plowing,'' is when you turn your wheels, but
the car tries to keep going straight. Oversteer, or
``fishtailing,'' causes the rear of the car to try to break away to
the outside of the turn and pass the front of the car.

NOMAR, A-ROD IN VERY EXCLUSIVE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There is no password or secret handshake, but theirs
is the most exclusive of clubs. Three members. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter are the holy
trinity of shortstops. All in their mid-20s, already heaped with
riches and awards, they are redefining baseball's most skilled
position.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many Yalta sessions for the three shortstops. It's
possible you'll see them together at an All-Star game (voting for a
starting American League shortstop has become like selecting your
favorite Springsteen song). Otherwise, they'll assemble only for a
national ad campaign or a magazine cover. Check out the April GQ
and there's Nomar, A-Rod, and Derek, left to right _ like Eric
Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Keith Richard without guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to get us all together,'' Nomar said. ``But
that was fun doing that photo shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' opening series in Seattle gives us an opportunity
to see Nomar and A-Rod head-to-head for three days. Fans get the
same thrill whenever the Sox play the Yankees or the Mariners play
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Rodriguez share the closest relationship. They stay at
one another's homes when the Mariners play the Yankees. This caused
some friction in the Yankee clubhouse last summer when the
shortstop buddies chose to chat and laugh during an on-field brawl
between the Yankees and Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek and I are like brothers,'' said Rodriguez. ``We came up
together. But Nomar and I have done some fun things in the
offseason. We filmed a commercial (for Amtrak) and got a lot
closer. Nomar and I are good buddies, man. He's my man.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra isn't staying at Rodriguez's house this week, but
he's got a lot of admiration for his Seattle counterpart. ``I love
watching him play,'' said Nomar. ``He's got all the tools. He's a
great defensive guy; he's got a great arm. He can beat you so many
ways on the bases, and at the plate he's unbelievable. He's got
power, can hit for average, and do what needs to be done. He's a
clutch hitter as well. He's got all the things you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, A-Rod returns the compliment. These guys see the same
things we see. ``He's incredible,'' said Rodriguez. ``He's a future
Hall of Famer. I think the world of Nomar, both on and off the
field. I watch him all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hit in the right elbow by a wild and ineffective
Ramon Martinez in the first inning Wednesday night, but stayed in
the game and made a spectacular grab of a Garciaparra liner,
turning it into a double play to end the top of the third. A-Rod
homered of John ``Way Back'' Wasdin in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   You can start an argument in any barroom in America simply by
asking which shortstop you'd take first in a dispersal draft.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar doesn't like questions about who's best. Rodriguez is a
little more forthcoming on the obvious rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a healthy competition going on,'' said the
Seattle franchise. ``We motivate each other. In a way we're
probably subconsciously trying to out-do each other and, I don't
know, it's fun. Those guys are great competitiors and great team
players. I think the common denominator is that we care about the
team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra last year was voted starting shortstop for the AL
All-Star team. America enjoyed a Kodak moment when Jeter ran out to
replace Nomar at the start of the fourth inning at Fenway Park.
They embraced. Rodriguez was home watching on TV. He missed 32
games early in '99 due to a knee injury. The ballot this year is
wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who's first, not to me,'' said Rodriguez.
``You can throw up a coin (a three-sided coin, perhaps?). I've won
two years. Nomar's won. Derek's gonna win. I don't even know if
it's really a matter of who's doing better or not. I think it's
just a matter of whose fans are dialing in.''
</P>
<P>
   There you go, Sox fans. Get out there and stuff that ballot box
for Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a competition,'' said Nomar, sounding a
little like Rick Pitino. ``People say you got to go up against
so-and-so. I'm not competing against Derek or Alex. I'm competing
about the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners. It doesn't matter
what each one of us does; what matters is who won and lost. So
there really is no competition. It's team against team. I don't try
to be the best anything. I just try to do the best job I can do. I
don't look for titles like that. I just do my job.
</P>
<P>
   Having delivered the required Dukespeak, he acknowledged, ``It's
an honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with those guys.
Watching those guys play is tremendous, so if they throw me in
there I'm proud of it. It's an honor. I think it's great for
baseball right now. I think fans enjoy watching guys who enjoy the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Garciaparra, at 26, is the oldest of the three.
Jeter is 25, and Rodriguez, who made his big-league debut at Fenway
in 1994 when he was 18, is only 24 years old but has already hit
148 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tease Derek because nobody really knows how old Derek is,''
said Rodriguez. ``In Kalamazoo, (Mich.,) they don't have birth
certificates. The town is too damn small. You can't kid Nomar too
much. He might be the smartest of all of us. You get to Georgia
Tech, you got brains.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a treat to watch any of them, any time. It's a double
treat when their teams play one another. Sox-Mariner games, like
Sox-Yankee games, and Yankee-Mariner games, are special. There's a
potential Hall of Fame shortstop on the field every time you look
up from your scorecard.

READERS DRIVEN TO WRITE IN ABOUT SUVS, ABS, AND EPA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorting through reader mail, which flows here not only in great
volume but also in remarkable diversity of tone, from praise to
outright rancor with some interesting technical questions tossed
in:
</P>
<P>
   I remain amazed at the blind rage with which some folks look at
SUVs. When I claimed while reviewing a Chevrolet Suburban that
carried seven people on a ski trip that I had the high
environmental ground over four smaller cars that whizzed by me
carrying, in total, seven people, it set the anti-SUVers into full
attack mode. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   --``I was so saddened to see your incredibly stupid comment
about having the environmental high ground because you had seven
people in your Suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the other 99 percent of the time you drive this
thing and occupy the environmental sub-basement?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face the fact . . . that 95 percent of the time these cars are
driven by unemployed wealthy suburban dwellers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do you see a big SUV with more than one or two
people in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people in a Suburban is the way the vehicle should be
used. Far too often I see them driven by a lone commuter or a
driver and one passenger. In past columns, I have called people who
commute alone in SUVs ``jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   My feeling is that if you can afford a big SUV and the gas to
run it, you can also afford an additional, smaller commuter car and
you should buy one and drive it most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   --``In your review of the 2000 Volvo Cross Country, you did not
mention the problem with Volvo headlights, which are burning out
after only 100 hours of driving time. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not occur in the 2000 model year. It is a
problem that cropped up in the V70 and S70 models in 1999. Volvo
says the 4-year, 50,000-mile warranty covers the lights in these
models and dealers should replace them. There is a shortage of the
long-life bulbs they want to install (1,000-hour bulbs), but that
should end in about a month. Meanwhile, if you have to replace your
bulbs with what they have on hand, those, too, will be replaced by
the 1,000-hour bulbs as they become available.
</P>
<P>
   --``I read your column on driving with ABS brakes. Did I have a
(gaseous cranial event) or isn't this the same as anti-skid
systems?''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes and anti-skid or stability systems are not the
same. Anti-lock brakes work when a central monitor senses wheel
lockup and briefly eases the brake at the wheel that is about to
lock up. ABS can, however, be a part of an overall anti-skid

emitted at the tailpipe. This gives them the mileage figures. The
EPA does spot checks to make sure nobody's cheating.
</P>
<P>
   I drive each car I test 800-1,000 miles. I try to drive the way
most people would drive, mixing city, back roads, highways, short
trips, long trips, hauling lots of kids, hauling one kid, going to
the landfill, commuting in and out of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Is it perfect science? Of course not. Does it give me a good
feel for what kind of mileage an auto will get? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   --``Without sounding or feeling stupid, how do I tell if I have
ABS brakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Check your owner's manual. If that's not clear, return to your
dealer and ask. If you want to find out on your own, drive the car
on a deserted stretch of road at about 30 m.p.h. Stamp the brakes
and hold them on. If you have ABS, you'll get a noticeable chatter
in the brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   --``On a column about the growth of high-tech tracking and
navigation equipment in cars: Is it a good thing to make it
possible for a $9-per-hour computer operator to track upscale
people in their cars? We look for our writers to think, not take

</P>
<P>
   Let me think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   If I am in a car that hits a tree at night on a desolate stretch
of road, I'd love to have an electronic device alert an operator
that my air bag has deployed. If my car is stolen, I'd love to be
able to remotely lock the doors and set off the horn, making life
miserable for the thieves. If I lock myself out of my car, I'd find
it wonderful to be able to call that operator and, after giving the
proper code word, have the car unlocked from afar. Telematics is a
good thing, and it won't always be for the rich. Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   --``I've read columns that describe understeer and oversteer.
Can you explain?''
</P>
<P>
   Understeer, or ``plowing,'' is when you turn your wheels, but
the car tries to keep going straight. Oversteer, or
``fishtailing,'' causes the rear of the car to try to break away to
the outside of the turn and pass the front of the car.

THE NEW CADILLAC DEVILLE DTS: IT'S LARGE BUT STILL SPORTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in Cadillac's history when virtually every
model screamed, ``Yo, look at me.'' Fins, chrome, whitewalls, gaudy
paint (yellow and pink among chosen hues), and sheer size turned up
the visual volume.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain the 2000 DeVille DTS _ big but unimposing,
staccato rumble burbling from its twin exhausts, yet quiet and
silky smooth, subtle but possessed of an attitude, as in (with
apologies to Ratso Rizzo) ``Yo, I'm drivin' heah''?
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing finned, abrupt or gaudy about this new Caddy.
It's bigger than today's sports sedans, but it has the same
crouched-on-steroids look they have _ not too long at the nose,
hunched and muscular in the middle, high and chopped at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Even the view from the driver's seat has changed from the
Cadillac of old _ you no longer peer down an endless expanse of
hood. Instead, there is a subtle hump at the center of the
windshield and the fenders drop from view.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the Lincoln LS _ but bigger. Like German luxury sedans
_ but bigger. And it's very luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment includes variable, self-sensing suspension,
traction control, front- and side-impact air bags for driver and
passenger, the OnStar emergency-convenience communications system,
12-way power leather front seats with power massaging lumbar,
adjustable headrests, and heated front and rear seats. You get this
for about $45,000; add a navigation system ($2,000), Night Vision
(at $2,000 the only such system offered on an American car right
now), a sunroof (a bit pricey at $1,500), and other goodies such as
a garage door opener and rear parking alarm sensors, and you can
quickly be into the mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, this is a huge car. Big doors let you in. Big seats
greet you. Legroom and headroom are superb _ particularly headroom
for the rear seat where the roof is scooped above the seatbacks for
crucial extra inches.
</P>
<P>
   The seats themselves are theater-quality with lateral side
supports for trunk and legs forming stiff flanks for front buckets
with wide butt and back surfaces. The rear bench holds three adults
comfortably _ not common in ``five-passenger'' sedans these days.
</P>
<P>
   Audio and navigation controls are easy to read with big buttons
and touch-screen features that you can learn to use without
glancing constantly from the road. Climate control buttons are
large as well.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is ample with bins in all four doors, a big, two-level
bin between the seats, and major pouches built into the backs of
the front seats. The glove compartment, however, is lost to the CD
changer.
</P>
<P>
   All this size and luxury, of course, does not come in a
lightweight package. We're talking a little more than 2 tons here.
</P>
<P>
   To get the DeVille on down the road, it's powered by a
4.6-liter, DOHC, V-8 Northstar engine. It's heavy on aluminum _
cylinder block, heads, pistons _ and even has a nylon intake
manifold. It is also heavy on the horses _ 300 _ and moderately
hungry for fuel (I got 16.1 miles per gallon).
</P>
<P>
   Booted up for passing on the highway, the engine sounds more
NASCAR than luxury sedan, a nice touch. Straight ahead, there was
nothing distinctive about its handling, slightly light up front
like many big American cars. But the front-wheel drive seemed to
dig in when it was pushed into corners and it was surprisingly firm
and agile for a big sedan. You get the cruiser of old with a good
taste of some of the best handling features of the sports sedan of
today.
</P>
<P>
   And the front-wheel drive made what could have been a tricky
machine in the snow (hopefully the last dumping of this spring)
into a sure-footed, strong rig that moved stubbornly through the
slop.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the weight and performance in balance are a front
suspension with independent struts, coil springs and antiroll bar,
and an independent rear with semi-trailing arms, coil springs,
electronic level control, and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Brakes are vented discs with ABS and they stop this heavy rig
straight and sure in a way smoking old brake shoes never could have
matched.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic, with overdrive, was smooth through the
sequence _ better than what I've seen in Lincoln automatics. But
why, oh why, in a luxury car, do they drop the shifter into a
notch-plate on the center console made of cheap plastic? Wood or
aluminum would add so much more class and probably not affect the
profit margin all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The thin wood band that bisects the dash and continues its
line through leather along the interior side panels of the front
and rear doors.
</P>
<P>
   --The individual reading lamps for rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The placement of a cheap, loose flap of rubber in the dash bin
just ahead of the console.
</P>
<P>
   --The placement of the coin holder-sorter at the back of the
bottom level of the console bin. Hard to reach, impossible to look
at while cruising into a toll both.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers
</P>
<P>
   Base price: $45,095
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $55,675
</P>
<P>
   Horsepower/Torque: 300/295 lb.-ft.

FORMER CNN JOURNALIST SEEKS EXONERATION FOR `TAILWIND' ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Not long after being fired for her role in
producing CNN's ill-fated 1998 telecast about ``Operation
Tailwind,'' April Oliver was struggling to hang on in TV,
freelancing for a tabloid show not known for its high editorial
standards. One day, when she learned that her stint with the show
might make the newspaper, she alerted her bosses. ``We can't be in
the paper next to you,'' she was told.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dingier corners of the news business, Oliver's name
was poison. ``I cried all night,'' she recalls. ``And I decided I
needed to figure out something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as a tangle of Operation Tailwind lawsuits enters
court-ordered mediation, Oliver _ who is both a plaintiff and a
defendant _ is still crusading for her story, her reputation, and
what she sees as the larger cause of investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's career was not the only casualty of the June 7, 1998
CNN report, with its explosive allegation that the United States
used nerve gas during a 1970 mission to kill American defectors in
Laos. Senior executive producer Pamela Hill resigned and senior
producer Jack Smith was fired. A year later, star correspondent
Peter Arnett _ who narrated the segment as part of CNN's new
collaboration with Time magazine _ was also gone. CNN, which
retracted the story, endured a public relations disaster.
Journalism suffered another credibility crisis. Angry veterans and
military brass claimed the story viciously libeled the nation's
armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years later, the verdict of public opinion has
hardened: Tailwind _ a segment originally called ``Valley of
Death'' _ was a bad story. Rarely is there a dissenting voice.
</P>
<P>
   Except for April Oliver's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still to this day think we put an accurate story on the air
that is supportable,'' asserts Oliver, who spent the last decade of
her career at PBS and then CNN. ``Whether or not the public has any
interest left I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the defrocked journalist, who is suing both CNN and
retired Army Major General John K. Singlaub over the story, seems
hellbent on vindication. On the other, the 38-year-old mother of
two young kids, who is now studying law at George Mason University,
says ``I'm moving on with my life. I don't want to live my life
bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outside observers can pass definitive judgment on the
veracity of ``Valley of Death.'' But Hodding Carter III, president
of the Knight Foundation and a former boss of Oliver's at PBS, says
that ``she was probably as enthusiastically committed to what I
understand to be the best instincts and principles of journalism''
as anyone. ``If she is convinced that the story is right on the
merits, (she should) fight to the last barricade. I'm a believer in
nothing's over till it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams, who helped seal
Oliver's fate by co-authoring the Tailwind post-mortem that advised
CNN to ``retract the story and apologize,'' thinks she has suffered
unduly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am . . . sorry that the effect of this was to keep her from
working elsewhere,'' he says. Other news outlets are ``making a
mistake in not making use of her talents. It's a sad result that
because of this effort, she's out of journalism altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver was driven out of journalism by a tidal wave of
condemnation. The report that Abrams authored at CNN's behest found
the story ``insupportable.'' Both CNN and sister company Time
magazine, which ran a companion Tailwind article, apologized and
retracted. CNN military adviser Perry Smith, a retired Air Force
major general, resigned to protest the telecast, for which he was
not consulted. And ``Valley of Death'' was exhaustively dissected
by the American Journalism Review (``An Ill Tailwind'') and the
Columbia Journalism Review (``Ten Mistakes That Led to the Great
CNN-Time Fiasco.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oliver found herself with few defenders. ``When push
came to shove, I didn't have that network,'' she says. ``I was
deeply hurt by the lack of support within the journalism community.
. . . It's just a much easier script to buy that I'm the renegade
producer who went astray.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN and parent company Time Warner declined comment
on all matters related to Tailwind. Arnett, who initially responded
to the furor by saying he had played only a minor role as the
program's narrator, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Singlaub has sued CNN, Time Inc., Time Warner
Inc., Arnett, and Oliver for defamation and intentional infliction
of emotional distress for being ``falsely quoted'' and ``falsely
portrayed as a participant in Tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking to try his best to polish up his tarnished
reputation. He feels that they branded him as a war criminal,
wrongfully,'' says Singlaub attorney Keith Mitnik, adding ``that if
we go trial'' he will be seeking damages in the ``significant seven
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub himself says that he ``was initially suspicious'' that
Oliver's vehement defense of the story was designed to ``reduce
(CNN's) liability in a lawsuit.'' Now, he says the ``very anti-CNN
remarks she's made in her public utterances clearly indicate she's
not interested in helping CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's attitude toward her former employer is manifest in her
cross-claim against CNN: She is seeking damages for, among other
things, ``defamation,'' ``intentional infliction of emotional
distress,'' and ``invasion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN's decision to publicly retract the report, apologize to
the military, and terminate the employment of Oliver and Smith was
based primarily on business and public relations concerns,'' her
suit states. ``CNN decided to destroy Oliver's career for its own
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oliver has also filed a counterclaim against Singlaub,
asserting that in interviews she did while working on the Tailwind
story, he ``expressly confirmed'' the allegations in the story that
he then denounced as erroneous after the program aired.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran journalist Smith, who has slipped from public view, will
begin teaching a course on politics and the press at DePaul and
Loyola of Chicago universities this fall. He is still angry about
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a young reporter who had her throat cut by a no-guts
management early in her career and she's not gonna' take it,'' he
says, of Oliver. ``I think the whole matter of investigating secret
operations by the US military _ that's what's at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, mediator Jonathan Marks will attempt to nudge the
parties in this dispute to some kind of settlement. That'll be no
mean feat. Like Mitnik, Oliver's attorney, Roger Simmons, talks
about the price of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``April's attitude is that she simply wants to have her good
name back,'' he says. ``The number we've thrown out is the $5
million number.''
</P>
<P>
   If mediation fails, Oliver says, she has ``a short list of
people I want to put on the hot seat'' by deposing CNN founder Ted
Turner, Time Warner boss Gerald Levin, former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, and former CIA director Richard Helms.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to seem like a zealot when you're in Oliver's
position, poring over documents and depositions for nuggets and
nuance. She produces a 1970 New York Times newsclip quoting a
former Army officer saying he'd seen lethal nerve gas stored in
South Vietnam, and a report of complaints that US planes had
sprayed ``toxic'' and fatal chemicals over Laotian towns during the
war. She and Simmons are heartened because they believe that
Admiral Thomas Moorer _ who was used as a confirming source in the
Tailwind program, but later backed off _ confirmed the accuracy of
Oliver's interview notes in a recent deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me six months to really believe in her story,'' says
attorney Simmons. ``People have forgotten what the Vietnam War was
about and how the coverups happen. . . . I represent a lot of
investigative journalists. They take a lot of risks and get their
heads kicked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is still immersed in Tailwind litigation and writing a
book about what she calls the ``the double coverup'' _ the one in
Laos in 1970 and the one ``inside the CNN executive suite.'' But
she also talks about change, about moving away from Washington. She
recalls how in one brief span during her decade-long residence
here, she ran into ``a bunch of fallen celebrities'' _ former Gary
Hart paramour Donna Rice; former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara,
who has apologized for his role in the Vietnam War; and former
Redskins football star Dexter Manley, whose career was punctuated
by drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should have been a cautionary lesson about how this town
can eat you alive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver also thinks a lot about a new career in law. ``This was a
huge earthquake and it changes a person,'' she says. ``I don't know
how hireable I'll be. Maybe the law is an area where a little bit
of hubris is appreciated.''

BUSH SHOULD EMBRACE THE KING OF STRAIGHT TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If George W. Bush is as smart and savvy and secure as his
anxious pals keep assuring us he really is, then his running mate
is making a public appearance in Boston Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain makes a Rocky-like return to the scene of
his triumphs in New England, so recent on the calendar, so long ago
in political terms. The Arizona Kid who came from nowhere to
clobber Dubbaya in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Connecticut signs books from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Kennedy
Library.
</P>
<P>
   King of all New England except Maine, where he lost by a
whisker, McCain will lead a sizeable contingent of Republican
convention delegates to Philadelphia at the end of July. His last
appearance hereabouts was a sprightly and well-attended kick-butt
rally that filled Copley Square the Saturday before he whupped Bush
silly in the March 7 Yankee primaries.
</P>
<P>
   That morning McCain upbraided Bush for gutter campaigning in
colluding with a last-minute smear campaign by two Texas pals of
Bush who mugged McCain with $2 million in smear ads. McCain
demanded that the governor of the Lone Star State ``take that dirty
money back to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But after getting rolled up in subsequent primaries, McCain did
the smart thing, the practical thing, the right thing, and folded
his operation, abandoning the fray, but holding onto his delegates
in order to take care of his people at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, McCain is negotiating
terms for his troops as a battlefield commander who has been
out-numbered, out-gunned, out-supplied, but not out-fought or
out-thought. Bush, for his part, has been slow to accommodate to
the reality that McCain is still a force to be reckoned with in
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest move Bush could make would be to embrace McCain's
personality, accommodate to a reasonable degree with McCain's
reformist agenda on money in politics, and make the acknowledged
MVP of the primary season his running mate. McCain brings his
record as a proven vote-getter, his blow-torch rhetoric against Al
Gore, and much more standing on the money-corrupting-politics issue
than Bush can sustain on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Would McCain take the No. 2 slot? ``He's said so many times he
flat out won't do it,'' said Jean Inman, chairwoman of the McCain
campaign in Massachusetts. ``I just don't see him going back on
that. He's never even leaned a little towards it in any
conversation. I see him sticking to his belief he can serve his
country better in the Senate or in some other role.'' Maybe she's
right.
</P>
<P>
   But if the party elders work to convince McCain that Bush cannot
win without McCain on the ticket, I think McCain would go for it.
Why not? McCain would be 67 if he tried to run again in 2004,
presuming Bush lost; that's possibly too old. If the offer is
phrased a summons to duty, McCain would have to think hard about
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like McCain has thumbed his nose at Bush. McCain has
said and done all the right things since conceding. His minions
have negotiated the convention arrangements with the Bush high
command. As a result, Governor Paul Cellucci, our
incredibly-shrinking governor, won't have to wear a page's pass to
get in the convention hall. Cellucci keeps getting marginalized
everyway he turns. But at least he'll be an official delegate,
thanks to McCain's camp awarding Cellucci and six of his
hench-persons delegate passes, while Inman will lead the remaining
30 Bay State delegates for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Similar deals were announced Wednesday for Vermont (McCain gives
Bush three of the 12 delegates), Rhode Island (McCain gives four of
14 delegates to Bush), and Connecticut (Bush gets 4 of the 25). But
like a Confederate officer holding onto his sword, his pistol and
his horse, McCain is setting up Straight Talk America, a political
action committee to fund his campaigning for the 40-plus Republican
House members and other GOP candidates who recognize his drawing
power on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaigns Saturday in Rhode Island for newly-appointed
Senator Lincoln Chafee, and appears also in Connecticut and New
York. Come convention time, McCain will roll into Philly from
Washington aboard the Straight Talk Express, the symbolic battle
bus of the McCain rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty Arizonan will not be dependent on the kindness of
strangers in the Bush machine to get his message. He is not without
options. Remaining as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee is
not chopped liver. And it's theoretically conceivable he might
succumb to the temptation of being a Bush cabinet appointee, say
State or Defense. McCain's incredible popularity with military
folks, from the GI families on food stamps to the veterans peeved
about benefit cuts, would make him a natural for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's notorious independence and outspokenness would
probably rule him out of consideration for a cabinet job. I still
think the vice presidential nomination is an option. It would give
Bush a shot at independents and crossover Democrats who flocked to
McCain last winter. And Bush could control a vice president easier
than a cabinet officer. But Bush has yet to demonstrate the
subtlety and surefootedness that would be required to entice McCain
into accepting the No. 2 job.

A MIAMI ICON BECOMES A TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Just as it appeared that the Elian crazies had no more
barricades to conquer, they found a new focus for their anger.
Unlike attorney Gregory Craig or Bill Clinton, this foe is one many
of them know well: Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for Janet, a personality so well-known in
this community that thousands of people who've never met her talk
about her as if she were an old acquaintance. She long ago attained
first-name status, joining such local legends as Edna (Buchanan),
Dan (Marino) and Fidel.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have taken to demonstrating outside her small house
at the edge of the Everglades, and the Secret Service has been busy
checking death threats phoned in to Spanish-language radio
stations. Even given the high tensions of the moment, this
animosity is very startling, and no less sad.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up here, worked here as a reporter, and watched her
career unfold, I feel safe saying this: No one, absolutely no one,
loves Miami more than Janet Reno does. For the mayor of Metro-Dade
County, a fool named Alex Penelas, to stand up as he did last week
and declare that she would be ``held accountable'' if the riot that
he tried to incite comes about is just a measure of how unglued
parts of this community have become.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has a long acquaintance with criticism, here and elsewhere.
Less than two years after becoming state attorney for the county in
1980, her office was defeated at the trial of seven police officers
accused of the beating death of a black motorcyclist. She was
pilloried, especially in the black community, and ``Reno! Reno!''
was one of the signature chants of the riot that followed the
verdict, a bloodbath that left 17 dead and the black neighborhood
of Liberty City in enduring chaos.
</P>
<P>
   She spent much of the next year talking to any black group that
would have her, explaining how her office tried the case, why it
lost, what she would have done differently. I saw some of those
sessions, and still remember how well she handled herself. She
listened as much as she talked, and many people who expected to
hate her were surprised to come away not only liking but respecting
her.
</P>
<P>
   Given her history, Reno is a link between old Miami and the new
city that has emerged. She suceeded Richard Gerstein, an
old-fashioned liberal who was a relic of Miami's almost-forgotten
days as Democratic turf. Reno easily won five elections running as
a Democrat in a city in which they were vanishing _ evidence of,
among other things, her strong standing with the Cuban-American
community gaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's popularity was not always easy to fathom. She famously
does not suffer fools; people still talk about the time she
declared a group of juvenile court judges ``dunderheads'' and
walked out of the conference they were holding. She is not
especially warm. Even old friends laugh about their icy encounters
with her over the years. Her record, especially on public
corruption, remains a matter of some dispute. But she cared deeply
and projected great integrity, and got through on respect rather
than charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day she moved to Washington, she lived in a monument
to eccentricity, a little stone house her mother built with her own
hands in South Dade. Both her parents were reporters. Her father,
Henry, covered the cops for 40 years at the Miami Herald. Her
mother, Jane Wood Reno, was one of the great colorful characters of
local journalism, a star at the late and much lamented Miami News.
Except for college and law school and her time in Washington, Reno
has lived in Miami every day of her life, most of it in the house
now under heavy police guard.
</P>
<P>
   After a distiguished, if tumultuous, tenure as Attorney General
she plans to move back home. No outcome in this case would be
likely to change that. Wednesday, I asked Seymour Gelber, her
friend of more than 30 years and a former mayor of Miami Beach, if
he thought she would still return to Miami, given the animosity
here.
</P>

CHECKING THE CHILD WARS

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An exchange between a 7-year-old and his 5-year-old sister:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know you were born as a puppy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes you were. I was there. I saw you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were too! Were too!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate you! I hate you! Mommyyyyy . . .''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those of us whose children tease and bicker constantly, the
sound is like water torture: One more drip and you'll go out of
your mind. No wonder we throw up our hands in despair, roll our
eyes in exasperation, or yell at them out of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sighing or shouting may be human, but it isn't helpful: The
number-one reason siblings bicker is to get our attention.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean we aren't giving them enough attention as it
is. ``I look at it this way,'' says psychologist Peter Goldenthal,
author of ``Beyond Sibling Rivalry'' (Owl Books). ``Kids don't
respond to a good enough job. They always want more of us, even
just 15 seconds more.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they don't care if it's 15 negative seconds, so
when we roll our eyes or throw up our hands, we become enablers,
participants in a familiar and comforting script: ``OK, here we go
again.'' And what could be more reinforcing than the power and
attention that come from getting Dad so riled up he shouts ``I
can't stand another second of this bickering! Go to your rooms!''
and cleans up the mess himself? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Terms of endearment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While teasing and bickering is primarily for our benefit, there
are other reasons it happens. The 7-year-old who told his sister
she was a puppy, for instance, may actually have been trying to be
nice, not nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Family counselor Nancy Samalin, founder and director of Parent
Guidance Workshops in New York City, came to this realization when
her sons Eric and Todd were 9 and 10. Todd was going away for the
weekend, and Eric left him a note to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a messy, torn piece of paper with a horrible, insulting
message,'' says Samalin. ``I thought Todd would be furious, but it
made him laugh uproariously.'' She pauses. ``That's when it hit me:
This was a love letter, the closest Eric could come to saying,
`I'll miss you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Samalin says this ``sibling-ese'' is a way of expressing
affection and intimacy and is often what's behind bickering and
teasing. Goldenthal agrees. ``Some kids are just at an awkward age
or don't know how to express affection positively to a sibling,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Samalin says bickering typically indicates a level of
security and comfort, not animosity. ``You bottle up anger and
frustration all day at school, and then you come home and take it
out on someone you feel safe with,'' says Samalin. In fact, she
adds, ``Don't assume that because kids fight, they'll hate each
other when they grow up. One has nothing to do with the other.''
She is the author of ``Loving Each One Best: A Caring and Practical
Approach to Raising Siblings'' (Bantam). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Natural frictions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of times when bickering does reflect
temporary hatred and unhappiness, and/or significant differences,
says parent educator Adele Faber, co-author of the best-selling
book ``Siblings Without Rivalry'' (Avon).
</P>
<P>
   ``Two siblings like loud music, the third doesn't. One likes to
draw, two think drawing is stupid. These are natural frictions.
Even the best marriage has them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As natural as bickering may be, it can't be left unchecked.
``That leaves at least one child feeling unsafe,'' says Faber. On
the other hand, it's a mistake to impose rules or solutions. ``When
the solution is a parent's decision, kids only get invested in
fighting more. When it's their decision, their investment is in
making it work,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As in the best marriage, the trick is to respect differences.
``I'm looking for more than managing the children,'' Faber says.
``My goal is to empower children to manage themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping bickering in check is a process that begins in the
toddler and preschool years by setting ground rules _ ``There is no
hitting or grabbing in this house, and no teasing'' _ as well as
expectations: ``In our family, when someone is upset, we use words
to describe what we want and how we feel. We don't use words to
hurt people.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Strategies to use &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When an infraction occurs, here's what Faber suggests:
</P>
<P>
   --Restate the problem. Ask each child to describe the problem,
then restate it yourself: ``You both want to sit in the same chair,
and you each were mean to the other. Is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   --Acknowledge feelings. ``No wonder you're both so upset, this
is a hard problem! Two brothers want to sit in the same chair at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   --State the rule. ``You know the rule: We don't say anything
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   --Offer options. ``Let's figure out what you can do to solve
this problem. Should you set a timer, so you each have a turn? Can
two brothers sit in the chair together?''
</P>
<P>
   --Express confidence in them: ``Jeff, I think you are a fair
person. Matt, you're also a reasonable person.''
</P>
<P>
   --Walk away: ``I trust you two to work this out in a way that's
fair to you, Jeff, and to you, Matt.'' Don't go too far away in
case things accelerate, but resist going back in unless it does.
Psychologist Phyllis Sonnenschein of Families First Parenting
Programs in Cambridge, Mass. recommends the Toilet Technique: ``Go
sit on the toilet and resist the urge to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   If bickering escalates or graduates to hitting or pushing, you
do need to intervene: ``This is a dangerous situation. You three
are so angry with one another, you can't work this out. You each
need to go to a separate room to cool off.'' Children are usually
grateful for this, says Faber: ``They don't like it when bickering
escalates but they need a face-saving way to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this takes patience and repetition, she says, but the more
you put the problem back in their hands, the less bickering there
will be. One of her favorite anecdotes involves six siblings. She
knew she'd had a breakthrough when they were fighting for a turn on
the swing and were able to negotiate themselves: Each person would
have 10 swings apiece, they'd take turns pushing, and they would
all count out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Empowering children is not the same as yelling in to them from
the next room, ``Work it out, kids!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives permission for the oldest or more powerful to turn
to the youngest or weakest (and say): `I'll kill you if you don't
let me go first,' '' says Faber. A better response: ``Do you three
need help or can you work it out yourselves?'' That gives
permission to any one of them to say, ``Yes, we need help,'' and it
states clearly that all of them need to work equally on the
solution. &QL;

SEPTIC TANKS. `PRO' WRESTLING. NEED WE SAY MORE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unusual credit ``based on World Championship Wrestling
characters'' will be enough to keep some folks away from ``Ready to
Rumble''; the discovery that the wrestling scenes are among the
movie's most highbrow will probably seal the deal. Yet this
slovenly comedy appeals to certain base instincts, such as wanting
to see David Arquette take some sort of punishment after all those
blasted, annoying (800) CALL-ATT commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Arquette and Scott Caan play Gordie and Sean, Wyoming
septic-tank cleaners with an unbalanced obsession for wrestling and
especially for their hero, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt, making like
he's auditioning to play Fat Elvis). Gordie and Sean are more
enamored of ``The King'' than they are of the women at the local
fast-food joint, and get a rare chance to see him live when the WCW
comes to Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, they also get to see their idol mercilessly pummeled
during a career-ending ``massacre'' engineered by backstabbing WCW
honcho Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano). With King at rock bottom
and their own lives just as low, Gordie and Sean decide that
there's only one thing to do: Help their fallen fave make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The recent wrestling documentary ``Beyond the Mat'' informed us
that wrestlers have their flawed human sides, a none-too-startling
revelation that led the World Wrestling Federation to withdraw
support for the film. Rival WCW has no such problem with ``Ready to
Rumble,'' lending many of its real-life stars to a story that
portrays King as a drunken bum who's also a bad son, husband and
father. But Gordie and Sean whip him into shape with the help of a
still-spry wrestling legend (Martin Landau, showing just what being
an Oscar winner means in a brief but lively role) and a Nitro girl
(Rose McGowan) whose seduction of Gordie isn't all that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   It's all even more diagrammed and predictable than real pro
wrestling, but the ring scenes are undeniably exciting if you're up
for this sort of stuff. They're certainly better than the movie's
opening 20 minutes or so, a nonstop barrage of scatalogical humor
and standbys such as the swearing, lecherous old lady (''The
Wedding Singer's'' Ellen Albertini Dow, who should patent this
role). Richard Lineback enlivens things somewhat as Gordie's
father, a trigger-happy state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   A final word of warning to the unsuspecting: ``Ready to Rumble''
is quite possibly the most violent PG-13 movie ever, replete with
so many crotch kicks (including a final-credit montage) that it's
sure to hold the record for this gag unless someone makes a movie
called ``Groin Injury.'' But it's nothing to criticize the ratings
board for. After all, it's all fake.

GENIAL CHARACTERS HELP `RETURN TO ME' OVERCOME FLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, a movie comes along that breaks down
resistance, that shares flaws with similar films but overcomes them
through some mystical bit of creative alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hunt's ``Return to Me'' is that kind of movie; it commits
a certain number of storytelling sins, such as centering its plot
on an enormous coincidence and a secret that a character must keep
because, if it were divulged, there'd be no more movie. And when it
needs an easy laugh, it leans a little too much on the cuteness of
animals, children and old men.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it succeeds, thanks to appealing characters, sharp
dialogue and an atmosphere that varies from boisterous to
melancholy without losing its balance. In her directorial debut,
Hunt _ who also co-wrote and appears in a supporting role _ shows a
talent for putting what she's got to its best use. That shows most
in the performance of David Duchovny, who brings his laconic
everyguy charm to a relaxed and varied turn as Bob Rueland, a
Chicago architect whose lovingly cute relationship with his
zoologist wife Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) ends in tragedy when
she dies in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bob spends a lot of time in mournful moping, letting his home
and his appearance go to seed and finding little solace in his
Great Dane, who still stares at the door waiting for Elizabeth to
come home months after her death. Encouraged by an upbeat friend
(David Alan Grier), Bob picks himself up long enough to go on a
blind date with a woman who turns out to be an obnoxious loudmouth
lawyer (Hunt's longtime crony Holly Wortell, in a brief but
scene-stealing role). But it's the waitress Bob clicks with: She's
Grace (Minnie Driver), a heart-transplant recipient trying to get
over her self-consciousness about her scars and join the dating
game. Which she does, reluctantly, with the affable and persistent
Bob in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt filmed the movie in her hometown of Chicago, even going
back to her old neighborhood for some scenes, and she drenches the
city with so much Windy City ambience that you can practically
smell the sausage links. Well, the pasta sauce, anyway _ Grace
works at an Italian-Irish restaurant owned by her Irish grandfather
(Carroll O'Connor, trying out an Irish brogue) and inhabited by her
Italian uncle (Robert Loggia) and a multiethnic crew of other aging
widowers. Without forcing the matter, Hunt does a better job of
portraying a melting pot than James Toback does with his much more
serious-intentioned multiracial ``Black and White.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, she does it without resorting to too many obnoxious
characters, aside from Wortell's date from hell and a similarly
disastrous blind date for Grace (played amusingly by
co-screenwriter Don Lake). Even James Belushi has a slovenly appeal
as the husband of Grace's best friend, played by Hunt with her
typical supportive warmth. The likable characters, and Duchovny and
Driver's surprising chemistry, help ``Return to Me'' transcend its
problems and turn it into an affectionate winner.

FATHER OF CUBAN CHILD ARRIVES WITH HOPES OF A SWIFT REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hour after sunrise, the jet carrying the father of Elian
Gonzalez touched down Thursday at an airport near Washington, D.C.,
and Juan Miguel Gonzalez set foot on U.S. soil, vowing to take his
son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly impatient to have him returned to me as soon as
possible and go back to Cuba together immediately,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzalez said in Spanish at a news conference at Dulles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   After more than four months of separation, he said he wanted to
embrace his 6-year-old son. Elian is being cared for by his
great-uncle in Miami, and the relatives there resumed negotiations
with federal officials Thursday morning as Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
his wife and their infant son were whisked off to a Cuban
diplomat's suburban home, where they will stay.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is appealing in a U.S.
district court in Atlanta to compel the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to grant the boy an asylum hearing. Like
many Cuban-Americans who oppose President Fidel Castro's communist
regime, the great-uncle is reluctant to see Elian returned to Cuba.
He has said he will talk with Elian's father about the boy's future
if the father comes to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the lawyer for the father, said he traveled to
Cuba on Tuesday and put Juan Miguel Gonzalez's trip into motion
because the INS had said it was negotiating for a transfer of
custody to the father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was discovered by fishermen floating in an inner-tube off
the Florida coast in November, one of three survivors of a capsized
refugee boat. His mother, who was divorced from the his father, and
10 other Cubans drowned. The INS gave Elian temporary residency
status and placed him in the care of his great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the news conference of his son's ordeal, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez said, ``As if his mother's disappearance before his eyes
and the miracle of his arrival have not inflicted enough damage, he
has had to spend time under the temporary custody of some distant
relatives who had never seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Defying the shouts of anti-Castro protesters gathered at the
airport, he further criticized the boy's exposure to the hostile
politics that have characterized relations between Cuba and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his personality
already weakened by the terrible trauma,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez
said. ``Worse still, Elian has been paraded and exhibited in public
rallies and by the media with a clear intent to obtain political
advantage from this tragedy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Juan Miguel Gonzalez's arrival gives Justice Department
and INS officials more leverage in negotiating for Elian's
handover, it was not clear Thursday morning exactly what role the
father would play in the process. Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his
family are staying at the home of Fernando Remirez, head of the
Cuban diplomatic mission, in Bethesda, Maryland. Remirez said the
diplomatic immunity status of his residence was being dropped
during Juan Miguel Gonzalez's stay. That would put the home under
the jurisdiction of the U.S. government rather than the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they might meet with the
father as early as Thursday, but have made no plans for him to go
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe reuniting Elian with his father is not only a matter
of federal law, not only a matter of immigration law, it is simply
the right thing to do,'' Eric Holder, deputy attorney general, said
at a news conference Thursday morning in Washington. ``The father
and his son need to be together, and in the coming days we will do
all that we can to ensure that that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said no law prevents Gonzalez from leaving the country
immediately if he is given custody of his son, but he said he
believes the father is willing to stay through the legal appeals
process. The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has said
it will hear oral arguments starting the week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Thursday, outside the yard where Elian played on a
slide and fired toy guns Thursday morning, about 70 Cuban-American
protesters prepared for what they believe may be a bitter fight.
For days, they have practiced forming a human chain to block
federal officials if they come to retrieve Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Castro said Elian's father could come to the United
States alone if he could bring his son back to Cuba immediately.
But if he would have to wait in the United States through the
appeals process, Castro said Juan Miguel Gonzalez would have to be
accompanied by an entourage of 27 other people including Elian's
classmates, teachers and relatives, as well as child psychiatrists,
doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Gonzalez said President Castro ``has been like a
brother, giving me advice and support through our long days of pain
and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the State Department granted six visas, but three
recipients _ Elian's kindergarten teacher, a close cousin and a
pediatrician _ did not accompany the father. Juan Miguel Gonzalez
urged the U.S. government to allow the rest of the entourage to
come, saying that it would be in the best interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will also need the counseling of specialists and a
propitious environment with his classmates and teachers to help him
back to his old routine of family life, schooling and playing with
his friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Juan Miguel Gonzalez prepared on Wednesday for his trip,
Castro spoke in Havana before hundreds of university students from
across Latin America and the Caribbean who had gathered for a
regional congress. Castro predicted that Elian and his father would
be reunited soon. ``It is inevitable,'' he said.

MICROSOFT MONOPOLY IS A GLOBAL CONCERN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There is no more compelling symbol of globalization than
the one evoked by Microsoft. Its reach seems unlimited and its
ambitions are universal. And it represents more than porous borders
that let athletic shoes and hamburgers come from anywhere and go
anywhere, offering hungry peasants the opportunity to become sweat
shop workers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the result of the technological conquest of time
and distance, but the technology itself, evolving so fast that its
creators can scarcely imagine what will come next. But they are
convinced that they must hurry up or they will be left behind in
the new race for the power that ``intelligence technology,''
computing and communicating can bring.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have a passport and its boss is not elected, not even
chosen by stockholders because he owns so much of the stock
himself. He is so rich that he can give away a hundred million
dollars without feeling a dent.
</P>
<P>
   So an American court's decision that this colossus is breaking
the law and must be forced to atone for its transgressions imposes
a startling change in perspective. The U.S. government didn't ask
anybody else about regulating Microsoft, or what the consequences
may be for other countries if the company is broken up or
remodeled. It is a matter of purely national antitrust law, and no
international agreements or obligations are involved.
</P>
<P>
   There was an effort to negotiate a settlement between Microsoft
and the government that would have avoided a judicial decision, but
it broke down. No doubt there will be an appeal, and the case is
likely to drag on for a long time and at great expense. There will
be all kinds of efforts at lobbying, overt and not so
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   But the point has already been made. The United States, by
itself, can overrule Microsoft and nobody else can have any say
about it. That is superpower, and for all the talks and disputes
and pretense of sovereign equality, it is a reminder that the
United States can dominate.
</P>
<P>
   The bewildered behavior of stock markets at the news was another
reminder of how intricately interdependent the world's economy has
become. In the years right after World War II _ when the dollar was
the only reliable currency (except for the Swiss franc) and
everybody's recovery and reconstruction depended on American help _
they used to say, ``When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches
pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Today there is a nervous sense that there would scarcely be time
to take your temperature. The extraordinary gains of the stock
markets in recent years, especially in high tech companies, have
come with the full realization that there is an enormous gap
between value projected from future earnings and value reflected
from goods and services produced. It could be called the
psycho-economy. Everything depends on confidence.
</P>
<P>
   So there is very good reason for the rest of the world to watch
closely the dispute between Microsoft and the U.S. government.
Careful attention must also be paid to how those tribulations may
be interpreted by investors and speculators.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian financial crises broke a few years ago, followed
by Brazil and Russia, there was a quick sense of the global
economy's common stakes in palliating breakdowns. The international
response was sensitive and realistic. Instead of the kind of panic
and beggar-thy-neighbor responses that turned 1929 bank and credit
failures in Europe into a long and devastating global recession,
there were rescue missions and firebreaks.
</P>
<P>
   For lack of foresight, however, they weren't as good as they
might have been. There was much talk at the time of developing
better international surveillance of financial movements so that
governments need not be overwhelmed by the integration of THE
market.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure of necessity ebbed, as did political will.
Nothing much was done to show recognition that new economic
circumstances require new political decisions, now quite
necessarily on an international level.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, the Microsoft case renews the sense of need
to strike a balance between the dynamics of totally unrestrained
markets and governments' itch to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The American antitrust laws were passed at the beginning of the
century in reaction to the terrible excesses of robber-baron
capitalism. It was seen that free markets require that the
government take steps to protect the chance for fair competition.
Microsoft, dealt with as a purely U.S. concern, shows that this is
now true on a global level and should have global coordination.

&HT;     STANFORD PLAYER OVERCOMES AILMENTS TO RETURN TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER ARGYRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ When a ruptured spleen brought on by a severe
case of mononucleosis sidelined Stanford tennis ace K.J.
Hippensteel in January, doctors told him he would have to ``kiss
the season goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel was having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked too hard this summer to have a season just lost like
that,'' said Hippensteel, who was coming off an NCAA singles title.
``This was going to be a big year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So the top-ranked collegiate singles player worked his way back
into form in time for the stretch run at another team title and
individual honors.
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel's return to singles will come Friday when
third-ranked Stanford hosts UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tough to go down like that, when I was playing
at the top of my game, but it feels good to be back,'' said
Hippensteel, who did not know he had mono at the time of his
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``K.J. is a great team leader,'' Stanford coach Dick Gould said.
``His return is a tremendous boost to the whole team. I've never
seen a bigger smile on a guy than the day when K.J. was cleared to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould said his players were sorry to see Hippensteel go down but
were quick to pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``no one loves to compete more than K.J., so it was
disheartening for us to lose him when he was playing so well,''
Gould said. ``But I was really impressed with how they played
without him, how we were able to stay undefeated. It's quite
remarkable really, and a testament to this team's strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould praised Alex Kim and Geoff Abrams, who have split time at
No. 1 singles since Hippensteel went down. He has not played a
singles match since Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel will be eased back into the lineup, Gould said. The
coach isn't worried about what slot Hippensteel will fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about getting my guys healthy and doing
well in the team championships,'' Gould said. ``Whom I play at what
spot will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel said he respects Gould's decision, wherever he puts
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Gould knows what's best for the team, where to put his
guys in the lineup,'' he said. ``I just need to focus playing my
best and getting my singles confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   As an unseeded entrant in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association
All-American Championships in Austin, Texas, in October,
Hippensteel beat six of the nation's top 40 players en route to the
No. 1 ranking in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel entered the winter season as the top-ranked player
in Division I, and was the top seed at the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic. But he suffered his injury in his first match at
that event, and was sidelined until his return to doubles action
March 28.
</P>
<P>
   He won the NCAA doubles championship last year with Ryan
Wolters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (15-0) in Friday's rematch with UCLA (16-2) seek to
remain the only undefeated team in Division I. On Feb. 27 in
Louisville, the then-No. 2 Cardinal beat the No. 7 Bruins, 4-3, in
the finals of the National Team Indoor Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Hippensteel admits returning to singles against the top team in
the land is not exactly easing his way back, but he is aching to
get thrown back into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be quite a challenge for me, physically as well as
psychologically, but I'm ready to go. And UCLA will be out to get
back at us after our win in Louisville, for sure,'' he said. ``I
just can't wait to get back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you get up in the morning to practice for.''

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The House has just pulled one of
those transparent political stunts that underestimates the
intelligence of the voters. For the third time in recent years,
conservatives have approved an abortion-procedure ban they know is
going nowhere because President Clinton will veto it. And once
again they put preserving a fetus ahead of protecting the health of

<P>
   WASHINGTON-PROTESTS (Washington) _ Four months after paralyzing
Seattle's meeting of the World Trade Organization, dozens of
protest groups will soon arrive here to make life miserable for two
other multinational financial institutions: the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. The protesters want them to forgive
many nations' debts, pay more attention to the environment and
provide loans that directly help people rather than corporations.
The April 16 and 17 meetings will bring together financial
officials from 182 nations. By MARK HELM.

<P>
   AIDS-FUNDING (Washington) _ Lawmakers may change the way the
federal government distributes $1.6 billion for AIDS care and
prevention. Instead of giving the money just to those with AIDS
cases, they are considering a plan to give part of it also to
people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. By JUDY HOLLAND.

<P>
   You have to love celebrities and their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Campbell appearing nearly nude in ads with the tagline,
``I'd rather go naked than wear fur.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna literally wrapping herself in the American flag for MTV
and cooing, ``If you don't vote, you're going to get a spanky!''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Danson explaining why he's already forgotten more about the
environment than you'll ever learn.
</P>
<P>
   Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger striving valiantly to save those
Manhattan horses from their carriage-pulling enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Goldie Hawn. Actress, singer, dancer, committed
girlfriend to Kurt Russell, devoted mother. Plus she cares! Just
last month, Goldie wrote a letter of concern to legislators in
Maryland, her home state if you can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The topic: Circus elephants. There's a bill before the Maryland
General Assembly that would ban the use of elephants for
entertainment of any kind, and Goldie's all for it.
</P>
<P>
   As she put it in her open letter to the Maryland Judiciary
Committee: ``Circus elephants are denied almost everything
important to them, including family relationships, privacy, mental
stimulation, physical exercise and emotional outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   She's talking about privacy for elephants. How can you not love
that?
</P>
<P>
   As entertaining and informative as it is when celebs are
arrested in the name of their pet causes, it's even more inspiring
when Hollywood stars make the pilgrimage to Washington, D.C., to
testify about issues like starvation (they're almost always against
it) and literacy (they're almost always for it).
</P>
<P>
   Last month Michael Bolton appeared before Congress to deliver
more than 40,000 signatures supporting an extension of the Violence
Against Women Act, which provides funds for programs and shelters
for women who have been abused. There ain't a damn thing funny
about violence against women _ but do we need the man who has
sullied ``When a Man Loves a Woman'' to run point on this issue?
How about an amendment prohibiting Michael Bolton from remaking
golden oldies?
</P>
<P>
   Even better was the all-star panel that met with lawmakers on
March 30 to voice support of the Shambala Wild Protection Act,
which would impose further regulations on the breeding and sale of
large exotic animals. The roster of stars included Melanie
Griffith, her mom, Tippi Hedren, and Bo Derek _ all of whom have
been mauled by lions, if you can believe it. Only Hedren has ever
been mauled by birds, but that wasn't in real life, that was in
``The Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand (so to speak) was Kermit the Frog, who is a hand
puppet. Imagine being the guy who had to crouch under the desk and
manipulate Kermy as he testified to bigwig lawmakers. Quite a life
moment!
</P>
<P>
   Some passionate celebrities and the causes, illnesses or
injustices they've talked about on Capitol Hill:
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tyler Moore, juvenile diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox, Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Judd, hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas, nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep, chemicals in apples.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Cash, copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Hayes, Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   Don Henley, copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Seymour, alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda, flag-desecration amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey, children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen, colorization of classic films.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these appearances have been more compelling than others.
How can anyone be unmoved by Christopher Reeve, speaking from
tragic firsthand experience, about the need for more funding to
find a way to repair spinal cord damage? Then again, how can anyone
but a handful of very famous people care when Paul Reiser speaks
about the need for more legislation protecting the privacy of
celebrities? Not exactly an issue of deep concern to the average
working-class family.
</P>
<P>
   There's something refreshing about good old-fashioned hedonists
like Jack Nicholson, who seem to be interested only in doing
movies, golfing and having a helluva good time. I can't imagine
Jack appearing before a judiciary committee to ask for more funding
to combat rickets or something.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though. No matter what the motives of the celebrity
who vamps for Congress or gets arrested while the cameras click
away, the publicity stunt invariably accomplishes its mission.
Hearings about juvenile diabetes or the plight of Tibetans won't
get a paragraph in most newspapers _ unless somebody famous shows
up to talk about it. Those comments from stars who say things like
``I'm using my celebrity to increase awareness of this terrible
situation'' _ they happen to be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Pretentious to the brink of being insufferable, but accurate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politicians embellish, and Vice President Al Gore
is no exception. But press critics, led by Bob Somerby, Gore's
college roommate, say that media coverage of Gore's exaggerations
have themselves been exaggerated to the point of recklessness.
</P>

   The critics say Gore has been unfairly portrayed as a delusional
``Zelig''-like figure and an untrustworthy political ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the portrait is partly rooted in exaggerated or
inaccurate accounts of Gore claiming he uncovered the Love Canal
toxic waste scandal, ``invented'' the Internet, inspired the novel
``Love Story,'' and spent summers doing back-breaking chores on the
family farm in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts continue to appear in news stories and opinion
columns, and have become a theme of attacks by Gore's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some have become so deeply embedded in the coverage of the
presidential campaign that Gore himself has simply apologized for
misimpressions, apparently in order to avoid further controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line reporters and biographers who know Gore best say
the vice president himself is responsible for the atmosphere of
skepticism that permeates their coverage. His tendency to embellish
his accomplishments and rewrite his biography are well documented,
they note.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coverage of Gore's campaign has triggered a backlash
from media critics and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the venom that the press directs at Al
Gore,'' said Joanne McGlynn, a New Hampshire high school teacher
whose students have been waging their own campaign to correct the
record about a visit Gore made to their school last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, in a recent interview, said, ``The image of the
Washington press corps from `All The President's Men' is a couple
of young guys pounding the pavement, trying to get it right, trying
to beat the other guy. But that's just not the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of being entrepreneurial, they seem to be
desperate to stay on script. There's this tremendous uniformity of
expression. And there is clearly a code of silence _ a tacit
agreement that you never, never criticize another journalist in the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, a native of Boston, delights in boxing the ears of
media stars inside the Washington Beltway from his home in nearby
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Somerby's targets dismiss him and his Web site, The
Daily Howler (www.dailyhowler.com), as an unofficial arm of the
Gore presidential campaign. Somerby shared a dorm room at Harvard
University with Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby remains a friend of the vice president, but denies that
the Gore campaign has any involvement in his efforts. In fact,
Somerby is now beginning to take aim at what he believes is unfair
press coverage of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's likely
opponent in the White House general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent New York Times interview with Bush in which
the paper reported that Bush had said he had not ``learned''
anything from his tough Republican primary contest with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'learn' _ it's like Gore 'inspired' 'Love Story,'
'invented' the Internet, 'discovered' Love Canal,'' said Somerby.
``Those verbs were never uttered by either man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a recent U.S. News and World Report article
which called both Bush and Gore ``dim bulbs.'' ``I don't know
Governor Bush, but I would suggest you can't run a state as big as
Texas if you are a dim bulb,'' he said. ``But it's another case of
the media elite asserting their superiority over politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a recent interview with Cox Newspapers, declined to
address the issue of his ``exaggerations.'' But he referred the
interviewer to Somerby's Web site. ``You'll get a kick out of it,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby taught the fifth grade in Baltimore public schools for
13 years before becoming a stand-up comedian in 1981. He also began
writing free-lance commentaries for the Baltimore Sun, occasionally
in defense of his old Harvard roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby launched the Daily Howler in early 1998 after the Sun
rejected a commentary criticizing media coverage of President
Clinton's political supporters staying overnight in the Lincoln
Bedroom at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, `Ohhh, articles on the national press corps don't
get published,' '' he said, slapping his forehead in mock surprise.
``Articles criticizing Clinton will. Articles criticizing (former
House Speaker Newt) Gingrich will. Articles criticizing The
Washington Post and The New York Times won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two magazine articles highly critical of the Post and the Times
coverage of Gore have been published recently by The Washington
Monthly and Brill's Content. Both articles focused on how difficult
it has been to stop the reverberation of a small reporting error by
the Post and Times about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Love Canal'' incident provides a textbook example of how
the candidate, the press and the public have come to view the
veracity of candidates and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting error grew out of Gore's Nov. 30 visit to Concord
High School in Concord, N.H. In response to a student's question,
Gore cautioned against cynicism about the political process. He
illustrated his point with a story about how he had received a
letter from a high school girl in Tennessee when he was in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which complained about toxic waste in Toone, Tenn.,
eventually led to Gore holding the first congressional hearings on
Love Canal, an upstate New York neighborhood contaminated by
chemical waste during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for a congressional investigation and a hearing,''
Gore said in the course of a seven-minute response. ``I looked
around the country for other sites like that. I found a little
place in upstate New York called Love Canal. Had the first hearing
on that issue, and Toone, Tennessee _ that was the one you didn't
hear of _ but that's was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's Ceci Connolly and the Times's Katharine Seelye quoted
Gore as having said, ``I was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The misquote was widely cited as evidence of Gore's tendency to
exaggerate or falsify his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's George Stephanopoulos said it was an example of Gore's
``Pinocchio problem.'' MSNBC's Chris Matthews, host of the program
``Hardball,'' talked about Gore's ``Zelig'' condition, a reference
to the Woody Allen character who appeared in a procession of
historical events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the guy who said he was the main character in `Love
Story,' `I invented the Internet, I invented Love Canal,' chortled
Matthews. ``Isn't it getting to be delusionary?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews continued in this line even though he had played a tape
of Gore's remarks to correct the Post and Times accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his remarks at Concord High, Gore issued a
statement apologizing for any misimpression he may have created
with his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Post printed a correction seven days after the event, and
the Times printed one after 10 days. In the meantime, both
newspapers ran additional stories exploring Gore's exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   Seelye, in an interview last week, repeated her earlier
contention that the controversy was ``overblown.'' She also noted
that another statement by Gore about Love Canal provided the
context for the misquote. ``The vice president clearly said, 'I
found a little town in upstate New York called Love Canal','' she
said. ``And the vice president has never disputed that quote.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, reluctantly agreeing to discuss the matter last week _
``I don't generally want to be a part of a story,'' she explained _
insisted that ``the one word did not change the context that the
vice president had claimed to have found Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that Gore had apologized for causing a
misunderstanding, ``a rare occurrence with the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor, which helped
publicize the reporting error, said last week that ``in an age in
which this morning's newspaper account is tonight's talk-show
ridicule, the premium on accuracy is higher than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Gore's appearance at Concord High, late-night
comedian David Letterman issued his ``Top Ten Other Achievements
Claimed By Al Gore'' _ ``No. 1, Gave Mankind Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage of Gore's visit prompted the students in Joanne
McGlynn's English class at Concord High to issue their own press
release under the heading: ``Top 10 Reasons Why Many Concord High
Students Feel Betrayed by Some of the Media Coverage of Al Gore's
Visit to Their School.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students are ``still charged up about how things are
covered'' by the media, McGlynn said in a telephone interview from
her school last week. ``They're concerned, but they aren't cynical
... yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlynn said that while Gore had intended to caution her
students about cynicism, ``It was troubling to see that message get
lost because the press is so cynical about politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear him telling that story totally as self-aggrandizing
because that's the story they are ready to hear about Al Gore,''
she said. ``They've got a pre-existing script about Al Gore, and so
that story fit their script.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of a new
biography, ``Inventing Al Gore,'' which includes the inaccurate
``Love Canal'' account, acknowledged that some reporters are ``on a
kind of hair trigger'' with Gore because of earlier exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as ``falsehoods'' Gore's claims that his marijuana
smoking in the 1960s and 1970s was infrequent, that his work as a
newspaper reporter in Tennessee led to the imprisonment of two
Nashville city councilmen, that he took direct enemy fire as an
information specialist in Vietnam, and that he made very few
fund-raising telephone calls from the White House during the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like on `Love Canal' there probably was a rush to
judgment based on some garbled quotes,'' Turque said in an
interview last week. ``But I don't think we're being unfair. What
happens is when you establish a reputation like that, all the
little stuff sticks to you that you might have gotten a pass on if
all this other stuff hadn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Somerby claims that Gore is subjected to a different standard
than the other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby cites the example of McCain, heralded for his honesty
with reporters riding his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was lying straight to their faces that he didn't know
about the Catholic Voter Alert,'' Somerby said, referring to the
McCain-financed organization that was calling Republican voters
with allegations of anti-Catholic bias against Bush during the GOP
primary. ``Meanwhile, they're sifting through 25-year-old letters
Gore wrote to see if they can find some comma out of place, because
the theme on Gore is, Gore makes up things, but McCain is a
straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby said he does not object to criticism of Gore, even from
the Republican National Committee (RNC), which sends faxes to
newsrooms around the country repeating some of the inaccuracies
about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the `Love Canal' case, the RNC actually changed the Gore
misquote to make it grammatically correct. The RNC fax quoted Gore
as saying, ``I was the one who started it all,'' along with an
analysis from RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson: ``It's a pattern of
phoniness _ and it would be funny if it weren't also a little
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Yu, an RNC spokesman, defended the RNC's action. ``We
worked off what was reported and we stand by our statement,'' Yu
said last week. ``Al Gore got caught trying to rewrite history. He
did not find a place in upstate New York called Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it not news that factually inaccurate press releases
are coming out every day and are being written up in major
papers?'' Somerby asked. ``Isn't it the normal process of the press
to sift through everything for accuracy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be,'' said Bob Parry, editor of the investigative
magazine American Dispatches and author of a recent Washington
Monthly cover article, ``He's No Pinocchio: How the Press Has
Exaggerated Al Gore's Exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Journalism 101, especially in political coverage, has been
replaced by journalism that values entertainment above all else,''
Parry said in an interview last week. Parry is and editor of a Web
site, www.consortiumnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas columnist and author of the book ``Fools
For Scandal,'' a scathing critique of the Washington press coverage
of the Clinton presidency, is just as critical of the Gore
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting the news is not enough,'' Lyons said from Little
Rock in a telephone interview last week. ``You've got to be seen to
be witty. You've got to say things cleverly. And you've got to
assert your superiority to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that celebrity journalists ``achieve a
unanimity'' of views because ``they don't have time to do their own
work any more, they're so busy running from one TV station to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Somerby plans the next edition of The Daily Howler
with no illusions that anything in Washington is going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington press corps is where comedy was, say, 12 years
ago _ it's cool to be negative and dark,'' he said. ``But the
comedy world almost killed itself 12 years ago with all that Andrew
Dice Clay negativity. And that's why people are tuning politics
out.''

   WASHINGTON _ Politicians embellish, and Vice President Al Gore
is no exception. But press critics, led by Bob Somerby, Gore's
college roommate, say that media coverage of Gore's exaggerations
have themselves been exaggerated to the point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say Gore has been unfairly portrayed as a delusional
``Zelig''-like figure and an untrustworthy political ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the portrait is partly rooted in exaggerated or
inaccurate accounts of Gore claiming he uncovered the Love Canal
toxic waste scandal, ``invented'' the Internet, inspired the novel
``Love Story,'' and spent summers doing back-breaking chores on the
family farm in Tennessee.

   ``Reporting the news is not enough,'' Lyons said from Little
Rock in a telephone interview last week. ``You've got to be seen to
be witty. You've got to say things cleverly. And you've got to
assert your superiority to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that celebrity journalists ``achieve a
unanimity'' of views because ``they don't have time to do their own
work any more, they're so busy running from one TV station to the
next.''

<P>
   Meanwhile, Somerby plans the next edition of The Daily Howler
with no illusions that anything in Washington is going to change.
</P>

   ``The Washington press corps is where comedy was, say, 12 years
ago _ it's cool to be negative and dark,'' he said. ``But the
comedy world almost killed itself 12 years ago with all that Andrew
Dice Clay negativity. And that's why people are tuning politics
out.''

   WASHINGTON _ In several cases, stories about Vice President Al
Gore's tendency to exaggerate his accomplishments or personal
history have been distorted themselves:

   Al Gore discovered the Love Canal toxic waste dump.

   Misquotes by The New York Times and The Washington Post of
remarks Gore made Nov. 30, 1999, in a campaign visit to Concord
High School in Concord, N.H. The papers quoted him as saying, ``I
was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   REALITY:
</P>

   In exhorting the students to reject cynicism about politics and
government, Gore cited a letter he received as a congressman from a
high school girl in Tennessee about toxic waste in her hometown of
Toone.

   ``I called for a congressional investigation and a hearing,''
Gore said. ``I looked around the country for other sites like that.

   A March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer in which Gore
said, ``During my service in the United States Congress, I took the
initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   REALITY:
</P>
<P>
   Gore was the leader in Congress on the connections between data
transmission and computing power. This information technology
helped transform the tiny ARPANET, created in 1969 by the Defense
Department and used largely by academicians, into what is known as
the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH:
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore claimed he and his wife, Tipper, were the prototypes for
the Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw characters in the movie ``Love
Story,'' which was based on Erich Segal's novel by the same name.
</P>
<P>
   SOURCE:
</P>
<P>
   A Time magazine profile of Gore written by Karen Tumulty that
was based, in part, on a two-hour conversation the vice president
had with reporters on a late-night flight of Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY:
</P>
<P>
   Segal modeled the Ryan O'Neal character on two people: Gore and
one of his Harvard roommate, actor Tommy Lee Jones, who had a small
part in the movie as O'Neal's roommate. The Ali McGraw character
was not based on Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore based his comments to Tumulty and others on erroneous news
accounts of ``Love Story'' in the Nashville Tennessean newspaper
following the 1970 release of the hit movie. ``All I know'' is what
Segal had told reporters in Tennessee, Gore said. Segal confirmed
that the Tennessean ``exaggerated a bit'' in its coverage of the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH:
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore dishonestly portrayed his boyhood summers on the Gore
family farm in Tennessee by fabricating stories of strenuous
chores.
</P>
<P>
   SOURCE:
</P>
<P>
   A March 24, 1999, column in the Washington Post by Michael Kelly
under the headline ``Farmer Al.'' Kelly took fanciful issue with
Gore's description of his relationship with his father during an
interview published March 16, 1999, by the Des Moines Register:
``He taught me how to clean out hog waste with a shovel and a hose.
He taught me how to clear land with a double-bladed ax. He taught
me how to plow a steep hillside with a team of mules. He taught me
how to take up hay all day long in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   REALITY:
</P>
<P>
   Gore's summers in Tennessee were more like character-building
boot camps, according to two critical biographers, Bob Zelnick and
Bill Turque. His chores, which included baling hay, feeding
livestock and shoveling manure, often stretched from sunup to
sundown. His late father once acknowledged that he was ``a little
severe'' the summer regimen he set for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly himself, in a 1987 Gore profile he wrote for the Baltimore
Sun, noted that ``life was different'' for Gore, the son of a
senator, during his chore-filled summers in Tennessee.

<P>
   To save on the huge cost of prison construction, New York has
become one of the first states to segregate two inmates together in
maximum-security cells that prisoners derisively call The Box.
</P>
<P>
   The unorthodox move _ which prison officials call double-bunking
_ changes the definition of solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Amnesty International says such
imprisonment meets the definition of torture under international
law.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal court decisions so far have upheld New
York's prison policies regarding disciplinary confinement. State
officials say the prisoners have brought the punishment on
themselves by bad behavior behind bars, and need to be segregated
in special cells.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, nearly 5,700 prisoners are confined to 23-hour
disciplinary lockdown. That amounts to roughly 8 percent of the
state's 72,000 inmates, four times the national average of about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the following stories and sidebars, Paul Grondahl of the
Albany Times Union takes a look at the increase in maximum-security
confinement and the potential effects on the prison population.

   All stories will move in the NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category).
Here is the story lineup:
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-THE-BOX (Albany, N.Y.) _ Prisoners call it The Box, a
kind of hermetically sealed netherworld, devoid of outside contact.
Nowhere in the world is The Box _ super maximum-security
confinement _ used more than in the United States. Nowhere in
America is it used more than in New York state. Human rights groups
say such imprisonment meets the definition of torture under
international law, and that it violates constitutional prohibitions
against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic: PRISONS-UN
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-PRIEST (Coxsackie, N.Y.) _ For a few hours each day at
New York state's Greene Correctional Facility, the Rev. Joe Ramona
pushed a cart with rosaries, books and spiritual reading material.
What Romano witnessed among these young men, many of them between
the ages of 16 and 19, caused the cleric deep despair. Ultimately,
he said, it hastened his retirement last November after 15 years of
prison work.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-JUDGE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Sol Wachtler wrote court
decisions on solitary confinement as the one-time chief judge of
the state of New York. He also spent a month himself in what he
calls ``the hole'' while serving a federal prison sentence. That
gives him a unique position to assess this form of incarceration in
his book, ``After The Madness: A Judge's Own Prison Memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-PSYCHIATRIST (Undated) _ Dr. Stuart Grassian never set
out to become the country's leading specialist on the psychological
effects of long-term solitary confinement on prisoners. ``I was
shocked to find out that the prison psychiatrists who were supposed
to be doing this job weren't, so I got involved,'' the Harvard
Medical School professor says.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-ARIZONA (Undated) _ After 21 years on death row in the
Arizona state prison system, 14 of them in a solitary confinement,
Paris Carriger was left with a mind and a body eroded by the
ordeal. Carriger, now 55 and living in Oklahoma, was released in
January 1999 after a review of his case and a re-trial that found
him innocent and set him free. Today he cannot find work and
survives on Social Security disability.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-HISTORY (Undated) _ Charles Dickens visited Eastern
Penitentiary in Philadelphia in 1842 and wrote that solitary
confinement is ``immeasurably worse than any torture of the body
... a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up
to stay.'' Dickens' report and other negative reviews roused public
opinion against this form of punishment, yet solitary confinement
has never disappeared from the prison landscape.
</P>
<P>
   With: PRISONS-PUNISHMENT
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-BOX-LIFE (Undated) _ Your fellow inmates call it The
Box, the small maximum-security cells where two convicts are
housed. There are few liberties, and those must be earned through a
system of merits. But if you don't follow the rules, your actions
are punishable by additional time in The Box.

 &HT;    GORE MORE VICTIMIZED THAN GUILTY OF FALSEHOODS, PRESS CRITICS
SAY
 &HT;    1720&AMP;add. With GORE-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politicians embellish, and Vice President Al Gore
is no exception. But press critics, led by Bob Somerby, Gore's
college roommate, say that media coverage of Gore's exaggerations
have themselves been exaggerated to the point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say Gore has been unfairly portrayed as a delusional
``Zelig''-like figure and an untrustworthy political ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the portrait is partly rooted in exaggerated or
inaccurate accounts of Gore claiming he uncovered the Love Canal
toxic waste scandal, ``invented'' the Internet, inspired the novel
``Love Story,'' and spent summers doing back-breaking chores on the
family farm in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts continue to appear in news stories and opinion
columns, and have become a theme of attacks by Gore's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some have become so deeply embedded in the coverage of the
presidential campaign that Gore himself has simply apologized for
misimpressions, apparently in order to avoid further controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line reporters and biographers who know Gore best say
the vice president himself is responsible for the atmosphere of
skepticism that permeates their coverage. His tendency to embellish
his accomplishments and rewrite his biography are well documented,
they note.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coverage of Gore's campaign has triggered a backlash
from media critics and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the venom that the press directs at Al
Gore,'' said Joanne McGlynn, a New Hampshire high school teacher
whose students have been waging their own campaign to correct the
record about a visit Gore made to their school last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, in a recent interview, said, ``The image of the
Washington press corps from `All The President's Men' is a couple
of young guys pounding the pavement, trying to get it right, trying
to beat the other guy. But that's just not the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of being entrepreneurial, they seem to be
desperate to stay on script. There's this tremendous uniformity of
expression. And there is clearly a code of silence _ a tacit
agreement that you never, never criticize another journalist in the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, a native of Boston, delights in boxing the ears of
media stars inside the Washington Beltway from his home in nearby
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Somerby's targets dismiss him and his Web site, The
Daily Howler (www.dailyhowler.com), as an unofficial arm of the
Gore presidential campaign. Somerby shared a dorm room at Harvard
University with Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby remains a friend of the vice president, but denies that
the Gore campaign has any involvement in his efforts. In fact,
Somerby is now beginning to take aim at what he believes is unfair
press coverage of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's likely
opponent in the White House general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent New York Times interview with Bush in which
the paper reported that Bush had said he had not ``learned''
anything from his tough Republican primary contest with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'learn' _ it's like Gore 'inspired' 'Love Story,'
'invented' the Internet, 'discovered' Love Canal,'' said Somerby.
``Those verbs were never uttered by either man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a recent U.S. News and World Report article
which called both Bush and Gore ``dim bulbs.'' ``I don't know
Governor Bush, but I would suggest you can't run a state as big as
Texas if you are a dim bulb,'' he said. ``But it's another case of
the media elite asserting their superiority over politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a recent interview with Cox Newspapers, declined to
address the issue of his ``exaggerations.'' But he referred the
interviewer to Somerby's Web site. ``You'll get a kick out of it,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby taught the fifth grade in Baltimore public schools for
13 years before becoming a stand-up comedian in 1981. He also began
writing free-lance commentaries for the Baltimore Sun, occasionally
in defense of his old Harvard roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby launched the Daily Howler in early 1998 after the Sun
rejected a commentary criticizing media coverage of President
Clinton's political supporters staying overnight in the Lincoln
Bedroom at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, `Ohhh, articles on the national press corps don't
get published,' '' he said, slapping his forehead in mock surprise.
``Articles criticizing Clinton will. Articles criticizing (former
House Speaker Newt) Gingrich will. Articles criticizing The
Washington Post and The New York Times won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two magazine articles highly critical of the Post and the Times
coverage of Gore have been published recently by The Washington
Monthly and Brill's Content. Both articles focused on how difficult
it has been to stop the reverberation of a small reporting error by
the Post and Times about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Love Canal'' incident provides a textbook example of how
the candidate, the press and the public have come to view the
veracity of candidates and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting error grew out of Gore's Nov. 30 visit to Concord
High School in Concord, N.H. In response to a student's question,
Gore cautioned against cynicism about the political process. He
illustrated his point with a story about how he had received a
letter from a high school girl in Tennessee when he was in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which complained about toxic waste in Toone, Tenn.,
eventually led to Gore holding the first congressional hearings on
Love Canal, an upstate New York neighborhood contaminated by
chemical waste during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for a congressional investigation and a hearing,''
Gore said in the course of a seven-minute response. ``I looked
around the country for other sites like that. I found a little
place in upstate New York called Love Canal. Had the first hearing
on that issue, and Toone, Tennessee _ that was the one you didn't
hear of _ but that's was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's Ceci Connolly and the Times's Katharine Seelye quoted
Gore as having said, ``I was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The misquote was widely cited as evidence of Gore's tendency to
exaggerate or falsify his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's George Stephanopoulos said it was an example of Gore's
``Pinocchio problem.'' MSNBC's Chris Matthews, host of the program
``Hardball,'' talked about Gore's ``Zelig'' condition, a reference
to the Woody Allen character who appeared in a procession of
historical events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the guy who said he was the main character in `Love
Story,' `I invented the Internet, I invented Love Canal,' chortled
Matthews. ``Isn't it getting to be delusionary?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews continued in this line even though he had played a tape
of Gore's remarks to correct the Post and Times accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his remarks at Concord High, Gore issued a
statement apologizing for any misimpression he may have created
with his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Post printed a correction seven days after the event, and
the Times printed one after 10 days. In the meantime, both
newspapers ran additional stories exploring Gore's exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   Seelye, in an interview last week, repeated her earlier
contention that the controversy was ``overblown.'' She also noted
that another statement by Gore about Love Canal provided the
context for the misquote. ``The vice president clearly said, 'I
found a little town in upstate New York called Love Canal','' she
said. ``And the vice president has never disputed that quote.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, reluctantly agreeing to discuss the matter last week _
``I don't generally want to be a part of a story,'' she explained _
insisted that ``the one word did not change the context that the
vice president had claimed to have found Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that Gore had apologized for causing a
misunderstanding, ``a rare occurrence with the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor, which helped
publicize the reporting error, said last week that ``in an age in
which this morning's newspaper account is tonight's talk-show
ridicule, the premium on accuracy is higher than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Gore's appearance at Concord High, late-night
comedian David Letterman issued his ``Top Ten Other Achievements
Claimed By Al Gore'' _ ``No. 1, Gave Mankind Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage of Gore's visit prompted the students in Joanne
McGlynn's English class at Concord High to issue their own press
release under the heading: ``Top 10 Reasons Why Many Concord High
Students Feel Betrayed by Some of the Media Coverage of Al Gore's
Visit to Their School.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students are ``still charged up about how things are
covered'' by the media, McGlynn said in a telephone interview from
her school last week. ``They're concerned, but they aren't cynical
... yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlynn said that while Gore had intended to caution her
students about cynicism, ``It was troubling to see that message get
lost because the press is so cynical about politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear him telling that story totally as self-aggrandizing
because that's the story they are ready to hear about Al Gore,''
she said. ``They've got a pre-existing script about Al Gore, and so
that story fit their script.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of a new
biography, ``Inventing Al Gore,'' which includes the inaccurate
``Love Canal'' account, acknowledged that some reporters are ``on a
kind of hair trigger'' with Gore because of earlier exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as ``falsehoods'' Gore's claims that his marijuana
smoking in the 1960s and 1970s was infrequent, that his work as a
newspaper reporter in Tennessee led to the imprisonment of two
Nashville city councilmen, that he took direct enemy fire as an
information specialist in Vietnam, and that he made very few
fund-raising telephone calls from the White House during the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like on `Love Canal' there probably was a rush to
judgment based on some garbled quotes,'' Turque said in an
interview last week. ``But I don't think we're being unfair. What
happens is when you establish a reputation like that, all the
little stuff sticks to you that you might have gotten a pass on if
all this other stuff hadn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Somerby claims that Gore is subjected to a different standard
than the other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby cites the example of McCain, heralded for his honesty
with reporters riding his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was lying straight to their faces that he didn't know
about the Catholic Voter Alert,'' Somerby said, referring to the
McCain-financed organization that was calling Republican voters
with allegations of anti-Catholic bias against Bush during the GOP
primary. ``Meanwhile, they're sifting through 25-year-old letters
Gore wrote to see if they can find some comma out of place, because
the theme on Gore is, Gore makes up things, but McCain is a
straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby said he does not object to criticism of Gore, even from
the Republican National Committee (RNC), which sends faxes to
newsrooms around the country repeating some of the inaccuracies
about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the `Love Canal' case, the RNC actually changed the Gore
misquote to make it grammatically correct. The RNC fax quoted Gore
as saying, ``I was the one who started it all,'' along with an
analysis from RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson: ``It's a pattern of
phoniness _ and it would be funny if it weren't also a little
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Yu, an RNC spokesman, defended the RNC's action. ``We
worked off what was reported and we stand by our statement,'' Yu
said last week. ``Al Gore got caught trying to rewrite history. He
did not find a place in upstate New York called Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it not news that factually inaccurate press releases
are coming out every day and are being written up in major
papers?'' Somerby asked. ``Isn't it the normal process of the press
to sift through everything for accuracy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be,'' said Bob Parry, editor of the investigative
magazine American Dispatches and author of a recent Washington
Monthly cover article, ``He's No Pinocchio: How the Press Has
Exaggerated Al Gore's Exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Journalism 101, especially in political coverage, has been
replaced by journalism that values entertainment above all else,''
Parry said in an interview last week. Parry is and editor of a Web
site, www.consortiumnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas columnist and author of the book ``Fools
For Scandal,'' a scathing critique of the Washington press coverage
of the Clinton presidency, is just as critical of the Gore
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting the news is not enough,'' Lyons said from Little
Rock in a telephone interview last week. ``You've got to be seen to
be witty. You've got to say things cleverly. And you've got to
assert your superiority to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that celebrity journalists ``achieve a
unanimity'' of views because ``they don't have time to do their own
work any more, they're so busy running from one TV station to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Somerby plans the next edition of The Daily Howler
with no illusions that anything in Washington is going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington press corps is where comedy was, say, 12 years
ago _ it's cool to be negative and dark,'' he said. ``But the
comedy world almost killed itself 12 years ago with all that Andrew
Dice Clay negativity. And that's why people are tuning politics
out.''

   &UR; ALBANY, N.Y.: xxx numbing sameness. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner is allowed to leave the main box for one hour each
morning for ``recreation'' in an empty 9-by-7-foot caged balcony
attached to the back of The Box. There are no programs, educational
or otherwise. If SHU prisoners complain or don't follow the rules,
they may get additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   SHU prisoners say they are being treated like animals.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some animals kept in laboratories for scientific
research have more room. A pig, for instance, must be provided at
least 36 square feet of living space under Food and Drug
Administration regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to research swine, New York's SHU prisoners share
about 60 square feet of usable open floor space in The Box. That is
30 square feet per man _ about 16 percent less floor space than
federal regulations require for pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general impression is that this is the old hole,'' Goord
said. ``This is not the old hole. Our new cells are very large.
They have a window and an outside area.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's SHUs meet the accreditation standards of the American
Correctional Association (ACA), a prison industry group in Maryland
to which all 50 states and several foreign countries belong,
according to Robert Verdeyen, director of standards and
accreditation for the ACA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find New York's number of SHU beds out of line,''
Verdeyen said. ``Several courts in the U.S. have held that people
placed in solitary confinement in SHUs that are accredited by us
and follow our standards meet the constitutional minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights groups are working to reduce the burgeoning number
of prisoners confined to SHUs in New York and other states, which
they claim is unconstitutional and a form of torture in United
Nations declarations that the United States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amounts to cruel and inhuman punishment, which is
unconstitutional, and it falls under the international standard of
torture,'' said Angela Wright, an Amnesty International official in
London who is the group's leading researcher on the
maximum-security prisons in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even some correction officials are dubious about over-reliance
on The Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there are only a small number of individuals for whom
the high security of super-max prisons is necessary for defensible
reasons,'' said Chase Riveland, former secretary of the Department
of Corrections in Washington state. Riveland has run prisons in
three states, written extensively on correction policy and received
numerous state and national awards for his work in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this proliferation of super-max prisons is particularly
disturbing to me because it's so generally accepted by correction
officials,'' Riveland said. ``Admittance is driven by open SHU
beds. If you build them, they shall come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put these young men, who are mostly black and
Hispanic, into solitary, any rehabilitation is hopeless,'' Riveland
said. ``They're locked away so tightly, they have no voice. Out of
sight, out of mind is politically attractive. Invisible prisoners
don't rile the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goord and his spokesman, Jim Flateau, defended the sharp
increase of 23-hour disciplinary lockdown under Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Both said the frenzy of SHU bed building was necessary to
relieve pent-up demand among unruly prisoners inadequately
segregated after a decade of soaring inmate populations and a surge
in medium-security prison construction that did not allocate enough
SHU beds.
</P>
<P>
   Goord called SHU cells ``an effective management tool'' that has
helped achieve a decline in prison violence in the past few years.
Inmate-on-staff assaults have dropped 25 percent, from 960 in 1995
to 630 incidents last year. There were similar reported decreases
in inmate-on-inmate assault and in the rate of inmate possession of
weapons, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the bad actors out of the general population and
it's getting results,'' Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll compare my rate of staff injuries and inmate injuries to
any state or federal prison in the country,'' Goord said. ``I'm the
person responsible for controlling violence and creating a safe
prison environment, and I take that responsibility very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the offenses that can land a prisoner in The Box are
these: testing positive for drugs; assault of a correction officer
or another inmate; possession of a weapon; throwing feces or urine
on prison staff; conspiring to create a prison disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Being sentenced to time in The Box has nothing to do with the
violence of the crime that landed the person in prison in the first
place. Convicted murderers or inmates sentenced to life without
parole are not automatically housed in 23-hour lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of SHU is to teach a prisoner that if you act out
and are disruptive, you'll be locked down,'' Flateau said. ``They
knew the rules from day one, and they broke them.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say prisoners are placed in confinement for increasingly
minor infractions. Interviews with more than a dozen SHU prisoners
and their families revealed a pattern of confinement for what
inmates claimed were minor incidents ranging from arguments with
correction officers to the lockdown of a group allegedly involved
in a ``Y2K protest'' leading up to New Year's Day. The protest
involved eating in silence in the mess hall and wearing prison
greens in place of civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into nonsensical claims from inmates,''
Flateau said. ``There's no such thing as a nonviolent demonstration
in prison. The smallest thing could turn it violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics disagree with that argument. ``Our studies show
that many super-max prisoners are not dangerous. They're perceived
as a threat, so they're locked down,'' said James Austin,
co-director of the Institute on Crime, Justice and Corrections at
George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Austin criticized New York and other states that lack a clearly
defined criteria for why prisoners are placed in disciplinary
lockdown and a uniform standard for how much time each infraction
gets in The Box. Furthermore, Austin said, states typically have
only internal review for SHU cases, with no outside scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But Goord said he was comfortable with the review and appeal
process for SHU inmates. The policies of New York's SHUs, bolstered
by case law, also appear to be supported by the correction staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``SHUs have kept the rest of the system safe,'' said Art
Leonardo, a retired prison superintendent at three New York
correctional facilities who spent 32 years working in the state's
prisons. ``I think New York's SHU system is as fair and as humane
as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody comes up with a better solution to solve the
problem of a violent person who's a threat to the staff or other
inmates, I think the SHU beds should continue to grow,'' said Ted
Flegel, a retired officer at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility.
Flegel spent 25 of his 38 years at Coxsackie assigned to the SHU
there.
</P>
<P>
   Flegel described being knocked unconscious in an inmate melee,
being spit upon by inmates and being hit with excrement hurled at
him by prisoners. ``We need the SHU to control those kinds of guys.
It's a deterrent to keep them straight,'' Flegel said.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Prisoners call it The Box.
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of hermetically sealed netherworld, devoid of
outside contact. In New York and elsewhere across the country,
thousands of inmates languish in cells isolated from the general
prison population, locked down for 23 hours a day for months or
even years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no thought of rehabilitation. This is segregation and
removal from human society for prisoners the authorities say need
discipline that ordinary imprisonment does not provide.
</P>
<P>
   The prefabricated, high-tech cellblocks, operated from a central
console station, are eerily efficient. It amounts to incarceration
by remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the world is The Box used more than in the United
States. Nowhere in America is it used more than in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
Amnesty International, say such imprisonment meets the definition
of torture under international law. Prison watchdog organizations
claim it violates the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which
prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In New York _ the state that introduced solitary confinement to
North America in the early 1800s _ nearly 5,700 prisoners are
confined to 23-hour disciplinary lockdown in what prison officials
often call special housing units, or SHUs. That amounts to roughly
8 percent of the state's 72,000 inmates, a reliance on The Box that
is four times the national average of about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of prisoners confined to specially designed SHU cells
has more than doubled in the five years since George Pataki, a
Republican, became governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the public knows little about this forgotten population.
Many of these prisoners are isolated in distant reaches of the
state. Access by the press and other prison watchdog groups is
generally blocked.
</P>
<P>
   For some of New York's inmates, lockdown has become a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are deemed to pose an ongoing threat of violence to
the prison staff or other inmates, about 150 prisoners have been
confined to 23-hour lockdown for more than five years. A handful of
inmates have spent more than 15 years in these disciplinary cells.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, to save on the huge cost of prison
construction, New York has become one of the first states to
segregate two inmates together in The Box. The unorthodox move _
which prison officials call double-bunking _ changes the definition
of solitary confinement. In the aftermath of the recent choking
death of an inmate after a fight with his cellmate in The Box and
another fatality following the forcible removal of an inmate, new
concerns about the policy are being voiced.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal court decisions so far have upheld New
York's prison policies regarding disciplinary lockdown. State
officials say the prisoners have brought the punishment on
themselves by bad behavior behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their action that put them in prison and it was their
action that made me take them out of the prison community itself,''
said Glenn S. Goord, commissioner of the New York state Department
of Correctional Services (DOCS).
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to protect staff and other inmates. That's what I
want to be known for,'' Goord said. ``I don't feel our use of SHUs
is excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent SHU building spree, in New York and elsewhere,
has energized critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super-max confinement is an abomination,'' said Hans Toch,
professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York
at Albany. ``Emotionally disturbed prisoners are over-represented
in super-max. The proliferation of these prisons is happening all
over the country, and it's not a development of which we can be
very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 super maximum-security prisons have been built in
the United States in the last decade. They now hold more than
23,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki plans to continue the growth trend in New York. A $180
million, 750-cell maximum-security prison with all the SHU
high-tech hardware, now being built in Seneca County, southeast of
Rochester, could easily be converted into an SHU facility for 1,500
prisoners. In his current budget proposal, Pataki has asked for
another $180 million to build a similar prison.
</P>
<P>
   That could allow the number of prisoners in The Box to grow by
another 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other states that have only solitary cells _ that
is, holding one prisoner _ New York's recent policy of
double-bunking inmates in The Box is unusual. But double-bunking
lowers construction costs by packing twice as many prisoners into
half the space.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent deaths among SHU inmates have not caused the
correction commissioner to re-evaluate the double-bunking issue.
``Of course I have concerns,'' Goord said. ``Those were unfortunate
deaths. I'm in a risk business. Is there a risk with two people in
a cell? Yes. But thousands of inmates have gone through double
cells successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Goord said he believed that the rate of violence such as assault
in double-bunked SHU cells is no higher than in single-bed SHU
cells.
</P>
<P>
   In New York The Box measures about 14 feet by 8 feet. It
contains two beds, a desk, a shower, a sink and toilet. Prisoners
sleep, eat, defecate and shower in The Box. And little else. There
is no variation from day to day. Prisoners who have been there say
the months blur into a grinding, numbing sameness.

EAST-WEST ROAD LEADS TO NOWHERE

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``East-West'' is a movie that many predicted would win the Oscar
for best foreign film last month. It didn't, losing to Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' and voters can take comfort in
having done the right thing. ``East-West'' certainly has good
intentions, and it's easy to see why it was nominated. That doesn't
mean it's a good movie, however. It is the type of foreign film
that the academy inexplicably likes to honor _ sweeping, stolid,
somber and, most of all, somnolent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows a group of people who could charitably be
called idealists, although it's hard to avoid being constantly
reminded of their naivete. In June 1946, Stalin offered Russian
emigrants amnesty and invited them back to the motherland to help
rebuild the Soviet Union. That was the offer, anyway. But _
surprise, surprise _ Stalin lied. Most of the emigrants who
returned were sent to forced labor camps. Some were shot on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei (Oleg Menchikov), a doctor, along with his French wife,
Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), and their young son escape the fate of
the gulags. But life isn't exactly beautiful. Alexei is assigned to
an infirmary of a textile factory in Kiev, and he and his family
live in a rat-infested communal apartment along with five other
families.
</P>
<P>
   Marie hates her new life and determines that they must return to
France.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei agrees in an intellectual way, but he's not a man blessed
with much backbone or boldness. Marie realizes she must take
matters into her own hands, and when a French theater group comes
to town, she daringly contacts an actress (Catherine Deneuve),
hoping to alert French authorities to her family's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West'' continues on, with assorted melodramatic subplots
and a story that takes decades to play out (and it almost feels
like real time, as you're sitting there, half-awake, in the
theater). Director and co-writer Regis Wargnier is obviously trying
to create a serious saga in the vein of his Oscar-winning
``Indochine,'' but this film lacks the story, the pretty pictures
and the strong central performance that made ``Indochine'' at least
watchable.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnaire does her best as the sympathetic heroine, but the
supporting characters are mostly caricatures, particularly the
Soviet officials, who seem to have stepped out of a Cold War comic
book. This is hardly the stuff of moving drama, much less of a film
that somehow found itself nominated for an Oscar.________ &QL;

<P>
   After 21 years on death row in the Arizona state prison system,
14 of them in a solitary confinement cell measuring 6 feet by 7
feet, Paris Carriger was left with a mind and a body eroded by the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   His muscle tone gone from neglect, Carriger left prison in a
wheelchair. He suffers from paranoid delusions, unable to focus
beyond an animallike instinct to survive that particular day. He
can't hold a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ex-death row is distinctly unemployable,'' Carriger said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Carriger, now 55 and living in Oklahoma, was released in January
1999 after a review of his case and a re-trial that found him
innocent and set him free.
</P>
<P>
   Free to what?
</P>
<P>
   ``My attorneys couldn't understand why I didn't rejoice when I
won,'' Carriger said. ``I had no emotional connection to it. My
emotions had atrophied along with my ability to walk after 14 years
in solitary.''
</P>
<P>
   During those many years, Carriger was allowed out of his cell
for one hour three times per week during which, in shackles and
under guard, he could shower and exercise in a ``dog pen'' at the
end of his cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gradually lost my ability to manufacture hope,'' Carriger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Carriger came within an eyelash of being put to
death before his attorneys managed to secure a stay of execution.
Thoughts of suicide frequently floated through his consciousness,
but he lacked the equipment or the will to act upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my head, I was preparing to be executed. It seemed like a
good idea, because the pain would be over,'' Carriger said. ``Each
time they backed away, I had to go on antidepressants to try to
reorient my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Carriger said the only ``humanizing effect'' during his time on
death row arrived in the form of letters from four women, whose
devotion to Carriger and attention to his case was described in an
April 19, 1999, article in The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He shunned visits. ``I didn't want my people to see me the way I
was,'' Carriger said.
</P>
<P>
   Carriger wrote his own account, ``Requiem for Justice,''
published recently in Contemporary Justice Review. The quarterly,
which focuses on restorative justice, is edited by Dennis Sullivan
of Voorheesville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Carriger wrote: ``In the course of 21 years, I have been stabbed
half a dozen times, burned once, punched more than I can remember.
I once sat in the dark in my cell waiting for a man who had already
stabbed me to come back and try to finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year of freedom, Carriger has remained on the move.
``I don't stay inside any more than I have to,'' he said. ``The
best thing is being able to open the door when I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Carriger exists on disability benefits from Social Security, and
asked that the name of the town where he lives in Oklahoma not be
published. ``I buy and sell in yard sales to pay for gas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Carriger avoids tightly enclosed spaces. ``I find myself
huddling close to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in solitary teaches you to be wary, that the rest of the
world is unsafe, Carriger said. ``I wasn't physically touched for
21 years unless someone was attacking me or putting on or taking
off handcuffs,'' he said. ``I ended up losing my human instinct for
touch. I became this cocoon being, totally shut down and
isolated.''

 &HT;     SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN U.S. DATES TO EARLY 1800s  
 &HT;     (EDS: With PRISONS-PUNISHMENT)  
 &HT;     (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)

<P>
   Solitary confinement in the New York state prison system dates
to the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1816, state officials built a new prison complex in Auburn,
Cayuga County, where harsh and experimental correctional tactics
were tested. The state Legislature enacted more punitive prison
legislation in 1819, allowing Auburn's prison officials to place
inmates in solitary confinement with a diet of bread and water, to
use irons or stocks and to whip any male inmate who violated prison
rules with as many as 39 lashes.
</P>
<P>
   (Auburn's female inmates, while subjected to solitary
confinement in some cases, were supposed to be protected from
floggings, although documented abuses occurred.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1821, a new solitary confinement wing was opened at Auburn.
Each cell held a single prisoner and measured 7 feet long and 3{
feet wide, with 7-foot ceilings. On Christmas Day that year, 80
convicts were moved to the new wing. These were the most
``hardened'' prisoners under Auburn's classification system.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Christianson chronicled these developments at the Auburn
prison in his 1998 book, ``With Liberty For Some: 500 Years of
Imprisonment in America.'' Christianson, who lives in Rensselaer
County, wrote: ``Held in complete isolation, monitored day and
night to keep them from communicating with anyone except the
chaplain, they remained idle and alone in their dark cells and were
even prevented from lying down in daytime, presumably to prevent
muscular atrophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 80 inmates were placed in isolation cells at Auburn on
Christmas Day 1821. By New Year's Day, 1823, out of Auburn's 80
solitary confinement inmates, at least five had died of consumption
and 41 were seriously ill, according to Christianson.
</P>
<P>
   Others went insane. When one convict's cell was opened, he
sprang out and leaped from the fourth floor to his death. Another
bashed his head against the cell wall until he destroyed one of his
eyes. Another slashed his veins with a piece of tin and bled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Gov. Joseph C. Yates visited Auburn prison, was
said to be horrified by the conditions, and pardoned some survivors
of the solitary confinement experiment on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on Auburn's prisoners thus halted by Yates wasn't
America's first foray into isolation cells.
</P>
<P>
   Solitary was used during the early 1800s in Pennsylvania
penitentiaries as part of a prison reform movement led by the
Quakers, who believed that forced isolation would allow
contemplation and, ultimately, repentance and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens visited Eastern Penitentiary in Philadelphia in
1842 and wrote: ``The system here is rigid, strict, and hopeless
solitary confinement. I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and
wrong. ... I am persuaded that those who devised this system of
Prison Discipline, and those benevolent gentlemen who carry it into
execution, do not know what it is that they are doing. ... I hold
this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain, to
be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body ... a secret
punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' report and other negative reviews roused public opinion
against this form of punishment. Solitary confinement never
entirely disappeared from the prison landscape, although its use in
New York for the next century and a half was limited to a small
number of ``problem inmates'' who assaulted or killed other
prisoners or correction staff.
</P>
<P>
   This long period of stasis regarding the use of solitary
confinement was radically altered in the past three years, when
Gov. George Pataki approved the construction of more than 3,000 new
23-hour lockdown disciplinary beds _ doubling the previous
capacity. Pataki, a Republican, also curbed construction costs by
allowing double-bunking (two inmates per isolation cell), an
unorthodox form of lockdown that New York was the first to try.

&HT;     EX-JUDGE LEARNS ABOUT `THE HOLE' FROM HIS OWN PRISON TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sol Wachtler wrote court decisions on solitary
confinement. He also spent a month himself in what he calls ``the
hole.'' That gives him a unique position to assess this form of
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1997 book, ``After The Madness: A Judge's Own Prison
Memoir,'' the former chief judge of the state of New York _ who was
convicted in federal court for harassing his ex-mistress _ quoted
from a diary he kept while confined to an isolation cell in a
medium-security federal prison in Butner, N.C., for what he was
told was mental health observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write this entry from the hole. Soon the light will go out,
and I will hear the banging on the doors and the cries for help.
Because the dog man is still here, the barking has already begun.
... Days have a way of running together when you're in solitary
confinement. ... I seem to spend most of my time staring at the
ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler, now 69, conceded a ``breathless fear of being sealed
alive in a coffin, unable to breathe.'' He also wrote: ``There is
no chair or table in my cell, so I eat sitting on the steel shelf
which I will use for a bed, using my lap for a table. I feel
aboriginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler was placed in solitary for observation and
administrative segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview from his home on Long Island,
where Wachtler teaches at the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center of
Touro College, the ex-convict and ex-chief judge of the New York
Court of Appeals reflected on solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler recalled writing a Court of Appeals opinion in the
mid-1980s in the case Wilkinson vs. Skinner, in which an inmate
sued a county sheriff for a five-day solitary confinement the
inmate claimed constituted ``cruel and unusual punishment,'' thus
prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler wrote for the court: ``Merely confining an inmate in a
segregated cell does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
There are, of course, some cells that are so subhuman as to
constitute such punishment even for a very brief confinement. One
day in some cells might be constitutionally intolerable.''
Wachtler's opinion prevailed, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how prophetic that opinion was,'' Wachtler said.
</P>
<P>
   His weeks in solitary only solidified that position. ``What
happens to you in the hole defies description,'' Wachtler said.
``You have to have been there to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon his own experiences and those related to him by other
inmates, Wachtler said solitary confinement _ a tool correction
officials contend helps them maintain discipline among inmates
difficult to control _ is frequently abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw guys put in the hole for making fun of a guard, for
having a radio with somebody else's initials in their locker and a
lot of minor infractions,'' Wachtler said. ``It's a system of
discipline administered peremptorily and without appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   He witnessed harassment and abuse by guards, but inmates were
afraid of reporting it for fear of retribution. ``If you're in the
hole and complain, they'll double your time in the hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler, who is writing a book on prison reform, said the
method of assigning solitary confinement needs an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates a system that would allow inmates to appeal
solitary confinement sentences and file complaints of abuse to an
objective oversight committee that would ensure inmate
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler also would like to see more care for mentally ill
inmates in solitary. ``Many inmates had trouble coping with reality
when they were in the real world. Imagine how much more
dysfunctional solitary makes them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtler advocates these changes to solitary confinement policy:
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical inspection without notice by prison watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inspectors allowed to deliver sealed, confidential reviews of
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restrictions on the use and duration of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immediate moratorium on placing two inmates in a single cell
in isolation, as New York does, which Wachtler labels ``totally
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The long isolation confinements in New York, some lasting a few
years, ``constitute cruel and inhuman punishment'' and should be
ruled unconstitutional, according to Wachtler.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a long period in isolation, these people come out 10
times worse than when they went in,'' the former judge said.

&HT;     GOD'S MISSION LEADS TO BURNOUT IN PRISON `BOX' 
</HEADLINE>

   COXSACKIE, N.Y. _ The Rev. Joe Romano could detect it first in
the eyes of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It might take a few weeks or a few months, but there was a
defining moment when the mostly youthful prisoners in isolation
units regressed into something less than human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light went out in their eyes,'' said Romano, a retired
Roman Catholic prison chaplain. ``They became like zombies. I'd
talk to them through the food slot, and all I got back was a blank
stare.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours each day at New York state's Greene Correctional
Facility, Romano pushed a cart with rosaries, books and spiritual
reading material. He would go from cell to cell in the special
housing unit (SHU), where 200 inmates are confined two per cell.
The SHU, what inmates call The Box, was added to the prison in the
spring of 1998, replacing a 15-cell isolation unit.
</P>
<P>
   What Romano witnessed among these young men _ more than half of
the 1,700 inmates at Greene, a medium-security prison in Coxsackie
in Greene County, are between the ages of 16 and 19 _ caused the
cleric deep despair. Ultimately, he said, it hastened his
retirement last November after 15 years of prison work.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, Romano grimly watched the prison's response
team storm the SHU in ``uniforms like Darth Vader,'' led by
correction officers who ``got their jollies by beating guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The drill was known as ``breaking a cell.'' It was used on
prisoners who _ in protest or by reason of loss of mental reasoning
_ refused to come out of their cell at the end of their SHU
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Romano was successful in talking an inmate into
coming out voluntarily just before the response team prepared to
swarm the tight confines in riot gear while lobbing tear gas into
the cell.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, Romano's were the broad shoulders these young
felons cried upon. ``Please tell my family where I am,'' was a
typical tearful plea, Romano said. Since they were denied access to
a phone, computer or other instant communications (letters are
permitted), it often fell to Romano to break the news of deaths or
family emergencies to the inmates in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time trying to console scared kids who cried
and cried,'' Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Romano sometimes tried to intervene and demand reassignments for
young prisoners who complained to the priest of being sexually
abused by ``booty bandits'' _ bigger, older men who acted as sexual
predators against weaker cellmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday experience in the SHU was pretty awful for these
kids,'' Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things he saw:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attempted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nude inmates lolling on the floor, openly masturbating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmate self-mutilation with names, swastikas and other symbols
carved into their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smearing and throwing of feces and urine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmates unresponsive and catatonic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmates in psychotic rages, ranting obscenities and banging
heads on walls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmates sleeping naked on cement floors to combat sweltering
summer heat without air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation in these young lives inside was startling.
Romano described an angry, loud vitality in the general inmate
population at Greene. After a few weeks in The Box, though, that
life force seeped out from the inmates as inevitably as air from a
punctured balloon.
</P>
<P>
   And with it, Romano's own passion for attempting to reform young
criminals evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a priest, and we're in the forgiveness business,'' said
Romano, 60, who now is assistant pastor of Saint Catherine of Siena
Church in Albany. ``The SHU is only about punishment and breaking
down these guys. There's nothing about forgiveness or
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Romano's affable personality and knowledge of the ways of the
streets seemed to help earn him the respect of inmates. ``I never
felt I was a savior,'' Romano said. ``If I helped one of these guys
a little, I thought I'd done OK. That's what saved my sanity
working on the SHU.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates weren't the only tortured souls on the SHUs. ``Being
a C.O. is a horribly stressful and difficult job,'' Romano said,
using an abbreviation for correction officer. He counseled officers
about problems that plagued them disproportionately, including
alcoholism, depression and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In his 15 years at Greene Correctional Facility, Romano talked
drunk and despondent correction officers out of committing suicide
_ twice literally removing loaded guns from the hands of officers
preparing to take their own lives. Six officers finished the
suicide attempts and killed themselves during his tenure there,
Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Romano blames much of the human wreckage he observed on The Box.
The priest did what he could to alleviate the despair by delivering
communion wafers through the cells' food slots, distributing books
donated by parishioners and starting a Bible studies program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 100-cell SHU was monitored by audio and video
equipment and inmates were loathe to participate in the Catholic
sacrament of confession, Romano lobbied for and won the right to
hear confession through two-way field phones that maintained some
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were starved for anything that gave them hope,''
Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, old divisions conspired against Romano's ministry.
Greene's inmate population is about 60 percent black, 30 percent
Hispanic and 10 percent white. Allegiances to street gangs don't
end at the prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, who speaks Spanish, was accepted by Hispanic inmates,
particularly the Latin Kings gang, a powerful force in the prison.
The Latin Kings and other Hispanic gangs openly warred with rival
black gangs, The Bloods and The Crips.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Romano had to offer two Masses on Saturday nights _ one
on the north side of prison and the other on the south side _ to
keep feuding gangs physically separated. When they clashed, the
result was ``cuttings,'' prison slang for disfiguring and sometimes
serious slashings with homemade shanks.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday night last summer, after a sermon on forgiveness
based on the Scripture readings for the Mass, the futility of his
prison ministry was driven home to Romano.
</P>
<P>
   An inmate was at Greene for killing a young man on the streets
of the Bronx. The murdered man's brother was sent to Greene for a
different crime. The convicted killer attended Romano's Mass and,
unknowingly, sat next to the brother of his victim. The two even
exchanged the handshake of peace, Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mass, the victim's brother sidled up to his brother's
murderer and, according to witnesses, muttered a sentiment of
forgiveness in cynical reference to Romano's sermon. Then he
slashed the fellow inmate's throat, face and chest.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient of the cutting narrowly escaped bleeding to death
on the spot. After 119 stitches and surgery, the prisoner
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That did it for me. I couldn't take any more,'' Romano said.
``I was burned out, and it was time to go.''

&HT;     HARVARD PSYCHIATRIST DEPLORES LIFE IN SOLITARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Grassian never set out to become the country's
leading expert on the psychological effects of long-term solitary
confinement on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Medical School professor, who practices psychiatry
in the Boston area, came to dominate the literature on the topic by
default. ``I was shocked to find out that the prison psychiatrists
who were supposed to be doing this job weren't, so I got
involved,'' Grassian said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassian's 1979 study of prisoners confined to 23-hour lockdown
in special housing units (SHUs) coined the term ``SHU syndrome''
and its attendant symptoms of mental illness: depression, increased
paranoia, agitation, manic activity, delusions, florid psychotic
illness and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a psychological toxicity among solitary confinement
in super-max prisons,'' Grassian said by phone from Boston. ``These
places are breeding grounds for mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Super maximum-security refers to the punitive 23-hour
disciplinary lockdowns where prisoners have few or no privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Grassian discussed New York state's early 19th-century
experiments with solitary confinement at Auburn prison as
``undertaken with the best of intentions and open to public
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1830s, however, Auburn's experiment was dropped because
of ``a high rate of catastrophic incidents of psychiatric illness
and death,'' according to Grassian. Soon, solitary confinement fell
out of favor in New York and across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past 20 years _ despite extensive federal research on
the psychologically harmful effects of solitary confinement on
prisoners of war _ state prison systems around the country have
built at a furious pace prisons dedicated to isolating and
punishing inmates in 23-hour disciplinary lockdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrendous development,'' Grassian said. Moreover,
prison officials in New York and elsewhere are ``systematically
denying the psychiatric problems'' and refuse press access or
public scrutiny of SHU conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To save on the huge cost of prison construction, New York has
become one of the first states to segregate two inmates together in
super maximum-security cells that prisoners derisively call The
Box.
</P>
<P>
   During two decades, Grassian has evaluated hundreds of SHU
prisoners in a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Grassian wrote an extensive follow-up report on the Attica,
N.Y., SHU last fall in which he concluded: ``The psychiatric
evaluation and periodic monitoring of mentally ill Attica SHU
inmates are grossly inadequate; seriously mentally ill inmates
continue to be housed in SHU, and often psychiatrically deteriorate
as a result of the stringent conditions of confinement prevailing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassian said prisoners who act out or can't comply with rules
in the general prison population likely suffer from mild forms of
mental illness to begin with. Those psychiatric problems deepen and
become profoundly dangerous during long months, even years, in the
isolation of SHUs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking sick people and making them sicker,'' Grassian
said. ``Mentally ill people need treatment, not disciplinary
punishment.''

   &UR; COXSACKIE, N.Y.: other SHU cellblocks. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your inmate handbook details SHU rules. Cells must be kept neat
and clean at all times. Any markings in the cell or affixing any
articles to the walls is punishable by additional time in The Box.
Wet towels may not be hung from the bunks; they may be hung to dry
only from the second rung of the bunk bed ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates will be issued one paper drinking cup. The cup will only
be exchanged if necessary during morning rounds. Possession of
cups, trays and utensils after food tray pickup will be considered
contraband. That is punishable by additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Lights are turned on at 6 a.m. and turned off at 11 p.m. daily
in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   You are not allowed to make telephone calls. To contact the
outside world, you may write some letters. You slide outgoing
letters under the cell door before lights out at night. If you have
no money in your inmate account, you must wait 30 days until you
are issued postage. You will be given one 33-cent stamp each month
if you have no money in your account. If you attempt to wash off
canceled stamp marks or illegally reuse stamps, you may be punished
by additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 6 a.m., two COs on rounds will gather the mail
from the cellblock corridor and slide back under the cell door a
corresponding amount of paper and envelopes. There is no mail
delivery on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   You are not permitted to wear a watch. You will learn to mark
time by the rhythms of your SHU day. Shifts change at 7 a.m. and
new COs come on duty. A CO escorts a nurse who makes rounds
beginning at 7 a.m. to check on inmates who filled out a sick call
request slip the night before.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., you will hear other inmates rousing, washing up,
getting dressed and waiting at their cell door for breakfast. COs
bring around the food trays between 7 and 8 a.m. If you oversleep
and are not waiting at the food tray slot to receive your food, the
CO will pass by your cell and you will not eat.
</P>
<P>
   You will learn to eat quickly. The COs come back around in about
15 minutes to collect the empty trays, milk cartons and plastic
``sporks'' _ a single utensil combining a spoon and the tines of a
fork. Failure to return immediately any of these items will
constitute contraband, punishable by additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m., the console officer will make an announcement over
loudspeakers that it is recreation time. You will go to the back
door and be ready to open it when the console officer
electronically unlocks all doors leading to the caged balcony. The
doors will remain unlocked for one hour, until 9:30 a.m. In the
case of double-bunked cells, inmates alternate one-hour shifts in
the caged balcony and the doors are locked down at 10:30 a.m. The
console officer will watch you on video monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to prop open the door beyond the one-hour allowable
recreation time will be detected by electronic surveillance and is
punishable by additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   You go back inside your cell until lunch. Line up at your cell
door. The food trays arrive between 11:30 a.m. and noon. They are
collected shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Another shift change comes at 3 p.m., signaling the arrival of a
new CO, who delivers incoming mail.
</P>
<P>
   Line up at your cell door for dinner. The food trays arrive
about 4:30 p.m. Eat quickly. Return the tray and the spork on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Until lights out at 11 p.m., you may read or listen to the radio
with earphones on one of three stations selected by the console
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you'll learn to pass the empty hours in conversation
with your bunky. Or, you may remain wary of this stranger, vigilant
to fend off his advances.
</P>
<P>
   Try not to doze or sleep too much during the day or you'll lie
awake at night, listening to the moans, rantings and pounding of
agitated inmates. There are six cells for psychiatric observation
in the medical wing adjacent to the SHU.
</P>
<P>
   You will look forward to your three shower days each week. In
the morning, during recreation time, the console officer will make
an announcement when the showers will be turned on. You and your
bunky will alternate in the shower. The water will run for about
five minutes. There is no curtain. You will need to mop up water on
the cell floor with your towels. You may request a disposable razor
during the shower period three days each week. The razor must be
immediately returned. If it is not, or if it has been tampered
with, the infraction is punishable with additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are allowed one haircut per month on scheduled days, if
requested. Inmates will be placed in a waist chain and handcuffs
during the haircut. Inmates will not be allowed to bring a comb or
brush.
</P>
<P>
   Each inmate will be required to clean his cell three times each
week. Inmates will be issued a sponge, toilet brush, mini-broom,
cleaning cloth and mop. Failure to return these items is punishable
by additional time in The Box.
</P>
<P>
   One day each week, inmates will receive linen exchange. Inmates
must separate greens in one net bag and whites in the other.
Clothing to be washed will be picked up at 8 p.m. on your scheduled
day and returned the following day. At that time, you will exchange
your two sheets and one pillow case for clean linen.
</P>
<P>
   Visits are allowed one day per week, either Saturday or Sunday.
Inmates are led by COs in waist chains and handcuffs to the
visiting area, where inmates are confined in caged areas and
separated from visitors by wire mesh. An inmate can bring into the
visiting area only a wedding band, religious medal and a pair of
prescription eyeglasses. No exchange of items with visitors is
allowed. Attempts are punishable by additional time in The Box.
Visitors may stay for up to five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Your time in SHU will be defined by the Progressive Inmate
Movement system (PIMs). Inmates begin at Level I, the most
restrictive, and can progress to Level II and Level III after 30
days in each level _ given proper behavior and no disciplinary
reports.
</P>
<P>
   On Level I, you are not allowed earphones or commissary
privileges. You will remain in waist chain and handcuff restraints
at all times while out of the cell, including visits.
</P>
<P>
   On Level II, your waist chain and restraints will be removed in
the visiting area. If approved, you also can enroll in a cell study
program. That means you will be able to pick two books and one
periodical from a library cart. Materials are rotated every 60
days. Swapping with your bunky doubles your reading options. You
may request up to two books or journals from the law library and
borrow them for up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Level III, you will be allowed one pair of personal sneakers
and one pair of personal shorts. You will graduate from three to
four showers per week. You will be granted an additional 30 minutes
of daily exercise in your cell's caged balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a good record of behavior on Level III, however, your
parole board will take note of your lack of program involvement
during your SHU time. There are no programs offered to prisoners in
The Box. Being sent to The Box in the first place wipes out any
time off a sentence you may have accumulated for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If your frustration over being denied parole results in breaking
any prison rules, your actions are punishable by additional time in
The Box.

&HT;     SPARTAN LIFE FOR PRISONERS IN `THE BOX' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COXSACKIE, N.Y. _ In accordance with the regulations of
directive 4933 of the New York State Department of Correctional
Services, you have been assigned to a special housing unit (SHU).
</P>
<P>
   Your fellow inmates call it The Box.
</P>
<P>
   On your way to The Box, correction officers _ known here as COs
_ will cinch a thick chain around your waist and handcuff your
wrists to the chain, and a padlock will bind your hands at
waist-level in front of your body. If you resist or make threats,
you also may be locked into leg irons.
</P>
<P>
   You will proceed under correction officer escort to the SHU
cellblock. Video cameras will monitor your every move. Microphones
will pick up each sound.
</P>
<P>
   You will pass a large octagonal, glassed-in room called ``the
control unit.'' A ``console officer'' stands before rows of video
monitors and switches. He operates the mechanical systems that
regulate your existence in The Box: lights, showers, radio,
recreation, announcements and more.
</P>
<P>
   The console officer cannot see your physical presence. You exist
only as an image on the control unit's video monitors. Your
isolation over months or years in The Box will be, in effect,
incarceration by remote control.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a corridor, perhaps 100 yards from the control
unit, you will reach your box. If family or friends do not come to
visit, it is possible that you won't leave The Box for a year _ or
perhaps as long as five years.
</P>
<P>
   You will find an inmate inside, a stranger. The majority of SHU
cells in New York are double-bunked. Some screening and pairing of
cellmates is attempted: smokers with smokers, no rival gang members
together, similar physical types to discourage sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Before you enter The Box and meet your cellmate, the COs will
order the other inmate to face the exterior wall at the back of the
cell or to lie face down on his bed. The CO will slide back a metal
cover over a 10-inch square of clear, thick Plexiglas to make a
visual inspection to determine if the cellmate has complied with
the orders.
</P>
<P>
   The console officer will activate a switch that electronically
unlocks the cell door. It rolls back on a track. The door is heavy,
made of steel. In addition to the small plexiglass window, the door
has a thin slot cut out of the steel through which to pass food
trays. The food tray slot and the window have metal covers that can
be opened only from the outside by a CO
</P>
<P>
   The CO departs, leaving you to the stranger with whom you will
share The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Your cell is identical to hundreds of other modular units hauled
to the prison site two at a time on flatbed trucks and bolted
together end-to-end to form an SHU cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   The prefab unit is made of pre-cast concrete, 5 inches thick,
reinforced by steel bar. The cell's dimensions are 14 feet long and
8 1/2 feet wide. The ceiling is 8 feet high _ 120 feet of floor
space.
</P>
<P>
   With arms outspread, your fingers touch both boundaries of your
new world: bed on one wall, desk on the other. The concrete walls
are gray and unfinished. You are not permitted to hang anything on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The beds are 5 feet long and 32 inches wide, two slabs of steel
bolted to the wall. Top and bottom bunk are divided by 3 feet of
wall. A four-rung steel ladder runs up the far side of the bunk.
You will be issued a thin mattress, small pillow and linen.
</P>
<P>
   You and your ``bunky,'' as cellmates call each other, will have
to decide who gets top and who gets bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The bed, as well as the other steel furnishings in the room, are
Corcraft products made by other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the bed are four coat hooks mounted on the wall with
custom-made, tamper-proof rivets and screws. Nothing that might
make a weapon can be ripped or torn out of the walls, floor or
ceiling of The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the cell door, on the left wall, is your stainless
steel sink and toilet unit. It resembles those in a preschool
classroom. The sink, about waist high, is the size of a large salad
bowl. There are no faucet handles. A push-button spigot is used for
washing or directed upward for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Above the sink hangs a small sheet of stainless steel. This is
your mirror. It affords a dull reflection. No glass is allowed in
The Box.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the unit below the sink, at about knee level, is the
toilet. It is made of stainless steel. There is no seat or cover.
The toilet's bowl is small, roughly the size of a dinner plate. It
is flushed with the push of a button on the side of the sink.
</P>
<P>
   An arm's length away from the sink on the same wall is the desk
unit. Each inmate is assigned a metal locker, which flanks a 5-foot
metal desk bolted to the wall. Two hubcap-sized seats pull out from
beneath the desk on metal swing arms.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the desk in the far corner is the shower, a stainless
steel triangular unit with no faucets and no curtain. The water's
temperature and force are controlled electronically by the console
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The cell includes six tamper-proof electrical outlets and two
light switches, although the lights also can be controlled by the
console officer. There is one fluorescent light in the ceiling in
the center of the cell and another fluorescent light above the
sink. Both lights are covered with thick, shatterproof plexiglass.
</P>
<P>
   On the back wall of The Box there is a window and a door. The
window is heavily screened and consists of five metal louvers
operated by a hand crank to allow slits of daylight and fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy steel plate back door is locked and controlled
electronically by the console officer. It is unlocked for one hour
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   During that hour, you and your cellmate will be able to go out
the back door onto a concrete balcony, caged in heavy wire, that
measures 9 feet by 7 feet. Think of it as a smaller box. The view
is of a guard tower, fences topped with concertina wire and long
rows of identical caged balconies on other SHU cellblocks.

   These forms of punishment were used in 19th-century isolation
cells in New York state prisons, according the book ``With Liberty
for Some,'' by Scott Christianson:
</P>
<P>
   _ Arriving prisoners dumped in vats of hot, soapy water and
scrubbed with brushes to remove filth and vermin from county jail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prison officials shaved face and heads of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmates herded in lockstep human chain by guards with rifles
and bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discipline included floggings with bullwhips and
cat-o'-nine-tails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cells were kept dark and inmates prevented from lying down in
daytime.
</P>
<P>
   _ No mail could be sent or received by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   _ No family visits except in extraordinary circumstances
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard labor in prison factories, with no talking permitted.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There's the candy jar on the boss's desk, the
birthday cakes for office colleagues, doughnuts at morning meetings
and the ubiquitous vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scout cookies are at every other desk; and, if high school
bands sold carrot sticks, they'd all be marching around in the
emperor's new clothes. Instead, they sell candy bars. King-size
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Snack food is everywhere. Even if you avoid keeping it in the
house because you're apt to indulge too often, you'll be bombarded
with it at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the common things people talk about when they come
in for nutrition counseling,'' says Dianne Fagan, a registered
dietitian who practices in Niskayuna.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Del Rosso, a nutritionist with offices in Clifton Park
and Albany, agrees. She estimates that nearly 90 percent of her
patients who work outside the home bring up the topic of snack food
in the office.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to combat the office calorie overload.
</P>
<P>
   Stay satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it comes down to is your desire to reach your goal versus
you're desire to have what's in front of you,'' says Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   And to stem the desire, Del Rosso says to eat a well-balanced
diet in the first place. ``Once you're in that hunger mode, it's
very difficult to pass up food. You're body is telling you to eat
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Eat breakfast at home.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people say, ``Oh, I'll get something when I get to
work,'' and then they walk in and get slammed with a major project
and a box of doughnuts, Fagan says. If you've eaten before you
leave the house, you'll be better prepared to skip the doughnuts
and go straight to work.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply can't manage to get down breakfast before you
begin working, stop at the grocery store and pick up some cereal
and a pint of milk or take along a packet of instant oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Circumvent the candy jar.
</P>
<P>
   This nutritional booby trap snares nearly everyone. ``It's part
of the socialization of the office,'' says Fagan, and even though
it would be better for the whole office if it weren't there, it's a
hard thing to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself sampling from the jar too often, take a
different path, says Fagan. People tend to walk the same way
through the office. Vary the route so you pass by the jar less
often.
</P>
<P>
   If you must munch on something, keep a bowl of seedless grapes,
fat-free mini pretzels or cocktail tomatoes on your desk.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, even people who have ``ownership'' of candy jars
admit having trouble with them. Fagan says for some of her clients,
keeping a candy jar on their desks makes them part of the office in
a unique or special way. But if you find you're filling the jar
with M&AMP;Ms just to eat them yourself, try candy that isn't as easily
eaten. Hard candy that's difficult to just bite and swallow is
better than things that can be eaten quickly. Buy hot,
cinnamon-flavored candy or ones that require sucking for a long
time such as Jolly Ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, just communicating better with your co-workers can
help. Fagan recalled one man who ate jelly beans all day because
they were available and his assistants kept filling the jar. He
didn't want to ask them to stop because he was afraid of hurting
their feelings and, as it turned out, they thought he wanted the
jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to further the causes of your co-workers'
children, without indulging in band candy and cookies. First, you
can simply not buy anything. Which, while more nutritious, could
put you at a serious disadvantage when your children have to sell
something. The next tactic is to promise yourself you'll only buy
an item if you can give it away to someone else. And finally, if
you're simply unable to resist eating any snack food that is in
your possession, just donate money to the cause and leave the
snacks alone.
</P>
<P>
   Be a social person, not a social eater
</P>
<P>
   It is acceptable to sing ``Happy Birthday'' and mingle and not
eat cake. There are those who will thank you for leaving more for
them. Suggest the office adopt a policy of having only one cake a
month for everyone's birthday instead of a cake for each person.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fagan says, it's more about your own willpower than about
what foods others bring to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard,'' says Fagan. ``You're surrounded by people
that could care less about your diet. They're not exactly the most
supportive types to be around.''

`ENGAGEMENT' BREAKS ITS OWN UNWRITTEN RULES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Withholding of evidence is a major plot point in ``Rules of
Engagement,'' a military courtroom drama directed by William
Friedkin and conceived by former Secretary of the Navy James Webb.
</P>
<P>
   But the filmmakers commit something like the same crime as the
film's civilian strawman. What we're shown in the early, action
parts of the movie, and led to believe is the truth well into the
picture's third act, turns out not to be the whole story. This
makes for some rousing court-martial grandstanding and rah-rah
support for the ``shoot first, question later'' approach to
soldiering. But it betrays the more intriguing, complex examination
of ethics under fire that the film promises for the longest time.
</P>
<P>
   Superbly, if superficially, acted by Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L.
Jackson and Guy Pearce, and filmed with spit-and-polish precision,
``Rules'' is engaging as long as it refrains from taking sides in
the case at hand. Once it sets to advocating, though, it loses us.
</P>
<P>
   The opening sequence during the Vietnam War is nice and concise;
it sets up personalities and relationships while not skimping on
the terror and horror and the difficulty of decision-making under
fire. Terry Childers (Jackson) and Hays Hodges (Jones) split their
squad during a jungle engagement. Childers' operation succeeds and
he takes a couple of North Vietnamese prisoners, but Hodges'
command is wiped out and Childers resorts to extreme measures to
rescue his wounded comrade.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years later, Childers is a respected Marine combat
colonel while Hodges, somewhat of a disappointment to his officer
corps family and more than somewhat of a drunk, is about to retire
from a mediocre career as a military attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Then the folks over in the Arab nation of Yemen get upset about
something. Childers heads a rescue mission to the besieged U.S.
embassy there, where his men come under immediate and constant fire
from snipers in nearby buildings. After taking several casualties,
Childers gives orders to shoot into the crowd demonstrating in the
street below. In the eerie quiet that follows, 83 local civilians,
many of them women and children and all apparently unarmed, lie
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Quite understandably, the incident threatens U.S. relationships
throughout the Middle East, and Childers must be scapegoated. Enter
the bad civilian, a national security adviser played by Paramount
Pictures' designated weasel, Bruce Greenwood (``Double Jeopardy'').
Also, more formidably, a young bulldog prosecutor, Maj. Mark Briggs
(Pearce, the fine Australian actor, affecting a perfect New York
street brawler accent) is hot to purge the Corps of this
trigger-happy vet.
</P>
<P>
   Childers naturally turns for representation to the self-doubting
man whose life he once saved. However, Hodges is not only limited
by his own sense of inadequacy, but by the knowledge of to what
lengths his dear but hotheaded friend is capable of going.
</P>
<P>
   The early combat scenes have an immediacy and disorienting
vividness that ranks right up there with prime Oliver Stone. The
characters also exhibit potential early on; no one plays a loose
cannon more intelligently than Jackson, and Jones is always at his
best when playing against his naturally overconfident persona.
</P>
<P>
   But as the film settles into rote, court-martial movie dynamics,
it grows less engaging both personally and philosophically. Hodges
does some key investigating on his own, Childers does the old Jack
Nicholson blow-up on the stand, witnesses are pressured into lying,
``surprise'' testimony you knew was coming an hour earlier pops up
at a climactic moment, and the few good men tell off the clueless
desk jockeys but good.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, what we thought we saw happen is ultimately
revealed to not quite have happened that way. Friedkin, an old
master of movie trickery in his ``French Connection'' and
``Exorcist'' days, pulls it off with slick aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   But it still leaves you feeling like you've been cheated by
someone who hasn't played by the rules. &QL;

ACCUSATIONS FLY IN FIGHT OVER A PICASSO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A nasty dispute has flared up between two
prominent San Francisco families _ pitting the children of arts
patron Madeleine Haas Russell against investment brokerage baron
Charles Schwab and his wife, Helen _ over the sale of a $45 million
Picasso painting last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art are
considering suing the Madeleine Haas Russell Trust for allegedly
breaching a ``binding'' oral contract to sell them Picasso's
masterpiece ``Nu au fauteuil noir.'' The painting, a famously
erotic depiction of Picasso's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, was
sold at a Christie's auction for $45.1 million in November along
with other works from Russell's estate. Russell was a longtime
trustee of SFMOMA, where Helen Schwab is a board member.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement the Schwabs released Wednesday through
San Francisco attorney Charles Cohler, the Schwabs and SFMOMA had
made a deal in September to jointly buy the painting from the
Russell estate, a claim Russell's heirs deny.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs say they planned to give the museum the money to buy
40 percent of the painting, and they would pay for 60 percent of
the $44 million purchase. According to their statement, they
planned to make their share of the painting a ``promised gift'' to
the museum upon their deaths. They claim that Haas' three grown
children ``reneged on the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to SFMOMA's board of trustees expressing ``dismay at
the Museum's threats to sue us,'' Russell's heirs _ Alice
Russell-Shapiro, Charles P. Russell and Christine H. Russell _ say
they were ``led to believe that there would be sole use of the
painting by the Museum, and ultimately sole ownership by the
Museum.'' When they learned that the painting would be jointly
owned and used, they say, they decided not to proceed with the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have an agreement until both parties sign on the
dotted line,'' said their attorney, Roger Mead of the San Francisco
firm of Folger, Levin &AMP; Kahn. ``We are confident that when the
museum trustees give the matter proper consideration, they will
conclude that it would be reckless to pursue these baseless
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs and SFMOMA may sue. Cohler said, ``Mr. and Mrs.
Schwab wish to see the museum made whole again and do not intend to
seek (personal) damages.''

DUMBER THAN `DUMB,' AND NOT AS FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ready to Rumble'' _ a film built around the world of
professional wrestling _ is based on a simple premise: Anyone going
to this ``comedy'' must be dumber than its two protagonists, Gordie
and Sean. How dumb? Let's say they couldn't beat my dog in a game
of tic-tac-toe.
</P>
<P>
   Before any pro wrestling fans call up with the intention of
body-slamming me into the next county, I am !ital!not implying that
aficionados of the ``sport'' are stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, wrestling is ``scripted.'' The movie tells us that right
away when Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano) decides he's tired of his
star, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), and scripts him to lose a
championship match without telling him. After the surprised King
gets the daylights beaten out of him, he goes into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught, his two biggest fans _ Gordie (David Arquette) and
Sean (Scott Cann) _ go on a quest to bring him back and help him
regain his crown. Along the way, they find that nothing in King's
bio is real. (They inform his parents that they are dead even as
the parents stand right there before them.) Even after they find
the broken-down, drunken King and he tries to get them to
understand that wrestling is scripted and he's been written out,
they stare at him grinning, waiting for him to be the way he was in
the ring all those years.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' absolute blockheadedness, we take it, is supposed to
drive the film's humor.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plot never gets much thicker than this and the boys'
occupation is emptying portable toilets and driving a sanitation
truck, there is plenty of time for a number of really gross jokes,
none of which need to be repeated here. (Few _ if any _ are very
funny, and one must have cost quite a few bucks for one of the
lamest payoffs imaginable.)
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we get a cameo from Oscar-winning actor Martin
Landau as Sal Bandini, an aging macho wrestler; Rose McGowan as
Sasha, a Nitro Girl (one of those women who parade around the ring
in skimpy outfits); and a host of real wrestlers. We hope they got
paid well. Actually, everybody seems to throw themselves into their
roles, which often is the only thing that keeps the film from being
totally unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brian Robbins (``Varsity Blues'') and written by
Stephen Brill (``The Mighty Ducks''), ``Ready to Rumble'' looks
exactly like what it is _ a crass attempt to cash in on the
popularity of pro wrestling. Alas, no one seemed to think that a
real script might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Farrelly brothers (``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``There's
Something About Mary'') have shown recently, it takes skill to
build up laughs around dumb characters _ otherwise, to quote
``Forrest Gump,'' ``Stupid is as stupid does.''________ &QL; 
The film: ``Ready to Rumble'' (PG-13; language, crude humor, sexual
content including brief nudity, and wrestling violence). &QL; 
The stars: David Arquette, Oliver Platt, Scott Caan, Bill Goldberg,
Rose McGowan, Diamond Dallas Page, Joe Pantoliano and Martin
Landau. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Brian Robbins. Written by Steven
Brill. Produced Bobby Newmyer and Jeffrey Silver. Released by

 UNDATED: ... on the solution.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some other strategies:
</P>
<P>
   --Lavish praise. Goldenthal tells parents to say something
positive to each child 50 times a day for a week. Fifty times!?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he says, ``fifty makes you notice trivial things.
If the theory is that competition for your attention drives the
bickering, they need more attention no matter how much you're
already giving. Second, this doesn't take any more time than it
does to intervene every time they fight.'' Fifty isn't magic, he
says, but it does flood them with positive feeling. ``In 10 years,
it's worked almost every time. If it doesn't,'' he says, ``there's
something else behind the bickering.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep the praise simple and low-key, however. If Lucy uses the
fork instead of her fingers, tell her, ``I noticed you used the
fork, Lucy. Thanks!'' not: ``Wow! Lucy! This is great!'' If three
of them watch TV without fighting, acknowledge their effort instead
of walking past the room: ``I noticed your brother had on `Sesame
Street' and you didn't flip the channel. Thank you both for being
so considerate.''
</P>
<P>
   --Provide structure. Does teasing get out of hand every day at
the same time, like an hour before dinner? Do they fight whenever
it's time to get into the car? ``They need structure,'' says
Goldenthal, like an extra snack or a seating chart for the car.
Charts only work, however, if you involve everyone in making them.
For instance: ``Every time we get in the car, there's a fight over
who sits next to the baby. It's great the three of you love your
sister, but I wonder what the squabbling sounds like to her? Let's
brainstorm ideas so we can do this without quarreling.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests drawing a picture of the car with the baby in her
seat. Find something to praise in each suggestion they come up with
and try to craft a plan from their ideas, perhaps a turn-taking
system that gets posted in the car. (This is a pretty common
problem, by the way. In one family Faber knows, two sisters came up
with the idea that one would sit in front on even days because her
birthday was an even number, and the other on odd days because her
birthday was an odd number.) Two caveats: Be sure to follow the
chart yourself, agree to consequences ahead of time _ ``What should
I do if you refuse to do what you agreed to do?'' _ and be prepared
to follow through on them, even if it will make you late: ``I can't
start the car to go, remember?''
</P>
<P>
   --Break the cycle. Sonnenschein recommends a family meeting to
restate your values: ``There's constant bickering in the house.
This is not the kind of family or atmosphere Mom and I want. We
want everyone to think about this and come up with at least two
suggestions for a family meeting Saturday at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Samalin has a dramatic idea that works well with older children.
In the midst of their bickering, get out the video camera: ``Don't
stop, don't stop! I want to get this for posterity.'' That usually
shocks them into stopping, but she knows one family where three
sisters ignored the camera and kept fighting. When they watched it
weeks later, they were horrified. ``The bickering stopped,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, inserting yourself may be the best way to
break the cycle, says Samalin: ``Girls, you've got five minutes to
agree on what you're going to watch. If you can't figure it out,
I'll turn off the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons she likes that strategy so much is because it
turns their focus away from each other and on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better way to make allies out of siblings than for
them to hate you together,'' she says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other things parents can do &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Bickering diminishes as children become more involved with
peers and less with each other, usually by 12 or 13.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're worried that bickering masks true hostility, keep
track of how often a child does something kind or loyal for a
sibling. If it's less than once a week, consider it a red flag.
Consult a professional.
</P>
<P>
   --Although most bickering is normal, it can sometimes be fueled
by a mood disorder, learning disability or a highly charged issue
such as divorce. If you suspect any of these, consult a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   --Look at bickering as an opportunity, not a nightmare. The more
you express confidence in their problem-solving, the more they will
think of themselves as problem solvers and the better they will be
at resolving conflict in general.
</P>
<P>
   --Give children specific tools to nip bickering in the bud: If a
4-year-old gets victimized by a toddler, tell him, ``When you see
the baby coming and you know he's going to take something, say,
`Stop!' and hold out your hand.'' Tell a preschooler who gets
teased by an older sib, ``Walk away to another room.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure to tell your children that you hope they can solve
disagreements themselves but when they can't, they can always say,
``Mom/Dad, we need help.''

HEART OF OLD-FASHIONED LOVE STORY BEATS IN CHARMING `RETURN TO
ME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to good old-fashioned, uncomplicated romance
in the cinema? In a world of movies rife with sex, foul language
and the confusion of lust for love, ``Return to Me'' is a welcome
return to the courtship, cuddling and sweet nothings of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Gifted funnywoman Bonnie Hunt's directorial debut is a flyweight
heartwarmer brimming with winning characters, but it's built around
a story so slight and predictable it's a foregone conclusion from
the first act.
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny, the deadpan star of ``The X-Files,'' is all
smiles and charm as Bob, a successful contractor with a storybook
marriage to zoologist Elizabeth (Joely Fisher). ``I promise you
we'll see Italy,'' she pledges, dooming her in the world of
romantic tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver, who could charm the world in her sleep, is Grace,
a sickly girl raised by an overprotective grandpa awaiting the
heart transplant needed to save her life.
</P>
<P>
   In the most plot-stuffed opening in recent years, Bob loses his
wife in a car wreck (delicately portrayed in a restrained but
emotionally devastating sequence), Grace is the lucky recipient of
her heart, and after a year of near misses while they're absorbed
in mournful solitude and shy retreat, the strangers meet with an
instant simpatico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we know each other?'' is no pick-up line but the
unnecessary nudging of a script reminding us that these two hearts
are fated for true love. They court like shy, sincere school kids,
nervous and giddy.
</P>
<P>
   If we didn't already know where this is going, Hunt's
sledgehammer reminders lay the destiny on thick, making more of the
heart-crossed complication than it deserves. She has little
delicacy with the architecture of plot and every meaningful moment
is spelled out in capital letters, but she saves herself with
marvelous comic instincts and a light touch with actors.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is a Hollywood dream man: kind, sweet, funny, confident
and (as he shows in a heart-tugging breakdown of soulful sobbing in
the first act) achingly vulnerable. Driver unleashes that slow grin
that takes over her face like a sunrise but has frustratingly
little else to do: It's hard to imagine casting such a vibrant
actress as a naive wallflower, but she brings Grace to life with a
glow.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, who also co-stars as Grace's understanding best friend,
surrounds these two star turns with a marvelous ensemble that
lazily banters and bickers like old friends and extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' carries no surprises but floats nicely on the
simple charm of innocent romance and the good company of endearing
characters. It's not quite magic, but it'll do until the real thing
comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Return to Me. Directed by Bonnie Hunt. Screenplay by Hunt and
Don Lake. Cast: David Duchovny, Minnie Driver, Carroll O'Conner,
Robert Loggia, Bonnie Hunt, Joely Richardson, James Belushi. MGM.
116 minutes. Rated PG for mild language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B (romantics add a +, cynics a -)

VISIONS OF DARKNESS, DESPAIR AND HOPE IN A SMALL TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FALLING DARK 
By Tim Tharp 
Milkweed Editions, 271 pp., $39.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Tharp's ``Falling Dark'' is a version and a vision of the
pastoral. It is not an idealized pastoral of the past, even the
recent past, though a young boy in a small Oklahoma town dreams of
visiting a farm, and a friend of his, a young African-American boy,
does go to visit relatives who live on a farm.
</P>
<P>
   The town has a past you can glimpse beyond the blacktop and the
neon detritus of ``civilization.'' Once, 20 years ago, there was a
commune where the Sunshine People expected to find themselves in
nature and nature in themselves. It didn't work out that way; only
an old geodesic dome still stands, down by the pond on Sam Casey's
place.
</P>
<P>
   Life is rough and limited in this part of the world. The
Git-N-Go sign shines on, and there's a Dairy Queen, a gas station,
some sagging rent houses, a bar, and a lot of broken dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Bless works checkout at the grocery store. Since her
husband was gunned down by some crazy teenagers, she's been trying
to hold things together for her two sons, Wesley and Nelson, boys
who haven't been spoiled yet by the world they're in. It's an
uphill battle: Donna has a generous heart, but she also has a
problem. Despite her best intentions, she drinks way more than a
little bit too much. A friend says, coaxingly, ``One little beer
never did anybody any harm.'' `` `I don't know,' Donna said. But
she did know. She knew all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend's efforts to fix Donna up with a new man end up in an
attempted rape. She is rescued by Roy Dale, who is not exactly a
knight in shining armor; he moves into her life, and she accepts
him there because she's lonely, but the situation is no good, and
she knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Roy is a drifter and a liar, and, it turns out, a smalltime drug
dealer. There's a sizable marijuana crop growing out there at
Sam's, and Roy isn't above stealing some of the stash and taking it
in his pickup to Tulsa to do some business.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters who come into the story include Sam's daughter
Melinda and Melinda's friend Jennifer, who is a wild one, out of
control, and it turns out she has plenty of reason to be. `` `You
know, it's like I said,' Melinda observes, `she's the oldest friend
I have and my father always told me you have your regular family
and then you have the one you find along the way and that's how it
is with Jennifer and me. She might not always act like I think she
should, and I'll let her know it too, but I'm still going to try to
be the same kind of friend I'd want for myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda is a good person in an environment that doesn't seem to
care one way or the other about anything good. Wesley and Nelson
are good; and in different ways, Sam and Donna, who have seen a lot
more of life, are still trying to be good. It's a struggle, as even
the pure of heart learn. Ragel, the black boy, tells a kid on a
minibike who wants to beat him up, ``You know what's the matter
with you. . . . People treat you like trash, and so you have to go
around treating other people like trash. My daddy told me about
that, he told me all about what makes people like you.'' Even
little Nelson has a bedtime epiphany. ``Nelson lay his head back on
the pillow then and that was something he never knew. He never knew
how you could grow up to understand the world less than you did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Tharp understands the world and this particular place very well.
He grew up in Henryetta, Okla., and (according to a brief biography
printed at the end of the book) explored the United States by thumb
and pickup truck before experimenting with a variety of jobs. Now
he teaches at Oklahoma State University in Okmulgee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling Dark'' won Milkweed Press's national fiction prize,
and it deserves to. Tharp is an economical writer, uncannily
sensitive to the poetry of ordinary speech, but never soft at the
center. Donna ``pictured Sam Casey again, the way she had done
since seeing him on her front porch that night, standing there
half-turned, like a door that was just opening in front of her.''
That kind of precise language recalls some of the miracles in the
early work of Larry Woiwode, a writer of a different region.
</P>
<P>
   When, finally, Tharp writes about hope, as pastoral writers
always do, you have to believe him, because he knows all there is
to know about despair.

GARDEN TOURS ABROAD LURE PLANT-OBSESSED AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people visit a few parks or gardens while vacationing
abroad. It's part of seeing the sights. But 10 years ago, it was
difficult to find tour roups headed abroad specifically to look at
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Gardengoers now make up almost 16 percent of American
specialty tours to Europe, according to Bob Titsley of the British
Tourist Authority. Bonafide plant nuts whose idea of bliss is to
visit two gardens a day for 10 days are making garden tourism a
growing niche in the travel business.
</P>
<P>
   But garden hopping especially lends itself to organized tours
because, unlike, say, world-famous opera houses, great gardens are
usually not near a subway stop. In fact, notable gardens are often
notably hard to reach, being retreats from the world literally as
well as figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   If you go solo, you have to rent a car and find your way to 12
Horsenuts Lane in Clydesdale County, and when you get there you
often find you've arrived on the day it's closed or a week when the
famous laburnum walk is bare of petals.
</P>
<P>
   A well-organized tour eliminates these tragedies and often costs
little more than doing it on your own. It also provides reasonable
pacing, entry by special arrangement to private gardens that are
often better than the public ones, and, best of all, the company of
other gardening maniacs so you don't have to drag your civilian
friends and family members along. (My patient husband often sits in
the car reading a newspaper while I explore yet another garden.)
</P>
<P>
   Even gardeners can find themselves prematurely sated. The same
variety of antique rose that looked sublime in the first garden on
the first day can look ho-hum by the 12th garden on the sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a deep interest in gardens if it's that kind
of a trip,'' warns Lois Rosenfeld, author of the popular annual
guide ``The Garden Tourist.'' ``Otherwise, you're better off taking
a tour that mixes gardens and architecture or other historic
sights. Some of them I've noticed have theater or sightseeing
thrown in so you don't completely zone out on gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   The thriftiest way to visit gardens abroad, suggests Rosenfeld,
is often to ``check if there are any local one-day garden tours out
of major cities you might be staying in.'' For instance, I took in
Monet's waterlily garden at Giverny in an inexpensive half-day bus
tour available to anyone staying in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Arm yourself with comfortable shoes ``and four times as much
film as you think you'll need, because you'll use it,'' advises Nan
Sinton, who directs Horticulture magazine's excellent tour program.
There seems to be some direct neural connection between garden
gazing and photo snapping. ``People on garden tours use cameras
today the way they used sketchbooks 100 years ago. Still
photographs work better than camcorders for this. But don't take a
tripod, which usually aren't allowed because they block traffic and
they introduce a discordant element.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leading destinations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   England and Canada are still the leading foreign destinations
for garden visitors from the United States. The Chelsea Flower
Show, in London, May 23-26, is such a mainstream tourist event that
you can shop for special packages through the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as of last week Virgin Atlantic Airlines was
offering an unbeatable deal: Roundtrip tickets on an overnight
flight leaving New York May 22 and returning May 29, downtown
London hotel with breakfast for six nights, a fFlower sShow ticket,
and tours of several gardens including Sissinghurst, starting at
$1,269. Call 1-800-937-8474 or check their websiteWeb site at
www.Virgin-Atlantic.com.cq
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the best way to get tickets to this preeminent event,
which always sells out far in advance, is to join the British Royal
Horticulture Society and go on one of their two members' days. As a
bonus you get their excellent magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Canada offers ``the most comfort and ease if you're traveling on
your own,'' says Rosenfeld. It also offers the biggest bang for the
buck _ or loonie _ and is almost as garden-fixated as England,
despite (or perhaps because of) its northern latitude. Whenever I
drove through the tunnel from the vacant lots of downtown Detroit
to the civic gardens of downtown Windsor, Ontario, I felt like
Dorothy entering the Technicolor kingdom of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   French-speaking Canada loves flowers just as much, and Quebec is
close enough for a weekend getaway. The Montreal Botanical Garden
has 10 exhibition greenhouses and 30 outdoor gardens on 180 acres.
Montreal is also the setting for an unprecedented summerlong
multi-million-dollar international competition in ``mosaiculture''
_ sculptures and pictures pieced together from plant materials.
Quebec exhibited a sensual example at the New England Spring Flower
Show last month. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Summer gardens in winter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ring of garden travel seems to be widening. England's
gardens no longer seem so exotic, so today's trendy destinations
include Tuscany, Provence,Portugal, and Japan, where the Zen
gardens of Kyoto are a big draw.
</P>
<P>
   In the English-speaking world, New Zealand (with a much lusher
climate than Australia) is becoming popular despite the
knee-crunching 12-hour plane trip (from Los Angeles) because you
can enjoy gardens from October through February, thanks to the
equatorial inversion of seasons. The Taranaki Rhododendron
Festival, Oct. 28-Nov. 6, is justly famous. Once you get there, New
Zealand rivals Canada for ease of travel, thanks to the disarmingly
helpful inhabitants who to a soul seem thrilled to have visitors.
When I lost my wallet there on a visit, it was quickly returned,
cash intact.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is another south-of-the-equator destination that
has grown in popularity as a midwinter garden spot. Its unique
indigenous flora and thriving horticulture industry provide much
for flower lovers to see, as do the game preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My South African tours are always billed as wildflower and
wildlife tours. The wildflowers are good for most of the year, but
I always go in September, which is spring there, because the grass
is not very high and you see the animals much more easily, and you
often see babies,'' says the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's South
African-born director emeritus, Elizabeth Scholtz, who led some of
the first garden tours to that country.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of garden tour directors, Scholtz has led 79 excursions
to 42 countries since the program began in 1964. ``For a long time
we were the only kids on the block because when we would announce a
tour it would fill up overnight. Now everyone seems to be running
garden tours,'' she says. Based on long experience, her favorite
garden destinations include Japan, New Zealand, the Greek Isles,
and Madeira and elsewhere in Portugal, as well as South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland is also making a strong bid for garden tourism. The
European Regional Redevelopment Fund has made matching grants
available to privately owned Irish gardens that open their gates to
the public year-round, prompting a great increase in sites to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Irish Department of Tourism, more than 600,000
foreigners visit Irish gardens each year, about three times the
number of tourists who come to swing a golf club. But very good
Irish gardens such as Creagh in County Cork and Derreen in County
Kerry still log only about 9,000 annual visitors in contrast with
60,000 or more to comparable British gardens, according to Olda
FitzGerald, whose own estate garden at Glin Castle in County
Limerick is open to the public. That sounds heavenly to garden
travelers who have waited in line to get into Sissinghurst. &QL;

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... Sissinghurst.  Irish Gardens of Eden 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irish gardens are wilder than their English counterparts,
according to FitzGerald, wife of the well-known architectural
preservationist Desmond FitzGerald, the 29th knight of Glin. She
has just written ``Irish Gardens'' ($40, Hearst), to raise the
profile of 20 great Irish gardens open to visitors. ``Ireland does
have its clipped hedges and parterres, but if you leave it for one
minute, it grows twice as fast as England,'' says FitzGerald.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the Irish climate is generally wetter and milder
than even England's, making it hospitable to palm trees and other
semitropical plants, as well as rampant vines. Mixing exotics with
native plants for a Garden of Eden effect was a dictum of the
influential turn-of-the-century Irish garden writer and designer
William Robinson, and remains a trademark of the Irish garden
style.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently Ireland's great estate gardens were barely
surviving, however. ``Things were quite gloomy from 1939 on. The
gardens were running down badly because there was less money to
keep them up, fewer workers to do so, and a general lack of
interest. Gardening was seen as a property of the middle-class
Protestant spinster ladies. And there was always (the feeling)
about the big homes and their walled gardens that (they
represented) a colonial elite. But now everybody's interested in
the gardens and dreaming of a good tourist trade,'' says
FitzGerald.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her favorites are Helen Dillon's garden in Dublin and
designer Jim Reynolds's Butterstream in County Meath. Reynolds is
chairman of the Great Gardens of Ireland Restoration Programme,
which since 1994 has helped save a number of old estate gardens
``just before they disappeared into the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to tackle the byways to find Ireland's gardens,
FitzGerald warned, ``Ireland is a small country, but you need to
have a map. There's a lot of untouched countryside. And you need to
keep very calm. Because a cow in the road could easily happen.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``Return to Me'' is a movie that has no business working, but it
does. The premise alone should be required to carry some sort of
warning: Widower falls in love with transplant patient who carries
his late wife's heart.
</P>
<P>
   If you just groaned, then find another movie. This one is so
full of whimsy that the set decorators probably had to sweep the
fairy dust away at the end of each day. But for anyone who misses
Doris Day, believes that love conquers all and that it's possible
to get good corned beef and cabbage at an Italian restaurant named
O'Reilly's, ``Return to Me'' is a romantic throwback that will warm
your heart and give your handkerchief a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hunt, !ital!the gal pal of the romantic fantasy genre
(``Jerry Maguire,'' ``Only You,'' etc., etc.) co-wrote and directed
``Return to Me,'' !ital!and cast herself as the movie's gal pal.
It's a hit-and-miss effort. Too often Hunt settles for the
trite-and-true with twinkly old-timers, non-existent character arcs
and a shameless (not to mention stupid and strained) subplot
involving a lonesome gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   And yet just when you feel an overpowering urge to run to the
exit (this is especially pressing in the film's first 20 minutes),
Hunt reins the film in and creates such an appealing atmosphere of
sweetness and innocence that you can't help but follow the words of
an old Dean Martin hit and ``smile, smile, smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Dino, of course, sings the film's title song, and he and Sinatra
and Jackie Gleason's syrupy orchestra provide the mood music for
the movie. David Duchovny shrugs off his dour ``X-Files'' persona
to play the widower, Bob, who's devastated after losing his beloved
wife in an automobile accident. Minnie Driver, returning to the
kind of vulnerable role that won her acclaim in ``Good Will
Hunting,'' is the beneficiary of the wife's misfortune, getting a
new lease on a life that, until now, has been rather sheltered.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's character, Grace, waits tables at the improbable
Italian restaurant, where her grandfather (Carroll O'Connor) and
his chef (Robert Loggia) and their cronies seem to spend more time
playing poker (and Cupid) than they do serving pasta. When Bob
finds himself in O'Reilly's on the blind date from hell, he and
Grace meet and !ital!zing go the strings of their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Only Grace's heart came from Bob's dead wife. Only Grace doesn't
know that, and Bob certainly doesn't, either. And therein lies the
obstacle to their future happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny and Driver have a natural ease together, giving their
scenes an engaging believability in this most heightened of
fantasies. Hunt and co-writer Don Lake also play favorites, giving
her some enjoyably earthy supporting scenes with Jim Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Belushi? Enjoyable? Like we said, ``Return to Me'' provides
a number of unlikely pleasures. &QL;

 &HT;     DIPLOMATIC DiMAGGIO STRIKES OUT A LAWYER  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dom DiMaggio is a famously nice guy, as outgoing
as his late brother Joe was private.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't want to get this former Red Sox center fielder
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg has gotten Dom DiMaggio very angry.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dom was boiling that Engelberg, the executor of
Joe's estate, is threatening to sue San Francisco in the name of
the DiMaggio family if the city renames the North Beach Playground
in honor of Joe, instead of renaming something big like the Bay
Bridge, the airport or a gift horse's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged. He's intimating that I've been involved in
what's going on,'' said DiMaggio, when I called him at his home in
Florida. ``I have been treated as a complete stranger. As an
individual and a human being, I'm ashamed at what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg has said he's speaking for the family, but he hasn't
talked to the most famous living DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not represent me,'' said Dom, who has let his feelings
be known to city officials. ``I've sat by long enough. I think I'm
affected now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Paul DiMaggio (known as ``The Little Professor'' because
of his glasses and articulate manner of speaking) had an impressive
career batting average of .298 over 11 seasons with the Boston Red
Sox, and played with great grace, like his more famous brother.
</P>
<P>
   He's proud of having learned to play ball with his brothers on
that little playground, and thinks it would be wonderful to name it
after Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we lived only a block from there,'' he said. ``We
played there morning, noon and night. We even jumped over the fence
on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom said he'd like to see future major leaguers learn to play
ball in a playground named for his brother Joe.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, San Francisco could call it ``DiMaggio
Playground'' for Dom. The man has a lot of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had my admiration. He supported us from day one,
but wanted to keep a low profile,'' said city Supervisor Gavin
Newsom, who has led San Francisco's efforts to find a DiMaggio
memorial. ``What I like is his deep love and admiration for the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Engelberg, what can you say?
</P>
<P>
   There are some parts of San Francisco worthy of naming after
him, if we haven't cleaned up all our toxic waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates' biggest innovation: Use the word ``innovation'' as
many times as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a public letter printed in newspapers Wednesday after the
antitrust decision against Microsoft, Gates used the word
``innovation'' three times, as well as ``innovate,'' ``innovative''
and ``innovating'' one time each.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a techie friend what technical innovations Microsoft had
ever made and all he could think of was an elegant little operating
system for the old Tandy 100 portable computers. Even Microsoft's
business practices are less than innovative, having been developed
by moguls born 100 years before Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't care how innovative Microsoft is. They care
how Microsoft stock is doing, and my bet is that it will continue
to perform better than those ``innovative'' Microsoft products.

US LEGAL VETERAN BECOMES A KEY TO CUBAN BOY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He is cast alternately as an unfit father and as
the other helpless victim, as he is shown, eyes swelling with
tears, on Cuban television considering the long separation from his
six-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   But if Juan Miguel Gonzalez wins the battle over Elian, it may
have less to do with his image or emotions than with his powerful
Washington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, known here as the ``quarterback'' for
President Clinton's impeachment legal team and a longtime adviser
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has taken on the father's case. And
the effects of his $400- to $500-an-hour talent are being felt.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's associates say his involvement has nothing to do with
his close ties to the Clinton White House, which has advocated
reuniting Elian with his father. Craig has said he is involved
because he has a six-year-old son of his own. But his entry onto
the scene underscores how tightly intertwined politics, law and
personal diplomacy have become _ even by Washington standards _ in
this highly unusual case.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 55, for example, was once director of policy planning at
the State Department, the agency that issued a visa to Gonzalez. He
spent time as a foreign policy adviser on Capitol Hill, where
legislators are considering a bill to let Gonzalez stay.
</P>
<P>
   He seeems to have the skills of a Washington insider. He
attended Yale Law School with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and
cultivated strong ties with Kennedy. (All advocate returning Elian
to Cuba).
</P>
<P>
   And he is no stranger to controversy; long before representing
Clinton in the US Senate trial, Craig helped to defend John
Hinckley, the attempted Reagan assassin, and guided Kennedy through
his nephew's Palm Beach rape trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have someone who had access to the courts and was
well-connected,'' said Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, formerly of
the National Council of Churches, who travelled to Cuba to
introduce Craig to Gonzalez last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father's wishes were taken much more seriously when he
came on board,'' Campbell said of Craig. ``He can speak to lawyers
at INS and at Justice. These are not conversations we were able to
have before. He's had direct access which no one ever had before.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the change has been in simply gaining respect for
Gonzalez _ and access to the Miami relatives of Elian, who had kept
the boy's Cuban family at arm's length, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, at a news conference outside his office last week,
blasted Elian's Miami guardians for giving the media wide-ranging
access to the boy. He said they had decided to ``parade Elian in
front of demonstrators,'' and added that one point was not
negotiable: ``Elian's best interests lie with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, Craig is, in fact, a negotiator. At once
charming and self-deprecating, he is noted for trying to keep his
opponent talking: In this case, Kendall Coffey, the lawyer for the
sometimes-hostile Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   And while participants declined to specify details, they said
Craig, in general, has brought the Cuban father's perspective more
fully into the national spotlight since coming on board.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harvard senior in 1967, while other students protested in
the streets, Craig chaired a meeting between more moderate college
Vietnam war protesters and US Secretary of State Dean Rusk. It was
an off-the-record gathering, but afterward, Craig went public with
his disappointment, writing an editorial in the Harvard Alumni
Bulletin that described the students' reactions to Rusk's opinions
thus: ``quite literally stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later, when he was brought in to head
Clinton's impeachment team, Craig found himself once again a voice
of moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with two sets of Clinton advisers, the lawyers who wanted
to keep revelations under wraps, and the political strategists who
saw the value of releasing damaging information fully and fast,
Craig pressed for a certain degree of information to be released in
the interest of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   But ``he really understood that there were different interests
that had to be reconciled,'' said the former White House press
secretary, Michael D. McCurry. Craig wasn't just concerned with
legal issues, he said. ``I always felt he was someone I could talk
to who wouldn't take a real hard line and say, `We can't do X, Y
and Z in the public arena,' '' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, who has
been friends with Craig since his Harvard days, agreed: ``He pulled
the administration's position into a clear, strategic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Craig, reporters ``didn't write any stories about how
they were going off in different ways, or about differences among
his advisers, which was really unusual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of foreign policy, Craig's dealings have not always
won such unmitigated praise. As a foreign policy adviser to Kennedy
in the 1980s, he pressed for sanctions against apartheid-controlled
South Africa _ and did, Kennedy now says, a ``brilliant job.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in private practice, however, Craig represented a Haitian
family with close ties to coup leaders in Haiti. In fighting to
lift sanctions on their behalf, Craig prompted criticism from some
former allies who believed he was tarnishing his idealistic image.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department aide said in his defense: ``Lawyers defend a
lot of people and have a lot of clients.'' But the official added
that in the case of Elian, ``it is natural for him to be on this
side _ more so than representing members of the Haitian elite
class.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, of course, being paid to help Gonzalez. Although Craig
has reduced his fees, the group that is paying them, the General
Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, says it
is raising up to $100,000 for Craig's services. Neither the Cuban
government nor Gonzalez himself is helping foot the bill, said the
group's general secretary, Thom Whitewolf Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   Craig has a fellow Democrat to thank for having landed the case:
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who called Campbell to suggest
she hire Craig to help Gonzalez. Craig has deep family roots in
Vermont, where his father attended college and ran for governor as
a Republican in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell believes that what drew Craig to the case was much
more personal. A father of five, Craig talked more than anything
about his own children during his visit with Gonzalez in Havana
last month, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't come to this intellectually. He comes to this as
the father of a six-year-old, and he said quite clearly, `I don't
know how I would function if someone took him away from me,' '' she
said. ``He knows a lot of people. He's very well-connected in a lot
of agencies. But he makes no bones about the fact that he thinks
the father is a good father. That's what his representation is
about.''

SOPRANOS: SO MANY PLOTS, SO LITTLE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHTIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was TV Guide's entire teaser for last Sunday's episode of
``The Sopranos'': ``Tony throws a party for Richie and Janice.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a party it was. Such a happy couple. Who would have
guessed that before the hour was out she'd whack him with the gun
he liked to hold to her head when they were in bed?
</P>
<P>
   Janice merely suggested that it was no big deal if Richie's
ballroom-dancing son was gay. Richie responded by smashing her in
the mouth. Bang. Bang. Richie didn't even get to finish his ziti.
Minutes later, Christopher and Furio were stuffing his remains into
a meat grinder at Satriale's butcher shop. I guess this means the
wedding is off.
</P>
<P>
   What do we have to look forward to this Sunday on ``The
Sopranos'' season-ending episode? Here's what TV Guide says: ``Tony
visits the rarely seen Livia to negotiate her future living
arrangements. Meanwhile Meadow's graduation is cause for
celebration, and Carmela gets an extravagant addition to her
wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   No hint of mayhem there. But let's not be discouraged. Look what
happened last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sopranos'' fans have their own ideas about what turns the plot
may take. I have mine, you have yours, and if you log on to HBO.com
there's a message board full of fans' predictions about what could
happen on the season's last show. Most seem to agree on one thing;
Pussy has to go. But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   One of many things that sets this series apart is its
unpredictability. Another is its dead-on depiction of ordinary,
everyday, dysfunctional family life with all the plotting and
scheming, the suspicion, the greed, the lying, the back-stabbing,
the betrayals, the grudges, the yearning for revenge. They may be
Family but they're family, too. No wonder we love them.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans' predictions for the season-ender are a tad
far-fetched even by ``Sopranos'' standards. One rabid viewer
suggests that Richie didn't die, that he was wearing a bullet-proof
vest, and that the shooting was staged by Uncle Junior to give
Richie a chance to kill Tony in the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Another prediction, almost as loony, has Junior killed, Tony
going to prison, and Janice, or possibly Carmela, taking over the
business.
</P>
<P>
   A number of contributors think Dr. Melfi has the hots for her
most notorious patient and has taken to drinking to avoid
confronting her feelings for Tony. Personally, I think she's
drinking because Peter Bogdanovich is her psychiatrist, but that's
just my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my final episode predictions, for what they're worth,
ie., not much. Anthony Jr. becomes convinced he's adopted, that
he's really Jewish and has been cheated out of a bar mitzvah.
Meadow reluctantly agrees to go to NYU, then comes out as a lesbian
to annoy her parents. After Carmela has a vision, the Soprano
swimming pool becomes a place of religious pilgrimage. The FDA
shuts down Satriale's when an outbreak of sausage-related E. coli
sweeps New Jersey. Christopher marries Adrianna, who whines
incessantly that Tony killed her Uncle Richie. Adrianna disappears.
Dr. Melfi consults the psychic in Nyack about her drinking problem.
Pussy undergoes sex re-assignment surgery and enters the federal
witness protection program. Uncle Junior gets his hand stuck in the
garbage disposal again. Tony has the mother of all panic attacks
when he wakes up in bed with Livia. Is he dreaming? We'll have to

THERE'S NO DEFENDING THE BEFUDDLED `RULES OF ENGAGEMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: D  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The credits (which include a former secretary of the Navy as
executive producer) and advertising for the military drama ``Rules
of Engagement'' would lead one to expect the most intelligent and
thought-provoking Hollywood court-martial thriller since ``A Few
Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   And those expectations are heightened when the film opens with
not one but two devastating action sequences _ one set in 1968
Vietnam, the other in contemporary Yemen _ that recall director
William Friedkin's heyday of ``The French Connection'' and ``The
Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's downhill from this point on and, by the time the film
plummets to its rock bottom, we find ourselves in a flag-waving
no-brainer of the first order, and one of the most thoroughly
confused morality tales in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a
highly decorated U.S. Marine officer, who, in the midst of an
operation to rescue the besieged U.S. ambassador to Yemen and his
family, orders his men to fire into a crowd that's attacking the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   When 83 civilians, including women and children, are killed, a
slimy National Security adviser (Bruce Greenwood) decides to
destroy a surveillance tape that proves the crowd was filled with
armed snipers and prosecute Childers for murder _ hoping this will
placate our angry allies in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   To defend him at his court-martial, Childers chooses a fellow
Marine, Col. Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), an old buddy from the
Vietnam War whose life he saved in the prologue _ a man with his
own demons who is not much of a lawyer and even less of a
detective.
</P>
<P>
   From here, we have to watch Childers as he's ``hung out to dry''
_ spit on by protesters, perjured in the courtroom and made to look
like an out-of-control psychopath, even though we know he's
innocent of the charges and an all-around great American who wants
nothing out of life but the privilege of serving his country.
</P>
<P>
   As a drama, it's all very heavy-handed and plodding: filled with
one-note characters, mindless patriotic sentiment and tiresome
macho bonding rituals. (At one point, the two 50 year-old Marines
duke it out in Childers' quarters, and come up bloody and smiling _
like we're suddenly in a John Wayne movie!).
</P>
<P>
   As a legal thriller, its not just weak, but a Swiss cheese of
story holes and non sequiturs. Childers' whole defense depends on
proving the crowd was armed and yet no one even thinks of calling
to the stand one of the Marines who carried out Childers' orders
and surely would have been in a perfect position to see the crowd.
And that's just one of maybe a dozen points that makes you want to
grab the screenwriter by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   As a morality tale, the film is even more of a disaster. It asks
us, ultimately, to see Childers as a noble warrior and a put-upon
martyr, but we clearly see him commit a war crime in the Vietnam
prologue _ callously executing an unarmed POW _ and he doesn't even
try to disperse the crowd of mostly women and children by shooting
over its head.
</P>
<P>
   But, by far, the biggest failing of ``Rules of Engagement'' is
that it simply can't make us believe its preposterous premise _
that the U.S. government would rather have another William Calley
scandal on its hands than face a few Arab allies with evidence that
its man acted in self-defense. It just doesn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of Engagement. Directed by William Friedkin. Cast: Tommy
Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce, Bruce Greenwood, Anne
Archer, Ben Kingsley. Paramount. 123 minutes. Rated R for combat
violence.

<P>
   When Philip Seymour Hoffman walks into the greasy spoon near his
West Village apartment, a hat with ear flaps is pulled down low on
his head, a blue muffler up high to his freezing nose, leaving
visible only a narrow strip of skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest day in New York in three years, and his
dark-framed glasses start to fog up within seconds. With the
sneakers and baggy work pants, he looks a little like the attendant
at your local gas station who always has a friendly wave and a
smile but is kind of scary anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He says hello to the waitress, who's waiting to lock up. Letting
her call it a day, Hoffman leads the way across Eighth Avenue to
another tiny cafe, where he greets the counter man with the same
familiarity he did the waitress. Both treat him like a regular, a
neighborhood guy who appreciates a good slice of apple pie. They
seem genuinely oblivious to the fact that their customer is one of
the fastest rising actors in the business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Hoffman has made the difficult leap from
anonymous but respected character actor (``Oh yeah, that guy'' in
movies from ``Boogie Nights'' to ``Twister'') to leading man
(``Flawless,'' David Mamet's upcoming ``State and Main'').
</P>
<P>
   With two big movies (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
``Magnolia'') now in theaters _ which together earned him the
National Board of Review's best supporting actor award _ Hoffman
has begun rehearsals for his Broadway debut, in a revival of Sam
Shepard's ``True West,'' which opened in March. This was Shepard's
first day sitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was f---ing frightening,'' Hoffman admits with no hint of
pretense. The enigmatic playwright's presence isn't the only thing
giving Hoffman a case of the nerves. ``It wouldn't be scary if I
was one of the guys in the town in ``Our Town,'' you know what I
mean?'' he says with a laugh, then digs into that apple pie. ``Then
it would just be kind of fun _ like, I'm on Broadway, let's give it
a go.''
</P>
<P>
   This situation, he says, is more like ``Flawless,'' in which he
played a drag queen opposite Robert De Niro, ``picking the most
difficult situation to jump into new territory.'' He is referring
not just to the emotional intensity of ``True West,'' about two
brothers reunited in their mother's house, but to director Matthew
Warchus' decision to have Hoffman and his co-star, John C. Reilly,
swap parts every three or four performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not our idea,'' Hoffman says. ``In fact, that was one
of the reasons, when they came to me in the first place, I was not
interested. I was like, `I'm not going to do that. That's hokey.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then Reilly, who appeared with him in all three Paul Thomas
Anderson movies _ ``Hard Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and
``Magnolia'' _ talked him into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's probably the only person whose work I look at and go,
`Aw, man,''' Reilly says. ``It's like, where the hell did he come
up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agree that they wouldn't have wanted to do the play
with a total stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two actors really have to trust each other,'' Hoffman
says, ``because you're giving up your part to the other person
every few days, then taking it back. It's so intimate what these
actors are doing. It's like trading bodily fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's shed his winter layers, by the way, Hoffman isn't
scary at all. Disheveled, yes, with blond hair sticking out in
every direction, and enough reddish growth on his face to indicate
he's giving his razor a lengthy vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really resemble any of his extraordinarily diverse
characters _ certainly not Allen, the overweight obscene
phone-caller in ``Happiness,'' or Scotty, the chubby, lovesick
production assistant in ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Hoffman isn't fat. A high-school jock before
discovering acting, he's a husky, powerfully built guy. But he's
also not vain, evidenced by his willingness to pork up to 230 for
slob-loser effect in ``Happiness.'' (Standing 5-feet-10-inches
tall, he says he was a trim 190 for ``State and Main'' but has
since put on 25 pounds because he quit smoking.)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the press, though, have been less than kind about his
physique, which has become a sore spot. Asked if there are any
characters he doesn't think he could play, Hoffman interprets the
question to be about his looks and brings up an unflattering review
of ``Flawless.'' (Overall, though the movie was panned, Hoffman's
reviews were superb.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy started commenting, `Phil's just not right for this
part. He's way too big for the dress he's in,''' he remembers. ``It
was something like that, but it was really kind of cruel and stupid
and just ignorant. You just wanted to find the guy and be like,
`Umm, I'm playing a guy who thinks he's a woman, jackass. That's
the whole f---ing point. What do you think, only skinny men are
these people? Only non-muscular men? Have you walked around Chelsea
lately?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Hoffman is not entirely comfortable in a
profession that has always been _ and always will be _ heavily
based on looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get carried away with it,'' he says. ``Relax. Is the guy
acting well or not? Is she acting well or not? Are you caught up in
the story or not? Pay attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, Hoffman may not be the gorgeous guy you drool
over from afar, but he's the one you end up falling in love with.
Which may be why David Mamet cast him as the lead in ``State and
Main,'' due out in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respect David for hiring me, because I don't think I
was the guy most people would think of to play the kind of Jimmy
Stewart role,'' he says, laughing. ``No one told me this, but I
have this feeling that there was somebody cast, and that didn't
work out. It was pretty close to shooting that I got hired _ like
three weeks before shooting _ and it was the lead of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which he describes as being about truth and the battle
not to sell out, stars Hoffman as a beleaguered screenwriter who
comes to a small town in Vermont to shoot his movie and falls in
love with a local woman, played by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the extreme characters he's portrayed, Hoffman
welcomed the chance to play an everyman _ and one who gets the
girl. But he insists the part was no less challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romantic leads are really more character roles than
anything,'' he explains. ``They're people falling in love, so just
how glamorous can that be? Think about it: Not knowing what to say,
feeling uncomfortable, feeling awkward _ or feeling completely not
awkward, so therefore you're saying stupid s--t all the time. It's
really kind of a bumbling thing, falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is so passionate about what he's saying that it's hard
to figure out where the character ends and he begins. He is cagey
about his personal life, at one point mentioning in passing that he
briefly moved to Los Angeles in his 20s ``for some woman,'' and
otherwise skirting the issue with, ``I take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he returns to the subject on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it's truly hard to be yourself is when you're
madly in love, obsessively in love,'' he says, ``because you're
really scared that you suck, that they're going to find out that
you suck. It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the 32-year-old Hoffman is most comfortable is in the
theater. He had his start there in high school, outside of
Rochester, N.Y., after being sidelined with a sports injury. Then
he chose New York University to study drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to do film at all,'' he says. ``I thought it
was silly _ not that film was silly, but that me acting in film was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles came early on anyway, in ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Nobody's Fool,'' ``The Big Lebowski'' and a couple dozen others,
and Hoffman found himself moving easily between stage and movie
set. He's on the board of the LAByrinth Theatre Co. and received
strong notices last summer for his first directorial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money being made,'' he says of the company, ``and really,
purely, some great stuff being created.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Boogie Nights'' hit theaters in 1997, people had
begun to take notice of him, and then Hoffman auditioned for
``Happiness,'' director Todd Solondz' dark comedy about a group of
miserable New Jerseyites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never met Phil or heard of him,'' Solondz says, ``and was
terribly disappointed to discover that Paul Thomas Anderson had
already discovered him. I wanted to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, in turn, had recently seen ``Happiness'' when
he started looking for two ``chameleon-like actors'' who could do
``True West'' with the chance of transcending the typical
comparisons to the classic team of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I thought of was Phil,'' he remembers. ``He
is quite extreme without losing truth or plausibility. I think
that's a gift, not a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly calls him ``a searcher'' and gushes, ``Phil can
make a meal out of the littlest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the scene in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in which
Hoffman, playing Matt Damon's uppercrust tormenter, is listening to
records with Jude Law and cuts Damon down with just a withering
stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been one of those light days. But you're just
like, `Goddamn, look at Phil Hoffman.' One scene with no dialog
establishes what the whole character's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admits that the snobby Freddie Miles ``was exquisitely
fun to play'' _ and not just because it meant six weeks in Rome
with plenty of time for espresso, sightseeing with Cate Blanchett
and her husband and even some Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's extraordinarily wealthy, floats around Europe and
hangs out with affluent, well-educated, literary people,'' Hoffman
says. ``I drank beer in the woods. That's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His slight regional accent has led him to create a different
voice for virtually every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's writing parts for redheaded guys who grew up in
Fairport, N.Y.,'' he says. ``It's just not happening. I don't have
(the accent) as much, but my mouth is lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``I remember reading it and
just going --'' he breaks off, reshaping his mouth into Freddie's
smirk. ``They sound like they're from England, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman used his own voice as the tenderhearted nurse Phil in
``Magnolia,'' which he calls ``one of the best movies I've ever
been in. It's really ballsy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and more than a little irritated at the beating
it's taken from some critics (though his reviews have been
characteristically excellent), he adds, ``I really do think in 20
years people are going to talk about `Magnolia' as the movie that
was extraordinarily profound at the time it came out, saying
something about the numbness and cynicism of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he jumps out of his chair to help an elderly woman
and her pushcart into the cafe. When he returns to the table,
Hoffman has one last story to tell. It's about shooting the
surreal, climactic frog scene in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his directors and colleagues have to say about his
talent, Hoffman insists acting comes naturally to no one, certainly
not him. But he's also not a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to act like there are thousands of frogs,'' he
remembers, ``and I have to start the scene crying. I was just fed
up, and I couldn't. I was freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew waited at 4 a.m. to get the shot and go home to bed,
Hoffman struggled. Finally, out of pure frustration, he began to
cry. Paul Thomas Anderson called action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a squirt-in-the-eye kind of guy,'' Hoffman
says. ``Morally, I feel like I'd burst into flames if I did
that.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is so passionate about what he's saying that it's hard
to figure out where the character ends and he begins. He is cagey
about his personal life, at one point mentioning in passing that he
briefly moved to Los Angeles in his 20s ``for some woman,'' and
otherwise skirting the issue with, ``I take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he returns to the subject on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it's truly hard to be yourself is when you're
madly in love, obsessively in love,'' he says, ``because you're
really scared that you suck, that they're going to find out that
you suck. It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the 32-year-old Hoffman is most comfortable is in the
theater. He had his start there in high school, outside of
Rochester, N.Y., after being sidelined with a sports injury. Then
he chose New York University to study drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to do film at all,'' he says. ``I thought it
was silly _ not that film was silly, but that me acting in film was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles came early on anyway, in ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Nobody's Fool,'' ``The Big Lebowski'' and a couple dozen others,
and Hoffman found himself moving easily between stage and movie
set. He's on the board of the LAByrinth Theatre Co. and received
strong notices last summer for his first directorial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money being made,'' he says of the company, ``and really,
purely, some great stuff being created.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Boogie Nights'' hit theaters in 1997, people had
begun to take notice of him, and then Hoffman auditioned for
``Happiness,'' director Todd Solondz' dark comedy about a group of
miserable New Jerseyites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never met Phil or heard of him,'' Solondz says, ``and was
terribly disappointed to discover that Paul Thomas Anderson had
already discovered him. I wanted to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, in turn, had recently seen ``Happiness'' when
he started looking for two ``chameleon-like actors'' who could do
``True West'' with the chance of transcending the typical
comparisons to the classic team of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I thought of was Phil,'' he remembers. ``He
is quite extreme without losing truth or plausibility. I think
that's a gift, not a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly calls him ``a searcher'' and gushes, ``Phil can
make a meal out of the littlest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the scene in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in which
Hoffman, playing Matt Damon's uppercrust tormenter, is listening to
records with Jude Law and cuts Damon down with just a withering
stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been one of those light days. But you're just
like, `Goddamn, look at Phil Hoffman.' One scene with no dialog
establishes what the whole character's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admits that the snobby Freddie Miles ``was exquisitely
fun to play'' _ and not just because it meant six weeks in Rome
with plenty of time for espresso, sightseeing with Cate Blanchett
and her husband and even some Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's extraordinarily wealthy, floats around Europe and
hangs out with affluent, well-educated, literary people,'' Hoffman
says. ``I drank beer in the woods. That's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His slight regional accent has led him to create a different
voice for virtually every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's writing parts for redheaded guys who grew up in
Fairport, N.Y.,'' he says. ``It's just not happening. I don't have
(the accent) as much, but my mouth is lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``I remember reading it and
just going --'' he breaks off, reshaping his mouth into Freddie's
smirk. ``They sound like they're from England, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman used his own voice as the tenderhearted nurse Phil in
``Magnolia,'' which he calls ``one of the best movies I've ever
been in. It's really ballsy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and more than a little irritated at the beating
it's taken from some critics (though his reviews have been
characteristically excellent), he adds, ``I really do think in 20
years people are going to talk about `Magnolia' as the movie that
was extraordinarily profound at the time it came out, saying
something about the numbness and cynicism of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he jumps out of his chair to help an elderly woman
and her pushcart into the cafe. When he returns to the table,
Hoffman has one last story to tell. It's about shooting the
surreal, climactic frog scene in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his directors and colleagues have to say about his
talent, Hoffman insists acting comes naturally to no one, certainly
not him. But he's also not a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to act like there are thousands of frogs,'' he
remembers, ``and I have to start the scene crying. I was just fed
up, and I couldn't. I was freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew waited at 4 a.m. to get the shot and go home to bed,
Hoffman struggled. Finally, out of pure frustration, he began to
cry. Paul Thomas Anderson called action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a squirt-in-the-eye kind of guy,'' Hoffman
says. ``Morally, I feel like I'd burst into flames if I did
that.'' &QL;

<P>
   MILAN _ He's played every role from gigolo to gentleman, and now
Richard Gere is starring as the resourceful Italian butler
Ambrogio.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrogio?
</P>
<P>
   Gere and a string of other top names including Brad Pitt,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford
are pocketing millions plugging Italian products from sunglasses to
spumante in ads that appear almost everywhere _ except the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stars have long boosted their income with lucrative ad
campaigns fashioned mostly for the Japanese and other Asian
markets. Now American actors are marching westward _ and directly
into Italy _ where companies are waiting with open purses and
high-quality, if sometimes silly, campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is the most vigorous industry in the world _ on all
levels. It influences people's tastes, and its events echo
throughout the world,'' said Silvia Damiani, who just hired Brad
Pitt to star in the ads for her family-run jewelry company.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for Italians' latest love affair with
Hollywood: ``With e-commerce and the single currency, Italian
companies, which have traditionally used local celebrities, want to
appear less provincial, more global. What could be better than
trading on the universal, cosmopolitan allure of a Hollywood
actor?'' said Luca Vercelloni of GPF &AMP; Associati, a research
institute and consultancy here.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Italians may not be as generous as the Japanese _
who won't blink at paying $4 million for a celebrity-focused
campaign _ they are more than willing to loosen their purse strings
for a Hollywood face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fees start at about six or seven figures and can go up to
several millions of dollars depending on how long the ad is used
and in how many countries,'' said Reuben Igielko-Herrlich, an owner
of the Geneva-based Propaganda, which specializes in product
placement, special events and corporate advertising. ``There is no
rule, and no flat fee. Everything is negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis were among the first to arrive in
Italy. In 1997, Stone shot a Spumanti Martini ad in which she plays
herself as an awards presenter on Oscar night. The ad was so
popular that it has run every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis did the European print campaign for De Rigo's
Police sunglasses, which appeared in more than 60 countries, and
he'll be starring in the next campaign, which breaks later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Agents for Stone, Willis and Gere refused to have their client's
images appear in an American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Igielko-Herrlich added that American actors _ whether they
appear in films or ad campaigns _ can boost the popularity of a
brand in record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication is a long-term strategy, so it's hard to
quantify the results of a specific campaign. One thing we've
observed, however, is that consumers will walk into a store and ask
for a specific product they've seen a star use on screen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the chocolate company Ferrero chose
Richard Gere for its latest television campaign. Last year Ferrero,
which makes Nutella and other sweets, needed a high-voltage TV
campaign to replace the successful but long-running one for its
Ferrero Rocher chocolates. The old ads starred the tireless
Ambrogio, a chauffeur and butler, who regularly dispensed the
elegant chocolates, wrapped in gold foil, to his socialite boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ad, Gere plays himself and is watching La Traviata
when he spots a young woman _ clearly in need of a chocolate _
sitting in the balcony of the theater. As if by magic, the
chocolate appears in front of her. When the woman, who by then
recognizes Gere, goes to thank him she says: ``But aren't you...?''
and he replies: ``Ambrogio.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ferrero spokeswoman said the ad was by far the most popular in
the history of the company. It was so successful, in fact, that the
actor is filming a sequel that will air in Italy in September.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ferrero's choice of Gere in particular, the spokeswoman
said: ``He's elegant yet accessible _ and he's everyone's Prince
Charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration is also the reason why Fiat chose to use Harrison
Ford in its Lancia Lybra ads, and Catherine Zeta-Jones in its Alfa
Romeo Sportwagon campaign, which broke here recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of the hottest names in the world,
and this is an international campaign. She will help accelerate
awareness of the brand in the 17 European countries where the ad
appears,'' said Luca Lindner, chief executive of Conquest Network,
which developed the ad.
</P>
<P>
   While Fiat worked with another agency, Armando Testa, to create
the Lancia ads, the idea behind both campaigns is the same: sleek
image, speedy delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancia ad shows Harrison Ford reviving a dying plant by
placing it on the passenger seat of the car and cruising on the
open road. In print, he poses on the hood of the car with a caption
that says: ``It doesn't matter how far you've traveled, just how.''
</P>
<P>
   An Armando Testa spokesman said Fiat believes Ford embodies the
rock-solid values of Europe's ``new middle class ... which offers
large growth potential for Lancia Lybra.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that actors' primary motivation for doing the ads is
money, but there are other reasons as well. And while all the
actors mentioned declined to comment for this story, the Italian
companies are proud to talk about why they chose to be in a
specific campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero said Gere donated his fee _ a reported $1.4 million _ to
the cause to free Tibet. Damiani said Pitt walked into her store
looking to buy a ring for his girlfriend Jennifer Aniston, and the
two became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who has appeared in Japanese automobile and beer ads, told
Italian newspapers last year that he's proud of his publicity work:
``I hope that the U.S. comes to accept the idea of actors appearing
in TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be too long in coming: ``I can understand that
actors are protective of their images in their main market _ the
U.S. _ and that one bad TV advertisement can be damaging,'' said
Federico Fasolino, a partner in Brw, one of Italy's foremost
advertising production companies. ``On the flip side, a well-done
campaign can actually be a vehicle to boost or relaunch a career,''
he added. &QL;

OUR LEGACY TO GRANDCHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was sitting at a coffee shop with friends, all of us
grandmothers. We were talking about our amazing grandkids, but
contrary to what you might expect, we weren't bragging. We were
sharing serious concerns. I have changed the names for reasons of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about Dory,'' said one of the women. ``She's
hyperactive, I guess, but what disturbs me most is that she doesn't
make much eye contact. She'll look into your eyes for a second, but
then she's off, and you feel as if she hasn't really connected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John's been diagnosed as dyslexic,'' said another. ``He's
having trouble with reading, and his teachers complain that he
doesn't pay attention, which astonishes me because he was the most
amazingly alert toddler. I can't believe he's having trouble in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jody's so easily upset that it's difficult for me to be with
her,'' said the third woman. ``She's been like that from the moment
she was born. As an infant, she was a light sleeper and any noise
would start her crying. She's doesn't seem to have the ability to
soothe herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything like this in any of our backgrounds?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   We thought for a moment, turning siblings, aunts and uncles,
parents and grandparents, over in our minds. No one in any of our
families had suffered from problems like these. Our kids certainly
hadn't, and as far as we knew, neither had our children's spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the kids watching too much TV?'' someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   One family had no TV. The other two families limited the time
their kids spent in front of the set. We left, hugging one another
with greater intensity than usual. Apart from sympathy, we had
nothing to offer one another and no idea why our personal stories
dovetailed.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started researching the problem of whether something
widespread was happening to children these days. Then I decided not
to write about what I'd found.
</P>
<P>
   How could I scare grandparents with the news that Diane
Dumanoski, coauthor of ``Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our
Fertility, Intelligence and Survival?,'' believes that the more
than 70,000 untested chemicals introduced since World War II are
linked to the increase in behavioral disorders being seen in
schoolchildren today? She cites evidence that these poisons, at
levels well below those generally recognized as harmful, may be
causing permanent damage in utero, resulting in learning
disabilities, attention problems, and hyperactivity.
</P>
<P>
   How could I upset pregnant women with the news that umbilical
cord blood has been tested and found to contain PCBs, pesticides,
and phthalates, an ingredient in plastic? How could I frighten
young parents with the information that all American children are
now born with dioxin in their blood, and that Dutch studies have
shown dioxin exposure is linked to lower IQ, withdrawn and
depressed behavior, attention deficits, hyperactivity, and an
alteration of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   At first I was too upset to write. Then I got mad.
</P>
<P>
   I am so sorry to be writing this, but I'm only the messenger,
not the perpetrator of this assault on our unborn children. These
chemicals are invading children's bodies because we refused to heed
the old wives, whose stories had morals like ``Better safe than
sorry'' and ``Look before you leap.'' Instead we listened to the
profit makers who found certain levels of risk acceptable (to them,
never to us). We handed our lives over to businessmen who flooded
the environment with poisons, then placed the burden of proof of
harm on their innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   While Governor Cellucci drags his feet about uniform clean-air
standards, and agribusiness creates genetically modified foods that
are actually pesticides, and mercury pours out of incinerator
stacks, and the EPA and the FDA bow to corporate pressure, it is
the grandmothers who have to watch their grandchildren struggle
with neurological deficits that could have been avoided if we only
valued life as much as we do money.
</P>
<P>
   Who gave these people the right to poison mothers' bodies? Who
gave these people the license to injure children's minds? Where is
the will to stop them? Grandmothers who have mopped up plenty of
spilled milk in their lives could teach these criminals a lesson.
We know, with bitter certainty, that these poisons can never be put
back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we hug our grandkids so tightly.
</P>
<P>
   And stifle a scream.
</P>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in
mid-September.
 &HT;    A typical trip? Adventures on Skis (815 North Road, Westfield,
Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655; www.advonskis.com) sends skiers to South
America and Las Lenas, Argentina, for $1,555 per person, based on
double occupancy. That includes round-trip airfare from New York to
Buenos Aires; round-trip airfare from Buenos Aires to Malargue;
transfers; seven nights at Hotel Escorpio; daily breakfast; and
dinner.

Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-666-4857; www.skimoguls.com); Ski

programs in both New Zealand and South America.

Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement. For purchase information,
see end of text. TWO COLOR SLIDES, AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, CAN BE

 &HT;    
 By MARVINE HOWE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was

 &HT;    
 By MARVINE HOWE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

A COLORFUL TROVE IN MEXICO CITY  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in
mid-September.
 &HT;    A typical trip? Adventures on Skis (815 North Road, Westfield,
Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655; www.advonskis.com) sends skiers to South
America and Las Lenas, Argentina, for $1,555 per person, based on
double occupancy. That includes round-trip airfare from New York to

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

HIS DECK ISN'T WEATHERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to get a weathered effect on my deck floorboards.
They are four years old and I have been using a sealer every year.
What else should I do?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD MAGUE, Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the deck is pressure-treated and the sealer is a clear
sealer, it should have turned to a nice weathered gray by now.
Ditto for a mahogany or cedar deck.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is pressure-treated or mahogany, you can stop
applying the sealer or continue with it; the deck has been through
enough cycles of contraction and expansion not to splinter, spall,
or split.
</P>
<P>
   If it's cedar, it may not weather very attractively, so it might
be best to continue the sealer treatment, even though it's an
annual pain. If it were my deck, I would not treat it at all, and
let it weather.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more of a light-gray weathered look, you can treat
the deck with semitransparent stain of a medium to light gray. This
will last for three to five years, and only one coat is needed each
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the toilets on the second floor is leaking; the drain
in the basement is wet and dripping. How can I locate the leak?
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE, and wasting water
</P>
<P>
   A. The leak may be where you see the drain dripping water or it
may be higher up, and is telegraphing down the outside of the pipe
and dripping where it goes from vertical to nearly horizontal on
its way to the main sewer pipe. You could try wiping the pipe and
inspecting it for a possible leak, or more likely, a break in the
drain where it makes a turn. If you find nothing suspicious, you
may have to break into the wall amd make a visual inspection. Have
a helper flush the toilet while you make the inspection; the leak
should manifest itself immediately. And if the drain is leaking,
you really are not wasting water; it just is not going to the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 55-year-old house has painted cedar shingles. Recently, I
noticed brown stains at the bottom of some shingles on the north
side of the house, especially just under the eaves. My neighbor has
the same thing on the south side. What is it, and how can I prevent
it?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL ANDERSON, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is the dreaded cedar bleed, which has become a plague in
New England with our red cedar shingles and clapboards, all nicely
painted or stained a light color.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is moisture behind the shingles, which leaches out the
tannins in the red cedar, dissolving them into that brown ooze.
There is little you can do except wash the stains; power washing
will be even more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   But the stains will return if the water is allowed to remain.
So, check for leaks in the wall or roof, or a blocked gutter, which
overflows down the face of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you fix the leaks, the stains may continue, because the
moisture may be behind the shingles. It arrives there as water
vapor that migrated from inside the house, through walls and
insulation, and condensed on the cool sheathing, turning into water
that penetrated the sheathing and resulted in the brown stains.
Ventilating or dehumidifying the house may help some.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I stripped the top of my maple Hitchcock tabletop where
something dripped and took off the stain. I sanded to the bare wood
and planned to stain it, butthe maple will not take stain. How can
I get the original stain color back?
</P>
<P>
   GLENN DEMERS, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Maple is a very hard hardwood, and dense, too, making it
difficult to impossible for ordinary oil stains to penetrate. So,
you have to use a different stain. Use a stain made from
water-soluble or alcohol-soluble analine dyes. As a bonus, regular
oil stains can be applied over dried analine dyes to get the
desired color.

PEELING PAINT, BROWN STAINS, MOLD, AND ALGAE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real outdoor painting season doesn't start for another
month, but already the questions are rolling in:
</P>
<P>
   1. My house is peeling like crazy. How can I stop it?
</P>
<P>
   1A. I paid $5,000 to have my house painted last summer. Now it
is peeling all over. The painter blamed the house, not the paint.
What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   2. My beautifully painted walls are getting all kinds of brown
stains. What are they, how can I get rid of them, and how can I
keep them away?
</P>
<P>
   3. The nails on my clapboards are rusting out, and bleeding down
the face of the clapboards. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   4. My house is full of mildew and green stuff. How can I prevent
it?
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers to these questions. But all these
problems have plagued homeowners for years. Paints and primers have
improved in their ability to withstand wear and tear and weather,
but peelng paint remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The standard paint system today is one coat of primer and two
coats of house paint. Water-based paints are the state of the art,
even for primers. Latex paint as a finish coat has ruled for years.
Now, acrylic is gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation _ scraping, sanding, washing, and sometimes treating
mold with bleach and rinsing _ is as important as the paint and how
it is applied.
</P>
<P>
   One does it all right, and still the paint blisters and peels,
or gets moldy, or gets those brown stains, or all three.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens the homeowner is tempted to go to vinyl
siding, a poor choice to cover a problem, not to solve it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessary. Let's take the problems, and solutions,
one at a time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Peeling, the problem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peeling (Questions 1 and 1A) is almost always caused by
moisture. In fact all of the above problems are caused by moisture.
Moisture (water) gets behind the shingles or clapboards and
literally pushes the paint off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If the paint is peeling to bare wood, you can know that moisture
is the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Where is all this water coming from? Some is coming from
outside: a roof leak, leaky windows, and overflowing gutters.
Fixing any leaks could help.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, the water is coming from inside, from excess
moisture indoors, created by breathing, cooking, bathing, and
washing. This water vapor builds up until it goes through the wall,
the vapor barrier, and insulation, hitting the inside of the
sheathing (just under the wood siding), and condensing into water
because it is cooler than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The water then goes through the sheathing and ends up behind the
clapboards or shingles, saturating them and causing the peeling.
</P>
<P>
   Water vapor can penetrate vapor barriers by going through the
holes made by nails and screws used build the wall.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen to houses new and old, but mainly with houses
that are tight and well insulated. In the days of no insulation and
loose-as-a-goose houses, this water vapor went through the walls
and ceilings quickly and harmlessly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ventilate, a solution &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what is the solution?
</P>
<P>
   A fix might be to ventilate the house regularly _ open doors and
windows twice a day _ to release that water vapor. Some tight
houses have air-to-air heat exchangers to do this ventilation
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your attic is well ventilatd; if it is, chances are
that more water vapor will escape to the attic.
</P>
<P>
   You could also try this: Insert plastic wedges under the
clapboards to bring them out just 1/8- to 1/4-inch. Set these
wedges 24 inches apart along each row and see what happens. What is
supposed to happen is the escape of water vapor. Wedges may be hard
to find, and some homeowners have used plastic wobble wedges,
designed for furniture legs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stains, a solution &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another solution is to use stain instead of paint. A solid color
latex stain will go over bare wood or old paint. No primer is
needed; two coats should do it. A solid stain can be put on trim,
too. But even solid stains can peel.
</P>
<P>
   Another stain is a semitransparent stain, but it has to go over
bare wood. That means you must remove all paint or install new
siding. These are viable solutions, but will cost more than a paint
job. A semitransparent stain needs only one coat. It will last five
years and will not peel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still another way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one more way to fight peeling paint. It works, but has
to be done with new construction or when removing old siding and
putting on new.
</P>
<P>
   That is to apply 3/8-inch Styrofoam insulation on the sheathing,
just under the new clapboards or shingles. This was done originally
under vinyl siding, and was considered heresy because it was a
vapor barrier on the outside of the wall, which could cause
moisture problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was discovered that this not only did no harm, it also
insulated the sheathing, keeping it warm enough to prevent
condensation of water vapor that got into the wall cavity from
inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cedar bleed, the problem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That does it for peeling. Then there is the dreaded cedar bleed
(Question 2).
</P>
<P>
   Cedar bleed is caused by moisture, and appears as brown stains
on light-colored paint, stain, or other finish on red cedar
clapboards and shingles. Woods such as pine, fir, and white cedar
contain fewer tannins, and bleeding does not occur.
</P>
<P>
   The stains are water-soluble, therefore easily extracted from
the wood by water. Water gets to the wood from outside (roof and
window leaks, overflowing gutters, condensation, dew, rain,
irrigation, or high humdity), or from inside (water vapor pushing
its way from inside the house to the outside and condensing into
water. The tannins are dissolved by water and drawn to the surface
by the sun and hydrostatic pressure (osmosis).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the information on cedar bleed and other situations is
from the excellent technical bulletins published by Samuel Cabot
Inc. of Newburyport, a pioneer in stains and a manufacturer of
paints, stains, and other coatings.
</P>
<P>
   Stains usually yield to washing with detergent and water,
power-washing, bleach and water, and special cleaners made by paint
companies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cedar bleed, the solutions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cure, or rather the solution, is multiple. The easiest cure
is to use a dark paint or stain; if cedar bleed occurs, you won't
see it. Dumb cure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stains are caused by moisture, getting rid of the
moisture indoors by ventilating and fixing leaks outdoors will go a
long way toward a solution.
</P>
<P>
   A direct solution is to prime all surfaces with an oil-based or
stain-killing primer. Latex primers also help, but two coats are
usually needed. These primers simply keep water out of the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The primers are for use under paint and solid stains.
Semitransparent stains will not penetrate or cover any primer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Those rusty nailheads &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one more thing (is that all?) that plagues painted
houses, and that is the rusting of nails that hold the clapboard on
(Question 3).
</P>
<P>
   There are cures, such as countersinking the nails and filling
the holes with putty. It won't work; the clapboards are too thin to
countersink nails into.
</P>
<P>
   Another cure is to prime the heads with an oil-based primer
before painting or staining. This too is unlikely to work.
</P>
<P>
   The right cure is to pull the rusty nails and replace them with
stainless steel nails, either in the same hole or an inch or so
away. Fill any holes with putty; they are deep enough for the putty
to stay. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mold and algae, forever &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about that mold and algae (Question 4). Black mold and
green algae will grow on any damp, warm surface, and there is
little you can do except to wash it off with a solution of one part
household bleach and three parts water. Or use Era, a detergent
containing oxygen bleach, effective against mold and algae, but
milder than household bleach. Wear skin and eye protection when
working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior paints and stains contain a mildewcide effective
against mold. Protection is usually about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes increasing the amount of sun that hits your house will
reduce mold and algae growth. That may mean cutting down or cutting
back trees.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else? Put up white cedar shingles. They will last for
40 years untreated, unpainted, and unstained, will weather to a
silver gray, and will need no maintenance. There is nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost nothing. Nothing, not even white cedar shingles, is
immune to mold and algae. Nothing to do except get out the old
bleach and water.
</P>

<P>
   When Philip Seymour Hoffman walks into the greasy spoon near his
West Village apartment, a hat with ear flaps is pulled down low on
his head, a blue muffler up high to his freezing nose, leaving
visible only a narrow strip of skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest day in New York in three years, and his
dark-framed glasses start to fog up within seconds. With the
sneakers and baggy work pants, he looks a little like the attendant
at your local gas station who always has a friendly wave and a
smile but is kind of scary anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He says hello to the waitress, who's waiting to lock up. Letting
her call it a day, Hoffman leads the way across Eighth Avenue to
another tiny cafe, where he greets the counter man with the same
familiarity he did the waitress. Both treat him like a regular, a
neighborhood guy who appreciates a good slice of apple pie. They
seem genuinely oblivious to the fact that their customer is one of
the fastest rising actors in the business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Hoffman has made the difficult leap from
anonymous but respected character actor (``Oh yeah, that guy'' in
movies from ``Boogie Nights'' to ``Twister'') to leading man
(``Flawless,'' David Mamet's upcoming ``State and Main'').
</P>
<P>
   With two big movies (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
``Magnolia'') now in theaters _ which together earned him the
National Board of Review's best supporting actor award _ Hoffman
has begun rehearsals for his Broadway debut, in a revival of Sam
Shepard's ``True West,'' which opened in March. This was Shepard's
first day sitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was f---ing frightening,'' Hoffman admits with no hint of
pretense. The enigmatic playwright's presence isn't the only thing
giving Hoffman a case of the nerves. ``It wouldn't be scary if I
was one of the guys in the town in ``Our Town,'' you know what I
mean?'' he says with a laugh, then digs into that apple pie. ``Then
it would just be kind of fun _ like, I'm on Broadway, let's give it
a go.''
</P>
<P>
   This situation, he says, is more like ``Flawless,'' in which he
played a drag queen opposite Robert De Niro, ``picking the most
difficult situation to jump into new territory.'' He is referring
not just to the emotional intensity of ``True West,'' about two
brothers reunited in their mother's house, but to director Matthew
Warchus' decision to have Hoffman and his co-star, John C. Reilly,
swap parts every three or four performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not our idea,'' Hoffman says. ``In fact, that was one
of the reasons, when they came to me in the first place, I was not
interested. I was like, `I'm not going to do that. That's hokey.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then Reilly, who appeared with him in all three Paul Thomas
Anderson movies _ ``Hard Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and
``Magnolia'' _ talked him into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's probably the only person whose work I look at and go,
`Aw, man,''' Reilly says. ``It's like, where the hell did he come
up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agree that they wouldn't have wanted to do the play
with a total stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two actors really have to trust each other,'' Hoffman
says, ``because you're giving up your part to the other person
every few days, then taking it back. It's so intimate what these
actors are doing. It's like trading bodily fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's shed his winter layers, by the way, Hoffman isn't
scary at all. Disheveled, yes, with blond hair sticking out in
every direction, and enough reddish growth on his face to indicate
he's giving his razor a lengthy vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really resemble any of his extraordinarily diverse
characters _ certainly not Allen, the overweight obscene
phone-caller in ``Happiness,'' or Scotty, the chubby, lovesick
production assistant in ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Hoffman isn't fat. A high-school jock before
discovering acting, he's a husky, powerfully built guy. But he's
also not vain, evidenced by his willingness to pork up to 230 for
slob-loser effect in ``Happiness.'' (Standing 5-feet-10-inches
tall, he says he was a trim 190 for ``State and Main'' but has
since put on 25 pounds because he quit smoking.)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the press, though, have been less than kind about his
physique, which has become a sore spot. Asked if there are any
characters he doesn't think he could play, Hoffman interprets the
question to be about his looks and brings up an unflattering review
of ``Flawless.'' (Overall, though the movie was panned, Hoffman's
reviews were superb.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy started commenting, `Phil's just not right for this
part. He's way too big for the dress he's in,''' he remembers. ``It
was something like that, but it was really kind of cruel and stupid
and just ignorant. You just wanted to find the guy and be like,
`Umm, I'm playing a guy who thinks he's a woman, jackass. That's
the whole f---ing point. What do you think, only skinny men are
these people? Only non-muscular men? Have you walked around Chelsea
lately?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Hoffman is not entirely comfortable in a
profession that has always been _ and always will be _ heavily
based on looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get carried away with it,'' he says. ``Relax. Is the guy
acting well or not? Is she acting well or not? Are you caught up in
the story or not? Pay attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, Hoffman may not be the gorgeous guy you drool
over from afar, but he's the one you end up falling in love with.
Which may be why David Mamet cast him as the lead in ``State and
Main,'' due out in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respect David for hiring me, because I don't think I
was the guy most people would think of to play the kind of Jimmy
Stewart role,'' he says, laughing. ``No one told me this, but I
have this feeling that there was somebody cast, and that didn't
work out. It was pretty close to shooting that I got hired _ like
three weeks before shooting _ and it was the lead of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which he describes as being about truth and the battle
not to sell out, stars Hoffman as a beleaguered screenwriter who
comes to a small town in Vermont to shoot his movie and falls in
love with a local woman, played by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the extreme characters he's portrayed, Hoffman
welcomed the chance to play an everyman _ and one who gets the
girl. But he insists the part was no less challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romantic leads are really more character roles than
anything,'' he explains. ``They're people falling in love, so just
how glamorous can that be? Think about it: Not knowing what to say,
feeling uncomfortable, feeling awkward _ or feeling completely not
awkward, so therefore you're saying stupid s--t all the time. It's
really kind of a bumbling thing, falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is so passionate about what he's saying that it's hard
to figure out where the character ends and he begins. He is cagey
about his personal life, at one point mentioning in passing that he
briefly moved to Los Angeles in his 20s ``for some woman,'' and
otherwise skirting the issue with, ``I take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he returns to the subject on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it's truly hard to be yourself is when you're
madly in love, obsessively in love,'' he says, ``because you're
really scared that you suck, that they're going to find out that
you suck. It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the 32-year-old Hoffman is most comfortable is in the
theater. He had his start there in high school, outside of
Rochester, N.Y., after being sidelined with a sports injury. Then
he chose New York University to study drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to do film at all,'' he says. ``I thought it
was silly _ not that film was silly, but that me acting in film was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles came early on anyway, in ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Nobody's Fool,'' ``The Big Lebowski'' and a couple dozen others,
and Hoffman found himself moving easily between stage and movie
set. He's on the board of the LAByrinth Theatre Co. and received
strong notices last summer for his first directorial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money being made,'' he says of the company, ``and really,
purely, some great stuff being created.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Boogie Nights'' hit theaters in 1997, people had
begun to take notice of him, and then Hoffman auditioned for
``Happiness,'' director Todd Solondz' dark comedy about a group of
miserable New Jerseyites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never met Phil or heard of him,'' Solondz says, ``and was
terribly disappointed to discover that Paul Thomas Anderson had
already discovered him. I wanted to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, in turn, had recently seen ``Happiness'' when
he started looking for two ``chameleon-like actors'' who could do
``True West'' with the chance of transcending the typical
comparisons to the classic team of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I thought of was Phil,'' he remembers. ``He
is quite extreme without losing truth or plausibility. I think
that's a gift, not a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly calls him ``a searcher'' and gushes, ``Phil can
make a meal out of the littlest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the scene in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in which
Hoffman, playing Matt Damon's uppercrust tormenter, is listening to
records with Jude Law and cuts Damon down with just a withering
stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been one of those light days. But you're just
like, `Goddamn, look at Phil Hoffman.' One scene with no dialog
establishes what the whole character's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admits that the snobby Freddie Miles ``was exquisitely
fun to play'' _ and not just because it meant six weeks in Rome
with plenty of time for espresso, sightseeing with Cate Blanchett
and her husband and even some Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's extraordinarily wealthy, floats around Europe and
hangs out with affluent, well-educated, literary people,'' Hoffman
says. ``I drank beer in the woods. That's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His slight regional accent has led him to create a different
voice for virtually every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's writing parts for redheaded guys who grew up in
Fairport, N.Y.,'' he says. ``It's just not happening. I don't have
(the accent) as much, but my mouth is lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``I remember reading it and
just going --'' he breaks off, reshaping his mouth into Freddie's
smirk. ``They sound like they're from England, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman used his own voice as the tenderhearted nurse Phil in
``Magnolia,'' which he calls ``one of the best movies I've ever
been in. It's really ballsy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and more than a little irritated at the beating
it's taken from some critics (though his reviews have been
characteristically excellent), he adds, ``I really do think in 20
years people are going to talk about `Magnolia' as the movie that
was extraordinarily profound at the time it came out, saying
something about the numbness and cynicism of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he jumps out of his chair to help an elderly woman
and her pushcart into the cafe. When he returns to the table,
Hoffman has one last story to tell. It's about shooting the
surreal, climactic frog scene in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his directors and colleagues have to say about his
talent, Hoffman insists acting comes naturally to no one, certainly
not him. But he's also not a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to act like there are thousands of frogs,'' he
remembers, ``and I have to start the scene crying. I was just fed
up, and I couldn't. I was freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew waited at 4 a.m. to get the shot and go home to bed,
Hoffman struggled. Finally, out of pure frustration, he began to
cry. Paul Thomas Anderson called action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a squirt-in-the-eye kind of guy,'' Hoffman
says. ``Morally, I feel like I'd burst into flames if I did
that.'' &QL;

how glamorous can that be? Think about it: Not knowing what to say,
feeling uncomfortable, feeling awkward _ or feeling completely not
awkward, so therefore you're saying stupid s--t all the time. It's
really kind of a bumbling thing, falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is so passionate about what he's saying that it's hard
to figure out where the character ends and he begins. He is cagey
about his personal life, at one point mentioning in passing that he
briefly moved to Los Angeles in his 20s ``for some woman,'' and
otherwise skirting the issue with, ``I take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he returns to the subject on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it's truly hard to be yourself is when you're
madly in love, obsessively in love,'' he says, ``because you're
really scared that you suck, that they're going to find out that
you suck. It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the 32-year-old Hoffman is most comfortable is in the
theater. He had his start there in high school, outside of
Rochester, N.Y., after being sidelined with a sports injury. Then
he chose New York University to study drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to do film at all,'' he says. ``I thought it
was silly _ not that film was silly, but that me acting in film was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles came early on anyway, in ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Nobody's Fool,'' ``The Big Lebowski'' and a couple dozen others,
and Hoffman found himself moving easily between stage and movie
set. He's on the board of the LAByrinth Theatre Co. and received
strong notices last summer for his first directorial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money being made,'' he says of the company, ``and really,
purely, some great stuff being created.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Boogie Nights'' hit theaters in 1997, people had
begun to take notice of him, and then Hoffman auditioned for
``Happiness,'' director Todd Solondz' dark comedy about a group of
miserable New Jerseyites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never met Phil or heard of him,'' Solondz says, ``and was
terribly disappointed to discover that Paul Thomas Anderson had
already discovered him. I wanted to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, in turn, had recently seen ``Happiness'' when
he started looking for two ``chameleon-like actors'' who could do
``True West'' with the chance of transcending the typical
comparisons to the classic team of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I thought of was Phil,'' he remembers. ``He
is quite extreme without losing truth or plausibility. I think
that's a gift, not a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly calls him ``a searcher'' and gushes, ``Phil can
make a meal out of the littlest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the scene in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in which
Hoffman, playing Matt Damon's uppercrust tormenter, is listening to
records with Jude Law and cuts Damon down with just a withering
stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been one of those light days. But you're just
like, `Goddamn, look at Phil Hoffman.' One scene with no dialog
establishes what the whole character's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admits that the snobby Freddie Miles ``was exquisitely
fun to play'' _ and not just because it meant six weeks in Rome
with plenty of time for espresso, sightseeing with Cate Blanchett
and her husband and even some Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's extraordinarily wealthy, floats around Europe and
hangs out with affluent, well-educated, literary people,'' Hoffman
says. ``I drank beer in the woods. That's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His slight regional accent has led him to create a different
voice for virtually every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's writing parts for redheaded guys who grew up in
Fairport, N.Y.,'' he says. ``It's just not happening. I don't have
(the accent) as much, but my mouth is lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``I remember reading it and
just going --'' he breaks off, reshaping his mouth into Freddie's
smirk. ``They sound like they're from England, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman used his own voice as the tenderhearted nurse Phil in
``Magnolia,'' which he calls ``one of the best movies I've ever
been in. It's really ballsy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and more than a little irritated at the beating
it's taken from some critics (though his reviews have been
characteristically excellent), he adds, ``I really do think in 20
years people are going to talk about `Magnolia' as the movie that
was extraordinarily profound at the time it came out, saying
something about the numbness and cynicism of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he jumps out of his chair to help an elderly woman
and her pushcart into the cafe. When he returns to the table,
Hoffman has one last story to tell. It's about shooting the
surreal, climactic frog scene in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his directors and colleagues have to say about his
talent, Hoffman insists acting comes naturally to no one, certainly
not him. But he's also not a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to act like there are thousands of frogs,'' he
remembers, ``and I have to start the scene crying. I was just fed
up, and I couldn't. I was freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew waited at 4 a.m. to get the shot and go home to bed,
Hoffman struggled. Finally, out of pure frustration, he began to
cry. Paul Thomas Anderson called action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a squirt-in-the-eye kind of guy,'' Hoffman
says. ``Morally, I feel like I'd burst into flames if I did
that.'' &QL;

<P>
   MILAN _ He's played every role from gigolo to gentleman, and now
Richard Gere is starring as the resourceful Italian butler
Ambrogio.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrogio?
</P>
<P>
   Gere and a string of other top names including Brad Pitt,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford
are pocketing millions plugging Italian products from sunglasses to
spumante in ads that appear almost everywhere _ except the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stars have long boosted their income with lucrative ad
campaigns fashioned mostly for the Japanese and other Asian
markets. Now American actors are marching westward _ and directly
into Italy _ where companies are waiting with open purses and
high-quality, if sometimes silly, campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is the most vigorous industry in the world _ on all
levels. It influences people's tastes, and its events echo
throughout the world,'' said Silvia Damiani, who just hired Brad
Pitt to star in the ads for her family-run jewelry company.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for Italians' latest love affair with
Hollywood: ``With e-commerce and the single currency, Italian
companies, which have traditionally used local celebrities, want to
appear less provincial, more global. What could be better than
trading on the universal, cosmopolitan allure of a Hollywood
actor?'' said Luca Vercelloni of GPF &AMP; Associati, a research
institute and consultancy here.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Italians may not be as generous as the Japanese _
who won't blink at paying $4 million for a celebrity-focused
campaign _ they are more than willing to loosen their purse strings
for a Hollywood face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fees start at about six or seven figures and can go up to
several millions of dollars depending on how long the ad is used
and in how many countries,'' said Reuben Igielko-Herrlich, an owner
of the Geneva-based Propaganda, which specializes in product
placement, special events and corporate advertising. ``There is no
rule, and no flat fee. Everything is negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis were among the first to arrive in
Italy. In 1997, Stone shot a Spumanti Martini ad in which she plays
herself as an awards presenter on Oscar night. The ad was so
popular that it has run every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis did the European print campaign for De Rigo's
Police sunglasses, which appeared in more than 60 countries, and
he'll be starring in the next campaign, which breaks later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Agents for Stone, Willis and Gere refused to have their client's
images appear in an American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Igielko-Herrlich added that American actors _ whether they
appear in films or ad campaigns _ can boost the popularity of a
brand in record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication is a long-term strategy, so it's hard to
quantify the results of a specific campaign. One thing we've
observed, however, is that consumers will walk into a store and ask
for a specific product they've seen a star use on screen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the chocolate company Ferrero chose
Richard Gere for its latest television campaign. Last year Ferrero,
which makes Nutella and other sweets, needed a high-voltage TV
campaign to replace the successful but long-running one for its
Ferrero Rocher chocolates. The old ads starred the tireless
Ambrogio, a chauffeur and butler, who regularly dispensed the
elegant chocolates, wrapped in gold foil, to his socialite boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ad, Gere plays himself and is watching La Traviata
when he spots a young woman _ clearly in need of a chocolate _
sitting in the balcony of the theater. As if by magic, the
chocolate appears in front of her. When the woman, who by then
recognizes Gere, goes to thank him she says: ``But aren't you...?''
and he replies: ``Ambrogio.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ferrero spokeswoman said the ad was by far the most popular in
the history of the company. It was so successful, in fact, that the
actor is filming a sequel that will air in Italy in September.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ferrero's choice of Gere in particular, the spokeswoman
said: ``He's elegant yet accessible _ and he's everyone's Prince
Charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration is also the reason why Fiat chose to use Harrison
Ford in its Lancia Lybra ads, and Catherine Zeta-Jones in its Alfa
Romeo Sportwagon campaign, which broke here recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of the hottest names in the world,
and this is an international campaign. She will help accelerate
awareness of the brand in the 17 European countries where the ad
appears,'' said Luca Lindner, chief executive of Conquest Network,
which developed the ad.
</P>
<P>
   While Fiat worked with another agency, Armando Testa, to create
the Lancia ads, the idea behind both campaigns is the same: sleek
image, speedy delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancia ad shows Harrison Ford reviving a dying plant by
placing it on the passenger seat of the car and cruising on the
open road. In print, he poses on the hood of the car with a caption
that says: ``It doesn't matter how far you've traveled, just how.''
</P>
<P>
   An Armando Testa spokesman said Fiat believes Ford embodies the
rock-solid values of Europe's ``new middle class ... which offers
large growth potential for Lancia Lybra.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that actors' primary motivation for doing the ads is
money, but there are other reasons as well. And while all the
actors mentioned declined to comment for this story, the Italian
companies are proud to talk about why they chose to be in a
specific campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero said Gere donated his fee _ a reported $1.4 million _ to
the cause to free Tibet. Damiani said Pitt walked into her store
looking to buy a ring for his girlfriend Jennifer Aniston, and the
two became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who has appeared in Japanese automobile and beer ads, told
Italian newspapers last year that he's proud of his publicity work:
``I hope that the U.S. comes to accept the idea of actors appearing
in TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be too long in coming: ``I can understand that
actors are protective of their images in their main market _ the
U.S. _ and that one bad TV advertisement can be damaging,'' said
Federico Fasolino, a partner in Brw, one of Italy's foremost
advertising production companies. ``On the flip side, a well-done
campaign can actually be a vehicle to boost or relaunch a career,''
he added. &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will he do it? Can he do it?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions swirling around David Duchovny these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Will he quit ``The X-Files,'' which has made him one of the
best-known television personalities in the world, when his contract
runs out in a few weeks?
</P>
<P>
   And will his decision to play for the eighth year Fox Mulder,
the driven FBI investigator of all things paranormal, be influenced
by whether or not Duchovny can draw audiences into theaters for his
new movie, ``Return to Me,'' which opens Friday?
</P>
<P>
   ``My major problem with 'X-Files' is, always, the time
commitment,'' says Duchovny, a lanky, intellectual 39-year-old with
an easygoing personality and active wit. ``I'm just constantly
putting myself in this very dangerous position of having a movie
bomb a year. Whereas John Travolta can have four bombs and a hit in
a year and he's still John Travolta, I can't. I've got to have a
hit, I've got to have a big movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my problem with the show. I love the show, I think it
makes great movies and I would love every fifth or six movie that I
do to be an 'X-Files' film. I just hate the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 1998 ``X-Files'' movie was a summer hit, Duchovny has
not had similar luck with his other starring features, such as
``Playing God,'' ``The Rapture'' and ``Kalifornia.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Return to Me,'' a light romantic fantasy with dark
emotional undertones, comes, at the very least, with good portents.
The film is directed and co-written by Bonnie Hunt, the comic
actress who has been a friend since she played opposite Duchovny in
one of his biggest, pre-``Files'' hits, the family comedy
``Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with movies, it's hit or miss,'' Duchovny
acknowledges. ``It's hard to know what's going to be good. But I'm
especially proud of this whole process because I knew Bonnie and
have always liked her, then I took a chance on a first-time
director and I'm so fully rewarded. It's a great feeling to
actually go with your gut about somebody and stake a considerable
amount of your professional life on them, then have them come
through. So aside from being professionally happy with the film,
I'm personally happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Return to Me,'' Duchovny's Bob Rueland loses his beloved
wife in a traffic accident. A year later, the still-devastated
Chicago architect finds himself inexplicably attracted to a
waitress he meets at an Italian restaurant. What he doesn't know is
that Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) received his wife's heart in a
transplant operation. As their love blossoms, Grace discovers the
truth, but understandably has trouble breaking the news to the
still-fragile Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt was as pleased as Duchovny was to work with an old friend.
But she was more enthused about giving him a chance to display a
range of his talents that Duchovny's darker films and the
buttoned-up, obsessive Mulder haven't permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joy for me to be able to have my friend do, what I
think, is his best work in my first movie,'' Hunt says. ``I was
able to help him bring out all of these levels that he has as an
actor. There are moments when he's so funny and moments of deep
sadness and vulnerability. I mean, what a roller coaster ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. But that's make-believe, and nothing compared to what
Duchovny, the show's producers and the entire Fox Network are going
through over the future of ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's happening with the TV show; it's still up
in the air,'' Duchovny claims. ``I'm not lying or anything. I
haven't made a final decision; they haven't made a final decision.
There could be an eighth year, there could be an eighth year
without me. I don't know; I really have to sit down and think about
what I'm willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny doesn't seem to mind if the show _ which the troubled
Fox Network depends on as an island of ratings stability, despite
the fact that its viewership has taken a direct hit this year from
ABC's game show monster ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _
continues without him (co-star Gillian Anderson is contractually
committed for another season). Foremost on his mind is a feeling
that, despite his constant protestations of love for ``The
X-Files,'' the thrill is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason, aside from making money, for the show
to go on,'' Duchovny says. ``There are really no creative
challenges left. For me, the only thing left is that I've been
given the opportunity to write and direct two episodes, and it's an
amazing opportunity. It's like being given $3.5 million to go make
a little movie. This is like free film school for me. So if I was
to come back next year, that would be the main reason why.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny made last season's well-received baseball-themed
episode, ``The Unnatural,'' and has just finished shooting a new
one, which is scheduled to air on April 30. In the upcoming show,
Mulder discovers that his boss has sold some X-Files stories to
Hollywood. When he goes to Tinseltown to investigate, he discovers
that the show being made of his exploits stars Garry Shandling (a
close friend, whom Duchovny memorably pretended to have a crush on
in Shandling's own post-modern ``The Larry Sanders Show'') and,
playing partner Dana Scully, Duchovny's real-life wife, Tea Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like writing and directing,'' notes the New York native, who
dropped out of Yale a semester shy of earning his Ph.D. in English
Literature to pursue acting in Manhattan. ``I don't think I've ever
really gotten as close to being fulfilled as I was with that
episode I did last year. So I think that's probably the direction
where I'm headed.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's probably got a future at it after his impressive
display of a not-insubstantial directorial gift: attracting top
talent for dirt cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can deliver two stars for $3,000, you're a hero at
the studio,'' he says. ``And of course I have to say this, but
really, I am just so impressed with my wife as an actress. I would
put her in anything I do if she would do it. And I love Garry as a
performer, so I just feel so lucky that they would do a TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is even more impressed with Leoni's performance at home
these days. This most down-to-earth of actors is in absolute awe of
his wife's rapport with their baby daughter, Madelaine West, who
celebrates her first birthday this month.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own parenting experience, the actor is learning that
there are more rewarding things in life than directing TV shows.
Even good TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's starting to cuddle a little bit,'' he notes,
analytically but with an increasing tone of satisfaction. ``You
know, you're so affectionate with them, but aside from holding,
they don't really respond when you, like, stroke them. It's not
like a cat or a 5-year-old kid, who likes it when you scratch their
head. Babies don't get physical affection right away, and I just
didn't know how to make her feel good. But now, all of a sudden,
she's recently started to lay her head into me. I'm like, ``Oh my
God!'''
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't quite so blissful with Duchovny's TV family,
although he insists that there's been minimal fallout on the set
from his pending lawsuit against ``The X-Files'' producers _ which
names, among many others, the show's creator and guiding hand,
Chris Carter _ for syndication revenues the actor feels he's owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my line: I have a view of my contract and they have a
view of my contract,'' Duchovny says. ``Those two views are
different. Because of that, I have a lawsuit, and when their view
of my contract becomes my view of my contract, then the lawsuit
will no longer be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't affect my work on the show at all. It has
nothing to do with it. That happens in Business Affairs on the
eighth floor of a building that I've never been in. What happens on
the set is what we do all the time, which is that everybody works
as hard as they can to make the show as good as it can be. That's
all it ever is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his personal future may hold, Duchovny will definitely
be sorry to see ``The X-Files'' series come to an end _ if only
because, he feels, there will never be another television show like
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, this show is amazing,'' he says. ``But 'The
X-Files' is a dinosaur. They will never spend money on a television
show like they spend on 'The X-Files' again. We were lucky because
the series grew up in the two or three years before cable
fragmented the audience, when you could still rationalize spending
that kind of money to get a huge audience. But you'll never get an
audience like this again.''

TAKING A CHANCE ON LIVE TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm a George Clooney fan. Admired him in ``ER.'' Loved ``Out of
Sight'' and ``Three Kings.'' Forgave him for the ``Batman'' thing.
</P>
<P>
   The guy projects star quality onscreen and has a reputation as
one of show business' more likable personalities off camera.
</P>
<P>
   He's no snob about theatrical films versus TV, and he isn't
averse to taking risks. Clooney was the force behind the live
``ER'' episode in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clooney will leap onto the high wire again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it will be a live, black-and-white production of
``Fail Safe,'' based on the nuclear shocker novel and the 1964 film
that starred Henry Fonda, Walter Matthau, Dan O'Herlihy and Larry
Hagman.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour production will originate Sunday from Burbank on
CBS. Viewers in the East will see it live. On the West Coast, it'll
be shown tape-delayed, possible screw-ups and all.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the new TV version will have a heftier cast than
the movie. Joining Clooney will be Richard Dreyfuss (in Fonda's
role as the president), James Cromwell, Brian Dennehy, Harvey
Keitel, Sam Elliott, Norman Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Don Cheadle,
William Smitrovich and Noah Wyle. You can even add Walter Cronkite,
who will introduce the program.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Frears (``High Fidelity'') will direct from a
refurbished script by Walter Bernstein, who wrote the 1964 film.
Clooney is co-executive producer and the man who put the project
together. Seems that ``Fail-Safe'' was his favorite movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to screen that movie over at my house all the time and
make people watch it,'' Clooney said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to be one of my favorite stories of all time. In
fact, my favorite film of all time. We thought it was sort of made
for live television. ... It's a very personal story about several
million people being killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney was only partly joking; the description isn't far off
the mark. The Cold War novel by Harvey Wheeler and Eugene Burdick
is about nuclear-laden bombers mistakenly sent to obliterate
Moscow, and the tense effort by the American president to avert
nuclear holocaust. He offers a frightful quid pro quo solution if
Moscow is nuked.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney will play the U.S. pilot _ Edward Binns had the role in
the old movie _ who is on a seemingly irretrievable course toward
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these characters who are making decisions on a lot
of people's lives and negotiating how many people they'll kill, and
there's a logic to it,'' Clooney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing, and what's great about this story, is it
talks about that and says, `Isn't this insane?' _ that that logic,
somehow, makes sense to us. I think that's what always appealed to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's ``Dr. Strangelove'' without the dark humor.
The 1964 film was released only two years after the Cuban missile
crisis, when public dread of the possibility of nuclear
annihilation was still at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time shifting in the CBS version; it too will be set
in the mid-1960s. And that raises a question about viewer interest,
given the end of the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union
and subsequent reduction of nuclear tensions. Clooney said the
cautionary story is still worth telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story itself isn't necessarily about Russia, although we
are using Russia as the vehicle, of course,'' Clooney said. ``But
the question is whether or not machines and our technology get
ahead of us and actually put us in jeopardy of nuclear war. With
China and Korea, I think that's still sort of relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``Fail Safe'' seems a decent fit for TV. It was a
stark black-and-white film with few sets, reminiscent of live TV
dramas in the 1950s. Viewers who get the Turner Classic Movies
cable channel can see for themselves; the 1964 ``Fail-Safe'' is
scheduled for 11:30 p.m. Sunday, half an hour after the CBS
production ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney said he'd like to see ``Fail Safe'' become the first of
an occasional series of live prime-time shows _ perhaps four a
year. If he wants to know more about the risks, he need look no
further than scriptwriter Bernstein, a veteran of the old live TV
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein still chuckles about an incident involving a 1950s
anthology series called ``Danger,'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic moment of one story, he said, the villain was
to edge toward the tiger cage at a circus and be fatally clawed by
a tiger. An animal trainer was stationed behind the stage with a
stick to jab the tiger at the right moment, to provoke the animal's
``attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Sidney Lumet (who also directed the ``Fail-Safe''
film), the climax came off convincingly in rehearsal. Then came the
live scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The villain got close to the cage, the cue came, the trainer
jabbed the tiger, and the tiger just sat there,'' Bernstein said.
``It was like he'd been waiting for that moment. Sidney, of course,
had to cut to the villain, who was staggering back after nothing
had happened, with blood pouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Clooney and his colleagues face the high-wire chance of
similar mishaps with ``Fail Safe.'' Yes, he said, he'd asked his
father, longtime television personality Nick Clooney, for advice.
Which was:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Don't do it,' '' George Clooney said. `` `What are you,
stoned?,' I believe, was his exact phrase.''

ACCUSATIONS FLY IN FIGHT OVER A PICASSO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A nasty dispute has flared up between two
prominent San Francisco families _ pitting the children of arts
patron Madeleine Haas Russell against investment brokerage baron
Charles Schwab and his wife, Helen _ over the sale of a $45 million
Picasso painting last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art are
considering suing the Madeleine Haas Russell Trust for allegedly
breaching a ``binding'' oral contract to sell them Picasso's
masterpiece ``Nu au fauteuil noir.'' The painting, a famously
erotic depiction of Picasso's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, was
sold at a Christie's auction for $45.1 million in November along
with other works from Russell's estate. Russell was a longtime
trustee of SFMOMA, where Helen Schwab is a board member.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement the Schwabs released Wednesday through
San Francisco attorney Charles Cohler, the Schwabs and SFMOMA had
made a deal in September to jointly buy the painting from the
Russell estate, a claim Russell's heirs deny.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs say they planned to give the museum the money to buy
40 percent of the painting, and they would pay for 60 percent of
the $44 million purchase. According to their statement, they
planned to make their share of the painting a ``promised gift'' to
the museum upon their deaths. They claim that Haas' three grown
children ``reneged on the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to SFMOMA's board of trustees expressing ``dismay at
the Museum's threats to sue us,'' Russell's heirs _ Alice
Russell-Shapiro, Charles P. Russell and Christine H. Russell _ say
they were ``led to believe that there would be sole use of the
painting by the Museum, and ultimately sole ownership by the
Museum.'' When they learned that the painting would be jointly
owned and used, they say, they decided not to proceed with the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have an agreement until both parties sign on the
dotted line,'' said their attorney, Roger Mead of the San Francisco
firm of Folger, Levin &AMP; Kahn. ``We are confident that when the
museum trustees give the matter proper consideration, they will
conclude that it would be reckless to pursue these baseless
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs and SFMOMA may sue. Cohler said, ``Mr. and Mrs.
Schwab wish to see the museum made whole again and do not intend to
seek (personal) damages.''

`READY TO RUMBLE' TAKES A DIVE IN SEWER OF POTTY HUMOR

<P>
   Thick-headed hicks Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean
Dawkins (Scott Caan) live for wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Septic tank cleaners by day (where the toilet humor runs like an
open sewer), they spend their nights in worship to their hero, WCW
champion Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), unaware he is just a soused
prima donna who's forgotten that his reign is the result of careful
scripting.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no shock when King loses his crown in a last minute
rewrite by Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), the man we love to hate
league president (and a fairly transparent swipe at rival WWF
president Vince McMahon). Muscle-bound villain Diamond Dallas Page
takes the crown and Sinclair bans King for life.
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, for Boggs and Dawkins become knights errant to
their tarnished King, now a bitter drunkard hiding from debtors in
trailer park, put him back in touch with his white trash roots, and
challenge Sinclair and Diamond Dallas to a dreaded Death Match: a
pay-per-view exclusive that could leave King dead, or worse,
embarrassed!

   With his beer belly and abs of flab, Platt only look slightly
less convincing as a modern day wrestling star than, say, Adam
Sandler (``Memo to Mr. Sandler: I've got your next vehicle right
here!'').
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by real life icons of the WCW like Goldberg, Sting
and Page, all of whom have a better sense of what this about than
the actors, Platt is less wrestling royalty than drawling Elvis
wannabe, a white trash showman trading the karate chop moves of
overweight Vegas showman for body slams and pile-drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Director Brian Robbins (``Varsity Blues'') shows little facility
for comedy. Squirrelly Arquette flops all over the place with
eye-ball rolling goofiness and the usually dependable Platt mugs
shamelessly. The gifted Martin Landau is wasted as a spry old-time
wrestler with more moves up his tights than Fred Astaire and indie
sexpot Rose McGowan becomes mere window dressing: her tight
sweaters and hot pants become the defining elements of her
conniving WCW Nitro dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brill's flat-footed script begins as an idiot comedy
with the gross-out gags of a Farrelly Bros. film. But when it loses
the anything-for-a-laugh excess, there's little left. Real
professional wrestling has become such a circus of outrageous
stunts and soap opera mythology that this winds up less parody than
pale imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to Rumble. Directed by Brian Robbins. Screenplay by
Stephen Brill. Cast: David Arquette, Oliver Platt, Scott Caan, Rose
McGowan, Martin Landau, Joe Pantoliano. Warner Bros. 100 Minutes.
Rated PG-13 for language, crude humor, sexual content including
brief nudity and wrestling violence.

 &HT;    RUSSIA FACES SUSPENSION FROM HUMAN RIGHTS BODY FOR CHECHEN WAR
OFFENSES
 &HT;    (400&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ Striking a severe blow to Russia's international
prestige, the Council of Europe voted on Thursday to suspend
Russia's membership in the human rights body because of Moscow's
controversial and bloody war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a slap in the face to Russia's President-elect
Vladimir Putin, who gained popularity at home thanks to the war and
made closer ties to the West part of his election platform.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's reaction to the vote was indignant. Its
parliamentary delegation walked out of the Strasbourg, France-based
body, founded in 1949 to promote democracy and human rights in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not able to participate in the work of the
parliamentary assembly in the Council of Europe. We regret that
this has happened,'' the head of the Russian delegation, Dmitry
Rogozin, told the assembly seconds after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Russians support the offensive, despite
growing evidence reported by international journalists and human
rights organizations of summary executions, rape and looting by the
Russian army against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has violated some of its most important obligations
under both the European Convention on Human Rights and
international humanitarian law,'' said the text of the motion,
passed in a 78-to-64 vote. It asked governments to report back to
the Assembly in June, saying that they should start suspension
proceedings against Russia ``should substantial, accelerating and
demonstrable progress not be made immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, however, could only be a symbolic act. The
41-nation organization has little real power. For the vote to take
affect, the governments must also approve of the action. No nation
has been suspended in the body's 51-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this could be unlikely, given international
governments' past refusal to risk upsetting the world's
second-largest nuclear power on most issues, like corruption,
economics and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's behavior in Chechnya certainly does not correspond to
European standards, and in principle Russia should be sanctioned,''
said Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political
Technologies, a Moscow-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But suspension would provoke (the Russian government) to slam
the door and stop cooperating with the West,'' he added. ``No
Western country wants to shut the door on a nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has denied allegations against its army. Moscow defends
the offensive as a war against terrorism, saying that if abuses by
the army have occurred then they are the exception, rather than the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However, uproar over Moscow's offensive has swelled in recent
weeks, with polite diplomatic exchanges being replaced by
out-and-out condemnation. After a weekend trip to the war-torn
region, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson told reporters she was shocked about what she saw and what
she heard from some of the 200,000 refugees who have fled fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to testimony of summary executions, intimidation,
looting by military personnel, disproportionate use of force,
attacks on civilian convoys, rape and other violations,'' she said.
``These accounts corroborate much of the serious and documented
information available so far, and they require a serious
response.''
</P>
<P>
   After her trip, the Council of Europe's political committee met
Tuesday and recommended the larger body sanction Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has made a few small, conciliatory steps to calm world
opinion. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov announced Tuesday that Moscow
would allow Council of Europe observers to take part in a
Russian-led investigation into army abuses. The army has also
arrested one colonel, alleging he raped and killed a Chechen girl.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Clooney usually comes across as self-assured, but on
Wednesday he was more like a nervous bridegroom. Sure, he loves her
and wants to get married, but can he get through the ceremony
without throwing up?
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his anxiety is Sunday's live broadcast of the Cold
War drama ``Fail Safe'' on CBS. Based on the 1962 best-selling
novel by Harvey Wheeler and Eugene Burdick, ``Fail Safe'' deals
with a B-52 bomber dispatched by computer error to drop a
20-megaton nuclear warhead on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first live broadcast of a dramatic movie on any
network since CBS' ``Playhouse 90,'' which ended its four-year run
in May 1960.
</P>
<P>
   When Clooney, the rest of the cast and all the behind-the-scenes
honchos met with reporters Wednesday during a rehearsal break,
their mood was jovial, but it was clear all were feeling the
deadline creeping up on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in over our heads a little bit right now, we're a little
crazed,'' Clooney said with a chuckle. ``Everybody's here because
we want to be here and because we think it might be fun, and we're
not quite sure if we can pull it off but we're going to give it a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney plays the bomber pilot, Col. Jack Grady, and is
executive producing the project with his Maysville Pictures
partner, Pam Williams, and former Fox 2000 chief Laura Ziskin.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen it before, the TV movie or special with this star or
that one billed as executive producer. ``Yeah, right,'' we say,
dismissing the credit as unbelievable as a pair of Nikes labeled
``made in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case, though, with Clooney, who was the catalyst
behind the live episode of ``ER'' in 1997. Although he was
disappointed with some aspects of that show, it whetted his
appetite for more.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, at the end of another long day of
juggling rehearsals and production details, Clooney sounded as
energized and enthused as if it were the first time someone had
asked him about ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's !ital!insane,'' he said of the mood in the production
office and two massive Warner stages. ``The Omaha war room is
gigantic. It literally takes up all of Stage 15. It's huge. It's
the biggest set I've ever seen. It's just gigantic. It's
ridiculous. We have a 38-foot screen of the (radar) map that's
constantly in motion, the map of the planes going in and out. It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in detail about the 22 camera operators (many of whom
will be in Army uniforms so they can move through the background
unnoticed), potential logistics problems, the art of special
effects for live TV and other particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney was a hands-on executive producer from the start, when
he pitched ``Fail Safe'' to CBS Television president Les Moonves,
through the selection of director Stephen Frears (``Dangerous
Liaisons'' and the just-released ``High Fidelity'') and the casting
of Richard Dreyfuss, Hank Azaria, Noah Wyle, Harvey Keitel, Brian
Dennehy, Don Cheadle, Sam Elliott, James Cromwell and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, 38, has remained grounded amid Hollywood stardom by
staying close with his longtime friends, a philosophy he applied to
this job. Indeed, someday people might sit around at parties
playing Six Degrees of Fail Safe.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney worked with Keitel in ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' knew
Cheadle from ``Out of Sight'' and, of course, Wyle from ``ER.''
Frears directed Elliott in ``The Hi-Lo Country'' and made ``Hero''
with producer Ziskin. Ziskin, meanwhile, headed the Fox film
division for which Clooney made ``One Fine Day,'' and she produced
``What About Bob?'' starring Dreyfuss. Clooney also brought in Tom
Park, who produced the live ``ER'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the people we went to first because we know them
and we like them,'' Clooney said. ``These guys don't do a lot of
television, if any, but they could do something if you do it live
... and then it's a story they all happen to like very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's getting any money here,'' he added. ``It's a very
expensive project. But it's all up on the screen because I
literally had to call them up and say, `Look, I was paid this
amount of money to do it as an actor and a producer, and I took it
and put it back into the production, because my name's on it and I
can't have my name on something and have it not work. There's no
back end (payoff) on this because it's live. There's nothing to
offer you except six weeks of terror if you want to do it,' and
everyone came on board and said, 'Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's terror of dwelling for hours each day in a make-believe
nuclear crisis, and terror in playing it live before millions of
viewers. Producer Park said there will be no cue cards, despite the
fact that as of Wednesday afternoon some of the actors still were
referring to their scripts. ``No net. That's one of George's
favorite phrases for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the program runs short because of, say, an adrenaline-rushed
pace or dropped lines, Azaria joked, ``We all have songs
prepared,'' and Norman Lloyd said he will recite Shakespeare's
sonnets.
</P>
<P>
   Azaria compared it to an auto race. ``I'm sure half the people
will be watching to see who's going to mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss, Keitel, Dennehy and William Smitrovich talked about
the appeal of ``Fail Safe's'' anti-nuclear-war message and the
importance of getting it across to a young audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Clooney said Wednesday that his choice of this story ``had
nothing to do with its relevance, politically or socially.'' The
1964 feature starring Henry Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy and Walter Matthau
has been his favorite film since he first saw it as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he settled on the title, he also resolved to shoot it in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and white makes it more cinematic,'' he said. ``Part of
the pitch I had with Les was to make sure it's in black and white
because it's a back-breaker if it's in color. It looks like a porno
film without the sex. It just looks cheaper than hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The live broadcast for the eastern and central time zones will
have the crisp look generated by 16 digital cameras, but on the
West Coast where it will air delayed, the picture will seem
old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have real hot whites, real high contrast, so it
should look like kinescopes,'' Clooney said. Cinematographer John
Alonzo has framed the shots in a near-letterbox configuration, he
said, with borders at the top and bottom of the TV picture to add
to the cinematic effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing the camera tests and we're able to get the
camera literally about six inches from our faces, so we're able to
get these closeups just of eyes,'' Clooney said. ``It's pretty
shocking what we're able to do with very little light because we're
using digital cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the most compelling aspects of director Sidney
Lumet's original film was its complete lack of music. He and
screenwriter Walter Bernstein, who also scripted the 1964 movie,
stayed with that concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence and the room tone alone are part of what you sell
the story with,'' Clooney explained. ``I'm a big fan of that whole
MTV look and how we've oversaturated the senses with rapid cuts,
but now with this, what we're trying to do _ which they did really
successfully in the film _ is sort of resensitize people to
stillness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're going to be great moments where you're just going to
see the president (Dreyfuss) and the translator (Wyle) sitting in
this white room and a single table with a single phone on the
desk,'' he said. ``It's going to be 30 seconds while they wait for
the Soviet premier to get on the line of just pure silence, and
with any luck at all that will be as interesting as all these rapid
cuts have been over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really, really great storytelling,'' he said.
``It takes a lot of patience because television doesn't like to sit
still at all now. But that's part of the fun of this.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well with ``Fail Safe'' _ as judged by Clooney's
standards, the ratings, the reviews and the reactions of Moonves
and key sponsors Ford and State Farm _ Clooney would like to do
other live television dramas, although he says there aren't any
projects in the pipeline just yet.
</P>
<P>
   USC professor Barbara Corday, creator of ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' and
former head of CBS prime time and Columbia Pictures Television,
loves the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I can't imagine the downside of this,'' Corday said.
``In terms of the future, if someone like George would say, 'Once a
year or every 18 months I'm going to do this and it's going to be
fully sponsored by X and I'm going to get all my movie friends to
be in it, I just can't imagine anyone turning that down.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Clooney is only making plans for what he'll be
doing right after Sunday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking,'' he said. Several of his co-stars nodded in
agreement.

THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR NO FANTASY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While ``Fail-Safe'' is set in the early 1960s, when computer
technology in defense systems was primative and Cold War tensions
were at their peak, the Global Security Institute maintains the
threat of nuclear war ``is not ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute, founded by former California Sen. Alan Cranston,
is using Sunday night's telecast as an opportunity to spread its
disarmament message with discussions and screenings at 10 college
campuses nationwide, including UCLA and Loyola Marymount
University.
</P>
<P>
   Both Los Angeles campuses will show the program at 9 p.m.,
preceded by an hourlong talk with defense and disarmament experts.
</P>
<P>
   Former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell, institute vice
president Tad Daley, former UC regent Stanley Sheinbaum and Robert
Scheer of the Los Angeles Times are slated to speak at the UCLA
program at Sproul Hall. Parking is available at the Sunset Village
parking structure for $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Loyola Marymount event, held in the library auditorium, will
feature theology professors Thomas Rausch and Daniel
Smith-Christopher as well as Dr. James Yamazaki of the Nagasaki
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and Jonathan Parfrey of Physicians
for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Similar events have been organized at Stanford (where Cranston
will speak), UC Berkeley, Notre Dame, the University of Michigan,
the University of Maryland, Swarthmore, Columbia and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said although the constantly flying bombers central to the
``Fail-Safe'' plot have been grounded for nearly a decade,
accidental nuclear war still is possible because of the ``launch on
warning'' strategies in place in the United States and Russia. Both
nations would fire their own missiles 30 minutes after detecting an
attacking missile. In 1995, he noted, Russia was three minutes away
from attacking the United States after mistaking a weather
satellite for an incoming warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Security Institute has designated Monday as a
``Fail-Safe'' national call-in day, urging concerned citizens to
call the White House and the campaigns of presidential candidates
George W. Bush and Al Gore to press for global nuclear disarmament.

<P>
   It was an attention-getter, to say the least. There was
Secretary of Defense William Cohen standing alongside Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Monday in Jerusalem, chastizing Israel for its
pending delivery of an AWACS-type surveillance plane to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Such official American criticism of Israel is rare, and rarer
still was Cohen's overt airing of differences at a joint press
conference. Coming as it did at a time when Washington is laboring
mightily to mediate Israeli peace agreements with the Palestinians
and Syria _ accords that are expected to entail considerable new
infusions of US aid to Israel _ Cohen's disapproval of the AWACS
sale signified an unusual clash of Israeli and US interests.
</P>
<P>
   The bellicose threats Beijing issued during the runup to
Taiwan's recent presidential election underlined how perilous to
Asian stability an arms race between the island and the mainland
could be. Cohen did not mince words when lamenting Israel's role in
stimulating such an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States does not support the sale of this type of
technology to China because of the potential of changing the
strategic balance in that region, with the tensions running high as
they are between China and Taiwan,'' Cohen said. Left unsaid was
the potential of the Israeli surveillance aircraft to help Beijing
overcome the qualitative edge in military technology enjoyed by
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen could not be expected to demand that Israel cancel its
contracts with China because, when Israel first submitted the sale
to the Pentagon for vetting, it was told that the sale was
permissible since there are no American components in the
surveillance planes and the sale involved no transfer to China of
US technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had to complain about Israel threatening the strategic
balance in Asia because, in the four years it took Israel Aircraft
Industries to roll out the first of four airborne radar systems it
hopes to sell to Beijing, things changed in the geopolitics around
the Taiwan Strait. If Israel now wants to show itself a faithful
ally, it will forgo the sale of the other three AWACS planes China
wanted to buy.

THERE'S NO DEFENDING THE BEFUDDLED `RULES OF ENGAGEMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: D  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The credits (which include a former secretary of the Navy as
executive producer) and advertising for the military drama ``Rules
of Engagement'' would lead one to expect the most intelligent and
thought-provoking Hollywood court-martial thriller since ``A Few
Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   And those expectations are heightened when the film opens with
not one but two devastating action sequences _ one set in 1968
Vietnam, the other in contemporary Yemen _ that recall director
William Friedkin's heyday of ``The French Connection'' and ``The
Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's downhill from this point on and, by the time the film
plummets to its rock bottom, we find ourselves in a flag-waving
no-brainer of the first order, and one of the most thoroughly
confused morality tales in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a
highly decorated U.S. Marine officer, who, in the midst of an
operation to rescue the besieged U.S. ambassador to Yemen and his
family, orders his men to fire into a crowd that's attacking the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   When 83 civilians, including women and children, are killed, a
slimy National Security adviser (Bruce Greenwood) decides to
destroy a surveillance tape that proves the crowd was filled with
armed snipers and prosecute Childers for murder _ hoping this will
placate our angry allies in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   To defend him at his court-martial, Childers chooses a fellow
Marine, Col. Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), an old buddy from the
Vietnam War whose life he saved in the prologue _ a man with his
own demons who is not much of a lawyer and even less of a
detective.
</P>
<P>
   From here, we have to watch Childers as he's ``hung out to dry''
_ spit on by protesters, perjured in the courtroom and made to look
like an out-of-control psychopath, even though we know he's
innocent of the charges and an all-around great American who wants
nothing out of life but the privilege of serving his country.
</P>
<P>
   As a drama, it's all very heavy-handed and plodding: filled with
one-note characters, mindless patriotic sentiment and tiresome
macho bonding rituals. (At one point, the two 50 year-old Marines
duke it out in Childers' quarters, and come up bloody and smiling _
like we're suddenly in a John Wayne movie!).
</P>
<P>
   As a legal thriller, its not just weak, but a Swiss cheese of
story holes and non sequiturs. Childers' whole defense depends on
proving the crowd was armed and yet no one even thinks of calling
to the stand one of the Marines who carried out Childers' orders
and surely would have been in a perfect position to see the crowd.
And that's just one of maybe a dozen points that makes you want to
grab the screenwriter by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   As a morality tale, the film is even more of a disaster. It asks
us, ultimately, to see Childers as a noble warrior and a put-upon
martyr, but we clearly see him commit a war crime in the Vietnam
prologue _ callously executing an unarmed POW _ and he doesn't even
try to disperse the crowd of mostly women and children by shooting
over its head.
</P>
<P>
   But, by far, the biggest failing of ``Rules of Engagement'' is
that it simply can't make us believe its preposterous premise _
that the U.S. government would rather have another William Calley
scandal on its hands than face a few Arab allies with evidence that
its man acted in self-defense. It just doesn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of Engagement. Directed by William Friedkin. Cast: Tommy
Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce, Bruce Greenwood, Anne
Archer, Ben Kingsley. Paramount. 123 minutes. Rated R for combat
violence.

COMPANY SAYS IT HAS FINISHED MAP OF HUMAN GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celera Corp. said Thursday that it has sequenced the human
genome, in effect discovering the sequence of DNA molecules in
which information on human heredity is inscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, a private company in Rockville, Md., has been racing
government-sponsored researchers to decode the human genome, which
offers a blueprint to life. The company, which was established
barely two years ago, reported that it would now attempt to
assemble the genetic fragments in their proper order.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's announcement Thursday drove the stock up nearly 25
percent, to $143 a share, by noon.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering the sequence is an essential step toward mapping the
entire human genome, though the real challenge will be to put the
sequence together properly. Celera said in a statement issued
Thursday that it expected to complete the task over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The progress is significant because assembling the full sequence
could transform the eventual practice of biology and medicine,
providing doctors with a roadmap for confronting diseases at the
genetic level and programming the human organism to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced last month that the United States
and Britain had agreed to cooperate by sharing research data to
break the codes governing human genetics, and invited private
companies to join the effort. But some, like Celera, prefer to
proceed alone.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the human genome involves at least 3 billion bases
of DNA, and calculations suggest that the sequence needs to be
established a half dozen times to ensure that the assembly is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in comprehending the formula has been that
genomes in living creatures contain numerous repeats, which are
copies of stretches of DNA that follow nearly identical sequences,
confusing the assembly process.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's scientists said earlier this year that they had
developed techniques for bridging the repeat stretches to
unscramble at least some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research involved establishing the DNA sequence of
a single anonymous man. The male genome is considered
scientifically more interesting because it contains both the X and
the Y chromosome, while female genomes contain only the X
chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Venter, Celera's chairman and chief scientific officer,
told Reuters Thursday that ``Now that we have completed the
sequencing of one human being's genome, we will turn our
computational power to the task of ordering the human genome.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company next plans to assemble the final human genome
sequence from the genes of five anonymous people. This would allow
the researchers to compare the donated genes to detect the minute
changes that make one human being different from another.
</P>
<P>
   The competing public consortium of researchers subsidized by the
government is sequencing a ``mosaic'' genome in which different
segments are taken from about 10 anonymous donors.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, whose operation employs 300 sequencing machines and the
largest known civilian computer, last month reported assembling the
sequencing of the genome of a fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the magazine Science, two researchers, Eugene W.
Myers and Edward Winstead, explained that the assembly began with
3.1 million fragments of the genome, which they described as
``random bits of fly DNA that have been converted into characters
that a computer can read.'' The fragments, they said, provided
enough DNA to cover the genome 14 times over.
</P>
<P>
   The task, they said, had been ``to arrange these DNA sequences
into a properly ordered and nearly complete genome,'' by matching
the overlapping sequences.

of its surviving movie palaces, scattered through a 14-square-block
area that had been a red-light district. It is now called the
Pittsburgh Cultural District and is overseen by the 16-year-old
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. By Paula Dietz.

GENETIC ALTERATIONS: SOMETHING TO CHEW OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, the organic farmer known as Prince sent shock
waves through the world of big agriculture, food processing and
associated businesses by vehemently denouncing genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, presumably the heir to the British throne, said
he bloody well wouldn't eat GM foods, and neither would he serve
the flaming stuff to his family or his guests.
</P>
<P>
   The British government was anything but pleased with the man who
might be king someday for poking his nose into such serious
business. That's not in his royal job description.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Charles' untimely comments, the real British
government was mounting a campaign to persuade domestic and foreign
corporations that British consumers could be convinced to accept GM
foods as safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
   But the prince came along and rekindled a public debate on GM
foods that until then had subsided into a low simmer. Asserting
that he didn't think it was right to ``tamper with the building
blocks of nature,'' the Prince of Wales, in an interview in ``The
Independent'' later that year, called for ``sustained pressure from
consumers demanding choice in the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier interview in The London Daily Mail, the would-be
monarch referred to laboratory tests indicating that pollen from GM
maize in the United States caused damage to the caterpillars of
monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   He also labeled arguments that GM foods offer hope for
eliminating hunger in the world and raising people out of poverty
as ``emotional blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince's views on GM foods, of course, have to be taken with
several spoons of salt. He is Britain's most renowned exponent and
practitioner of organic farming. At his Highgrove estate in
Gloucestershire, they grow their vegetables without the use of
chemical fertilizers, pesticides or gene splicing.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for organic food has boomed in Britain since the prince
took his public stand. And the waves he made in England about GM
foods have wafted to the shores of this country, Japan and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is the case in the United States, some Australian
experts have challenged the prince's views on the safety of GM
foods. Dr. Geoffrey Annison, scientific and technical director of
the Australian Food and Grocery Council, said the technology has
been built up over 50 years of comprehensive research into the way
that genetic characteristics are transmitted from one organism to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who suggests that safety work has not been done
doesn't really know what's going on,'' Annison said in The Sydney
Morning Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Then Annison posed this dilemma:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work out we will need one million tons of soyabean in
2020, and using current technology we can only reach half that,
then we have two choices. We can use more land, or we can increase
yield.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crux of the issue. GM foods offer the
possibility of using less of the world's land for food production,
which could halt deforestation and soil depletion. At the same
time, biotechnology advances associated with GM food production
offer the prospect of accelerating reforestation and reclamation of
natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   That is not emotional blackmail. The alternative is to clear
more forest and lay waste to more arable land to feed the world's
growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles talks bloody nonsense when he asserts that a lack
of food is not the underlying cause of starvation in some of the
world's poorest places. That's like saying that the primary reason
for a car stalling on the freeway is not that its fuel tank is
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, wars, a lack of infrastructure, and corrupt and inept
governments play major roles in preventing food from getting to
hungry people in some parts of the world. But a lot of people could
starve before those problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those obstacles were overcome, the answer to the food
problems of developing nations cannot be organic, land-intensive
farming. For better or for worse, the day of the small farmer is
plowing to an end. The challenge for the developing world is find
other things for most of the people to do for a living besides
subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like the protesters in Boston who demonstrated outside
the recent BIO2000 convention, Prince Charles has raised some
legitimate issues. They may not really know what they are talking
about, but their concerns need to be taken seriously.
Biotechnologists need to do a better job of explaining what is
happening in their field to the uninformed masses.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, it is well that Congress is considering
legislation that would require understandable labeling of foods
that have been genetically altered or contain such ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   There are several grains of truth spliced into the simplistic
statement, ``We are what we eat.'' That being the case, American
consumers need to know as much as possible about what they are
eating.

<P>
   Every day of the week, wiry, 27-year-old Zhang Minyou hoists 40
to 80 water jugs out of his smart, 19th-century-styled pedicart,
trudges through a labyrinth of laundry-lined alleys and groans his
way up dozens of creaky stairs.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering the goods to one customer, Minyou, an Aquarius
water deliveryman, hops back on his tricycle to peddle to his next
customer through Shanghai's byzantine streets.
</P>
<P>
   He is a cheap but crucial link in an idiosyncratic door-to-door
mainland distribution system that fills orders placed with the
click of a 21st-century mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, this ``fulfillment'' can be left to
domestic mail carriers, such as the United States Postal Service
and United Parcel Service, that offer easy, efficient delivery,
making the transition from a virtual to a physical world a seamless
process for new Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, where the dreams of dot-com wealth soar as high as
the obstacles to e-commerce _ such as snail mail that deserves the
name, a balkanized banking system and a near-absence of consumer
credit cards _ success calls for a kind of ingenuity not taught at
business school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of credit-card transactions, cash on delivery is the
most common method of e-commerce payment. Instead of relying on
delivery companies, start-ups like MyWeb of San Francisco are
becoming partners with a rare combination of local distributors,
including fleets of taxis and university students on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house EachNet, with listings that span nine mainland
cities, links buyers and sellers in any given city. After the
bidding is closed, they arrange to meet each other face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last June, there wasn't a lot being done,'' says Ted
Dean, a partner at the Beijing-based Internet consulting company
BDA. ``Now there are entrepreneurs setting up partnerships,
delivering goods, marketing to customers and dealing with
processing returns. Even if China's still in the early stages of
e-commerce, even if most transactions are still cash on delivery,
the Net companies are actually solving the next set of marketing
and logistical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of conventional Internet wisdom, traditional
brick-and-mortar, state-owned enterprises that boast an established
distribution system and a valuable customer base may have an edge
over brash new Net companies struggling to overcome delivery
problems and increase online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were virtual before we went online,'' Aquarius sales
manager Yan Boer says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's more than 400,000 customers could already order
through the network's 24-hour, seven-day a week telephone hotline
last year, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was already computerized,'' he says, ``and our
delivery system was already in place. All we needed to do was to
add a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The site went up on Jan. 1, adding a virtual layer to an
operation that, as Yan boasted, started from the ground up as a
traditional delivery company. Trucks from the Aquarius warehouses
stop daily at more than 100 delivery depots across the city, each
equipped with a computer linked to the headquarters, where 28,000
transactions are processed on the telephone and Web daily.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 pedicart drivers gather at the depots to get
their routes each morning and load their carts. They return twice
during their 12-to-15-hour workday, to get the afternoon and
evening orders and refill their carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost-effective and efficient,'' Yan says, adding that
Aquarius, a unit of one of Shanghai's largest food companies, plans
to expand its operations to seven more cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken is the fact that a distribution system like this
depends on a cheap migrant work force flooding into the major
cities from poorer provinces, working for as little as 36 cents an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Minyou the pedicart driver says it's better than Anhui,
the province south of Shanghai where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food costs next to nothing here,'' he says, ``so I can save a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   As he hops on his tricycle and prepares to peddle half a mile
through icy winds to his next delivery site, Li Zhongshen, a
35-year-old driver and former rice farmer, says that such work will
always fall to migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Shanghainese could do this anyway,'' he says. ``They
wouldn't be able to stand it.''

<P>
   When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. got serious about the Internet, it set
up an online company in the heart of Silicon Valley, complete with
couches, foosball and late-night brainstorming sessions over pizza
and Chinese takeout. The cultural divide between Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest retailer, and its dot-com offspring is as great as
the 1,500 miles between Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville,
Ark., and California _ and that is on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   As establishing an Internet presence becomes imperative for
brick-and-mortar companies, they face the urgent question of how
much distance, physical and logistical, to put between themselves
and their online operations.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off an Internet business offers the lure of cashing in
on the new economy's lofty valuations while creating a company
that, at least in theory, can respond more quickly to the turmoil
of the online marketplace because it is less bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to measure the success of that strategy. But
analysts say that, in the long run, the winners may be companies
that successfully integrate their online and offline businesses,
such as the Charles Schwab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are really looking to do business with companies
through a variety of channels,'' said Michael Bernstein, senior
analyst with the Gartner Group, the technology consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brick-and-mortar companies have the advantage of familiar brand
names and established infrastructures. But with no rule book on how
to parlay those strengths into Internet success, companies are
trying everything from tightly integrated e-commerce divisions to
independent spinoffs with license to cannibalize the parent's
business by undercutting its prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's tolerance of huge losses by Internet start-ups and
the triple-digit price-to-earnings multiples they command are a
seductive incentive to separate the balance sheets. Barnes &AMP; Noble
Inc. netted $486 million when it took its online business public
last May. Staples Inc. expects to raise as much as $250 million in
an initial offering of Staples.com stock this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're under a lot of pressure to create value for
shareholders, it's really hard to say no,'' said Prof. Brandt
Allen, associate dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business at
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   Established companies hope that spinoffs, and their stock
options, will help them compete for the scarce talent they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance to be part of something that's changing the world,
as well as potentially making people very well off at a very young
age, that's hard to resist,'' said Richard Kurovsky, marketing
director at the Haas School of Management at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   At the Haas School, interview slots with old-line companies such
as General Electric, Clorox and Nestle have gone unfilled, Kurovsky
said, adding that the Internet is ``a siren call.''
</P>
<P>
   Locating Wal-Mart.com in Palo Alto, Calif., was a strategic
decision, said James W. Breyer, the managing partner of Accel
Partners, the venture capital firm in Palo Alto that joined with
Wal-Mart to create Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to attract a level of personnel that's simply
impossible to attract elsewhere in the country,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart.com would work
``seamlessly'' together, even after the dot-com business goes
public. But not everyone believes the model can work.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab, the Internet business was run separately at
first, which was crucial to its development, said Vincent Phillips,
senior vice president for Web systems at the brokerage firm. But
Schwab's customers eventually spurred a decision to integrate the
online and offline operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers don't see us as two different channels; they see us
as one entity. And that's really the answer you need, not what
makes sense from a business-planning model.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab cannot offer employees start-up-style stock options, but
it offers the resources to ensure that projects get done, as well
as a huge customer base and the chance to live a more balanced
life, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Schwab, you're not going to have to work 22 hours a day to
participate in a dot-com experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most companies entering the untested waters of the
Internet, Schwab had to face the possibility that the online
business would undercut its original business. After a barrage of
objections to a double-pricing standard for regular and online-only
customers, Schwab shifted to a flat rate in 1998, knowing it would
lose more than $100 million in commissions. The gamble paid off:
Trading volume surged, and by the end of the year, revenues and
profits were up.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant consensus among chief executives was that if you
do not cannibalize your own business, someone else will.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling the spinoff fever is the dismal experience of
Barnesandnoble.com, whose stock price has dropped by more than half
since the business went public last May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the performance to poor integration of the
online and offline businesses. Customers in stores cannot use
computers to look for books online, where the selection is greater
_ although the company says that will change this year _ and
customers cannot return books bought online to stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers between the store and the site are
unbelievable,'' said Evan Schwartz, author of ``Digital
Darwinism,'' a guide to business survival on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of employees, Schwartz said, spinoffs,
with their separate compensation plans and potentially lucrative
stock options, can demoralize employees at the parent company and
create friction in what should be a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't want to jump to the other side?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prevent such internal strife, Staples is giving
dot-com stock options to some employees in the brick-and-mortar
business. Other companies are issuing dot-com options to their
offline sales forces or giving double commissions on Internet
advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest danger of spinning off an Internet business may be
that it represents the company's future, said Allen of the
University of Virginia. When a company enters a partnership to set
up a dot-com, as Barnes &AMP; Noble did with the European publishing
company Bertelsmann, it is easy to wind up holding less than 50
percent of the spinoff's stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a temptation for people to say `Don't worry about the
future, I'll just go ahead and take whatever I can get right
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies try to avoid this danger by employing a halfway
step known as a tracking stock. Instead of spinning off an
operation, the company issues shares that are tied specifically to
the division's performance. Although the tracking shares trade like
normal stock, investors who buy them do not actually buy a piece of
the subsidiary, as they do when purchasing normal common shares.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking shares usually focus on a popular piece of the
company, so they normally receive a higher market valuation than
the parent's stock. This allows the company to unlock some of the
value in its assets without selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies, in particular, have found that this tool
permits them to maintain control of the part of the business _
their online content _ that may well determine their futures.
Several companies have each isolated their Internet assets in a
single division, laying the groundwork for later public offerings.
The New York Times Co. announced earlier this year that it would
issue a tracking stock for Times Company Digital, the company's
Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an Internet business is spun off or not, analysts agree
that it must have independent management and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``These e-businesses have to be free to operate and do things in
nontraditional ways,'' said Bruce Buckland, president of Inforonics
Inc. of Littleton, Mass., which provides Internet support services.
``If they're not, they can't possibly keep up with the rapid pace
of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys in a garage who are risking nothing are going to come
and eat your lunch,'' he added.

<P>
   Josie True, a Chinese-American cartoon girl in an online game,
hunts for her missing teacher by time-traveling. Along the way, she
strikes up conversations with little-known historical heroines like
Bessie Coleman, the first African-American to earn an international
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Web-based action games, which generally interest
boys, ``The Adventures of Josie True'' is designed to appeal to
girls' interests in characters and narratives. In sly fashion,
Josie also introduces players to role models absent from most
history books, while increasing their computer fluency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a moneymaking scheme,'' said Mary Flanagan, an
assistant professor of media studies at the University of Buffalo,
who is developing the game with a grant of $199,920 from the
National Science Foundation. Her concern is the lack of educational
software aimed at girls, particularly minority girls.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping this overlooked market, Flanagan thought, could help
solve a stubborn gender gap. Girls still take fewer advanced
computer-science classes than boys and are more likely to shy away
from careers like engineering, said a 1998 report by the American
Association of University Women. Part of the reason, the report
said, was that boys play computer games more than girls and enter
classrooms far more comfortable with computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a software developer's dream to do something you're
committed to,'' said Flanagan, who hired graduate students to
finish the online game
(www.buffalo.edu &QC; /scripts/newnews/index.cgi?article &QC; (EQ)theadventu)
by the end of this year. For schools and girls without Web access,
Flanagan intends to produce CD-ROMs. With modest government
assistance and a passion for closing the digital gender gap,
Flanagan is demonstrating how the Internet can be an egalitarian
tool for self-expression. The site, like other noncommercial sites
being developed around the United States, is intended to be an
example of high-minded goals that have not been eclipsed by the
cacophony of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Without millions of dollars of investors' money to buy
mass-market advertising, noncommercial sites, especially ones
catering to untapped or underserved sectors, face an uphill battle
as they try to gather like-minded audiences from the far corners of
cyberspace. But such efforts are far from a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not different from any other medium,'' said Ekaterina
Walsh, a consumer analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. Compared with slickly packaged Web content for mass
audiences, original and unadorned sites are a breath of fresh air
that gain word-of-mouth (or e-mail) credibility ``in the same way
NPR and PBS stand out on radio and TV,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   And developers of noncommercial sites can salve their dot-com
envy with a patina of respect. Research shows that consumers are
more likely to trust nonprofit sites than commercial ones, Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to penetrate popular culture through radio and television
advertisements, some developers of noncommercial sites have
resorted to grass-roots efforts to build an audience, particularly
among those without Internet connections. This approach can be
successful when the audience itself ends up being the supplier of
low-cost content.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in public libraries in Newark, Harlem and
Melbourne, Australia, youngsters are dabbling at a test site,
www.kahootz.com.au, where they can create and publish animated
stories and inventions online, then ``chat'' about their work.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent tryout of the site in Newark, schoolchildren on two
continents showed off their child-centric creations: a homework
helper and a dirt-to-food machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a channl for interactive design to stimulate
girls and kids who don't have computers at home, to get them to
start thinking of themselves as designers and inventors,'' said
Dorothy T. Bennett, the project director of the Education
Development Center for Children and Technology, which is developing
the site with the Children's Television Foundation in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another grass-roots project has already drawn participation from
nearly 1,000 children in 139 countries. Their contributions filled
an online bulletin board devoted to how young people believe
technology can improve the world. The first Web site,
www.jrsummit.net, spawned a second, www.nation1.org. The project
began with professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Media Lab, who contacted education officials around the world to
attract young people to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about bringing underrepresented groups online,'' said
Justine Cassell, a Media Lab professor who was one of the program's
organizers and is a co-editor of the book ``From Barbie to Mortal
Kombat: Gender and Computer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to reaching such an overlooked audience comes
from Oakland, Calif., the eighth-largest city in the state.
Pummeled by the 1989 earthquake and a catastrophic fire in 1994,
the city is struggling to make an economic comeback, particularly
in East and West Oakland, which are characterized by a mix of
stately but aging Victorian houses, boarded-up storefronts and few
commercial services, like supermarkets and bank branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the underserved communities to move to the served
category,'' the community, not corporations, will have to create
the content, said David Geilhufe, the director of the Eastmont
Computing Center in Oakland, where 350 people receive computer
training financed by the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   This version of urban renewal is aimed at compressing the
digital divide in poorer neighborhoods without typically putting
computers in every classroom. Instead, the city and its
philanthropic partners are counting on the virtual world to provide
banking services that are unavailable to many residents in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of developing an e-banking service in this market,
about $300,000, with investment payback expected to be slow, is
being shared by four lenders led by Union Bank of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll mobilize and test and pull people into it,'' said Donald
Vial, the chairman of the California Foundation on the Environment
and Economy, a nonprofit group in San Francisco. Starting in May,
about 200 people will use the service, which will be offered at
five community technology centers, among them Eastmont.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will receive training in computers and household
financial management and learn how to navigate an e-banking site
that will be customized for language and culture, said Norman Jayo,
the foundation's senior strategist.
</P>
<P>
   E-banking has the potential to show people that technology can
make a difference in their lives, whether by helping a small
business grow or helping someone on welfare to find a job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A goal of Oakland's e-banking site is to show lenders and other
Web businesses that demand exists in neighborhoods being bypassed
by e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the application is significant to them, it takes off,''
Jayo said. ``It's using technology as a base for empowerment.''

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Good afternoon, Anthony Dunne's office _ I'll see if Mr.
Dunne's available.''
</P>
<P>
   I pressed the hold button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony!'' I shouted toward the open bathroom. ``It's Thomas
O'Brien!''
</P>
<P>
   There was excitement in my voice about the return call from
O'Brien, the hot interior designer, but I added, ``Once in a while,
could you please close the door?''
</P>
<P>
   Our communal office bathroom was adjacent to our main working
space, our 276-square-foot living room.
</P>
<P>
   That was where we set up shop last spring when, at 45, my
husband, Tony Dunne, gave up the security of the insecure movie
business, where he was the set builder on films such as ``Die Hard
With a Vengeance'' (1995) and ``Ransom'' (1997), to pursue an
Internet idea: the first virtual interior-design center.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, Tony had informally designed interiors
for family members, friends and people in the movie business. Last
May, he was designing two apartments when he returned home from a
long day spent in the maze of furniture showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on the couch and said, ``I've been thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In great detail, he laid out his idea for HauteDecor.com, which
would bring together about 20 top interior designers and have each
create virtual rooms, in which everything would be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The site would offer the best of home furnishings and
accessories to designers as well as consumers. Shoppers could
choose from thousands of items selected by design professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like shopping in New York or London from your office
or living room. It would be like looking at a magazine and being
inside the rooms. Rather than turn to the back of a magazine for
information, visitors could click on the item and find what they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Though I knew little about the Internet and e-commerce, I knew I
was hearing a good idea. I also knew that it was perfect for Tony
because it would use his film background, computer skills _
computers have been used in set design for years _ business acumen
and knowledge of interior design.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a grownup idea. It would never occur to a kid playing
videos and eating Cheetos at an Internet incubator.
</P>
<P>
   As I studied Tony's diagrams for the site, I knew I could help
him execute the concept. As a writer, I had always worked under
enormous pressure with brutal deadlines. I found it all fun. We
both did.
</P>
<P>
   And so I offered my services and became Tony's first employee:
assistant and messenger.
</P>
<P>
   To both of us, the e-commerce and movie businesses seemed
similar. Both required tremendous manpower, equipment and money, as
well as highly complex tasks, all in a compressed time frame. That
was crucial to making the transition for us. We simply applied our
movie skills to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is the script _ it had better be great. The venture
capitalists who provide the money are the studio executives. The
teams who get the site running are the teams who make a movie. The
Web site is the movie. The site's debut is the release.
</P>
<P>
   Even the big egos are the same. The business people think they
are most important _ the creative people know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Both businesses thrive on gossip and on people spewing opinions
with great authority. The accumulated knowledge does not add up to
much: Columbia Pictures passed on ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial''
(1982), even with Steven Spielberg involved. Bill Gates, among
others, was decidedly cool about the Internet's future but has
since changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   People talk as if they know. Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Once we started to execute the idea, it turned out to be as hard
as we had thought it would be _ which means that you really had no
idea how hard it would be, and your naivete is the only thing you
have going for you.
</P>
<P>
   You actually believe it is going to get easier, and so when it
keeps getting tougher and reaches the point where it has taken over
your life, you still believe that it is going to lighten up. That
is before you find yourself stopping at Banana Republic to buy
socks and underwear on the way to a meeting, or stealing toilet
paper from a friend's hotel room because that is one item the
coffee shop doesn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   As in a movie, you are behind before you begin. My original deal
with Tony had been six hours in the afternoons for $20 an hour, off
the books. By Week 2, I was working 14 hours a day, and the guy was
not coughing up the dough. Oh, this is the movie business, all
right _ everyone lies.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait it out. There comes a time when you are indispensable,
and then you've got them. As we refined the concept, Tony and I saw
the need for editorial content, which helps drive people to the
site and keeps them there. And so I was offered the job of
HauteDecor's editorial director. I would have been a whole lot
nicer about my deal had he paid me when I was an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Money is always the hardest part. We chose to take what in film
is called the studio route. The nature and scope of the project
required financing from a large venture-capital firm. Because we
did not know anyone at such a firm, we spoke to every single friend
we have.
</P>
<P>
   My most important recommendation: Do not be coy _ no one
appreciates it. If I thought a friend could somehow help, I started
the call with, ``I need a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask about their kids or their work or their last
vacation. This is business. They will respect you for that, even if
they cannot help.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight months, Tony and I have made easily 1,000
calls and met with countless friends, acquaintances and strangers
whom we found through friends and acquaintances. A little buzz
started, and people started calling us. Most conversations went
nowhere, but a few were exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That is how we found financing. Other people might have a more
sophisticated strategy, but this one worked for us.
</P>
<P>
   We identified two people who we believed were serious. Tony met
with the first one several times. Together, on a Sunday morning, we
met with the second at the Carlyle Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast, Tony laid out his HauteDecor plan for
entrepreneur Kevin Kinsella and his wife, Tamara. Thirty minutes
into breakfast _ and 29 minutes after his eyes told me he was
hooked _ Kevin said he wanted in on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would provide the $1 million seed capital needed to
get the idea moving. He made a commitment to help raise, in stages,
at least $25 million to $30 million, which is what he and Tony
determined it would cost to execute the site. He laid out the
deal's terms, and the firms and people he would ask for money. We
were familiar with a number of them.
</P>
<P>
   Back at our base, Tony returned to command central: the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he's for real?'' he asked, knowing the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' I said, knowing that my next words would determine
our future. Tony would not go forward without my support. ``Let's
do it,'' I said, but not in a silly, gung-ho way.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Kevin wired the initial $500,000 to the HauteDecor
account. A month later, we moved ourselves and four new employees
from our living room into a 2,500-square-foot space in the Flatiron
district of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie business, when every element is in place and
everyone is betting on success, the production is given a green
light. That's where we are now.
</P>
<P>
   With financing mainly from the Institutional Venture
Partners/Redpoint, we will spend the next five months continuing to
create and build the Web site, form alliances, work with
manufacturers and designers, write editorial content and perform a
long list of other tasks with the other employees, who seem to
arrive on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we begin in August, there will be 120 of us in an
18,000-square-foot space, 62 times the size of our living room,
where this venture started as a conversation between two people.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The roads in Gansu, China, are sometimes barely roads. Bathrooms
are pits in the ground. Fur coats are a necessity, not fashion. In
a nod to tradition, and for self-defense, some men travel with
swords at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, thanks to modem connections and the efforts of local
entrepreneurs, the Internet is trickling into back alleys and
basements of the most remote regions of western China. A nationwide
system of local Internet service providers was completed last year,
and now the seven westernmost provinces _ half of China's land,
with 20 percent of its population _ account for 5 percent of the
country's Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   So, when in early January I set out with my backpack and no
itinerary for a seven-week trek through the mountains and deserts
of western China, e-mail was the intercontinental umbilical cord
that tethered me to my anxious mother, 12,000 miles away in New
York. From Inner Mongolia to Kashgar to Lhasa, I hunted for the
elusive wang ba, or ``Net bar,'' to send reassuring updates.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are better left out of such dispatches,
incidentally: I did not tell my mother about the time my bus almost
slipped off an icy mountain road, or about another bus that fell
off a cliff outside Lhasa, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-room Net bar in Kashgar, where eight personal
computers were strung together with a tangle of wires, the
coal-burning stove, spewing black smoke, was not enough to keep my
fingers from becoming too cold to type.
</P>
<P>
   In the monastery town of Xiahe, in Gansu Province, Internet
users look out the window at the mule-drawn carts and the nomadic
herdsmen who trudge along the town's one main street, oblivious to
the information revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet may be a web of dreams, China is a country of
stark realities. Like its roads and infrastructure, China's
Internet is being sewn together piecemeal and unevenly, but it is
coming together.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you go and whom you ask, China is alternately
prosperous or poor, cutting-edge modern or heart-achingly backward.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational corporations salivate over magazine images of
Levi-clad adolescents eating at the McDonald's in Shanghai and
talking on their Nokia cell phones. But that slice of the
demographic pie is very slim and very urban. More than two-thirds
of China's 1.2 billion people are rural, and the overwhelming
majority of that rural population is poor.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 45 percent of China's Internet users live in Shanghai,
Beijing or in the affluent province of Guangdong, which together
account for only 8 percent of the country's total population.
Approximately 80 percent of users live in large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent are men, and 85 percent are 18 to 35,
according to a government-sponsored survey by the China Internet
Network Information Center. Few rural residents can afford
computers or the fees charged by their local Internet bars, the
equivalent of $2.50 to $4 an hour. Urban Internet bars are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet presence reflects these disparities. A wang ba can
be a sleek mirrored club, with uniformed attendants bringing tea to
customers at their computers, or a dirt-floor hovel where men
huddle under dim lighting. Beyond larger cities, wang-ba customers
are largely foreign tourists seeking quaint, traditional villages
but demanding modern communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Many wang bas use the names Hotmail and Yahoo as synonyms for
Internet access on their store signs. These services' increasing
presence is leading the way for infiltration of the Internet
throughout the underdeveloped areas of China.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, local residents who go to wang bas seem more
interested in the multiplayer video games than in the potential for
revolutionizing commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Jin, who owns Tim's Internet Cafe in Dali, in Yunnan
Province, estimates that 95 percent of his customers are
foreigners, 4 percent come from other parts of China and less than
1 percent are local residents.
</P>
<P>
   As for e-commerce, Jin says, a number of the communities
surrounding Dali still do their purchasing and bargaining at weekly
outdoor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way we can do an e-commerce site here,'' he says, citing
the lack of infrastructure in Yunnan, the difficulty of
transportation and the low population density. ``In big cities and
through foreign mail-order companies, maybe. Locally, there's no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, which is not connected to China
by railroad, Tsering Tashi opened the Khang Li Internet Bar as soon
as Tibet established an Internet service provider last year. He
says it was the only Tibetan-owned Internet bar in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 months, he says, he recovered his original investment
of almost $10,000. Still, nearly all of his customers are tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibetans almost never use high technology _ they don't
understand it,'' Tashi says. ``They have heard of the Internet, but
the Internet cafe is a wholly new concept to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, October through February, he converts most of
his Internet cafe into a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish connections are a problem throughout China. In
mid-February, Jin closed his cafe for two days because the Internet
was too slow, particularly the e-mail provider Hotmail, which 80
percent of his customers use.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, China is changing rapidly, and so is the Internet.
Entrepreneurs say they are optimistic that logistical obstacles can
be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate profits in China have historically been elusive.
Ask any multinational corporation that has set up shop in China in
the last decade, eager to tap into the billion-customer market.
Most companies are still waiting for the investments to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by distribution difficulties, inflated estimates of
demand and bureaucratic red tape, more businesses are leaving
China, deciding that the market can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, profits in e-commerce are elusive as well, though
not only in China. E-business opportunities in China could
therefore prove to be doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But low costs and tourists' cash, it turns out, can become a
very workable, albeit modest, business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamental goal is to make money,'' Tashi says. ``So far,
the Internet has been very good for making money.''

<P>
   Who wants to be a centimillionaire?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question rattling around the most elite country
clubs and the executive washrooms of the biggest corporations, as
the nation's most experienced managers decide whether to jump to
Internet startups with little more than a business plan and a pile
of not-yet-valuable stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, for those who want to take their chances, is that
Silicon Valley needs as many chief executives as Cecil B. DeMille
needed extras. Still, for the open CEO jobs and headless companies,
the mating rituals between start-up and seasoned executive are
complex. No one is likely to know them better than David Beirne, a
top technology headhunter who is now a partner in Benchmark
Capital, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Beirne was a partner at Ramsey/Beirne Associates
of Ossining, N.Y., and recruited top names, including Robert J.
Herbold from Procter &AMP; Gamble to be chief operating officer at
Microsoft and James Barksdale from Federal Express to be chief
executive of the young Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Beirne's switch, in 1997, to Benchmark, notable for its early
investment in eBay, the online auction company, was not as big a
jump as it might have seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do any more recruiting or any less than the other
partners here,'' Beirne said. ``But all of us spend a tremendous
amount of time recruiting for our companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, talent wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierne spoke about the challenges of recruiting Internet chief
executives in true Silicon Valley style _ while talking on a cell
phone as he jumped out of a taxi and ran through an airport
security check on his way home from a corporate board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you look for in a chief executive to run an Internet
company?
</P>
<P>
   A: One size doesn't fit all. Intellect and raw leadership
ability is a given. What you really need is someone who is a magnet
for talent. Since talent is the scarcest resource and getting more
scarce, the key to success is being able to recruit a world-class
team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is different about recruiting a chief executive for an
Internet company?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's more apparent is the need for speed. Five years ago,
people could take their time making decisions. Today, if someone
doesn't have the ability to adapt to the pace, you have to pass on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you tell if a candidate can keep up with Internet
time?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have to spend a tremendous amount of time with them to
get into their heads. You also look at what culture they come from.
It's one thing to say to yourself you can deal with the pace; it's
another thing to have lived it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that so many Internet executives were at FedEx
in the early days, like Barksdale, Christos (M. Cotsakos) of
E-Trade Group, and (William J.) Razzouk, who is now running
PlanetRx.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why would someone quit a cushy, well-paid job at the top of a
big company to join a start-up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't believe there is such a thing as a person who can't
be recruited. You have to find the right opportunity for someone
and sell them the dream.
</P>
<P>
   A person wants to come in and really have an impact on the
world. Instead of running some division of AT&AMP;T, they want to
create something that has huge shareholder value that changes the
way people do what they do. There is a huge psychic reward to doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did somebody say stock options?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of these guys have made enough money, so it's not about
that anymore. It is about psychic gratification when the day is
done.
</P>
<P>
   There is financial reward _ if it works. There is more financial
upside and higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Shaun Holliday, who now runs Living.Com (an online
furniture store in which Benchmark has an investment). He was
running Guinness Ireland, and so he was practically running
Ireland. Now he has only $200,000 in cash compensation. But like
all these guys, he can make $100 million or more if it works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why would you pick someone like George Shaheen, who ran
Andersen Consulting, to be the head of WebVan, an Internet grocery
store?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, WebVan isn't just a grocery store, it's the
last mile for the Internet. At the end of the day, it's a systems
company. Hiring a marketing guy from Pepsi wouldn't have been right
for this company. I can get all the marketing people I want to work
under him. Also, Shaheen is a great leader, a magnet for talent,
and people will follow him. And he has built a massive scale
business on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, with all the billions that have been made by Internet
executives, are you besieged by corner-office executives who want
to run Internet companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: It certainly was different when I recruited Barksdale to
Netscape. That was a seminal event: the first time a world-class
executive ever came to run an Internet company. It was a lot more
difficult before people saw the wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a huge number of executives who want to leave their
corporate jobs and join the next dot-com. And with success,
executives can see 10 other people with experience they can relate
to. They see they can have a fun quotient. But I don't think it's
getting any easier to find the talent you really need to have. A
lot of companies are settling just to get a body in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you have been a headhunter so long, can you save money
on fees to search firms?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There hasn't been a time that I haven't hired a search
firm. It's another set of eyes and ears. And even if I know my
first and second choice, you need a process in place behind you if
you can't get them.

 By MARTHA BAER  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Bay Area urologist treating a patient who
works at an Internet start-up recently had an idea. For their next
appointment, the urologist joked, he wanted to be paid in shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of what the guy does all day, for a doctor's salary,''
the Internet executive said sympathetically. ``Of course he wants
to get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the bankers, lawyers and venture capitalists he reads about
in the papers daily, the urologist wanted in on the action, and
these days it seems that everyone but the doctor is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hordes of business-to-business contractors who make deals
with high-technology companies are trading their services for
equity. While law firms have long taken slices of their clients'
companies on top of regular fees, consultants are now doing the
same, along with public-relations agencies, executive search firms
and commercial landlords. Even independent engineers and building
contractors are participating in the equity swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're five for five,'' said Ed Niehaus, a co-founder of
Niehaus Ryan Wong, a San Francisco public-relations firm that
serves technology-company clients. ``We've taken cash plus shares
as payment from five companies and have seen all five go public.''
</P>
<P>
   A sixth company, spun off from one of the five, went bankrupt,
but Yahoo and OnSale.com were among the group, according to an
executive close to the deals.
</P>
<P>
   For public-relations agencies that work with high-technology
ventures, the opportunities for such deals are rife. Because of a
shortage of agencies that are expert in technology, firms such as
Niehaus Ryan Wong are picking and choosing whom they will work with
and how they will be paid. And venture capitalists, or VCs, warn
start-ups that their business plans must incorporate publicity
efforts, which sends 30 to 50 companies knocking on Niehaus' door
every week, many offering stock.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes signing contracts with new clients resemble
aggressive stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're acting like a venture capitalist when you do this,''
Niehaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Bates has placed about 20 such bets since she founded
Sunny Bates Associates, an executive search firm, in New York 11
years ago. The firm serves high-techology companies and the news
media. She said, ``We've hit twice, once with Priceline and now
with a company still in its quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sorts of deals not only help us develop the value of our
company and get our recruiters involved,'' Bates continued, ``but
they also guarantee a different kind of relationship _ not a
hit-and-run, but a mind-share involvement. If you're a stakeholder,
you give freely of your introductions and your time, your contacts.
You're not hoarding.''
</P>
<P>
   For recruiters, equity reimbursements often follow the same
formula as cash fees. Search agencies have traditionally taken a
third of the newly placed executive's first year's salary, but now
that fee is combined with a third of the executive's first year's
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Stock deals can be complicated, however, and vary widely. Some
require no vesting or ``lock-up'' period, so recipients can cash in
the minute a company hits the public market. Some deals involve
options and some warrants. Both represent the right to buy stock at
a given price in the future. Warrants, however, tend to be subject
to fewer tax and accounting rules and can be issued on a more ad
hoc basis than options.
</P>
<P>
   In real estate, where the equity-as-currency phenomenon is
stirring up this fairly traditional industry, landlords are
agreeing to take warrants in lieu of security deposits. A wildly
competitive real estate market can give the landlords more
discretion over tenants and how they can structure deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are going up on a biweekly basis in my area,'' said Ted
Caulkins, an associate director of leasing services in San
Francisco for Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the international real estate
brokerage firm. ``A landlord usually has three to six offers, and
it becomes a beauty contest. That's where the stock element gets
very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, where large, institutional landlords reign
supreme, stock-for-space swaps are occurring in smaller niches.
Rudin Management, which owns highly visible commercial properties
in the financial district of Manhattan, has done four such deals.
</P>
<P>
   When Rudin Management negotiated with xBind, a
networking-technology company, ``we liked their business model,''
said William Rudin, the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Homedelivery.com, which accepts orders for local merchants
through its Web site, Rudin Management saw other possible
collaborations. ``We own a lot of residential apartments in
Manhattan, and Homedelivery.com's services can add value for our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When New York landlords and dot-coms start talking synergy,
times have changed. Or have they?
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather's philosophy was to buy stock in a company that
moved into his building,'' Rudin said. ``It's a slight variation of
the theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But buying stock in companies beyond your balance sheet is not
the same as taking stock for pay. At Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, Thomas
Falus, the president of the New York operations, does not favor the
equity high-wire act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investing vast amounts of money in earnings to grow our
business in China and South America,'' Falus said. ``We can't
afford not to be profitable in mature markets like New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, playing the equity game with square footage is no
better than playing the horses without knowing a thing about
thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Caulkins agreed that companies needed to do their homework.
``These deals put the landlord in the position of a V.C.,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Jamar sang the same refrain: ``I use the same criteria in
negotiating with clients that a V.C. would use.''
</P>
<P>
   A marketing consultant with 20 years' experience in high-tech
businesses, Jamar has taken noncash payment to the next level by
incorporating it into his business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a core component of my strategy, to build a
portfolio of equity in companies. Right now I have stock, or
agreements to take stock, in four companies. I imagine over the
next 12 to 18 months, I'll probably hold equity in 10 to 15
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he works with early-stage start-up companies, Jamar asks
for a minimum of their scarce cash and most of his compensation in
options.
</P>
<P>
   At this end of the spectrum _ where e-commerce companies are
even cutting in one-man-show consultants who would otherwise be
billing at $150 an hour _ the territory is relatively untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brave new world for most independent contractors and
their clients,'' said Michael Dortch, who has been following the
high-technology industry as an independent research analyst for
most of the last 25 years. ``Think about it just on a logistical
basis: Companies tend to work with a lot of contractors; for each
equity arrangement, you've got to go before your board and write up
a specific contract; no one has the time to manage that much
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that momentum is building. ``Somewhere down the road,''
Dortch predicted, ``forward thinking start-ups might build into
their business plans classes of equity specifically for independent
contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does all this swapping portend a world in which every office
temp and smoothie delivery person builds a portfolio of investments
in the start-ups they serve?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. While the equity flows between businesses and their
contractors in ever larger quantities, plenty of young companies
are clutching to their ownership, declaring their equity too
valuable to hand off to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hudes, the president of Organic Online, a Web company
that builds sites and provides marketing services and that went
public in February, held firm when potential landlords proposed
that Hudes pay in equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we gave equity to any number of partners who approached us,
we'd have missed out on giving ownership to the people who matter
most, our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   And after an initial offering, most companies become stingy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get capitalized,'' said Isabel Maxwell, the president
of CommTouch Software, a provider of e-mail services, ``you're
looking at mergers and acquisitions. You buy what you need. I doubt
you'll find well-capped companies who would give away stock to
small contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as word keeps spreading that dot-com options are
today's top dollar, contractors will clamor for them. Take the
building contractor who badgered a San Francisco executive for
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total knucklehead request,'' the executive said.
``Ten thousand shares, he kept on insisting, 10,000 shares. But he
had no idea of the exercise price or how many shares we had
outstanding!''

<P>
   A gerbil shot from a cannon, a hammy actor crooning a song
woefully off key, a college student who burps the alphabet: These
were just a few of the colorful images used in the past year by
dot-com companies flooding the airwaves with ``edgy'' advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To analyze why dot-com advertisements are so wild, whether they
work and where they go from here, a group of advertisers _ some old
hands, some new faces _ and dot-com clients, including one, Michael
Zapolin, who appeared in his own Super Bowl ad, assembled recently
in New York, watched one another's commercials and exchanged views.
The moderator was Warren Berger, a contributing editor at Wired and
editor of the advertising magazine One.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WARREN BERGER &LR;  _ So many dot-com ads, including the ones we
just looked at, seem to feature off-the-wall humor, outrageous
situations, quirky celebrities. Why do these offbeat approaches
seem to be popular?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MICHAEL ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ With all the names out there, even if you
have a really hot name, you still have to burn that into somebody's
brain _ so that a day later, a week later, when they need what you
were talking about, they can recall what you were doing. There's
not a lot of ways to burn something into the brain unless it's just
totally nuts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELLIS VERDI &LR;  _ I'm concerned, though, because half of the
dot-com ads, I don't even know what they're selling; I don't know
what the benefits are to them. At some point I've got to understand
what advantage the site offers to me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROY GRACE &LR;  _ I agree a lot of them sacrifice relevance for
impact, but when I see a gerbil shot out of a cannon, I never
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBERT BOWMAN &LR;  _ We were the first to do the ``Look, ma, no
hands'' advertising, really. We were relatively new to this. And we
got an A in Marketing 101: Get your name out there. But we didn't
tell them what we do and why it's important. So this past
Christmas, we ran ads that talked about overnight free delivery.
Our traffic doubled and our sales tripled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE PARKER &LR;  _ But many of these spots are not aimed at the
end-user anyway. They're aimed at the investment community. And all
they need to know is your name, not what you're selling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ It goes beyond just somebody coming to your site and
buying product. We had four segments to kill. No. 1, consumers
coming to the site. No. 2, the Wall Street community. They're
sitting there and the ad comes on TV and the guy's wife says, ``Are
you taking them public?'' And he says, ``I don't know, I'll call
them tomorrow.'' And then there's the individual investor _ in the
dot-com space, it's 80 percent individual investors, wanting to
know, ``Can I put money into your company?'' And then fourth,
partner companies who want to advertise on the site. It would have
taken us a year and a half to go out and see all these people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ But at some point, somebody's going to say, ``I can't
give you another dollar until you show me some level of
accountability.'' And the accountability has to be in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHERI BARON &LR;  _ I'm sure everyone in this room has sat with
venture capitalists and presented the big idea to them. And they're
not measuring advertising in the traditional way _ because they are
not advertising people. To be honest with you, I don't want a
venture capitalist responsible for developing my advertising
strategy. But at that moment, all bets are off and everybody is
playing different roles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ How involved do the V.C.'s get? To the point of
vetoing ads?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ It depends on the company, whether it's a well-funded
dot-com start-up in Phase 2, or still in Phase 1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ I think the V.C.'s are going to learn their lessons,
too. You can see it already. At one time, $25, $30 million was easy
to get. Now it's $15 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Is it difficult to find the balance between creating
an entertaining commercial like the ones we saw and giving the
basics for consumers _ what is this dot-com, how is it different
from 16 others?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ The basic rules apply. People don't come home at night
to watch the commercials, so it behooves you to make them
entertaining _ whether it's a dot-com, soap, an automobile. Even
more so now, because there's this fierce competition for air. In
the history of the world, have there ever been so many new
companies? There's this wonderful, manic desperation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ It's a very exciting time, but I also think that it's
a chance for agencies to be irresponsible. All of a sudden a
creative person who's always been told they can't do this or that
has newfound creative freedom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Putting aside the investor audience, are most of
these ads targeting a younger audience? Does that explain why
there's so much of a certain style of humor, such as the campy
William Shatner ads?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAVID WECAL &LR;  _ Actually, we're very serious about that stuff.
The truth is, I think mainstream America is pretty edgy. If you
look at the Priceline work, you can say it's a little out there.
But here's a campaign that was talked about on the ``Today'' show,
on ``Entertainment Tonight'' _ it was interesting to mass culture.
I think we underestimate middle America in terms of, like, how edgy
their humor is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Bob, let me ask you, what exactly was the effect of
that ``gerbils'' campaign on the business?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ Traffic spiked way up in December of '98. We had
37,000 new customers when the gerbil ads were flourishing. But of
those 37,000, only 8,000 came back to buy over the next 10 months.
In the holidays of '99 _ when we were running our boring ad about
overnight free delivery _ we had 100,000 new customers. Of those,
already 35,000 have come back. So by telling people what we did, we
got visitors who actually might become customers. We did the
outrageous stuff, and obviously Priceline's ads have been edgy. But
we finally retreated and said, ``We have to tell people what the
value proposition is,'' whereas Priceline has sort of kept with the
same edginess _ they've still not told people that stuff is really
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ David, will there be a second phase to that campaign?
Do you envision it as something that will evolve, where you'll have
less of Shatner singing and more information?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ I think he dances in the sequel. No, we're doing a
second round, but _ you know, there is a balance. I guess I'm going
to answer Bob's question with another question. When you switched
back to more responsible advertising, did you feel like you were
changing the image of your company?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ We were worried about that. In '98 our ads were
outrageous and our site was colossally boring. In '99 our ads were
boring and our site was interesting and fun _ so we tried to keep
the edginess in our site, figuring the ads won't be as irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ In truth, this business is a direct business. There
may be some mass businesses like a Priceline, but, in the end, it's
not like all of a sudden, overnight, we have quadrupled the
capacity for consumers to buy things. So one of the things that's
going to happen is that once we get past this first stage of
getting your financing and getting your name out there, then it
becomes a business like everything else. You have to go out there
and see who your customers are and then refine your targeting as
you move on. You may not be in mass television all the time telling
your story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Mike, what kind of traffic did the Super Bowl ad
generate _ and how did it taper off in the weeks afterward?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ We had about 500,000 people come through within 24
to 48 hours. What happened was, it spiked real hard, and then it
came down pretty hard _ but before the ad we were running at a few
thousand people a day; now we're over tens of thousands of people.
But aside from traffic, I got a call from every investment bank on
Wall Street, and I'm raising money right now at 10 times what I
raised my first round. I mean, you know, so much money that it's
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ As Mike points out, when you spike up to another
level with a big ad campaign, it's temporary _ but when it settles
back down, it doesn't go all the way back down. Because with
everyone you capture, you keep moving to different plateaus and
that's the game. Once we rope somebody in, and they've looked at
our site and particularly if they've been a customer, we now have
their e-mail address; we know who they are. So we don't necessarily
have to rely on mass media to keep people coming back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ One thing that we found from the Super Bowl, it was
like we could do this giant focus group where half a million people
came into our site and told us what they really wanted. We just
watched where they went and what they looked for.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ But I have a question about these advertising
budgets. I recently read about a $25 million advertising account of
a dot-com company aimed at serious marathon runners _ of which
there cannot be more than 50,000 in the entire U.S. If you do the
math, these people are maybe going to go through a pair of shoes a
month, a few pairs of shorts, socks. So where does this $25 million
budget become justified?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ They all say they have $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ Yeah, I know, but a lot of them do. And of course
it's V.C. money to go in and capture a share of the market, but if
you extrapolate it out, it doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ I think the investment market's already changed. We
just completed our quarter two days ago, and when we announce
earnings we will spend a lot of time on our customer-acquisition
cost and we'll divide that by our number of new customers _ and
unless that number's both low and falling, people will sit there
and say, ``You don't have a model that works.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Returning to the ads, there's been a real saturation
over the last year. Is anyone concerned that consumers may be
overwhelmed by the amount of ads ending with dot-com?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ I think there's a numbness. I know it's happened to
me. Listening to the radio, one company after another: dot-com,
dot-com, and you just start to turn it all off. And it has nothing
to do with the content or the message. It has to do with, Enough!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ I don't think the consumer says, ``Dot-com, dot-com, I
don't want to listen to it anymore.'' I think they do their own
editing. And then it gets back to where we started, which is, if
you're relevant to them, they will accept you into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ It's funny, I've been hearing this even before the
Super Bowl _ everybody's sick of the dot-coms. But last night I
turned on ``Law and Order'' and it's ``The Dot-Com Murder,'' you
know? Nobody's really sick of it because it's such an integral part
of our lives. And part of our commercial was saying, ``You know
what? If two guys like us can have a dot-com and an ad on the Super
Bowl, then the dream lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ I've heard agency people say that dot-com clients
sometimes treat the advertising like fun and games. And Mike, here
you are, appearing in your own Super Bowl commercial, doing a funny
routine ... as if you're out there having a good time, while the
meter's running at $2 million for 30 seconds. What would you say to
that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ I'm obviously an egomaniac. But when we sat down
with the agency and they gave us 15 different storyboards, we said
...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ You said, ``Where's the one with me in it?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ No, we said to ourselves, the only way we can be
unique is to try to give our own story, and to portray that we were
low-tech for novices, to say, ``I don't know more about computers
than you, but I'm just trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ I want to ask the agency people to evaluate dot-coms
as clients, generally speaking. What do they fail to understand
about advertising and how it works?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ They don't have a huge amount of marketing skills.
Which is wonderful. And it's also terrible. You know, they aren't
ready to look at advertising and marketing as a science. I think
they're more willing to have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ If they've had business experience before, then
they're usually pretty good. If they just graduated from Stanford
with an MBA six months ago, then some of them have pretty weird
ideas. And so it can be good and bad. I mean, you may come up with
something wild and wacky like shooting gerbils through a hole in
the wall, and these guys say: ``Yeah, let's do it. And we've got to
be on the air next week.'' Whereas if you're dealing with Procter &AMP;
Gamble, you'd have to research it. And you'd never get away with it
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ You'd have to change it to squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ The other thing is, I have friends in agencies around
the country who are steering clear of dot-com companies because
they have huge debts that these guys don't pay up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ But they've also woken up the rest of the clients _
they've provided shock treatment for the advertising industry. You
have clients that are not dot-coms that want a little of that fun;
they want to be talked about. So it's giving us the opportunity to
prove that advertising can be powerful for a brand again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ This has been noted before, but it's ironic that new
media is spending so much on old media. With dot-coms relying so
heavily on TV commercials, does it suggest that advertising on the
Internet is not a viable way to build a business right now?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ The last couple of years has proven that advertising
on the Internet doesn't work. Even when you get the hits, you get
visitors but nothing else. I mean, right now, as it's structured,
Internet advertising is probably one of the worst ways you can
spend your money.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ I think every new medium launches through the old
media. You rely on the old media because that's the mass market;
that's how you reach everybody. And then you get more targeted and
specific.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ So is this just a temporary bubble now, as far as all
the TV commercials are concerned?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ I think it's a bubble. As the numbers come in from the
fourth quarter, I think the expectations for the advertising were
much higher than what the delivery was, and I think that reality is
going to start setting in. That doesn't mean that there isn't an
incredibly important role for advertising. But it is going to find
its place in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Any thoughts on how dot-com advertising will evolve
from here?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ I think it will become respectable as the bigger
companies get into it. They'll want to take less chances, so
they'll focus-group research it and what will happen is what
happens to all advertising that goes through that process. It won't
be as funny. It won't be as edgy.

 &HT;    
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Priceline.com does not even look like your
normal dot-com company. Its headquarters are not in Silicon Valley,
but in a suburban office park. Instead of 20-somethings in jeans
and T-shirts with long hair and short resumes, many of its
inhabitants are gray-haired recruits from companies like Citigroup
and AT&AMP;T. Some wear neat, casual clothes, while others wear suits.
</P>
<P>
   Looks are not deceiving. For all its e-commerce, new-economy
credentials, Priceline wants to be a member of the Old World
corporate club. Instead of battling older, more traditional
companies, Jay S. Walker, its 46-year-old founder and largest
shareholder, and his lieutenants have turned them into partners and
allies. If he does well, he says, so will Delta Airlines, American
Airlines, AT&AMP;T, A&AMP;P, D'Agostino's, Pathmark, the National and
Budget car rental companies and the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compete against these companies,'' Walker said at his
office. ``We don't seek to own an airline. We don't seek to be a
car dealer. We don't seek to be a grocery store. We don't seek to
be a phone company. We seek to improve the profitability of our
partners rather than cannibalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of conducting auctions with rising bids, Priceline
allows a buyer to propose a price that the seller, whether of
airline tickets or orange juice, can choose to accept or reject.
Translated into Pricelinese, this approach comes out as the slogan
``Name Your Own Price.''
</P>
<P>
   For all Priceline's establishment stripes, what Walker has in
mind is more radical than eBay, pushing a strategy that is becoming
more important throughout e-commerce: partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, when customers call up a Web site, they see a
single entrance to a structure made up of many businesses in a
tangle of alliances and subsidies. Entrepreneurs like Walker
concentrate on what they do best, finding partners for everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We distribute prices, not products,'' Walker said, his bushy
eyebrows rising and falling for emphasis. Priceline, he said, is
demonstrating how the Web can introduce a new series of
relationships between seller and buyer. ``You can't wheel a grocery
cart down the aisle and have AT&AMP;T say, `You know what? I'll pay for
all the meat in your grocery cart if you'll try our long-distance
service for 7 cents a minute.' The Net allows for far richer, far
more customized, instantaneously creative partnering.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Priceline's target is not the customer who wants
favorite grocery brands delivered to the door, who wants to fly
direct flights at reasonable hours and stay in favorite hotels. All
those desires are served well by other companies and Web sites.
Priceline targets the bargain hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Wal-Mart manage to offer low prices partly by using
their size to win special breaks from their suppliers. Walker does
not. He wants sellers to have the flexibility to lower their
prices, then raise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not use our size to try to extract concessionary
prices,'' he said. ``Sellers like us because they can use us to
balance supply and demand in a constantly changing business.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't Walker dishing out some unrealistic bargains? Yes, he
said, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model in every business is subsidize first to build
traffic,'' he said. ``Every business spends money to acquire
customers. It's every grand-opening sale that has ever existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like Henry Blodget, at Merrill Lynch, remain optimistic
about Priceline's prospects, but they also wonder what will happen
when the grand-opening sale ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the
consumers won't be getting such a great deal,'' Blodget said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that Priceline will be able to sustain attractive
discounts. Bidding and buying through Priceline, he said, can
involve a deal with up to five parties: Priceline, the customer, a
retailer like a grocery store, a manufacturer or a service
provider, and the provider of an unrelated service like
long-distance calling or credit cards or magazine subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The issuer of Discover cards, for instance, will add $30 to
Priceline customers' bids for airline tickets if they apply for the
cards. Another $5 from Discover goes to Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate partners are so important to Walker that he often
identifies them, not his online buyers, as his true market, as when
he said, ``We're not here to compete with our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   His office seems like a shrine to those partners-cum-customers.
Against an incongruous background of bookshelves filled with
leather-bound classics, he displays dozens of packages _ Cheerios,
Dove soap, Joy dishwashing detergent _ and model jets.
</P>
<P>
   So strong is Walker's belief in his strategy's distinctiveness
that he has taken out several patents, recorded on plaques that
line a Priceline.com hallway, to protect his business processes. He
has sued Microsoft, maintaining that it has infringed on Priceline,
a contention Microsoft strongly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this strategy will benefit consumers or investors once
consumers exhaust their specials and Wall Street starts demanding
profits is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street's passion remains strong. Though Lauren
Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, raises questions
about how many industries will be receptive to Walker's approach,
she praises the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jay stands apart as a real visionary,'' she said. ``He
isn't just trying to shift market share online, but develop a whole
new business model.''
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline strategy has been applied to hotel rooms, rental
cars, mortgages, groceries, new cars, castoff household appliances
and, as announced just last month, gasoline, but it will not work
everywhere. Given the opportunity to offer name-your-own-terms
credit cards, many major issuers have balked, as have some large
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris and the nation's largest
maker of packaged foods, has also balked. So for the time being,
shoppers who want Kool-Aid, Jell-O, Post cereals, Maxwell House
coffee, Kraft cheeses or Oscar Mayer hot dogs cannot order through
Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not participating,'' said Moyra Knight, a spokeswoman
for Kraft. ``We just need a better understanding of their
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline tickets, the closest thing to a certifiable success for
Priceline, have features that suit the company's strategy, a point
Walker readily confirmed. Airlines have to unload a highly
perishable inventory, seats that would otherwise be empty, at low
prices, without sacrificing revenue from business travelers and
others willing to pay high prices. Priceline allows the airlines to
find travelers willing to accept inconvenient connections and
departure times in return for a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Just as clothing stores do not usually post signs telling
shoppers about their outlets, airlines do not play up their
Priceline partnerships. American Airlines, for example, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But other partners see so many benefits, and so few risks, that
they are happy to voice their praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores like it and the customers seem to be happy,'' said
Nick D'Agostino III, a vice president at D'Agostino Supermarkets
Inc. of New York. Priceline allows his stores to sell groceries
over the Web at no extra cost to them, he said, because the
manufacturers provide the discounts and the customers pick up the
groceries themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Walker came to his big idea in stages. As a student at Cornell
University, he was sued by Parker Brothers to prevent him from
publishing a guide to winning at Monopoly, and watched the weekly
newspaper he started in Ithaca, N.Y., collapse under competition
from a local daily owned by the Gannett Co. chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you become more experienced in business, you learn that
picking a fight is usually the last thing you want to do,'' he
said. ``War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Priceline began operating in April 1998, inviting customers
to propose prices for airline tickets, its diplomacy led to the
signing of only two, relatively meek carriers: TWA and America
West. Securing major airlines as partners took money, in the form
of Priceline shares.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Delta Airlines agreed to sell its tickets on
Priceline's Web site in return for, among other goodies, rights to
buy millions of shares for nearly nothing. Other major airlines
followed, with American and United also receiving Priceline stakes,
although smaller. The total cost to Priceline _ if not in cash, in
the ability to raise it _ is about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way they could have primed the pump without doing
that,'' Blodget said. Walker, saying that such concessions are not
habit forming, said that he has not had to give equity stakes to
any other partners.
</P>
<P>
   And if Priceline initially subsidized the tickets, paying the
airlines more than it was receiving from customers, the company is
paying less now. Marketing expenses, including those television
advertisements with the actor William Shatner, still leave
Priceline with heavy but narrowing losses.
</P>
<P>
   Will the strategy work? The results, so far, are unclear. But it
is a strategy distinct from the backward-looking approaches to
selling over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just catalogs online,'' Walker said. ``That's not
the future of e-commerce.''

 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Early last year, John F. Welch, the chief executive and chairman
of General Electric, set an ambitious goal for the managers of the
huge company's businesses _ establish a strategy for using the
Internet and put it into effect before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of GE's departments, from airplane engines to appliances
to industrial systems, met the goal that the company, long the
leader of the old economy, had set as part of its ferocious battle
to transform itself into a leader of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The company's speedy adaptation would not have been so
remarkable if it were another dot-com start-up or a small computer
company. But General Electric is the world's largest non-technology
company, a manufacturing and financial-services giant with $112
billion in revenue last year and 340,000 employees in about 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Working in teams and sharing information across the company's
global span, GE developed novel ways to do everything from speeding
up the overhaul of jet engines to buying a staple gun.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, GE industrial engineers on three
continents can meet to discuss new products. Customers can go
online to buy GE mutual funds or analyze the cost and benefits of
upgrading the turbines at a generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   GE was not the first manufacturing company to adapt to the Web,
but the lessons it has been learning are more likely to affect the
rest of the industrial sector and beyond. GE has developed much of
its own Web software, but has also hired other companies to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being smart because they are going after the Internet
in a hundred different directions,'' said William J. Fiala, an
analyst at the brokerage firm Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co., in St. Louis.
``They are big enough and rich enough to afford to take their
swings, knowing that they are going to hit a few home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, GE has learned a few things that could apply to
any business interested in the Web. Early on, for instance, the
company determined that simply listing products and services on a
Web site, a technique known as ``brochureware,'' is not very
helpful to customers, said Gary M. Reiner, the senior vice
president who is overseeing the company's Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company has developed interactive Web sites that
allow customers to buy goods and services, track their orders,
compare various products and tap into GE's technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The company also learned that an organizational structure based
on geography should not simply be transferred to a Web site. When
the site for GE's plastics business was unveiled last spring, there
were separate sections for the Americas, Europe and Asia. But
customers did not care about those divisions, so the site was
reorganized by products and services.
</P>
<P>
   One technique GE executives say has worked is the creation of
``wizards'' that enable customers to solve complex problems on the
Web. A design engineer at a manufacturing company, for example, can
log on to the GE plastics site and use a specialized engineering
calculator to determine a polycarbonate's strength, adhesion and
color.
</P>
<P>
   When the GE aircraft-engines business wanted to expand its share
of the maintenance and overhaul market, it adapted diagnostic tools
used on GE medical-imaging equipment to a site that company
executives say has sharply cut the time and cost of engine repairs.
</P>
<P>
   One important decision in overhauling such engines is whether to
retain, rebuild or discard a worn part. In pre-Web days, the part
in question was often sent to the customer to be evaluated before
it was installed, or the repairs had to wait until a customer's
representative could inspect it at GE, processes that could take
days or weeks. Today, a clear picture of the part can be
transmitted over the Internet and quickly evaluated by the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of GE's Internet innovations are aimed at its customers.
The industrial systems business, which supplies equipment to
distribute, operate and control electricity, has developed a
virtual city on the Web where its engineers, who are in 100
countries, can share ideas and information and work on projects
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   When employees go to the site, known as WebCity, they see
three-dimensional images of the city's buildings, including a
library, where information is stored; a university, where training
classes are available; and a factory, where products are developed.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a City Hall, with its own mayor, Chris Fuselier,
who happens to be the general manager of technology for the
industrial systems business. He and his staff, which includes a
``zoning board,'' set the agenda for WebCity. Fuselier, who has
been at GE for 31 years, says the site acts as a tool for tying
together a worldwide business. Tasks that once required airplane
trips and telephone calls across time zones are now accomplished in
less time and at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrangement breaks down barriers of time and location,''
Fuselier said. ``We've gone from a traditional 10-hour workday to
where we are pretty much able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing its Internet strategies, GE is trying to turn the
Web into a profit center as well as a cost cutter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a procurement employee who needs to buy staple guns
can go to a GE site and search for vendors from whom the company
has agreed to buy such items at a predetermined price. The employee
enters the kind and number of guns wanted, and the order is
processed. If the order is big enough to require approval, an
e-mail message is automatically sent to a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner says consultants estimated that the cost of placing an
order used to be $50 to $200, but the cost via the Web site is only
about $1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving money on its own purchases by using the
Web, GE formed a venture with the Thomas Publishing Co. to sell the
service to other businesses. So far, Reiner said, there are about
10 customers, including Boeing and 3M.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its effort to develop e-businesses as alternatives to
traditional brick-and-mortar operations, the company created two
new companies early in March. One of them, GE Global eXchange
Services, will provide Internet data exchange. The other, GE
Systems Services, will provide the operations infrastructure to
support e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring gains in productivity from using the Internet has
proved elusive, as it has for other e-commerce businesses. Fuselier
thinks he and his team from industrial systems have at least part
of the answer. Based on 600 projects that have been completed
during the first five months of WebCity's operation, Fuselier said,
the time it takes to develop a product has been cut 20 percent.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Businesses have discovered the power of the Internet for
communicating with employees and customers quickly through e-mail
or a Web site. Buying automobile parts, selling books or arranging
vacations can also be done efficiently online. Nonprofit
organizations should find the Internet just as appealing. What
better way to reach like-minded advocates, donors and volunteers or
to coordinate services?
</P>
<P>
   The desire is there, but most nonprofit groups have been slow to
pursue it. There are exceptions, most notably the American Red
Cross, which is planning to develop an online system for its blood
banks; and America's Second Harvest is using the Internet to
distribute food more efficiently. But the vast majority of
charitable organizations, while starting to raise money on their
sites, have been hindered by a lack of money, time, workers and
technological savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the struggles we have had for a long time is that
nonprofits are late adopters in terms of technology,'' said Ken
Goldstein, the director of online community development for
HandsNet, a San Jose, Calif., group that advises human-service
organizations about technology. Goldstein is convinced these groups
need to make more use of the Internet, and argues that being online
is becoming akin to being listed in the telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   Most nonprofit groups have a long way to go. Catholic Charities
USA, for example, is the largest private network of social service
agencies in the United States. The charity, located in Alexandria,
Va., works with up to 144 major agencies across the country. But
only a third of those agencies have Web sites. ``This is still an
area where we are trying to bring them along,'' said Jo-Ann Leitch,
a spokeswoman for Catholic Charities. ``It's not where they spend a
lot of their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those furthest behind are the thousands of organizations with
small budgets and limited expertise. ``Most nonprofits are small,
and most small organizations are not networked,'' explained Anthony
Wilhelm, the program director for communications policy for the
Benton Foundation in Washington, D.C., which is active in helping
nonprofit organizations make full use of technology. Many are
unable even to use e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current enthusiasm for the Web to date has focused
on fund-raising. Many charities' sites allow people to make
donations online. The American Red Cross has had significant
success using its site to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in response to the war in Kosovo, the charity raised
$1.2 million from people who logged on to its site. While that
amount was less than 4 percent of the $34 million raised by the Red
Cross during the crisis, it hinted at what many see as the
potential for electronic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But such fund-raising is in its infancy: a survey by Independent
Sector, a Washington, D.C. organization that promotes charitable
giving and volunteerism, found last year that only 1 percent of the
people who gave to charity said they used the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few charities are using the Internet to communicate
with their members or to deliver services. There are notable
exceptions. America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest
charitable hunger-relief organization, which has a network of
nearly 200 food banks, has developed an e-service called
ResourceLink with Hewlett-Packard. The service, begun in October,
enables corporations to log on and provide information about
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be up to date in technology,'' said Deborah Leff,
the president and chief executive of America's Second Harvest,
which is in Chicago. Because so many of its corporate donors use
the Internet to increase efficiency, the charity is exploring how
the medium can help ensure a steady flow of donations and
distribute food more quickly. While some of the agencies the
charity uses do not have access to computers, the hope is that all
the food banks will eventually log on to see if certain available
donations meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ResourceLink has made the gathering of information about
donations much simpler. When Nestle donated about 100,000 pounds of
one of its snacks, for example, it provided the necessary details,
including where the donation was located and whom to contact there
online. America's Second Harvest, which was alerted via e-mail to
the donation, placed the donation with six food banks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to adapt the same process to other kinds of
donations, like clothing or building materials, so that the
Internet can serve as a clearinghouse for large gifts, particularly
from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is also developing its Internet services.
In addition to maintaining a site about disaster relief,
www.disasterrelief.org, the charity has another site that describes
its charitable work, www.redcross.org, which is considered a very
sophisticated charity site.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Red Cross has such far-flung operations, the
Internet is a perfect medium to communicate national policies and
activities to its roughly 1,500 chapters and local units. The
chapters use the Internet to share information about their
successful activities, according to Tom Woteki, the charity's chief
information officer. The Red Cross is also planning an online
system of blood-supply management and delivery that will help
corporations conduct blood drives and allow doctors to use its
blood supplies better.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to be done. ``We haven't really scratched the
surface in building a community of volunteers,'' Woteki said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing community via e-mail, chat rooms and private Web
sites is just happening. Many groups, from Amnesty International to
smaller organizations, understand the potential for the Internet as
an advocacy tool. During the height of recent tobacco litigation,
for example, Tobacco Control Advocates ran a private network for
about two years on which several hundred activists could read daily
news bulletins and receive action alerts, allowing quick access to
the news and helping them to coordinate responses.
</P>
<P>
   And the World Wildlife Fund, whose site, www.worldwildlife.org,
is also among the most advanced, uses the Internet for its
Conservation Action Network. About 15,000 of its 1.2 million
members in the United States receive alerts about news in their
areas of interest and ways in which they can try to effect change.
</P>
<P>
   The fund does not plan to offer a more sophisticated site,
though its members coordinate activities, swap information or plan
strategies in the near future, because maintenance would be too
expensive, said Kathleen Nixon, the director of marketing alliances
for the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have expectations,'' she said. ``We don't have the
resources of Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Many charities are shocked to discover how expensive the
technology is, because the bulk of the costs are ongoing, said
Michael Gilbert, the director of the Internet Nonprofit Center, an
online resource for charities. ``Nonprofits have just started to
understand the total cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many donors, including corporations and foundations, prefer to
see their money go directly to the charity's mission.
``Infrastructure is not the most attractive thing to donors,'' said
Leff, of America's Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Internet may force changes in the philanthropic
world. Unable to afford the technology to raise money, create
change or provide services, charities that have been reluctant to
work together might have to create alliances to pool their
resources. ``To some extent, the Internet is going to force
collaborations,'' said Gilbert, of the Internet Nonprofit Center.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Even if you would never dream of auctioning your old blue jeans
on eBay, the person-to-person auction giant, the site may have
already changed the way you will shop in the future. With 10
million registered users at the beginning of the year, eBay has
made the ``going, going, gone'' mentality an integral part of the
online consumer psyche.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just eBay and other sites like Yahoo and Amazon.com
that are running auctions anymore. With the J.C. Penney Co.'s
announcement in January that it will begin auctioning close-out
goods and excess inventory online this spring, it looks as if major
retailers are deciding to adopt the auction format as part of their
e-commerce strategies.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney isn't the first retailer to go this route _ it's
just the biggest. Over the last year or two, retailers like the
Sharper Image Co. and Lands' End have instituted auction components
as part of their e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hardware and software have also traditionally been a
popular auction product, and niche sites auctioning everything from
wine to repossessed cars to racing pigeons have been cropping up
since Internet time immemorial, which is to say about five years
(eBay was started in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   But J.C. Penney's move validates what analysts have predicted:
auctions are becoming a must-have feature for business-to-consumer
e-commerce. According to Evie Black Dykema, an analyst at Forrester
Research, which studies technology-related markets, J.C. Penney's
decision ``means department stores have started to think of
auctions as part of their retail arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   That means e-commerce could start to look more and more like a
bazaar, at least for some brand-new items.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Last, executive vice president for J.C. Penney's
e-commerce division, explained the thinking behind offering goods
for auction. ``It's customer-friendly, fun and engaging _ that's
the main motivator,'' he said. He echoed a common theme: retail
auctioneers just want to have fun. While business-to-business
auctions may soon involve bigger money, business-to-consumer
auctions are big marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that once consumers have gotten the bidding bug,
they will go to auctions as much for the thrill of the chase as to
obtain an item. The retailers hope they will keep coming back _
even when they want to buy something the old-fashioned way, at full
price.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Hilton, a spokesman for Dellauction.com, which has been
auctioning Dell computer products since July, said that Dell
started its auction site because it was looking for more
interaction with its customers. The more Dell can offer a customer
between systems purchases, ``the more loyal the customer will be,
and we'll hang on to them longer,'' Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sarner, an analyst with the Gartner Group, which
specializes in Internet-related market research _ who acknowledged
that he recently caught auction fever himself and splurged on a
swatch of retro ``Star Wars'' wallpaper on eBay _ said that
business-to-consumer auctions were ``a marketing rather than a
business model.'' But, he added, ``sales and marketing do go hand
in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment factor accounts for some of the splashier
auctions that took place last year, like Amazon's ``Melrose Place''
memorabilia auction. However, the much-touted ``excitement
building'' factor can sometimes be absurd. Sharper Image, for
example, reports selling a $100 gift certificate for more than that
when it went on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, the happy coincidence of such excitement is that
auctions can be a good way to get rid of liquidation items. J.C.
Penney will use its site to auction close-out goods like
electronics, home furnishings and clothing. Retailers hope that
auctions will get them a higher price for surplus goods than the
straight sale-rack approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Lucking-Reiley, a professor of economics at Vanderbilt
University who studies online auctions, said: ``Auctioning
close-out goods makes sense from an economics perspective. If a
retailer has goods that aren't selling for the price they are set
at, it makes sense to put them up for auction, rather than guess
what price to mark them down to, because the retailer could guess
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As department stores and big retailers get ready to take the
auction plunge, auction software and service providers are rushing
to provide them with the kind of branded site they can't get on
eBay. ``The business-to-consumer market was eBay's to lose _ and
they seem, amazingly, like they're going to lose it,'' Dykema said.
``They treat Fortune 500 companies like they were flea-market
stands.'' As a result, she added, big companies are either building
their own sites or having sites built for them.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers running auctions need to generate enough traffic to
make an auction worthwhile, though _ something that is easy to do
on eBay but harder on a single store's site. FairMarket Inc., the
company that is running Dell's auction site and will run J.C.
Penney's, has approached this problem by signing deals to share
items and ``eyeballs'' (potential bidders) across more than 100
sites, including portals like MSN, Excite and Lycos, and retail
sites like Ticketmaster Online.
</P>
<P>
   OpenSite Technologies Inc., a provider of auction software,
recently acquired Bidder's Edge Inc., a so-called auction bot that
scours different auction sites. OpenSite will be able to send
Bidder's Edge traffic to its own retail customers' auctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Dr. Lucking-Reiley says, restaurants may auction
Tuesday-night dinners for less than Friday-night meals, and movie
theaters might auction off seats so that movie houses aren't empty
on sunny Wednesday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   But does all this mean that, in a couple of years, we'll log on
before we go home at night and haggle for the best price for
hamburger meat? The short answer is: Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Perlman, president of Maoi Technologies, an auction
software provider that works mostly with business-to-business
auction sites, said: ``I don't think that when I go to the grocery
store I want to negotiate iceberg lettuce because the convenience
will be more important than the price. You're paying for timing and
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that in the future, computer hardware will
remain a mainstay of the online auction world and that travel
packages, automobiles, apparel and goods like software, flowers,
toys, sporting goods and books should catch up. In most cases,
these items are already being auctioned in pockets on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lucking-Reiley's view may ultimately be the bottom line:
``An economist would say, 'If someone wants to pay for it, it must
be good.'''

BETTER WAYS TO SEARCH THAN TYPING `NEEDLE AND HAYSTACK'

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The modern equivalent of searching for a needle in a haystack is
searching for just about anything on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate this, three very different people were asked to
track down three very different items in a random, completely
unscientific test _ a sort of digital treasure hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this trio of e-commerce guinea pigs followed
similar paths. Each conducted highly focused searches, and at some
stage each used the search engine Yahoo, which could explain why
that company is valued at more than $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, vice president and senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an online research firm, was then enlisted
to comment on the searchers' strategies and offer advice for doing
it better next time. Knowing where to look in the first place, how
to phrase a search term and how to weed through sites returned by
the search engine, she said, are techniques that consumers learn
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: HAWAIIAN SHIRT. Searcher: Alesia Powell of New York.
Clicks: three.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Alesia Powell, 38, has never surfed waves in her life,
and she goes out of her way not to go to stores. So she seemed the
perfect person to assign the task of finding a Hawaiian shirt. It's
not something that she has ever done, or ever would do.
</P>
<P>
   Alesia, who works at CBS Healthwatch, a Web company, started at
Yahoo, typing in ``Hawaiian shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Why there? ``Yahoo was easier and offered a lot more specific
choices,'' she said. ``I always think of Excite afterwards, and I
can never remember the name of Larcos, or is it Lycos?''
</P>
<P>
   Her search returned 10 entries, listed under ``Business and
Economy. Companies. Apparel. Specialty. Hawaiian.'' She chose the
third one on the list: ``Big Kahuna Hawaiian Shirts''
(www.aloha-bigkahuna.com/bkframe.html).
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``The name jumped out at me,'' she said. ``I associated it
with Hawaiian shirts, although the listing above it was for a
company called Aloha, and that's very Hawaiian, I guess. Big Kahuna
just looked interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, however, proved to be not as interesting as its name.
Being a high-end-fabric kind of person, Alesia clicked on one of
five areas offered on the site _ a page pertaining to silk shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These don't look like the classic shirt,'' she said. ``But
then again, I hate Hawaiian shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting to note: using ``Hawaiian shirts,'' plural, turned
up a different set of shops from ``Hawaiian shirt,'' singular.
</P>
<P>
   Though it didn't happen in this case, nuances in keywords often
trip up Web surfers, Vanderbilt noted. Our search expert added,
``The more tenured online users have a better sense of how to
construct the right keyword searches.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Watch your search terms. Try a plural if
singular does not yield what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: CHERRY RED 1965 MUSTANG. Searcher: Brian Stelter of
Damascus, Md. Clicks: seven.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to search for a classic car than a youngster who does
not have his driver's license yet? I asked my online pen pal, Brian
Stelter, 14, to shop for a cherry red '65 Mustang because he's more
into computers than cars, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Brian started on eBay. ``I thought I had gotten lucky when I
read a listing for '1965 Dark Cherry Red Mustang convertible,''' he
wrote in an e-mail report. ``But I was mistaken: it was only a toy
model.''
</P>
<P>
   He then reverted to Alesia's search engine of choice, Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt commented that Yahoo has ``done a good job of
building a brand that means 'Come here to find what you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   For this search, however, that didn't turn out to be the case:
the site led Brian to two Canadian companies selling classic
Mustang replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tried another search site, AltaVista, which steered him
to the ``Classic Mustang Message Board''
(www.metromustang.com/classic/wwwboard.htm). Brian reports: ``I
began to hit pay dirt here. '65 Mustang needs good home,' one
message read.'' But no red.
</P>
<P>
   Another site on AltaVista contained car trivia and reprints of
Ford brochures, and another contained links to 22 chapters of the
Mustang Club of America. Still another took Brian to posters of the
elusive car.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring plain old classifieds were his best bet, he clicked on
something called ``Statewide Car Connection''
(www.carbuyer.com/moreinfo.phtml?key(EQ)113332&AMP;s(EQ)stw), which had
also appeared in his AltaVista search.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, he turned up three Mustangs of the appropriate
vintage and color.
</P>
<P>
   Which one would Brian buy, if he had his druthers and the
appropriate papers? He may be young, but he is pragmatic: ``I would
buy the first one I found, the one with the fire painted on it.
It's cheapest and looks the nicest, plus it's sitting only an hour
away from where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Sometimes the best place to look is the most
obvious. As Vanderbilt said, ``What the unique products have going
for them is, if they're tough to find on the Internet, they are
even harder to find off-line.''
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: HAMMOCK. Searcher: Vince Napoli of Boca Raton, Fla.
Clicks: six.
</P>
<P>
   A New Yorker who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., my dad, Vince,
66, is not a hammock sort of person. He hardly sits still. That's
why I assigned him the task of finding the ultimate relaxation
device.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, started with Yahoo, clicking on the search engine's
shopping area. ``They found 451 products in 83 stores,'' he
reported. Some of the hammocks were not the classic backyard
variety. The search page featured a cat hammock and a ferret
hammock, as well as a hammock for fruit, alligators and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four hammock merchants listed, Dad looked at all and
settled on Nicamaka from Nicaragua
(http://store.yahoo.com/buyhammocks/bluebecouphamm.html) for much
the same reason that Alesia chose the store she did: it just felt
right.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The site was easy to get around and has good
information and visuals for the products they sell. It lists all
kinds of hammocks for land and boats. And they have a shopping cart
for easy order and list their regular and sales prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Alesia and Vince both responded to sites that
simply caught their eyes ``points to an absence of really good
comparison shopping,'' Vanderbilt said.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce merchants and Web portals need to be more mindful of
the challenges faced by consumers in conducting a search, and
search engines need to provide deeper data for consumer
decision-making, she said. It takes more than a strong first
impression to drive consumers to a site.
</P>
<P>
   Though fabric hammocks turned out to be more expensive than
rope, Vince said he would opt for the former, particularly a
five-stripe model built for two, for $198.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it wouldn't sag after use,'' he said, citing
photographs of people in rope hammocks who appear to be scraping
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Virtual shopping is often based on visceral
reactions, just as it is in the brick-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript
</P>
<P>
   While all three searches were successful, Vanderbilt points out
that the e-commerce guinea pigs were engaged in a very particular
type of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Such focused searches _ ``intended'' shopping, in industry
parlance _ are what the Web supports best, she said: ``Where
there's huge e-commerce growth opportunity is in changing shopping
behavior and increasing impulse purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher bandwidth will help encourage more people to simply
browse for merchandise online, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that coming soon to a computer near you is the
digital equivalent of the checkout-counter tchotchke?

AHEAD TO THE PAST: DENNIS QUAID ON `FREQUENCY' 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Dennis Quaid
in a scene from ``Frequency.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Call him the reluctant sci-fi guy.
 &HT;    ``It's just not something I seek out,'' Dennis Quaid says. ``I
have done some sci-fi, but I am more interested in the human
aspects of a story. That's what really gets me.
 &HT;    ``You can use sci-fi as a means of telling a good story,'' he
says. ``And that's worked for several of my films.''
 &HT;    Among the actor's genre films are the based-on-real-life ``The
Right Stuff,'' ``Innerspace,'' ``Enemy Mine'' and the
sword-and-sorcery epic ``Dragonheart.'' Now add to that list the
time-tripping drama ``Frequency,'' which will open nationwide on
April 28.
 &HT;    Set in 1999, ``Frequency'' finds sullen cop John Sullivan (Jim
Caviezel) suddenly able to communicate with his late father Frank
(Quaid) _ via ham radio during an aurora borealis _ 30 years in the
past, on the day before the firefighter perished in a blaze. John
warns Frank of what's to come, and the next day Frank is still
alive in 1999.
 &HT;    But now his mother (Elizabeth Mitchell) is dead, and John and
Frank _ with Frank in 1969 and John in 1999 _ must race to set
things right.
 &HT;    ``For me, the movie is about playing God with your own
destiny,'' Quaid says over lunch at New York's Regency Hotel. The
actor is tan and rested, and looks lean in blue jeans and a white
T-shirt. ``I liked the aspect of communicating across time with a
loved one _ I found that really fantastic. Then it's got the
father-son bonding, some action and this murder mystery going on.
So the movie has a lot going for it.''
 &HT;    To pull off his role, Quaid relied a great deal on director
Gregory Hoblit's guidance and screenwriter Toby Emmerich's
dialogue. He also tapped into his relationship with his own father
and son.
 &HT;    ``I brought both of those things to the table,'' Quaid says.
``My son was 6 at the time we were shooting, which was the same age
as my son in the 1969 portion of the film. My father is no longer
here, but I talk to him in my head. I think we all do that. There's
a yearning for that.''
 &HT;    As for his earlier genre stints, the actor describes ``Enemy
Mine'' as a particularly tough film to make.
 &HT;    ``Another day, another special effect,'' he says of the film
that paired him with Louis Gossett Jr. as a human and an alien,
hereditary enemies, forced to cooperate on a hostile planet.
 &HT;    He met his future wife, Meg Ryan, and befriended funnyman Martin
Short while filming ``Innerspace,'' a sci-fi comedy he considers
``hugely underrated.''
 &HT;    ``Dragonheart,'' though he considers it a good film, was
difficult because of the challenge of acting opposite an invisible
dragon, who was added later through digital magic.
 &HT;    ``Basically,'' the actor says, ``I remember talking to three
tennis balls the whole time.''
 &HT;    Quaid's career has had more ups and downs than a tennis ball at
the U.S. Open. He's been in hits and flops and, at times, teetered
on the brink of losing his leading-man status. Just as quickly,
however, he has recovered. There's been a ``The Big Easy'' for
every ``Jaws 3-D'' and an ``Any Given Sunday'' for every
``Switchback.''
 &HT;    Along the way, Quaid _ who will next co-star in ``Traffic,''
director Steven Soderbergh's soon-to-shoot ensemble film _ has
developed a reputation as an underrated actor. Which, he says, is
something he tries not to fret about.
 &HT;    ``I try not to live my life that way,'' he says. ``Anybody could
feel that way. That could be an insatiable thirst, to start looking
for approval from other places.
 &HT;    ``I'm pretty secure in the talent I've got,'' he adds. ``I'm
good at what I do. I think I've always kind of believed that.''
 &HT;    So, even if he could go back in time and change the past ...
 &HT;    ``I think we all wonder `What if' about our lives,'' the actor
says. ``What if I'd gotten up an hour earlier today? What if I had
graduated college?
 &HT;    ``In the end,'' Quaid says, ``I don't think I'd change a thing
about my life. If you change something you didn't like about your
life, you also could be changing a lot of what you did like about
it.''

&HT;     MAN WHO INTEGRATED THE MASTERS STILL SEES FEW MINORITY PROS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It has been 25 years since Lee Elder integrated
the Masters, palms sweating as he made his way up Magnolia Lane for
the first time to enter a club that he had always considered to be
racist.
</P>
<P>
   By now, he would have figured to be entitled to utter some
cliche like ``We've come a long way, baby'' or ``How sweet it is.''
But when he rolled in from his Florida home to commemorate the
anniversary with an honor-filled weekend at Augusta National, it
occurred to him that the more things change, the more they stay the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around, he saw just two minorities, Tiger Woods and
Notah Begay III, an American Indian, in a field of 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see any (more) on the horizon,'' said Elder,
65, who played in the Masters six times after first qualifying with
a victory in the 1974 Monsanto Open. ``I've been to quite a number
of colleges around the country, and I really do not see any. ...
Yes, it is (disappointing). I would have thought that we would have
had more on the tour playing and more that would have won golf
tournaments by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, of course, is winning enough golf tournaments to carry
the entire human race. He has three titles in only seven events,
and has won seven of his last 11 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a lot of other guys that I'm close with, and I've
been pulling for some time,'' Elder said. ``Hal Sutton is one and
so is Davis Love. ... But no doubt about it, I think the man to
beat is Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods recognizes the contributions of Elder and even those who
came before him, saying, ``They broke the barriers and knocked the
walls down. From there, it's up to us to keep doing what we're
doing, keep being positive role models and keep aspiring to get
other people who are minorities in the world to play this great
game of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods certainly does his part, through youth clinics presented
around the country by his foundation. And 18 PGA Tour victories
likely have an impact as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee Elder National Youth Program is in 10 cities now, and
the PGA Tour and other governing bodies of golf are still at work
on the First Tee initiative to provide golf lessons in inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The going has been slow and so has been the progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we had a nationally recognized junior program, you
would have more country clubs that would open their doors to the
minorities and to the blacks to come play,'' Elder said, ``but we
do not have a recognized program to show that we're trying to help
these youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, the majority of the kids now get their training through
college, and the majority of our (black) colleges do not have, say,
your top teaching professionals. ... And you can't learn anything
from an instructor when you probably know more about golf than he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most elite and expensive golf clubs still have no
black members. Woods did not come into the game through the country
club's front door; he grew up on the public and military courses of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the road most traveled by a member of the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to prepare ourselves to compete on the
good golf courses or the courses we'd be competing on the regular
tour,'' Elder noted. ``We'd have to play in public facilities or
dig a hole out in the field someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Elder had thought about boycotting the Masters in 1975, and
talked to a few friends about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I felt I would not be accomplishing anything by
running away from it,'' he said Wednesday night. Moments earlier,
he received two standing ovations and a special award from the Golf
Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant moment for golf, which never before treated
Elder as its Jackie Robinson. He remembered walking in the rain out
of the clubhouse, under the ancient oak to the first tee that dull,
miserable day in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as soon as I got to the tee, the sun came through,'' he
said. ``And I remember thinking, maybe this is why God put me
here.''

 &HT;     DIPLOMATIC DiMAGGIO STRIKES OUT A LAWYER  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dom DiMaggio is a famously nice guy, as outgoing
as his late brother Joe was private.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't want to get this former Red Sox center fielder
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg has gotten Dom DiMaggio very angry.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dom was boiling that Engelberg, the executor of
Joe's estate, is threatening to sue San Francisco in the name of
the DiMaggio family if the city renames the North Beach Playground
in honor of Joe, instead of renaming something big like the Bay
Bridge, the airport or a gift horse's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged. He's intimating that I've been involved in
what's going on,'' said DiMaggio, when I called him at his home in
Florida. ``I have been treated as a complete stranger. As an
individual and a human being, I'm ashamed at what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg has said he's speaking for the family, but he hasn't
talked to the most famous living DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not represent me,'' said Dom, who has let his feelings
be known to city officials. ``I've sat by long enough. I think I'm
affected now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Paul DiMaggio (known as ``The Little Professor'' because
of his glasses and articulate manner of speaking) had an impressive
career batting average of .298 over 11 seasons with the Boston Red
Sox, and played with great grace, like his more famous brother.
</P>
<P>
   He's proud of having learned to play ball with his brothers on
that little playground, and thinks it would be wonderful to name it
after Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we lived only a block from there,'' he said. ``We
played there morning, noon and night. We even jumped over the fence
on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom said he'd like to see future major leaguers learn to play
ball in a playground named for his brother Joe.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, San Francisco could call it ``DiMaggio
Playground'' for Dom. The man has a lot of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had my admiration. He supported us from day one,
but wanted to keep a low profile,'' said city Supervisor Gavin
Newsom, who has led San Francisco's efforts to find a DiMaggio
memorial. ``What I like is his deep love and admiration for the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Engelberg, what can you say?
</P>
<P>
   There are some parts of San Francisco worthy of naming after
him, if we haven't cleaned up all our toxic waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates' biggest innovation: Use the word ``innovation'' as
many times as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a public letter printed in newspapers Wednesday after the
antitrust decision against Microsoft, Gates used the word
``innovation'' three times, as well as ``innovate,'' ``innovative''
and ``innovating'' one time each.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a techie friend what technical innovations Microsoft had
ever made and all he could think of was an elegant little operating
system for the old Tandy 100 portable computers. Even Microsoft's
business practices are less than innovative, having been developed
by moguls born 100 years before Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't care how innovative Microsoft is. They care
how Microsoft stock is doing, and my bet is that it will continue
to perform better than those ``innovative'' Microsoft products.

`RULES' TO LIVE BY: COURT-MARTIAL DRAMA HITS JUST SHY OF ITS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones should have been
evangelists; each, when riled, has a stentorian tone that could
convert the most recalcitrant sinner. They have the power to
persuade, and they can elevate a movie simply by convincing you
that what you're seeing is better than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Director William Friedkin and his casting director scored quite
a coup, then, by snagging Jackson and Jones for ``Rules of
Engagement,'' a military court-martial drama with inevitable echoes
of ``Courage Under Fire'' and ``A Few Good Men.'' The movie is
well-meaning and entertaining, but a bit shallow, setting its
targets up a little too obviously in its questioning of how much
violence is too much in a combat situation. But its stars make it
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is introduced as a hero, Col. Terry Childers, a 30-year
Marine veteran of Vietnam, Beirut and the Persian Gulf War. His
heroism comes into question during a rescue mission at the U.S.
Embassy in Yemen, where the ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his
family are under siege. After helping the Americans escape,
Childers orders his troops to open fire on a large group of
anti-American protesters, killing more than 80, including children.
The question is, did the protesters shoot first, or was Childers
demonstrating recklessness under fire?
</P>
<P>
   Childers maintains that he acted within the rules of engagement,
which provide guidelines concerning when to fire upon an enemy. But
the government sets him up as a fall guy, and this is where the
movie starts derailing, as Childers starts looking like the victim
of a conspiracy and the movie begins stacking the deck. The
ambassador's family turn its back on him, and a nefarious national
security adviser (Bruce Greenwood at his most skulky) destroys
evidence that could clear his name. The only guy who stands by
Childers is Jones' character, Col. Hays Hodges, whom Childers hires
as his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   It must've fulfilled someone's dream to put Jones and Jackson in
a courtroom situation, where both could give double meaning to
``testifying''! And it's thrilling to watch the two actors in
action, whether Jackson is barking back at someone who's cornered
him or Jones is growling someone into inadvertently admitting a
lie. But the courtroom setting limits the movie, confining it to
trial-drama rules of objections and revelations, which isn't much
of a surprise when you discover that screenwriter Stephen Gaghan
was once a staff writer for TV's ``The Practice.'' ``L.A.
Confidential's'' Guy Pearce, speaking for no accountable reason in
a New Yawk bruiser accent, adds to the familiarity as an ambitious
and intractable prosecuting attorney.
</P>
<P>
   This may be Friedkin's best movie in years _ it's certainly his
most high- profile _ but that's not saying much for a director who
hasn't had a sizable hit since 1973's ``The Exorcist.'' Friedkin's
seldom one for subtlety, and his knack for sledgehammering shows in
``Rules of Engagement,'' when he portrays the massacre scene in all
its bloody agony _ and then repeats it, in detail, in flashback.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin has assembled some top-notch talent for this, including
veteran cinematographer William Fraker, ``Saving Private Ryan''
adviser Dale Dye (who appears in a supporting role) and composer
Mark Isham (who provides the requisite martial snare-drum
soundtrack). But Friedkin's biggest success is with his two stars;
with Jackson and Jones working at full throttle, the rest is just
gravy.

   WORLD-BANK-PROTESTS (Washington) _ Four months after paralyzing
Seattle's meeting of the World Trade Organization, dozens of
protest groups will soon arrive here to make life miserable for two
other multinational financial institutions: the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. The protesters want them to forgive
many nations' debts, pay more attention to the environment and
provide loans that directly help people rather than corporations.
The April 16 and 17 meetings will bring together financial
officials from 182 nations. By MARK HELM.

   AIDS-FUNDING (Washington) _ Lawmakers may change the way the
federal government distributes $1.6 billion for AIDS care and
prevention. Instead of giving the money just to those with AIDS
cases, they are considering a plan to give part of it also to
people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. By JUDY HOLLAND.

REDUCE TAX REFUNDS TO SAVE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HIELSCHER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Millions of Americans could give themselves a
raise of $140 or more a month through some simple tweaking on their
pay stubs, say tax experts.
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers say that too many taxpayers withhold too much
for federal income taxes, giving the government free use of their
money for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   As the April 17 filing deadline approaches, and with many early
filers already receiving their tax refunds, accountants say now is
the perfect time to review how much money is withheld from your
paycheck and to make changes to reduce the size of that refund.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many taxpayers love to get that check from the U.S.
Treasury every year. For some, it's a form of enforced savings,
money put aside that they would probably spend if it were
available.
</P>
<P>
   But that money could be put to better use over the course of the
year, say through interest-earning savings or to pay off debts that
are generating more interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give the government your money interest-free?'' asked
Linda Lindsay, an accountant and enrolled agent with Howard &AMP; Co.
of Sarasota Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of the 127 million taxpayers will get
refunds this year, according to the IRS. Through March 17, some
47.3 million taxpayers had received $80.6 billion in refunds, an
average of $1,705 per check.
</P>
<P>
   Even the IRS doesn't understand why so many people prefer to get
their hands on that money later than right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank you for letting us use your money all year,'' joked
Bob Firman, an IRS spokesman in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Firman said that most taxpayers can adjust their tax withholding
allowance so they either owe a small tax at year end or receive a
modest refund. Employees can file a new W-4 form with their
employer and increase their allowances to lower the taxes withheld.
On the other hand, if your tax burden is too high, you can file for
fewer allowances so more taxes are taken out of each paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that any employee who got a large refund this
year fill out a new W-4 with their employer and adjust their
withholding exemptions,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   The W-4 form contains several worksheets. One projects the
federal income tax liability for the year. A second worksheet
estimates the total withholding and compares it to the projected
tax.
</P>
<P>
   If you are having too little withheld, it is probably because
you work more than one job; have a spouse who works; have income
not subject to withholding, such as capital gains, interest,
dividends or rental income; or owe other taxes such as
self-employment or household employment.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer cannot withhold enough additional tax from your
pay, you may need to make estimated tax payments. The IRS expects
such payments on a quarterly basis, and accountants say taxpayers
can be subject to penalties if they don't pay it on that income.
</P>
<P>
   The W-4 form has a line allowing taxpayers to add an additional
amount taken from each paycheck. Suppose you just estimated your
2000 tax at $5,000, and your withholding will be $4,700. To cover
that $300, the taxpayer can request having $8 more withheld from
each weekly paycheck ($300 divided by the 38 remaining weeks of
this year) so no tax will be owed.
</P>
<P>
   A big refund check this year probably means you are having too
much tax withheld. Your current withholding also may be too high if
your adjustments, deductions or credits will increase significantly
this year, or if you qualify for new tax credits this year.
</P>
<P>
   The child credit, new for the 1998 tax year and increased to
$500 for 1999, bumped up tax refunds for millions of taxpayers, and
most haven't factored that into their regular withholding.
Education credits, mortgage interest deductions for new homeowners,
and child-care credits also are often forgotten when figuring out
proper withholding.
</P>
<P>
   The W-4 form includes a worksheet for figuring how projected
itemized deductions and other adjustments can be factored into your
personal allowances. A separate worksheet for single people who
work more than one job, or for married couples with at least two
jobs between them, can add even more allowances.
</P>
<P>
   Firman said that many employed taxpayers with uncomplicated
returns can adjust their withholding so their tax liability or
refund could be under $100 every year.

 &HT;    By ignoring census, we hurt ourselves
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Public response to the Census Bureau's nationwide
mailing is well below the agency's ambitious target of 70 percent
of forms returned. That's a big disappointment on two counts.
</P>
<P>
   First, it means the 2000 census will be more expensive than it
needs to be. Beginning next week, the bureau's nose-counters will
be forced to go door-to-door trying to account for those who failed
to mail in their forms. Each 1 percent of U.S. households that
failed to respond to the census inquiries costs taxpayers an
estimated $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   More distressing, it means all too many of our fellow Americans
either don't care about or actually chafe at their obligations as
U.S. citizens to cooperate in this once-in-a-decade,
constitutionally mandated exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that chafing has been expressed in complaints about the
``intrusive'' questions on the census long form, a huffiness
encouraged by politicians posing as anti-Washington populists. Both
the complainers and the pols have short memories. The questions
differ only slightly from previous census queries, and are actually
fewer in number this time around. Members of Congress had ample
opportunity to modify the questions two years ago, and nobody
squawked then.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, every one of the questions was required by an act
of Congress or a court ruling. Why does Uncle Sam want to know if
respondents have indoor plumbing? Because if enough people in a
community don't use a sewage or septic system, that information
could help pinpoint areas of ground water contamination. Why is
Washington asking about people with disabilities? Because the
information is useful in planning appropriate services.
</P>
<P>
   Census participation rates are especially low in the South, in
part perhaps because of lingering suspicions about Washington's
motives and the uses to which it might put the census data. If
people succeed in evading the count, however, they also succeed in
denying themselves and their fellow Southerners a fair share of
federal funding and representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't answer, they don't get the money,'' Newsday (N.Y.)
columnist Marie Cocco wrote this week about Southerners' poor
showing on the census. ``That would mean more for everybody else.
And that would be an exquisitely just outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for her part of the country, but not ours.

&HT;     THE TRIBULATIONS OF PRE-MARITAL STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JESSICA BARBARO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Valentine's Day on a little Caribbean island. The
ring sparkled. The steel-drum band played. The engagement got off
to a hip start. The biggest decision was SPF 10 or 15.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half in the distance, the wedding seemed like a
vague, groovy daydream. I imagined a salsa band, a black cocktail
dress. The bride, margarita in hand, working the room. Feasting on
sushi and spring rolls. Everybody dancing. A foolish sun-baked
dream.
</P>
<P>
   A little background. My wedding nightmare starts like this: The
bride, swaddled in tulle, is a vision that Glinda the Good Witch
threw up on as she sashays down the aisle. She is froofy _ think
Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man. She wears what my mother calls ``one of
those veils that looks like a huge bird landed on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   She sports a bejeweled tiara and has relocated a colony of
oysters around her neck. She clutches four dozen of something
called ``sweetheart'' roses arranged in the shape of a heart.
Baring $3,000 worth of orthodonture at her 400 nearest and dearest,
she makes her way to the altar. Queen for a day, baby.
</P>
<P>
   I never wanted to star in one of these productions. But faster
than an ice cube melting in a rum drink, it snuck up on me.
</P>
<P>
   A month after uttering the word ``yes,'' my little soiree has
morphed into a traditional church ceremony and a reception for 150.
And yes, a white dress. There is talk of a videographer.
</P>
<P>
   I was informed immediately upon our return that unless my
groovemaster reception was to take place in a fire hall, I had
better get moving. Ha! I intended to plan my wedding in a leisurely
fashion. A lazy Sunday drive here and there to look at reception
spots in springtime. Let the nervous nellies get their veils in a
bunch. Not me.
</P>
<P>
   A few casual phone calls later, the dread set in. The summer of
2001 was already heavily booked. A Saturday night in June? Muffled
howls of laughter from the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The process of setting a date seemed like it would be a
sentimental process, blithely selecting a meaningful day to do the
deed.
</P>
<P>
   The date actually is chosen from a catering manager's planner.
Then it's a race to find out if the priest is available, how
precariously near the horse racing season you are, and whether
there are any available hotel rooms within a day's drive.
</P>
<P>
   Love is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings come from friends, acquaintances, colleagues. My
relationship, they caution, is in imminent peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worst wedding fight was over which stamps to put on the
invitations,'' said one friend. ``She wanted the `love' stamps and
I said that was too much of a clichi _ I wanted the fruit stamps. I
simply would not cave in. It was a major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridal magazines and Web sites devote large amounts of space to
how to deal with wedding, and if you can believe it,
engagement-related stress. ``A complete guide to dealing with the
in-laws.'' Articles on yoga and acupuncture and good nutrition to
help you through these trying times. How peaceful deep breathing
can help you avoid snarling at his parents. How not to kill a
well-meaning groom who thinks it would be cool to match his
cummerbund to the bridesmaids' dresses. Who were these angry
brides? I started waiting to turn into this kind of she-devil
werewolf.
</P>
<P>
   Engagement stress? People have entirely too much free time on
their hands when these are the trials we face. I'm all for going
back to the times when people had real concerns to stress about _
like gathering enough berries to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
   When a wedding consisted of crowning the bride with some dried
leaves and rustling up some fish from the stream for a feast.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all about the petite Beef Wellingtons and the rolled
fondant latticework atop the cake.
</P>
<P>
   But even though I'm not one of those women who is ga-ga for a
girly wedding, my betrothed points out that I have my whole life to
wear black. That most of our relatives probably hate sushi. And,
God willing, that we're only gonna make that walk once.
</P>
<P>
   And he tricked me into agreeing to wear a white wonder by saying
he wants to show me off to the world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm toast.

CRITICS SAY GOOD-GUY PHILIP MORRIS ADS DON'T FIT THE
CIGARETTE-MAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March 1990, the skies above Elba, Ala., opened and 16 inches
of rain fell in a few days. A nearby levee broke during the deluge,
and most of the homes and businesses in the town of 4,500 were
swamped in 12 feet of water. Relief poured in from across the
Southeast. A few hours' drive away, in Albany, Ga., a Miller
Brewing plant stopped bottling beer, and began bottling water to
assist the stricken place.
</P>
<P>
   But then you already knew that, at least if you've gone anywhere
near a television in the last five months. Since the fall, a
ubiquitous national ad campaign sponsored by mammoth
cigarette-maker Philip Morris Co. has trumpeted such altruism. The
spots are slick and heart-rending, reminding the world how the
world's largest cigarette company and its subsidiaries, like Miller
Beer, have helped flooded towns or, in the case of other ads,
victims of domestic violence and the home-bound elderly.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the campaign seems a cynical attempt to obscure
the fundamental reality of Philip Morris, which a recent article in
Business Week magazine termed ``arguably the most reviled
corporation in America.'' With its huge market share in the
cigarette industry, the article said, the manufacturers of Marlboro
could be blamed for 200,000-smoking related deaths a year. In
recent years, the company has paid billions to various states for
the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. Multimillion-dollar
court verdicts against Philip Morris and its tobacco brethren are
bound to pile up. That is a lot to obscure.
</P>
<P>
   But where Philip Morris is concerned, there is a competing
reality. There is a compelling basis for the ad campaign. For
decades, Philip Morris has been among the world's most
philanthropic companies, giving away millions to fight hunger,
support the arts, fund scholarships for minorities, and combat
domestic violence, to name just a few of its endeavors. Such
generosity was a corporate benchmark long before its major product
became the source of its current public-relations nightmare,
company observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's many opponents, to be sure, are not fooled by the
Philip Morris philanthropy or the ad campaign that promotes it, an
effort costing the company roughly $100 million a year. While
``good neighbor'' ads fill the airways, Philip Morris continues to
promote cigarettes in ways that appeal to young people, such as
buying ads in glitzy magazines, opponents say. Philip Morris is
also ``flooding the political system with millions of dollars in
campaign contributions and soft money, contributions designed to
get politicians to look the other way,'' says Matthew Myers, of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small price to pay to continue to make billions of
dollars selling cigarettes to kids,'' Myers says.
</P>
<P>
   But to some observers, cigarette-manufacturing on the one hand,
and a long philanthropic history on the other, is a bewildering
paradox.
</P>
<P>
   For a Business Week piece last November, writer John A. Byrne
was given unprecedented access to Philip Morris executives and
company headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne saw ashtrays built into granite walls outside elevators on
every floor. (The headquarters has the city's only exemption to a
New York smoking ban.) Wooden boxes filled with cigarettes adorn
conference tables. At the end of each day, Byrne, a nonsmoker,
emerged from the headquarters feeling ill, and smelling like an
ashtray. Yet he also tells this story:
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEO (Geoffrey Bible) is a devout Catholic. One day he's
coming to work and he heard the Harlem Boys Choir was in financial
trouble and might have to disband,'' Byrne says. ``He went in and
insisted Philip Morris give a huge donation, a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost impossible to reconcile,'' Byrne said. ``There's
no simple, clean answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company's research indicated a public
relations problem that transcended its tobacco products. Philip
Morris polls showed that only a small percentage of the public was
aware that the company also owned Miller Brewing and Kraft Foods,
or had long been a corporate leader in charitable giving, or had
programs to combat the use of tobacco and alcohol by minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to do something to educate or inform the
general public about who we are,'' says Jim Spector, a Philip
Morris vice president. ``Part of what we are is a tobacco company.
We're not trying to hide that. What we're trying to do is give a
more complete picture about what this corporation is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the advertising blitz that began last October, a campaign
designed by the Leo Burnett agency of Chicago. Even Spector
concedes the irony of that choice, for in 1954, it was to that same
advertising firm that Philip Morris turned for help during another
watershed moment in the corporation's history.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company's Malboro brand had been a
premium-priced women's cigarette. The company, lagging well behind
other cigarette makers, wanted to change Malboro's image and
broaden its appeal to all age groups and both sexes, according to
the memoir of a former Philip Morris executive named Joseph
Cullman. After a meeting with Philip Morris executives, it was
Burnett who devised the red top to a flip-up Malboro box. More
importantly, it was Burnett's idea to employ the American cowboy as
Marlboro's new symbol.
</P>
<P>
   More than any single factor, creation of the Marlboro Man
propelled the brand into the bestselling cigarette in the world,
and made Philip Morris the most successful cigarette maker.
Opponents also argue that the Malboro Man has contributed to _ and
continues to bear blame for _ an inestimable number of
smoking-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the Malboro campaign, more children smoke the
Malboro brand than all other cigarettes combined,'' says Myers, of
the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``That has remained unchanged.
Sixty percent of kids who smoke smoke Marlboro. The western, cowboy
image is the perfect image for the adolescent boy or girl. It's a
virile, strong, independent, good-looking rebellious image. It is
everything that an adolescent isn't and wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector said using the Burnett firm for the new campaign opened
Philip Morris to further criticism. But he said the agency came
back with the strongest advertising plan and hired a new team to
produce the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not dealing with the tobacco end of the agency's
business,'' Spector said. ``And they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The result have been spots like those that have made Elba a
tourist destination. The local sheriff seen on TV, and a grizzled
old codger in the courthouse square, are really actors. But a dozen
residents of the town make an appearance in the ad, including a
group of young Elba boys jumping from a dock into water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They helped out greatly,'' Elba Mayor James Grimes says of
Miller, sounding as if he could have had a role in the commercial
himself. ``They brought a truckload of water over here and stacked
it up on the courthouse square. They stopped bottling beer so they
could bottle water.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention of cigarettes, heart disease and lung cancer are absent
from the Elba spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, when you look at their actions, instead of their
ads, it's the same old tobacco industry,'' says Myers, the tobacco
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But Elba residents testify to a more complicated corporate
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke,'' says Kaye Whitworth, executive director of
the Elba Chamber of Commerce. ``I don't like to be around smoking.
It stinks. If they never made another cigarette, I would not care.
But I don't have to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say how much we appreciate what they did for us,''
Whitworth says. ``They really came to our rescue. They truly did.
That's the only water we had.''

ENERGY DEPARTMENT SAYS GAS WILL BE CHEAPER BY SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department sharply revised its
predictions about gasoline prices Thursday, saying that the worst
will soon be over and that by the summer vacation season fuel will
be a little cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide average has been hovering around $1.52 a gallon
for regular unleaded, but it should soon decline to $1.46 and stay
there through the summer, then slide to $1.39 by September, the
department's Energy Information Administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That forecast is starkly different from what the administration
said just four weeks ago, when it predicted a national average of
$1.56 for a gallon of regular unleaded this summer and said prices
would probably not start to go down until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's slightly rosier forecast was attributed to the recent
decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
step up production. The Energy Information Administration projected
that the additional supply would pull down the price of imported
crude oil, from the current level of about $27 a barrel to $25 by
June, then to $23.50 by the end of 2000 and $21.50 by the end of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   But all these predictions are based on the assumption that
conditions in the Middle East will remain stable. If there is a war
(as there have been before between OPEC members), or an oil
embargo, or if OPEC decided to turn down the spigot again, gasoline
prices could soar.
</P>
<P>
   Several other caveats must be observed. The nationwide average
for a gallon of regular unleaded is virtually meaningless in
high-cost regions, especially California, which requires
cleaner-burning, and therefore more expensive, gasoline. Prices in
California have been $2 or more a gallon in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   American drivers with good short-term memories may recall that
they were paying an average of 53 cents a gallon more last month
for regular unleaded than they were in March 1999, and that last
summer's average was only $1.17 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   But drivers with good long-term memories may recall that today's
prices are about 40 percent below what they were in March 1981,
after adjusting for inflation. They may recall that the same amount
of gasoline that cost $10 in 1984 cost only $10.19 in July 1999,
when prices were much lower than they are now.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On cue at the Palm Beach International
Film Festival, director William Friedkin, producer Richard Zanuck
and stars Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson all said the right
upbeat, bullish things about their imminent military courtroom
drama. After seeing the cliche-riddled, slow-moving ``Rules of
Engagement,'' though, you will wonder whether this is really the
movie they were referring to.
</P>
<P>
   There is promise in the early scenes, starting with a brief
prologue in 1968 Vietnamese swamps, a visceral, blood- and
mud-spattered combat sequence in which Terry Childers (Jackson)
saves the life of a wounded Hayes Hodges (Jones). The movie then
fast-forwards to 1996, to a scene of pomp and camaraderie over
Hodges' retirement from the Marines. He goes fishing, while
Childers returns to duty aboard ship in the Indian Ocean. Once
there, he receives emergency orders to head to Yemen and rescue the
besieged U.S. ambassador (Ben Kingsley), who is contending with an
angry protest against our presence in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin draws unmistakable parallels between the chaos of
Vietnam combat and the embassy attack, where a rattled Childers
orders his men to fire into the crowd of demonstrators. The
ambassador gets helicoptered out to safety, but when no weapons are
found on the dead protesters, the government suddenly needs a
scapegoat. So _ let's have a show of hands _ who gets charged with
83 counts of murder? And which rusty lawyer who owes Childers his
life will be called out of retirement to defend him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is the sort of movie where the relative
novice Hodges will fly halfway around the globe to Yemen to see the
alleged crime scene and stumble onto evidence that a team of
investigators had overlooked. It is the sort of movie where the
defendant will say things like ``If I'm guilty of this, I'm guilty
of everything I did in combat for the last 30 years.'' It's the
sort of movie where an intelligent, cool-headed guy like Childers
will be easily goaded into incriminating outbursts in court. The
sort of movie where the government will destroy evidence to further
the foreign relations interests of the nation. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   With the new battle lines clearly drawn, Friedkin settles into
and settles for an all-too-familiar courtroom yarn. We wait
dutifully for the surprise witness, the legal twist, the discovery
of the key evidence that we know has been suppressed. And wait and
wait. Picture ``A Few Good Men'' but without the crackling
histrionics. ``Rules of Engagement'' may be a more realistic
depiction of military justice, but it is far less dramatic. We can
handle the truth, but prefer that it not lull us to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is typically understated as Hodges, through whose eyes we
watch the trial unfold, but it is a role that any stalwart,
craggy-faced actor could handle. Jackson gets a few scenery-chewing
explosions, which he manages well, yet you sense that he too is not
working on all cylinders. Australian Guy Pearce (``L.A.
Confidential'') shows up with a New Yawk accent as the whippet-like
prosecutor, Kingsley has a few good moments as the duplicitous
ambassador, and Philip Baker Hall (``Magnolia'') gets a few minutes
of screen time as Hodges' father, who tries to dissuade him from
taking the case.
</P>
<P>
   If only more cast members had listened to him. ``Rules of
Engagement'' will soon be a minor, forgettable item on their
resumes, and those of us eager to see director Friedkin's career
back on track will have to keep waiting.

`EAST-WEST': WELCOME HOME, IMPERIALIST DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russian emigres in the West to return home.
Thousands accepted the offer of Soviet citizenship and the chance
to help rebuild their devastated motherland. In return for their
devotion, most were summarily executed or imprisoned, victims of
either Stalin's paranoia _ he thought that they must be imperialist
spies _ or of a state that reserved some of its greatest cruelties
for those who trusted and believed in it.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of ``East-West,'' Regis Wargnier's sumptuous,
moving new film, captures both the hope of the returning Russians
and their brutal betrayal. A voyage on an elegant steamship,
complete with vodka toasts and patriotic songs, gives way to the
grim reality of life and death in a police state. As they
disembark, the returnees are separated into two groups, fit and
unfit, in a scene clearly meant to put us in mind of the similar
sortings at the Nazi death camps a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Golovine and his French wife, Marie, the fictional
couple at the center of ``East-West,'' are luckier than most of
their fellow travelers. Because Aleksei (Oleg Menchikov) is a
doctor whose skills might be of use to them, the authorities assign
the Golovines and their young son, Serioja, to a communal apartment
in Kiev, where they share cramped quarters with a motley assortment
of New Socialist snoops, black marketeers and drunkards.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), the old woman charged by
the state with minding everybody's business speaks some French, but
this is a small mercy in a situation whose hellishness is amplified
by the impossibility of escape. On Marie's arrival, her French
passport is destroyed, and her husband, deaf to the intensity of
her misery, decides that behaving like a good Soviet citizen is the
best way to protect his family.
</P>
<P>
   When ``East-West'' was released in France last year, it drew
some criticism for its supposed anti-communism, but its politics
are fairly restrained. Wargnier, who collaborated with two Russian
writers, Roustam Ibraguimbek and Sergei Bodrove, on the screenplay,
shows the essential monstrosity of Stalinism. But he does not
conclude that everyone who lived under it was a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Even the system's most dedicated functionaries _ a military
officer who is kind to Marie, the hospital bureaucrat who rewards
Aleksei's talent and dedication, a tyrannical swimming coach _ are
given redeeming human qualities. Only one character, the vicious
secret-police officer who is convinced that Marie is a spy, is an
unambiguous embodiment of evil. And Marie, a furious, unyielding
martyr, is no saint. To her neighbors and co-workers, next to whom
she is comparatively privileged, she often seems haughty, selfish
and capricious.
</P>
<P>
   For all its moral complexity, ``East-West'' has a decidedly
old-fashioned, big-movie feeling. It's a throwback to the lush,
emotionally emphatic films of the era in which it takes place.
French critics and politicians like to complain about the
destruction of their national cinema by the hegemony of Hollywood,
but Wargnier has clearly learned something from recent American
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Like Steven Spielberg, he is fond of presenting climactic scenes
in counterpoint, cutting back and forth, for instance, between the
bustle and grandeur of a concert hall and the desperate struggle of
a lone swimmer in a dark, choppy sea. He also shares with Spielberg
an unfortunate taste for swelling, high-volume soundtrack music, as
if the only way to prevent the audience from remaining dry-eyed
were to drown it.
</P>
<P>
   But the sumptuous romanticism of the story makes it bearable,
and this may be grounds for criticism. The film may justly be
faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in the catharsis of
melodrama, but it also uses the resources of melodrama to shed
light on forgotten history. ``East-West'' is a historical pageant,
full of grandeur and period detail, but it is also the portrait of
a marriage under extreme pressure, external and internal.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene Marie sits in her room and weeps as she reads the
passage from ``Madame Bovary'' describing the heady bliss of its
heroine's first adultery. And like an unwillingly proletarian Emma
Bovary, Marie finds relief from her stultifying daily life and her
husband's drab conventionality in the arms of a lover, a young
swimmer named Sacha (Sergi Bodrov Jr.), whose parents were executed
as class enemies in the great terror of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei is engaged in an affair of his own, with the nosy,
officious neighbor who replaces Sacha's grandmother as manager of
the communal apartment after the grandmother is taken away by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of Aleksei's character _ we are kept wondering
about his loyalties and his motives, until the very end _ binds the
movie together, and Menchikov, who looks like a sensitive, Slavic
Gabriel Byrne, is a subtle, generous actor. But this is, in the
best old Hollywood sense, a woman's picture. ``East-West'' was
nominated for this year's Oscar for best foreign film, and like the
film that won, Pedro Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' it is in
part a heartfelt tribute to the iconic movie actresses of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnaire burns with moral passion and erotic fervor, as if
inhabited by the spirit of Ingrid Bergman. Catherine Deneuve,
playing a French actress who takes up the cause of Marie's
repatriation, is the living incarnation of everything noble and
beautiful in postwar French cinema. She was playing a bored French
housewife in Luis Bunuel's ``Belle de Jour'' the year Bonnaire was
born. To paraphrase Harold Brodkey: To see them on screen together
is to see Marxism die.

 FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE (For
 use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ARTICLE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT; ALSO
MOVING IN THE
 ``K'' CATEGORY)
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Liv''e? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star
Trek''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the ``Washington Post'' and the ``New York Times''.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The'' ``Next Generatio''n) to the current version (``Star
Trek: Voyage''r), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment:'' ``Earth,'' sent an agent from the future
into Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the
arms race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of'' ``Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled `The Wrath of Khan.`
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next''
``Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Countr''y),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' '' &QL;

RUSH OUT TO A GOLD-PANNING SPOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there any place in the country I can pan for gold?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.M.L., E. Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A: A Florida company has published maps you can use to pan for
gold in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten sells six gold maps of California and the West Coast and
five more for Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Individual maps sell for $12 with the exception of Alabama and
South Carolina, which sell for $12 as a set. Shipping and handling
is $3 regardless of how many maps you purchase.
</P>
<P>
   To order, write to Big Ten, Box 321231-W, Cocoa Beach, FL
32932-1231, or visit the Web site www.goldmaps.com.
</P>
<P>
   The closest gold-panning sites to Fort Worth-Dallas are in
Alabama and Georgia, said map creator Charles Overbey. ``Usually
people will find specks, but sometimes you don't find anything the
first time you're out,'' he said. ``It's a fun outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do airplane windows have tiny little scratches on them?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.D., Ramona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most small hairline scratches and ``spider-webby'' marks you
see on airplane windows are caused when they are cleaned, said Jeff
Pfister, director of marketing for LP Aero Plastics, a manufacturer
of windows for corporate planes. ``The windows are made of plastic,
and not as hard as glass and get scratched as a matter of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Though scratches can be caused by cleaning brushes, a more
common cause is exposure to chemicals. ``Even things like volcanic
ash in the upper atmosphere can cause that,'' Pfister said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing unsafe about those scratches on the windows,
which are periodically removed and polished to remove the
scratches, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, you printed an address for the Barry Manilow
Fan Club. They took my money and never sent any information. Where
can I contact them?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Send your letter and proof of payment to Vicky Thomas, Barry
Manilow International Fan Club, Box 45378, Los Angeles, CA 90045.
</P>
<P>
   The club, which has 60,000 members and is the singer's official
fan club, offers $10 yearly memberships and sends out a quarterly
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau of the Southland has no complaints on
file against the club for the past three years and gives it a
``clear record'' rating. If you are not able to get a refund or
membership, you can file a complaint with that bureau by calling
(909) 825-7280.

`SOUTHPAW' IS A PUZZLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, maverick independent studio The Shooting
Gallery has been running a series of offbeat films in an attempt to
showcase non-mainstream entertainment. The choices, including the
moody black-and-white seriocomedy ``Judy Berlin'' and the dense and
multilayered ``Such a Long Journey,'' have often been intriguing,
if not always artistically successful.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry, though, is a puzzler. It's ``Southpaw,'' a
documentary about Francis Barrett, a 19-year-old Irish boxer from
Galway. Barrett is also a Traveller, a member of a much-maligned
Gypsylike class of drifters who live in trailer encampments on
Galway's outskirts. The movie chronicles Barrett's successes and
failures as he competes in the 1996 Summer Olympics (where he
carries the Irish flag and becomes a national hero by winning his
first fight) and in the Irish and English championships.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much deeper than that; we learn a little about
Barrett's clanlike family, see amusing footage of a mass wedding
(and its aftermath), and watch Barrett fight in scenes that are
truncated until virtually all the boxing excitement is removed. We
don't learn much about why the Travellers are so reviled in Ireland
(the Irish-made film seems to take this for granted), or about what
Barrett's victories mean to his society. Because it's a
documentary, ``Southpaw'' showed signs of being able to rise above
the current crop of boxing movies. But it's just another one that
ends up down for the count.

square of William Faulkner's hometown into the darkened bar, the
bearded, wiry firefighter-turned-author greets the waitresses by
name and heads for a red vinyl booth in the ``Closed'' section of
the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting up a Marlboro, he orders a Budweiser and leans back to
talk about how much his life has changed from his days of fighting
fires, cutting pulpwood and writing sex-filled stories about
man-eating bears in Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   With two collections of critically acclaimed short stories and
four other books under his belt, Brown has become a nationally
known author and a literary folk hero in a town where Faulkner
ranks second only to God, or maybe John Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent so much of my life in bars,'' Brown says. ``That's
where I get a lot of my stories. There's so much material there. I
just watch what goes on and later on I find a place to put that
stuff in my novels. It's fascinating watching somebody come in
sober and then see how they behave when they get intoxicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brown's gritty literary world, bars are hangouts for his
blue-collar characters. They are refuges for desperate men and
women who are trying to escape boring, dead-end lives with too many
troubles and too little money. Men like the title character in his
1991 novel ``Joe,'' a divorced ex-con who spends his days poisoning
unwanted trash trees for a timber company and his nights gambling
and drinking. Or women like the teenage girl in his new novel,
``Fay'' (Algonquin, $24.95), a beautiful, resourceful temptress who
runs away from an abusive father and plunges into a world of
murder, violence and sexual exploitation. The character of Fay made
a brief appearance in ``Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew about her when I first started was what I wrote
about her in `Joe,''' Brown says. ``I knew she had been raised in
labor camps and she was naive and didn't know much about the world.
She just walked out of `Joe' and disappeared, and all this time I
wondered what became of her. One day I just sat down and started
writing about her walking down this dirt road that came out of this
ridge over at Tula, right close to where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing a novel from a woman's viewpoint was a challenge, says
Brown, who frequently sought guidance from his wife, Mary Annie,
about such feminine matters as morning sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be genuine to women who read it,'' Brown says.
``Fay was real naive and she was headstrong, too, to take off
walking like that. Her main thing was that she didn't want to be
alone. She wanted a man to take care of her, and not prey on her.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Fay, like many of his other characters, struggles to
survive in a violent, hardscrabble world that Brown knows
intimately. Born in 1951 on a small farm in Potlockney, Miss.,
Brown grew up in a family usually in desperate straits because of
his father's drinking.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of World War II, Brown's father never recovered fully
from his combat experiences. He dealt with the nightmares by
drinking, often spending the last dollar of grocery money for a
bottle. ``It was like trouble followed us from place to place,''
Brown recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When he was old enough, Brown escaped by joining the Marines.
Two years later, he returned to take a job with the Oxford Fire
Department and get married. He supported his growing family by
painting houses, hauling hay and cleaning carpets.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown turned 30, however, he took stock of himself and
decided he didn't like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a job as a firefighter, but I wondered where I'd be 10
years on down the road. I always had this question about how people
learned to write. I'd always loved to read so much, I just kept
thinking and thinking about it and one day I said I was going to
sit down and write a novel, to see if I could do it. I wondered if
it might be like learning how to build houses, or lay brick, or
even fight fires.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife recalls that he came home from work one day with a
stack of typing paper and announced he was going to write a novel.
</P>
<P>
   From the ground up
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a whim at first,'' she says, ``but when he
kept at it, month after month, I knew he was serious. He was so
determined to make it. The rejection slips would come in, and
they'd be real short sentences saying, `We're sorry we can't
publish this at this time.' Things like that. We got used to doing
things without him around because he was always writing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the novel about man-eating bears was rejected, Brown
tackled the short-story form, churning out a few horrible pieces
that nobody wanted. In addition to his firefighting job, he worked
at a place called Commanche Pottery on his days off, pouring liquid
plaster into molds shaped like Indian heads and animals. When the
place burned down, he lost his moonlighting job but gained more
time to write.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Brown decided he had better go to the library and
find some books on writing and learn more about the craft. He began
his education in earnest, checking out books on writing by the
armload. Later, Oxford bookseller Richard Howorth became his mentor
and provided a reading list of novels and short story collections
by Faulkner and other writers.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight years, Brown wrote like a man possessed,
accumulating piles of rejection slips (at last count, he had 250),
and turning out more than 100 short stories and five novels. After
he audited Ellen Douglas' writing class at Ole Miss, however, he
began to see things more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was point him in the right direction,'' Douglas
says. ``I suggested Flannery O'Connor and Faulkner, of course, but
he had already begun to read Faulkner. I also suggested James
Joyce, Katherine Anne Porter and a number of Southern writers. I
was impressed with his sense of voice. He had a natural talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's big break came in 1987 when Algonquin editor Shannon
Ravenel read one of his stories, ``Facing the Music,'' in the
Mississippi Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me and asked if I had enough stories for a
collection,'' Brown says. ``I told her, `I've got a hundred. How
many would you like to see?'''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Facing the Music'' was published as a collection of short
stories, critics praised the spare, powerful language, particularly
in the title story about a man's reaction to his wife's mastectomy.
They continued to rave when ``Dirty Work'' appeared later, calling
the novel about two hospitalized Vietnam veterans ``the most
unflinching depiction of war and its scars since `Johnny Got His
Gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the real thing, both personally and professionally,
says his friend, North Carolina novelist Clyde Edgerton. ``I think
he has a deep love of the earth. He loves people and things in a
way that keeps him anchored to his own good sense. His writing
shows that he's in touch with something at a deep level that few
writers ever make it down to.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, says Georgia State University professor Tom McHaney,
Brown is writing about his own little corner of Faulkner's
fictional Yoknapatawpha County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry made himself into a writer, much as Faulkner did.
Faulkner was also without an education, he'd like to say, but as a
writer he was self-made through reading. That's exactly what Larry
has done. I think Faulkner would have liked `Dirty Work' and pieces
like that because they express a point of view and a voice with
great clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from the countryside
</P>
<P>
   As dusk settles over the Delta, Brown says goodbye to the crowd
in the Ajax and heads for his truck. Retrieving a cold beer from
the cooler in the back, he pops in a CD titled ``From Senegal to
Senatobia,'' the latest eclectic blues offerings by Otha Turner and
the Afrossippi Allstars, and gets ready for one of his favorite
pastimes _ slow ridin'.
</P>
<P>
   As he bounces along the Mississippi backroads, he points out the
places where he grew up as the son of a sharecropper and the
locations that find their way into his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here is where Fay walked out onto the highway,'' he
says, slowing down where a dirt road intersects with the highway.
``I write about places I know so I won't have to do much
research.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later he turns off the blacktop onto a rutted
wagon road and parks on the piece of land where he's building a
writing cabin. He hikes across the dam of the pond and up the hill
where the unfinished 10-by-12-foot wooden structure sits perched on
concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started building this not quite two years ago,'' he says,
caressing the frame like a proud father. ``I'd like to move my
writing operation over here. It's nice and isolated and I can go
fishing in the pond. I'm going to have electricity but no plumbing.
I don't need no plumbing. I've got an outhouse I'm restoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Brown pulls into the driveway of his ranch house, looks
out over the pasture where a coyote has been carrying off his baby
goats, and unlocks a small office on the other side of the
breezeway.
</P>
<P>
   As narrow as a small walk-in closet, the office is crammed with
books, snapshots of writing pals Edgerton, Grisham, Rick Bass and
others, and clippings about his books.
</P>
<P>
   The past 10 years have been overwhelming, Brown says. Writers he
hadn't heard of two decades ago _ legendary authors such as Harry
Crews and Cormac McCarthy and Richard Ford _ now correspond
regularly with him. Colleges frequently ask him to speak at
literary conferences and he is the subject of a forthcoming
documentary film, ``The Rough Life of Larry Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is on the verge of making big money, as well. Billy Bob
Thornton has bought an option on ``Joe,'' and movie deals are in
the works for ``Father and Son,'' ``Dirty Work'' and ``Big Bad
Love.'' Still, Brown seems unaffected by fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, he hasn't changed a bit,'' says Howorth, owner of
Square Books. ``He's still the same gracious, down-to-earth person
he's always been. But as a writer, I think he's grown. He's very
careful about his craft and continues to read other writers with an
eye on story development.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the promise of Hollywood riches doesn't faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing pretty much what I want to be doing,'' says Brown.
``What would I do if I got a lot more money? I don't think I'd do
anything much different. I guess I would like to get my little
writing cabin finished.''

`JOE GOULD'S SECRET': CHARISMATIC CURMUDGEON VS. NEW YORKER WRITER
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review; note that a word in
graf 12 could be offensive to some readers.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great British actor Ian Holm has had many juicy film roles,
but none has placed him so ferociously front and center as the
title character of ``Joe Gould's Secret.'' Ian's ranting,
fiery-eyed performance is the brilliant spark that ignites this
otherwise rather somnolent film, adapted by Stanley Tucci and the
screenwriter Howard A. Rodman from Joseph Mitchell's famous New
Yorker profiles, ``Professor Sea Gull'' and ``Joe Gould's Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for Holm to sentimentalize Gould by
softening this thorny bohemian character who lived off handouts and
made grandiose literary claims into a dreamy-eyed holy man and
tragic misfit. Instead, the 69-year-old actor goes in the opposite
direction. The character is a raving crank, a pathological liar, an
obnoxious drunk, a disheveled, flailing, broken-down genius manque.
He is just the kind of person many would cross the street to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the movie is a rambling, episodic portrait of the
relationship between Mitchell (who died in 1996) and Gould, who
died indigent and senile at Pilgrim State Hospital on Long Island
four decades earlier (in 1957). Although that relationship had its
tender side, it was also mutually exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles, published more than two decades apart, in 1942 and
1964, significantly burnished Mitchell's journalistic reputation.
The first established Gould as a bohemian icon who held court at
the Minetta Tavern for fans who donated cash to his ever depleted
Joe Gould Fund.
</P>
<P>
   As infuriating as he is, Holm's Gould is also charismatic. A
Harvard graduate with an unstable personality and a major chip on
his shoulder, Gould moved in 1916 to New York City, where he
panhandled for a living while saying he was working on a literary
masterwork, his million-word-plus ``Oral History of Our Time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed to understand and speak the language of sea
gulls and would entertain people in bars and at parties with his
expressive birdlike squawks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mitchell caught up with him, Gould's oral history,
an epic anthology of overheard conversations, essays and apercus
hand-written in school composition books, had been more than 25
years in the making. Gould boasted that if the collected notebooks
were stacked they would tower over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial meeting takes place in a diner, where Gould
flamboyantly empties an entire bottle of ketchup into his soup.
Gould hungers for recognition, and it isn't long before he becomes
a pest, dropping in at the New Yorker offices at all hours and
demanding attention and whatever cash Mitchell can scrounge up.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell eventually resorts to having his receptionist cover for
him, and at one point she invents a bogus vacation. The
relationship becomes so uncomfortable that Mitchell guiltily hides
around a corner while Gould is talked out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell repeatedly presses Gould to produce his oral history,
but all Gould will show him are a few essays. The bulk of the work,
which Gould with typical grandiosity describes as mapping the
city's unconscious, is supposedly stored at a poultry farm on Long
Island. Gould's evasions lead Mitchell to doubt its very existence.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does a lovely job of evoking a boozy 1940s Greenwich
Village of poetry readings, cavernous bars and raucous parties.
Compared to today's free-for-all urban climate of sex, drugs,
hip-hop and voracious tourism, however, it all seems poignantly
innocent and genteel.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Patricia Clarkson have vivid cameos as the
legendary painter Alice Neel (whose nude portrait of Gould depicted
him as an exhibitionist with three penises) and Vivian Marquie, an
art gallery owner and close friend who administered Gould's modest
income from an anonymous benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes in flophouses, soup kitchens and a mental hospital
remind us that New York City's social safety net was a lot more
secure in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its rich period ambience and Ian's fiery acting, the
movie never brings Mitchell's relationship to Gould into clear
enough focus. To play Mitchell (who came from North Carolina),
Tucci adopts a credible Southern accent, but his character remains
a suave, low-key enigma. Even in the scenes of Mitchell at home
with his wife, the photographer Therese Mitchell (Hope Davis), and
their two children, the character comes across as a slightly
wistful, gentlemanly observer of his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking dramatic tension, ``Joe Gould's Secret'' settles for
being an atmospheric scenes-in-the-life biography of someone's most
unforgettable character. It could have been so much more. &QL;

 &HT;    `Return' a new twist on matchmaking
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I could be mistaken, but I think ``Return to Me'' may be the
first organ-transplant romance in history. (I don't imagine ``The
Incredible Two-Headed Transplant'' can be called a romance.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in this movie, David Duchovny of ``The X-Files,'' who's
been telling us for years that the truth is ``out there,'' learns
that the truth is actually ``in there.'' As inside co-star Minnie
Driver's chest, where beats the heart of his beloved first wife
(Joely Richardson), tragically killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the gimmick ... I mean plot. Poor, despondent Duchovny
has trouble getting back into the dating scene now that he's a
widower. His most meaningful relationships are with his best pal
(David Alan Grier) and with his dead wife's favorite gorilla (she
was a primate specialist).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, poor Driver is also having trouble getting back into
the dating scene, because she fears that her medical history will
turn off potential suitors. Her closest relationships are with her
best friend (Bonnie Hunt, who also directed) and her grandfather
(Carroll O'Connor), who runs an Irish-Italian restaurant in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Their tentative moves toward each other and true love are
sporadically interrupted by scenes of so-called warmhearted comic
relief proffered by O'Connor and his card-playing cronies. These
are the sorts of exchanges in which the revelation that Duchovny is
a widower deserves a toast.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, who keeps swinging at the big screen and missing
(anyone for a sequel to ``Playing God''?), is actually rather
wonderful here. He has the pensive, sweet romanticism of Harrison
Ford's long-lost son. If he'd been matched with, say, his director
(a union that Hollywood math, i.e. ageism, wouldn't allow),
``Return to Me'' could have been something quite special.
</P>
<P>
   But our distaff star, alas, is Driver, who, for reasons I can't
quite articulate, drives me crazy. Though she was perfectly
charming in her breakthrough film, ``Circle of Friends,'' where she
played an ugly duckling turned swan by the attentions of hunky
Chris O'Donnell, since then she's become ``Entertainment
Tonight''/``Access Hollywood''/People magazine bait. About 50 times
too often. In ``Return to Me,'' she's meant to be adorably
vulnerable and appropriately starry-eyed over Duchovny. Mostly,
she's just there _ swooning and overacting, as opposed to last
summer's ``An Ideal Husband,'' in which she was tart and
overacting.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, we could all use a delectable comedy-romance, it
being April and all. But ``Return to Me'' gives us half of a
romance (Duchovny) and a look at Chicago to rival Woody Allen's
valentines to New York City. All they needed was The Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny and Minnie Driver. Directed by Bonnie
Hunt. Rated PG for mild violence and sexual situations. At metro
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Return to sender. Except for David Duchovny.

 &HT;    Style, costumes can't save gory `Titus'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The goddess of justice has left the earth,'' cries Anthony
Hopkins as the titular Roman general in ``Titus.'' After a nonstop
series of decapitations and rapes, severed limbs and torn-out
tongues, he's kind of stating the obvious. As the movie stretches
toward the three-hour mark, you wish he'd just get on with it and
take revenge on his bloody enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a mythic No-Time and filled with fascist imagery (like
the Ian McKellen ``Richard III'' five years ago), this adaptation
of Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus'' by stage whiz Julie Taymor
(``The Lion King'') doesn't lack style. If anything, it has too
much, what with its crumbling ruins, vintage convertibles,
Fellini-esque orgies and psychedelic, MTV-style montages of
prowling tigers and busted statuary. It received an Oscar
nomination for its costumes. What it doesn't have is a core.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins plays a warrior whose main flaw is blind loyalty to his
country. Returning in triumph from battle bearing the captive Goth
queen Tamora (a body-tattooed Jessica Lange) and her sybaritic
sons, he's called upon by the people to replace the newly deceased
emperor. Instead, he endorses Caesar's son, the oily Saturninus
(Alan Cumming, whose fey, eye-shadowed shtick is getting a little
stale). When Saturninus claims Titus' daughter Lavinia (Laura
Fraser) as his bride, the general gives his blessing _ though
Lavinia is in love with his brother Bassianus (James Frain). Titus
even kills his own youngest son for challenging the match.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Saturninus decides to marry Tamora instead. And she,
with the help of her Moorish slave and sometime lover Aaron (Harry
Lennix), plots to get even with Titus for the killing of her eldest
son, a sacrificial victim of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on, people; it gets even more complicated. That has always
been the weakness of ``Titus Andronicus'': It's all plot twists and
shock tactics, without the poetry and resonance of Shakespeare's
later work. Taymor doesn't do anything to fill in the blanks or
convince us that there's some deeper meaning here. She's more
intent on finding cool catacombs to shoot in, or a ghostly, de
Chirico-like high-rise to serve as the Roman court.
</P>
<P>
   She can't make sense of the play's bizarre, even desperate
shifts of tone. There's an especially loony sequence in which
Tamora and her spoiled, oversexed sons (Jonathan Rhys Meyers and
Matthew Rhys) disguise themselves as Revenge, Rapine and Murder and
pay Titus a visit. She thinks the old man is losing his wits, that
she can con him into luring his renegade oldest son into her trap.
The setup is so preposterous (as are the costumes) that it plays
like some low-comedy burlesque.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's the title figure, Titus is off-screen for good
chunks of the movie, as the other characters scheme, rape and lop
off one another's hands. Predictably fine, Hopkins' put-upon hero
is something of a hybrid of King Lear, verging on madness as his
world unravels, and Hamlet, dawdling in his plans for revenge.
Lange does terrific, slinky work, edging right up to campy
caricature but never quite losing her steely grip. Lennix, as an
early prototype of Iago, brings believable ferocity as a man
relishing a chance to destroy those who've enslaved him all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Good performances can't save this movie, though. When it should
be tightening and galloping toward its stomach-churning final
banquet, ``Titus'' loses its way. If nothing else, you'll come away
with one valuable lesson: Never eat a tasty meat pie at your
enemy's table, unless all your near and dear ones are present and
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. Rated R for strong
violent and sexual images.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A stylish but empty version of Shakespeare's gory potboiler.

   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth,
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz
</P>
<P>
   and Antonia San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: foreign film. Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar
grows up with this humane celebration of nurturing women. A tribute
to actresses (of all kinds), ``All About My Mother'' is a virtually
male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage classic,
``All About Eve.'' Dark and tender in equal measures, the movie
beautifully balances humor and heartache. In Spanish with
subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscars: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), director, original
screenplay, cinematography. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays a
man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing, daringly
hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's a
hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed Up.
(ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the nature of identity, the
lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the illusion of free will, it's
playfully profound one moment, gonzo the next. (SM)1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' R (violence, sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bijou Phillips,
</P>
<P>
   Robert Downey Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields, Ben Stiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black &AMP; White'' is the latest from writer-director James
Toback, a hit-or-miss auteur. Hit: the screenplay for ``Bugsy.''
Miss: his last movie, ``Two Guys and a Girl.'' He gives you energy,
attitude and a big sloppy mess of a movie in ``Black.'' It's not a
very good or intelligent movie, but it's a topical powderkeg likely
to launch arguments and discussions more complex and sophisticated
than the film. (SM)1 hour 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: actress (Hilary Swank). This intense true story of Teena
Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After
cutting her hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some
hard-drinking rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out.
The movie is a bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film.
(ERG)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscars: adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Michael Caine).
John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr. Larch
(Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in his Maine
orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's protege,
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the world.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary'' Unrated (explicit sexual
</P>
<P>
   situations and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madhur Jaffrey
</P>
<P>
   and Greta Scacchi.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy-handed social melodrama whose title character is a
symbol with a capital S. Set in 1950s India, just as the country is
emerging from British rule, the movie focuses on an Anglo Indian
named Cotton Mary (Madhur Jaffrey) who insinuates herself into a
British family. Greta Scacchi is rather good as the weak-willed
family matriarch, but the film as a whole is torpedoed by Jaffrey's
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino)2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog:
</P>
<P>
   The Way of the Samurai'' R (strong violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and John Tormey.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Jarmusch takes the overused gangster genre and
makes it compellingly unfamiliar. Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), who
makes a fascinating lone wolf, is a gun-for-hire who follows the
philosophy of the samurai, especially their utter devotion to their
masters. His is Louie (John Tormey), a tubby, graying soldier
working for a gang boss. Louie saved him from thugs as a teenager.
(SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and drugs
</P>
<P>
   content, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years in the late '60s she spent at
an upscale mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone
reminiscent of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Jolie provides
the fireworks in a fiercely showy turn as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing and
beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen King's prison novel. Tom
Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest prisoner, a
mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical powers of healing.
(SM)3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth'' PG-13 (sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Klein,
</P>
<P>
   Leelee Sobieski and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   A limp and clueless variation on ``Love Story.'' Leelee
Sobieski, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett star as kids in a love
triangle. Trapped in this hermetically sealed setting, with a
script that would run 10 minutes if the cliches were yanked out of
it, they can't win. (SM)1 hour, 37 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' PG ( sci-fi violence and mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' R ( violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Olin.
</P>
<P>
   A major disappointment from Roman Polanski, the film stars
Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and the gateway to
satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween horror
houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at the end
of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in black robes,
play-acting a satanic mass. (SM) 2 hours, 13 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Not One Less'' Unrated (designed for
</P>
<P>
   mature audiences, subtitles)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wei Minzhi.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned director Zhang Yimou, who's better known for such
sumptuous efforts as ``Raise the Red Lantern,'' presents this
simple film. In a poor rural Chinese village, a 13-year-old girl is
hired to be the substitute teacher. She'll receive a bonus if all
the students are still there when the regular teacher returns. A
small, pared-down film with deep emotional and political
undercurrents. (ERG)1 hour, 46 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory'' PG-13 ( violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and brief drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jimmy Smits
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Seda.
</P>
<P>
   A boxing movie that goes down for the count. Jimmy Smits stars
in another retelling of the age-old story of sons struggling to
please a demanding father. It's about as dramatically subtle as a
head-butt. (SM)1 hour, 57 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' PG (mild violence and sexual situations.)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the movie's first organ-transplant romance,
bereaved widower David Duchovny falls for shy heart-transplant
recipient Minnie Driver, unaware that his beloved first wife's
ticker is beating inside her chest. Duchovny is actually rather
wonderful here, with a sweet pensive romanticism. But Driver
herself just doesn't seem worthy of Duchovny. (ERG) 1 hour, 56
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' PG (mild thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity.)
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Not cute enough for kids, not clever enough for adults,
DreamWorks' latest animated feature is gorgeous but curiously dull.
Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are the voices of a couple of
16th-century scam artists looking for the Lost City of Gold in the
New World. The movie fuses visual splendor with unsteady
storytelling and tone. The waterfalls are beautiful, but the movie
is a washout. (SM)1 hour, 23 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tommy Lee Jones,
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is another military flick that climaxes
in a courtroom, where soldiers shout out conflicting reports of
what really happened in the heat of battle. ``Rules'' is laughable,
but it's watchable thanks to the leads. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flicks's anchor. And Samuel L. Jackson delivers an on-the-stand
blow-up like Jack Nicholson's ``You-can't-handle-the-truth''
bluster from ``A Few Good Men.'' (SM)2 hours, 7 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, the WB's
Joshua Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied
club. It comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out.
(SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News)1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Jessica Lange.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish but empty attempt at Shakespeare's gory potboiler.
Good performances from Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange can't save
the movie. When it should be tightening and galloping toward its
stomach-churning final banquet, it only loses its way. (SM)2 hours,
42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' PG-13 (sexual situations and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shane West
</P>
<P>
   and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe
</P>
<P>
   Very loosely based on ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' this generic
teen-hormone comedy has two seniors who help each other woo the
girl of their dreams and/or lust. The cast is pleasant enough, but
if you saw a single John Hughes movie in the '80s, you've seen this
territory covered with more style and insight. If your kid is
begging to go, do whatever it takes to palm him or her off on a
clueless grandparent. (ERG)1 hour, 32 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 43 minutes. B

   Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff will have a lot of new faces to
work with when they put together their first ``Nitro'' show Monday.
Kevin Nash had the cast removed from his broken ankle and could
return to the ring in a month. ``Hard Knox'' Chris Candido has
signed a contract with WCW after a month of tryouts. No word on
whether the former ECW star's valet _ Tammy Lynn Sytch, a.k.a.
Sunny from her WWF days _ will be joining him.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Rick Steiner may be back sooner. It appears
Goldberg may have been influential in getting Bischoff back in the
good graces of Time-Warner and Brad Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Some other changes are on the way at WCW. Kevin Sullivan might
have a very short future. The man in the middle of The Radicals
departure has been offered a buyout on his contract. Meanwhile,
Russo's former WWF partner Ed Ferarra will be running things
backstage.
</P>
<P>
   WCW spin doctors are working the Internet getting out news on
Hulk Hogan. They are saying that Hogan refused to cleanly defeat
The Wall on ``Nitro'' because he felt it would end Wall's push as a
dominanting monster. So he asked that his ``new best buddy''
Vampiro do a run-in to save Hogan. This appears to be an attempt to
squash the anti-Hogan fans who feel he will do anything to keep the
young talent down and push himself to the top. Fans of the Tommy
Dreamer-Raven-dominated ECW should watch the next two TNN shows.
Tapings last week had Dreamer-Raven-Sandman in a classic ECW match
against the Baldies. Some of the foreign objects used included a
ladder, barbed wire, chairs and tables. The match ended with Mike
Awesome hitting the ring and decimating everyone. That leads to an
Awesome-Rhino match that is sure to please, although Awesome
retains the title.

 &HT;    WWF reaches another crossroads
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's called the Super Bowl of professional wrestling, and this
year the WWF's WrestleMania pay-per-view had all the hype and TV
saturation as a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd of pay-per-view subscribers was expected to pay
the $49.95 for Sunday's broadcast, not so much for the live event
as to relive the past 15 WrestleManias through highlight clips and
wrestlers' remembrances of WrestleManias past. That led up to the
16th WrestleMania, live from The Pond in Anaheim, Calif.,
culminating in a noon-to-midnight extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The live crowd at The Pond numbered 13,871, who paid more than
$1.2 million to attend, small by WrestleMania standards. But the
pay-per-view crowd is expect to reach record figures. Although
exact numbers are not expected until next week, the show will
undoubtedly have the largest gross of the year for wrestling
programs, considering the high price (normally $29.95) and the
viewers who were drawn to the unprecedented offering of historical
footage.
</P>
<P>
   WrestleMania viewers are rarely disappointed; some of the major
turning points in WWF history have occurred at WrestleMania.
Sunday's event was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But let's look at the history first. The highlight reels shown
Sunday featured three WWF watershed events.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved the largest crowd ever to watch a live
professional wrestling event in the United States. WrestleMania III
in 1987 was held at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, and although
many in attendance probably couldn't see a thing, 93,179 packed the
stadium to watch a showdown between up-and-coming Hulk Hogan and
aging-but-unbeatable Andre the Giant. Although Hogan was the
champion and an established star, the Giant had been such an icon
in the wrestling world that a victory over him would elevate Hogan
to icon status.
</P>
<P>
   As Hogan would say after the match, ``He's 7-foot-4 and over 500
pounds. If he didn't want to lose, he wasn't going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andre did allow Hogan to win and thus began Hogan's reign as
the undisputed king of the wrestling ring and a pop-culture icon.
</P>
<P>
   The next turning point for the WWF was 1990. For years the
Ultimate Warrior had been rampaging through the ring much like
Goldberg when he started his career. And like Goldberg, the
Ultimate Warrior had to meet and beat Hogan to complete his rise to
the top. The main event of WrestleMania VI featured Hogan and
Warrior in a matchup of the top two titleholders in the WWF. In the
end, the Warrior won and Hogan left to pursue an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the WWF were not as rosy. A steroid scandal kept
WWF owner Vince McMahon in court and caused a lot of the heavily
muscled wrestlers to ``disappear'' and return much smaller. The WWF
and professional wrestling as a whole was on a downswing.
</P>
<P>
   Until the next turn. In 1997, ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin was
running his mouth and stunning a WWF audience that had turned a
character who was a classic bad guy into one of the top fan
favorites. He met longtime champion Bret Hart in a match that
cemented Austin's future as the top wrestler in the WWF. Although
he lost the match, Austin won over all the fans by passing out
rather than quitting. The picture of Austin screaming in pain,
blood pouring down his face, made him the poster boy for the new,
raw WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the present. Sunday's event could also be a
turning point for the WWF, but not in a good way.
</P>
<P>
   The main event between The Rock, Mick Foley, the Big Show and
Triple H was not the best match of the night. In fact it probably
ranked third, behind a three-team ladder match between The Hardy
Boyz, the Dudley Boyz and Edge-Christian and a hardcore battle
royal that saw eight champions come and go in a 15-minute span.
</P>
<P>
   The main event was probably the final match in Foley's career,
and instead of going out with a ``bang-bang,'' he went out with a
whimper, injuring his shoulder early in the match so it was hard to
use his arm, and then completely missing a move on The Rock because
he didn't jump far enough. The ending was then a complete remake of
the Austin-McMahon feud that lasted too long two years ago and is
tired to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   With Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo taking over control of the
WCW and the possibility of WWF being without three of its top stars
(Foley to retirement, Austin to surgery and The Rock to make a
movie) for the next few months, the WWF is at another turning
point. Will it continue to dominate or are is it falling back to
the pack?

   With the announcement that the 2001 WrestleMania will be held at
the Astrodome in Houston with the hopes of breaking the 1987
attendance record, it will be important for McMahon to bring some
fresh ideas to the table before the cycle takes a downward spiral
again.

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A with two of fashions hottest designers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those unfamiliar with Custo of Barcelona's sportswear or Steve
Madden's shoes might look at their designs and wonder, ``What were
they thinking?'' Each Custo piece is a wild collage of fabrics,
prints and colors. And Madden's shoes typically feature
treacherously high heels.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting and chatting with Madden and Custo Dalmau, as we did
recently, makes you aware that there's more method and meaning to
their mad styles than is readily apparent. It's also evident that
both designers' wares have a wider appeal than you might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   When Dalmau paid a visit to Neiman Marcus in Atlanta, dozens of
women lined up to buy the separates he was there to autograph.
Dalmau's tops and bottoms sell in the $55-$150 range, and some of
his fans bought as many as 10 pieces on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Madden dropped by his Lenox Square mall boutique in Atlanta,
unannounced and went unnoticed as customers scurried around
snatching shoes to try on.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he sat in the mall courtyard sipping coffee, he
pointed out scores of shoppers shod in his platforms and spike
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Since both designers' styles have a similarly youthful and
flamboyant attitude, we posed the same questions to Madden and
Dalmau to see how their responses would match up.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Are your designs based on how you want women to look, or on
what women say they want to wear?
</P>
<P>
   Custo Dalmau: The second. We imagine the woman as we like her to
look, and design for this woman.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Madden: It's a little bit of both. When you design
something you can't presume that someone will like it. You have to
do it because you like it.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: In terms of the business climate, is this a good time to be
taking design risks or do you have to be careful with what you
offer?
</P>
<P>
   CD: We always take a risk. For the 20 years we've been in this
business we haven't been conservative or traditional at all, and
we've always tried to do something new in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   SM: The easy answer is to say, `Oh, we've gotta take risks.'
You've got to take some risks, but it's also true that we're in the
business of making shoes that make sense and that our constituency
wants to wear. Occasionally we go out on the limb with something.
But usually when we create a shoe it makes sense to us. If we made
a flat, that would be a risk. But if we make a four-inch platform
it's not. Our girls have been wearing platforms for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: How big a challenge would it be for you to start designing
for men?
</P>
<P>
   CD: I think men are getting a little bit bored with what's on
the market. We're starting with 25 tops for men this fall and
they're selling (to stores) incredibly well; much more than what we
expected. I think the stores were starving for something new.
</P>
<P>
   SM: I've always said we may do men's shoes one day, but it's not
something that interests me personally. ...We might do it. We just
think we're good at what we do and want to stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Which celebrity, to you, most embodies the spirit of your
designs?
</P>
<P>
   CD: Probably Madonna. She's the prototype of the woman who feels
individualistic, sexy and young. That's the woman we're targeting.
There are women 70 and 80 years old who wear our pieces, but they
have the mindsets of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   SM: (long pause) Lauryn Hill. I think she'd be a good prototype.
She just seems fast, but not over-the-top. I'm not even a huge fan
of hers. But there's something about her that seems very stylish,
cool and of the times.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What was the one big break that launched you into the big
time?
</P>
<P>
   CD: When we first started selling in America in 1996. ...The
stylists in Hollywood were all looking for something new to dress
stars in for the movies and TV. And by chance, they chose our
pieces. The first merchandise we shipped to this market wound up on
`Friends' and `Caroline in the City' and other popular shows. It
was a case of being in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   SM: We've had a lot of breaks, but one of the biggest came in
'93 when we made this one shoe called the Mary Lou. It was a patent
leather Mary Jane style. We made it and I started getting calls
from the mothers of all these kids who wanted it to wear to
parties. That set us off on this direction of being a popular
teenage brand.

 &HT;    Merchant's `Cotton Mary' badly frayed
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typically, the way the Ismail Merchant-James Ivory partnership
(``A Room With a View'') works is that the former produces and the
latter directs. Now we know why.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant decided to take another fling at directing _ his first
in several years _ and the result is ``Cotton Mary,'' a
heavy-handed melodrama whose title character is a symbol with a
capital S.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton Mary (Madhur Jaffrey) _ so-called because of her fondness
for English cotton over the native Indian variety _ is an Anglo
Indian working as a hospital nurse in 1950s India, a country just
learning what it means to be free of British imperialism. But Mary
still prefers anything English to all things Indian. She even, in a
perverse, self-loathing way, worships whatever rancid shards remain
of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she insinuates herself into a wealthy British
household. The mother, Lily (Greta Scacchi), has just given birth
and cannot nurse the newborn herself, a situation that Mary solves
through a combination of shrewdness and secrecy that immediately
grants her a certain power over the weak-willed Lily. It helps that
the child's father (James Wilby) is less interested in his family
than in his BBC stories and in chasing any available young woman,
native or not.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's strength and seeming devotion to ``Madame'' could be an
asset, except for one tiny problem. Mary is nuttier than a Dickens
fruitcake. Pretty soon, she's gone from pilfering from the pantry
to parading through town in Lily's clothes (shades of ``The
Maids''). She even boldly invades Madame's veddy English club to
get her hair done, much to the horror of the snobbish clientele.
</P>
<P>
   As a study of class, racism, imperialism and other misbegotten
caste systems, ``Cotton Mary'' offers fertile ground for some
provocative ideas and complex confrontations. Unfortunately,
Merchant seems to have been Cotton Mary'd himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked with Jaffrey, who's best-known as a cookbook
author, on three Merchant-Ivory films, and it was Jaffrey who
brought him a draft of a grad-student play she had been touring
with as a one-woman show. (Interestingly, Jaffrey receives
co-director credit.) Perhaps her performance worked onstage, but
on-screen, she makes Bette Davis at her campiest look restrained.
Sashaying about with all the subtlety of a soap opera villainess,
Jaffrey eradicates any challenging notions the movie might have
offered. Simply put, if she had a moustache, she'd twirl it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, really, because the movie also offers beautiful
locations, a fascinating attempt at a social study and a
particularly lovely, low-key performance by Scacchi. But even the
most devoted Merchant-Ivory fan will have a hard time cottoning to
``Cotton Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madhur Jaffrey and Greta Scacchi. Directed by Ismail
Merchant. Not rated, but there are explicit sexual situations and
female nudity (sexual and maternal).
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Comes all unraveled.

 &HT;    Savannah embraces elegant newcomer on the river's edge
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Folks here are so grateful for the luxurious
Westin Savannah Harbor Resort on Hutchinson Island, a sandy spit of
land across the river from the city's historic district, that they
haven't particularly minded that it opened as something of a work
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Westin's ballrooms and restaurants have been hopping with
meetings and parties since the December debut of the 16-story
Regency-style hotel with twin turrets and pricey details. Never
mind that the much-hyped Greenbrier Spa is still not finished and
won't be until April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers can play 18 holes on the resort's lush golf course,
designed by the legendary Sam Snead. But forget about grabbing a
cold one at the clubhouse: It's not finished either.
</P>
<P>
   Locals would encourage you not to sweat the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Savannahians may love their city's cobblestone streets,
wrought-iron-enclosed gardens and oak-draped squares, but they are
not immune to a Stylish New Thing. Especially when it's as pretty
as the Westin, which sits on the banks of Hutchinson Island like
some younger cousin of St. Petersburg's Don CeSar.
</P>
<P>
   At twilight, the sun drapes the Westin's salmon-colored stucco
in dreamy washes of shell and lemon. Viewed from River Street
against the empty sky of the 18-hole golf course behind it, its
outline seems etched in dark pearl, a beacon for the steady stream
of locals and visitors who cross nightly by water taxi to play
here.
</P>
<P>
   AquaStar, the Westin's twinkly shrine to local seafood, draws
them with Lowcountry favorites and picture-window views of the
water and the lamp-lit city beyond. Meeting rooms are abuzz with
conventioneers and salesmen. And it's often hard to find a seat in
the tiny Midnight Sun bar (named for a song by native son Johnny
Mercer) overlooking river and marsh.
</P>
<P>
   With 403 rooms, the Westin is the biggest hotel this city _ so
rich in fancy B&AMP;Bs _ has ever seen. What's more, its construction
on this undeveloped stretch makes it the island's first real
destination (unless you count the former kaolin plant, boat garages
or racetrack). But it's not its last: The 330,000-square-foot
Savannah International Trade and Convention Center, expected to
inject $150 million yearly into the local economy, has its grand
opening May 5-6. Mixed-use housing and shops are planned as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting about the Westin is that it's an upscale,
self-contained resort,'' says Tony Schopp, president of the
Savannah Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``It's the first we've had
here in Savannah in 20 years.'' (A Sheraton resort opened on
Wilmington Island, about eight miles away, in the '70s and closed
in the '90s).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bringing Savannah its first championship golf
course, the Westin's proximity to the convention center makes it
the only resort in the country adjacent to a civic building of that
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of the city's visitors come to River Street,''
Schopp adds. ``Now when they look across the river, they see growth
_ but we're not compromising the integrity of our historic
district. It's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Westin's attention to detail continues inside. Reproduction
antiques, ornate rugs and kaleidoscopic blown-glass sculptures and
lamps fill the front lobby. As you'd expect from someplace so close
to the Savannah College of Art and Design, original art adorns the
walls. Atlantan Virginia Cannon, director of the Soho Myriad Art
Network, curated the SCAD-heavy collection, which includes
sculptures, photos and paintings of waterfront life and Savannah
vistas. Margaret Tolbert's sea-colored tile installation ``North
Florida Springs Mosaic'' arches over the main floor's grand
stairway, and work by Atlanta photographers Rob Brinson and Kathryn
Kolb crops up in hallways and alcoves.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's a resort, guest rooms are plush. The Westin's
10-layer ``Heavenly Bed'' _ piled high with comforter, down
blanket, duvet and three high-thread-count sheets and five pillows,
all in white _ is crisp truth in advertising. (But if your
shoulders are crying for a few hours with a masseuse, you'll have
to look elsewhere until the Greenbrier opens in late April. The
concierge can suggest a couple of substitutes, including the
Rejuvenation Center on Paulsen Street, about 15 minutes away. He'll
also arrange the gratis ride there and back.)
</P>
<P>
   In-room art is not the typical landscapes and florals of most
hotel chains, but the same kind of carefully selected work
displayed downstairs. Ours had chic architectural photos of rusted
hinges and locks, so reflective of this town's lived-in glory.
</P>
<P>
   Being on this side of the river means it's quiet at most hours,
the only sound being the musical traffic of boats. In post-midnight
blackness, we watched an impossibly huge (and barely lit) freighter
slide past our fourth-floor perch almost soundlessly. Yet another
reason to reserve a riverside room.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you tire of hotel life, twice-hourly water taxis whisk
you to River Street in less than two minutes. Savannah's 2
1/2-square-mile historic district is compact enough to explore by
foot, and when you're ready for a nap, the watercab gets you back
to your room in no time.
</P>
<P>
   On a take-it-easy weekend, your biggest struggle may be deciding
where to eat. Everyone has a suggestion, but we found the lunch
crowd outside The Lady and Son's on West Congress Street on the
right track. Twenty minutes after adding our names to the list, we
were elbowing our way to the best buffet in town. Piled high with
Southern classics (three meats, including light and tender fried
chicken, and nine vegetables, from sweet potatoes to greens), it
also had surprisingly tasty spaghetti and meat sauce. And great
desserts and salad are included in the $9.99 price ($12.99 on
Sundays).
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, the Southwestern-style Tucson Grill on Broughton,
famous for preparing impossibly fresh guacamole right at your
table, hit the mark. Then we ducked back to the hotel for a
nightcap at the Midnight Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back across the water at the soft lights of Savannah's
historic district, we marveled at the city's considerable charms _
both enduring and new.

   SEATTLE _ Like all great cities, this Pacific Northwest
metropolis comprises a series of thriving neighborhoods, little
towns themselves that make the whole greater than the sum of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Seattle's famous places are already etched into every
traveler's consciousness, such as the Space Needle and Pike Place
Market.
</P>
<P>
   But visit Capitol Hill for a different, eye-opening take on the
vital, energizing Emerald City. It's not the highlight of the tour
maps, but neither is it so strange that it's unwelcoming to
visitors. Capitol Hill is an appealing mishmash of the youth scene,
the gay community, liberal arts colleges, parks, shopping and
moviegoing.
</P>
<P>
   As any Seattle resident will tell you, this neighborhood up the
hill from downtown is ideal for a great day of hanging out,
traipsing from coffee shop to movie house, from bookstore to ethnic
restaurant. Capitol Hill combines the best elements of Atlanta's
Midtown, Virginia-Highland and Little Five Points _ with some of
the finest views of the city amid all the greenery and glimpses of
Elliott Bay and other surrounding bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, order one of those ubiquitous espressos Seattle is
known for. You'll want to stay sharp for our walking tour.

 FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE (For
 use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ARTICLE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT; ALSO
MOVING IN THE
 ``K'' CATEGORY)
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Liv''e? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star
Trek''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the ``Washington Post'' and the ``New York Times''.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The'' ``Next Generatio''n) to the current version (``Star
Trek: Voyage''r), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment:'' ``Earth,'' sent an agent from the future
into Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the
arms race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of'' ``Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled `The Wrath of Khan.`
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next''
``Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Countr''y),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' '' &QL;

 &HT;    GORE MORE VICTIMIZED THAN GUILTY OF FALSEHOODS, PRESS CRITICS
SAY
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects Gore quote in graf 25; changes ``said'' to
``recalled'' in graf 33.
 &HT;    1720&AMP;add. With GORE-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politicians embellish, and Vice President Al Gore
is no exception. But press critics, led by Bob Somerby, Gore's
college roommate, say that media coverage of Gore's exaggerations
have themselves been exaggerated to the point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say Gore has been unfairly portrayed as a delusional
``Zelig''-like figure and an untrustworthy political ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the portrait is partly rooted in exaggerated or
inaccurate accounts of Gore claiming he uncovered the Love Canal
toxic waste scandal, ``invented'' the Internet, inspired the novel
``Love Story,'' and spent summers doing back-breaking chores on the
family farm in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts continue to appear in news stories and opinion
columns, and have become a theme of attacks by Gore's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some have become so deeply embedded in the coverage of the
presidential campaign that Gore himself has simply apologized for
misimpressions, apparently in order to avoid further controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line reporters and biographers who know Gore best say
the vice president himself is responsible for the atmosphere of
skepticism that permeates their coverage. His tendency to embellish
his accomplishments and rewrite his biography are well documented,
they note.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coverage of Gore's campaign has triggered a backlash
from media critics and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the venom that the press directs at Al
Gore,'' said Joanne McGlynn, a New Hampshire high school teacher
whose students have been waging their own campaign to correct the
record about a visit Gore made to their school last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, in a recent interview, said, ``The image of the
Washington press corps from `All The President's Men' is a couple
of young guys pounding the pavement, trying to get it right, trying
to beat the other guy. But that's just not the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of being entrepreneurial, they seem to be
desperate to stay on script. There's this tremendous uniformity of
expression. And there is clearly a code of silence _ a tacit
agreement that you never, never criticize another journalist in the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, a native of Boston, delights in boxing the ears of
media stars inside the Washington Beltway from his home in nearby
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Somerby's targets dismiss him and his Web site, The
Daily Howler (www.dailyhowler.com), as an unofficial arm of the
Gore presidential campaign. Somerby shared a dorm room at Harvard
University with Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby remains a friend of the vice president, but denies that
the Gore campaign has any involvement in his efforts. In fact,
Somerby is now beginning to take aim at what he believes is unfair
press coverage of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's likely
opponent in the White House general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent New York Times interview with Bush in which
the paper reported that Bush had said he had not ``learned''
anything from his tough Republican primary contest with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'learn' _ it's like Gore 'inspired' 'Love Story,'
'invented' the Internet, 'discovered' Love Canal,'' said Somerby.
``Those verbs were never uttered by either man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a recent U.S. News and World Report article
which called both Bush and Gore ``dim bulbs.'' ``I don't know
Governor Bush, but I would suggest you can't run a state as big as
Texas if you are a dim bulb,'' he said. ``But it's another case of
the media elite asserting their superiority over politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a recent interview with Cox Newspapers, declined to
address the issue of his ``exaggerations.'' But he referred the
interviewer to Somerby's Web site. ``You'll get a kick out of it,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby taught the fifth grade in Baltimore public schools for
13 years before becoming a stand-up comedian in 1981. He also began
writing free-lance commentaries for the Baltimore Sun, occasionally
in defense of his old Harvard roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby launched the Daily Howler in early 1998 after the Sun
rejected a commentary criticizing media coverage of President
Clinton's political supporters staying overnight in the Lincoln
Bedroom at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, `Ohhh, articles on the national press corps don't
get published,' '' he said, slapping his forehead in mock surprise.
``Articles criticizing Clinton will. Articles criticizing (former
House Speaker Newt) Gingrich will. Articles criticizing The
Washington Post and The New York Times won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two magazine articles highly critical of the Post and the Times
coverage of Gore have been published recently by The Washington
Monthly and Brill's Content. Both articles focused on how difficult
it has been to stop the reverberation of a small reporting error by
the Post and Times about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Love Canal'' incident provides a textbook example of how
the candidate, the press and the public have come to view the
veracity of candidates and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting error grew out of Gore's Nov. 30 visit to Concord
High School in Concord, N.H. In response to a student's question,
Gore cautioned against cynicism about the political process. He
illustrated his point with a story about how he had received a
letter from a high school girl in Tennessee when he was in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which complained about toxic waste in Toone, Tenn.,
eventually led to Gore holding the first congressional hearings on
Love Canal, an upstate New York neighborhood contaminated by
chemical waste during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for a congressional investigation and a hearing,''
Gore said in the course of a seven-minute response. ``I looked
around the country for other sites like that. I found a little
place in upstate New York called Love Canal. Had the first hearing
on that issue, and Toone, Tennessee _ that was the one that you
didn't hear of _ but that was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's Ceci Connolly and the Times's Katharine Seelye quoted
Gore as having said, ``I was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The misquote was widely cited as evidence of Gore's tendency to
exaggerate or falsify his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's George Stephanopoulos said it was an example of Gore's
``Pinocchio problem.'' MSNBC's Chris Matthews, host of the program
``Hardball,'' talked about Gore's ``Zelig'' condition, a reference
to the Woody Allen character who appeared in a procession of
historical events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the guy who said he was the main character in `Love
Story,' `I invented the Internet, I invented Love Canal,' chortled
Matthews. ``Isn't it getting to be delusionary?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews continued in this line even though he had played a tape
of Gore's remarks to correct the Post and Times accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his remarks at Concord High, Gore issued a
statement apologizing for any misimpression he may have created
with his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Post printed a correction seven days after the event, and
the Times printed one after 10 days. In the meantime, both
newspapers ran additional stories exploring Gore's exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   Seelye, in an interview last week, repeated her earlier
contention that the controversy was ``overblown.'' She also noted
that another statement by Gore about Love Canal provided the
context for the misquote. ``The vice president clearly said, 'I
found a little town in upstate New York called Love Canal','' she
recalled. ``And the vice president has never disputed that quote.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, reluctantly agreeing to discuss the matter last week _
``I don't generally want to be a part of a story,'' she explained _
insisted that ``the one word did not change the context that the
vice president had claimed to have found Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that Gore had apologized for causing a
misunderstanding, ``a rare occurrence with the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor, which helped
publicize the reporting error, said last week that ``in an age in
which this morning's newspaper account is tonight's talk-show
ridicule, the premium on accuracy is higher than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Gore's appearance at Concord High, late-night
comedian David Letterman issued his ``Top Ten Other Achievements
Claimed By Al Gore'' _ ``No. 1, Gave Mankind Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage of Gore's visit prompted the students in Joanne
McGlynn's English class at Concord High to issue their own press
release under the heading: ``Top 10 Reasons Why Many Concord High
Students Feel Betrayed by Some of the Media Coverage of Al Gore's
Visit to Their School.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students are ``still charged up about how things are
covered'' by the media, McGlynn said in a telephone interview from
her school last week. ``They're concerned, but they aren't cynical
... yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlynn said that while Gore had intended to caution her
students about cynicism, ``It was troubling to see that message get
lost because the press is so cynical about politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear him telling that story totally as self-aggrandizing
because that's the story they are ready to hear about Al Gore,''
she said. ``They've got a pre-existing script about Al Gore, and so
that story fit their script.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of a new
biography, ``Inventing Al Gore,'' which includes the inaccurate
``Love Canal'' account, acknowledged that some reporters are ``on a
kind of hair trigger'' with Gore because of earlier exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as ``falsehoods'' Gore's claims that his marijuana
smoking in the 1960s and 1970s was infrequent, that his work as a
newspaper reporter in Tennessee led to the imprisonment of two
Nashville city councilmen, that he took direct enemy fire as an
information specialist in Vietnam, and that he made very few
fund-raising telephone calls from the White House during the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like on `Love Canal' there probably was a rush to
judgment based on some garbled quotes,'' Turque said in an
interview last week. ``But I don't think we're being unfair. What
happens is when you establish a reputation like that, all the
little stuff sticks to you that you might have gotten a pass on if
all this other stuff hadn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Somerby claims that Gore is subjected to a different standard
than the other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby cites the example of McCain, heralded for his honesty
with reporters riding his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was lying straight to their faces that he didn't know
about the Catholic Voter Alert,'' Somerby said, referring to the
McCain-financed organization that was calling Republican voters
with allegations of anti-Catholic bias against Bush during the GOP
primary. ``Meanwhile, they're sifting through 25-year-old letters
Gore wrote to see if they can find some comma out of place, because
the theme on Gore is, Gore makes up things, but McCain is a
straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby said he does not object to criticism of Gore, even from
the Republican National Committee (RNC), which sends faxes to
newsrooms around the country repeating some of the inaccuracies
about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the `Love Canal' case, the RNC actually changed the Gore
misquote to make it grammatically correct. The RNC fax quoted Gore
as saying, ``I was the one who started it all,'' along with an
analysis from RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson: ``It's a pattern of
phoniness _ and it would be funny if it weren't also a little
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Yu, an RNC spokesman, defended the RNC's action. ``We
worked off what was reported and we stand by our statement,'' Yu
said last week. ``Al Gore got caught trying to rewrite history. He
did not find a place in upstate New York called Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it not news that factually inaccurate press releases
are coming out every day and are being written up in major
papers?'' Somerby asked. ``Isn't it the normal process of the press
to sift through everything for accuracy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be,'' said Bob Parry, editor of the investigative
magazine American Dispatches and author of a recent Washington
Monthly cover article, ``He's No Pinocchio: How the Press Has
Exaggerated Al Gore's Exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Journalism 101, especially in political coverage, has been
replaced by journalism that values entertainment above all else,''
Parry said in an interview last week. Parry is and editor of a Web
site, www.consortiumnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas columnist and author of the book ``Fools
For Scandal,'' a scathing critique of the Washington press coverage
of the Clinton presidency, is just as critical of the Gore
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting the news is not enough,'' Lyons said from Little
Rock in a telephone interview last week. ``You've got to be seen to
be witty. You've got to say things cleverly. And you've got to
assert your superiority to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that celebrity journalists ``achieve a
unanimity'' of views because ``they don't have time to do their own
work any more, they're so busy running from one TV station to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Somerby plans the next edition of The Daily Howler
with no illusions that anything in Washington is going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington press corps is where comedy was, say, 12 years
ago _ it's cool to be negative and dark,'' he said. ``But the
comedy world almost killed itself 12 years ago with all that Andrew
Dice Clay negativity. And that's why people are tuning politics
out.''

 &HT;    Laugh tracks: NASCAR drivers, crews add smiles to the miles
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that NASCAR has gone big-time with a mega-bucks television
deal, stock-car racing probably will get more serious. But
participants in the sport still enjoy laughing at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is like dark comedy,'' driver Kyle Petty said. ``You
make fun of all the serious stuff. You make fun of wrecks, just so
you don't have to think about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Race long enough, Petty said, and three things are certain to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to leave the garage area at some point, ride
around, build up speed on the backstretch, and the hood's going to
blow straight up, because they left the hood pins out,'' Petty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime during the race, you're going to leave a pit stop,
and your tires are going to run off, because they didn't get the
lug nuts on, because you left too soon. Sometime during your
career, you're going to hit the wall so hard that you don't know
where you're at until the Wednesday or Thursday of that week.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, of course, is three for three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the wall early,'' he said. ``I just left the hood pins
out on purpose to get it over with. And you feel like an idiot when
the wheels are falling off. Everybody's done it. It's just
miscommunication. You're thinking you're going to change two tires;
they're thinking you're going to change four. While they're
changing the right side, they're taking the left side lug nuts off.
They drop the jack, you take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a wreck at Indianapolis that makes Petty look
humorously at racing's dark side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew a tire going into turn four, and I hit the outside
wall,'' Petty recalled. ``I hit a ton. It knocked me just goofy.
Then I hit again, and I thought I had hit the outside wall and come
back across the race track and hit the inside wall. That's really
all I remember. Then I kind of woke up and they were trying to get
me out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``What had happened was I hit the outside wall, I came back
across the track, and Sterling Marlin hit me in the left front and
drove the wheel up on the motor, and it hung the accelerator wide
open. I went back and hit the outside wall again, then it came
across and hit the inside wall. I don't remember the last two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in this car, and I wake up, and I'm all slumped over. The
rescue guy's talking to me, and I'm like, `Yeah.' I got my eyes
closed. You ever wake up in the morning and you're in a fog? You
know things are going on, but you're not really sure it's a dream
or whether you're awake. So I'm kind of in a fog and I'm praying.
I'm praying that if I did die that I'm going to heaven. I told 'em
I'd heard Sterling Marlin talking, and I knew I'd died and gone to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was removed from the car and lifted on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they went to pick me up, they said I'd scream. A
blood-curdling scream. And they'd set me back down. They did it
three times. Finally, they realized when the guy went to pick me
up, he was standing on my pony tail. Every time he'd go to pick me
up, it'd stretch my head back. Sterling had to get them off my pony
tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, when I get in a car, I always take my pony
tail and double it and put another band around it, so it doesn't
hang out too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of NASCAR's humor is grim.
</P>
<P>
   One year during a race at Daytona, crew chief Tony Liberati got
distracted listening to MRN Radio's coverage. ``The radio said,
`The caution's coming out!' `` Liberati said. ``And I went running,
jumping up, throwing my hands up in the air, saying the caution's
coming out.'' Liberati was signaling driver Michael Waltrip to slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, MRN was playing a Daytona flashback of a wreck 15
years earlier between Cale Yarborough and David Pearson.
``Everybody looked at me like I was stupid. Once I realized what
I'd done, I sort of just sat there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Jeremy Mayfield raced go-karts, which intrigued his
mother, Judy Gordon. She started racing, too, and one night she was
running against her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were side by side, and going into the turn she cut across
me a little bit,'' Mayfield said. ``It was just enough to spin her
out. It didn't hurt her or anything, just spun her out. What made
it bad was it wasn't anything intentional at all, but, all of the
sudden there's ol' Jeremy turning his Mom. One guy said once, `You
hear about guys who'd spin their mother out to win a race, but
Jeremy actually did it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty remembers when he started racing late models and
thought he was cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed up one night for practice and was horsing around and
talking to people,'' Petty said. ``It got time to put on my uniform
for practice, and I realized I had forgotten to bring it. I ended
up sitting around having to explain to everyone who walked by why I
was sitting there in street clothes, waiting for my Mom to bring my
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are a little more relaxed in the Winston Cup garage area,
now that Henry Benfield has retired. Benfield, former gas man for
the No. 4 car, was racing's most notorious practical joker.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years, he delighted in serving opposing crew
members brownies baked with Ex-Lax and lemonade mixed with citrate
of magnesia. ``If you see somebody running, you'd better get out of
the way, because he has got to go,'' Benfield said.
</P>
<P>
   He also has sprayed racing gas on the toilet paper in the garage
restroom. ``You can hear those boys splashing water to cool off,''
he said. He teases the mechanics he knows are afraid of snakes by
throwing grass snakes at them. ``They even jump when you throw your
belt or a piece of rope,'' he said.

 &HT;    News and notes from the Winston Cup ciruit
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young and hungry: As exemplified with Tony Stewart last year,
NASCAR thrives when new, young stars arrive and succeed. Dale
Earnhardt Jr. might have be one of the most hyped rookies to enter
the Winston Cup circuit, but he proved he belonged in the big time
with his string of top 10 qualifying efforts this season and,
finally, by driving down victory last week at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little E'' predicts he won't be the last rookie to win in
2000. Who will be next rookie to roll down Victory Lane: Matt
Kenseth? Scott Pruett? Perhaps we'll find out at Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING HEADLINES: Our take on the sport's top stories
</P>
<P>
   Tide driver involved in dirty deal: Scott Pruett was the
feel-good story of Texas for awhile. The rookie suffered the
embarrassment of failing to make the field at Bristol and
Darlington, but rallied back in sensational fashion by qualifying
third in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett stunned race fans by taking the lead on the fourth lap,
but was knocked out of contention a dozen laps later after three
consecutive bumps in the rear by Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD:
</P>
<P>
   Long-overdue rule to be enforced: The most dangerous place to
work in NASCAR this year has been on pit road, not behind a
steering wheel. Many of the mishaps have occurred because of tires
left outside of the pit box.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's governing body announced that beginning Sunday,
teams will be penalized if right-side tires are left outside of the
pit box. Thankfully, no one was killed or seriously injured before
NASCAR finally took action.
</P>
<P>
   Will a record be broken? The Winston Cup Series has had a
roaring start in 2000 with seven different winners in seven races.
How long will this streak of different winners continue?
</P>
<P>
   Eight different winners in a row to start the season would be a
modern-era record. What's truly amazing is Jeff Gordon and Tony
Stewart, who combined for a total of 10 wins in 1999, have been
blocked from victory lane so far. Three-time Winston Cup champ
Gordon has gone 12 races without a top-five finish _ the worst
drought of his Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   POWER INDEX: FAST TALKERS
</P>
<P>
   These drivers know their way around a microphone
</P>
<P>
   1. Jimmy Spencer _ Last month at Atlanta, moments after Dale
Jarrett openly blasted the press for continuing to harp on ``boring
racing,'' Spencer held court in the infield media center and talked
about how racing really was dull and what could be done to fix it.
This is one driver that shoots straight from the hip.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jeff Gordon _ The true measure of a driver is how they react
when things are not going well. This season has been disastrous for
Gordon _ by his standards. Yet, the Chevy No. 24 driver has refused
to run and hide from the media, unlike many other high-profile
drivers do in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kyle Petty _ Ten years ago Petty was still getting questions
about the length of his hair. Today it's more than an afterthought
as he definitely does things his way. Petty is similar to Spencer
in a free-spirit manner of speaking, only he is much more radical
and funny. Son Adam will likely surpass his father down the road as
the best Petty spokeman.
</P>
<P>
   4. Darrell Waltrip _ D.W. revolutionized the way that the media
covers NASCAR. Twenty years ago few drivers realized the potential
of television. Most disappeared when they saw the cameras; not
Waltrip. In fact, he sought out the media and his wit, ability to
speak well, and tremendous on-camera presence was actually a
wake-up call to the rest of the drivers in the garage. He is
considered one of the master's of the one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   5. Rusty Wallace _ The Ford No. 2 crew likely cost Wallace a
shot at winning the Daytona 500 and they were not much better at
Rockingham. Who informed the press of these shortcomings about the
crew? Rusty Wallace. This Missouri native can never be accused of
being muzzled during an interview. Over the years he has been vocal
about other drivers, rule changes and even his current teammate.
</P>
<P>
   These NASCAR pros tell it like it is during interviews
</P>
<P>
   1. Larry McReynolds _ This part-time commentator for TNN
expresses himself well when discussing technical issues. He held
his ground in 1998 when being critical of Dale Earnhardt, the
driver he worked with for 18 months. He said that Earnhardt was not
``focused,'' which may have turned Earnhardt's career around.
</P>
<P>
   2. Todd Parrott _ Like father, like son. Buddy Parrott, team
manager for Jeff Burton, is a no-nonsense talker with a quick wit.
Todd Parrott, who makes the calls for Dale Jarrett, is built in the
same mold, and not afraid to hold his tongue on any issue. At Texas
Parrott chewed out Jarrett for giving teammate Ricky Rudd a lap
when a caution flag was raised. Parrott turned to a reporter and
said, ``That was Rudd's break for the day; they'll have to get the
rest on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Robin Pemberton _ A little more mild-mannered than Rusty
Wallace, his outspoken driver, Pemberton will respond to a question
with a direct answer. Great one-liners, and known to return calls
to reporters while testing in a wind tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kevin Hamlin _ Faces the pressure of working for one of the
all-time greats, Dale Earnhardt. When ``The Intimidator'' gets
moody and doesn't have time to bother with media, Hamlin steps in.
He is a man of few words, but makes them count with valuable
insight.
</P>
<P>
   5. Andy Petree _ Owner of the No. 33 car and crew chief for
driver Joe Nemechek. Petree is never short on opinions. He
recognizes the importance of the media, and takes the proper time
to explain NASCAR rules or issues at length _ and in laymen's
terms.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, for the second time in his career, John Andretti
enters a Winston Cup race as a defending champion. He recently
spoke with Cox News Service reporter Rick Minter:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does it feel to drive the No. 43 car, which won 200 races
and seven championships with your car owner, Richard Petty, at the
wheel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an ideal situation for me. A lot of driver who have
driven the No. 43 feel like they get caught in the King's shadow. I
like to get caught in the King's shadow. There are a lot of good
things that go with it, but there's also a tremendous amount of
responsibility because this car sort of identifies Winston Cup
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Richard Petty talk to you on the radio during races?
</P>
<P>
   A: Very, very seldom do I ever hear his voice. I know that if I
hear his voice, either I'm in trouble or somebody else is. Usually
I only hear from him if I get in a fight on the race track with the
race cars. He always tells me that if I want to take something out,
don't take it out on my race car.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the fact that you're leaving Pontiac and getting a new
Dodge ready for next year going be a detriment this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pontiac hasn't changed in a few years, so we're pretty
set with it. We've got a lot of work to do with the new Dodge, but
we should be ready to come out of the gate fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you and your uncle, Mario Andretti, talk a lot about
racing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every time I do well in a race, I get a call from him. He's
usually the first or second message on my answering machine. That
really makes me feel good. I grew up with him, but I just didn't
realize who he was or how much he's done until I got older. Then I
was sort of intimidated by him, but when you get next to him and
talk to him, he's just like everybody else. But I have a lot of
admiration for everything he's done. It's the same with my
godfather, A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you're likely to be compared to racing legends Richard
Petty, Mario Andretti and A.J. Foyt, what kind of career will you
have to have to satisfy yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a lot of ways, you're never going to be satisfied. The
King, Uncle Mario and A.J., they're not satisfied, because they
could have won one more 500 and they should have. I want to be
ultra successful, not so much for the fans, but so my peers _ the
people in the garage area _ will respect what I've done. That will
determine whether I'm satisfied or not.

 &HT;    GORE MORE VICTIMIZED THAN GUILTY OF FALSEHOODS, PRESS CRITICS
SAY

``recalled'' in graf 33.
 &HT;    1720&AMP;add. With GORE-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politicians embellish, and Vice President Al Gore
is no exception. But press critics, led by Bob Somerby, Gore's
college roommate, say that media coverage of Gore's exaggerations
have themselves been exaggerated to the point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say Gore has been unfairly portrayed as a delusional
``Zelig''-like figure and an untrustworthy political ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   They say the portrait is partly rooted in exaggerated or
inaccurate accounts of Gore claiming he uncovered the Love Canal
toxic waste scandal, ``invented'' the Internet, inspired the novel
``Love Story,'' and spent summers doing back-breaking chores on the
family farm in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts continue to appear in news stories and opinion
columns, and have become a theme of attacks by Gore's political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some have become so deeply embedded in the coverage of the
presidential campaign that Gore himself has simply apologized for
misimpressions, apparently in order to avoid further controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line reporters and biographers who know Gore best say
the vice president himself is responsible for the atmosphere of
skepticism that permeates their coverage. His tendency to embellish
his accomplishments and rewrite his biography are well documented,
they note.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coverage of Gore's campaign has triggered a backlash
from media critics and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the venom that the press directs at Al
Gore,'' said Joanne McGlynn, a New Hampshire high school teacher
whose students have been waging their own campaign to correct the
record about a visit Gore made to their school last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, in a recent interview, said, ``The image of the
Washington press corps from `All The President's Men' is a couple
of young guys pounding the pavement, trying to get it right, trying
to beat the other guy. But that's just not the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of being entrepreneurial, they seem to be
desperate to stay on script. There's this tremendous uniformity of
expression. And there is clearly a code of silence _ a tacit
agreement that you never, never criticize another journalist in the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby, a native of Boston, delights in boxing the ears of
media stars inside the Washington Beltway from his home in nearby
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Somerby's targets dismiss him and his Web site, The
Daily Howler (www.dailyhowler.com), as an unofficial arm of the
Gore presidential campaign. Somerby shared a dorm room at Harvard
University with Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby remains a friend of the vice president, but denies that
the Gore campaign has any involvement in his efforts. In fact,
Somerby is now beginning to take aim at what he believes is unfair
press coverage of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's likely
opponent in the White House general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent New York Times interview with Bush in which
the paper reported that Bush had said he had not ``learned''
anything from his tough Republican primary contest with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word 'learn' _ it's like Gore 'inspired' 'Love Story,'
'invented' the Internet, 'discovered' Love Canal,'' said Somerby.
``Those verbs were never uttered by either man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a recent U.S. News and World Report article
which called both Bush and Gore ``dim bulbs.'' ``I don't know
Governor Bush, but I would suggest you can't run a state as big as
Texas if you are a dim bulb,'' he said. ``But it's another case of
the media elite asserting their superiority over politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a recent interview with Cox Newspapers, declined to
address the issue of his ``exaggerations.'' But he referred the
interviewer to Somerby's Web site. ``You'll get a kick out of it,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby taught the fifth grade in Baltimore public schools for
13 years before becoming a stand-up comedian in 1981. He also began
writing free-lance commentaries for the Baltimore Sun, occasionally
in defense of his old Harvard roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby launched the Daily Howler in early 1998 after the Sun
rejected a commentary criticizing media coverage of President
Clinton's political supporters staying overnight in the Lincoln
Bedroom at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, `Ohhh, articles on the national press corps don't
get published,' '' he said, slapping his forehead in mock surprise.
``Articles criticizing Clinton will. Articles criticizing (former
House Speaker Newt) Gingrich will. Articles criticizing The
Washington Post and The New York Times won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two magazine articles highly critical of the Post and the Times
coverage of Gore have been published recently by The Washington
Monthly and Brill's Content. Both articles focused on how difficult
it has been to stop the reverberation of a small reporting error by
the Post and Times about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Love Canal'' incident provides a textbook example of how
the candidate, the press and the public have come to view the
veracity of candidates and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting error grew out of Gore's Nov. 30 visit to Concord
High School in Concord, N.H. In response to a student's question,
Gore cautioned against cynicism about the political process. He
illustrated his point with a story about how he had received a
letter from a high school girl in Tennessee when he was in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which complained about toxic waste in Toone, Tenn.,
eventually led to Gore holding the first congressional hearings on
Love Canal, an upstate New York neighborhood contaminated by
chemical waste during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for a congressional investigation and a hearing,''
Gore said in the course of a seven-minute response. ``I looked
around the country for other sites like that. I found a little
place in upstate New York called Love Canal. Had the first hearing
on that issue, and Toone, Tennessee _ that was the one that you
didn't hear of _ but that was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's Ceci Connolly and the Times's Katharine Seelye quoted
Gore as having said, ``I was the one that started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The misquote was widely cited as evidence of Gore's tendency to
exaggerate or falsify his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's George Stephanopoulos said it was an example of Gore's
``Pinocchio problem.'' MSNBC's Chris Matthews, host of the program
``Hardball,'' talked about Gore's ``Zelig'' condition, a reference
to the Woody Allen character who appeared in a procession of
historical events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the guy who said he was the main character in `Love
Story,' `I invented the Internet, I invented Love Canal,' chortled
Matthews. ``Isn't it getting to be delusionary?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews continued in this line even though he had played a tape
of Gore's remarks to correct the Post and Times accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his remarks at Concord High, Gore issued a
statement apologizing for any misimpression he may have created
with his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Post printed a correction seven days after the event, and
the Times printed one after 10 days. In the meantime, both
newspapers ran additional stories exploring Gore's exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   Seelye, in an interview last week, repeated her earlier
contention that the controversy was ``overblown.'' She also noted
that another statement by Gore about Love Canal provided the
context for the misquote. ``The vice president clearly said, 'I
found a little town in upstate New York called Love Canal','' she
recalled. ``And the vice president has never disputed that quote.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, reluctantly agreeing to discuss the matter last week _
``I don't generally want to be a part of a story,'' she explained _
insisted that ``the one word did not change the context that the
vice president had claimed to have found Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that Gore had apologized for causing a
misunderstanding, ``a rare occurrence with the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor, which helped
publicize the reporting error, said last week that ``in an age in
which this morning's newspaper account is tonight's talk-show
ridicule, the premium on accuracy is higher than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Gore's appearance at Concord High, late-night
comedian David Letterman issued his ``Top Ten Other Achievements
Claimed By Al Gore'' _ ``No. 1, Gave Mankind Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage of Gore's visit prompted the students in Joanne
McGlynn's English class at Concord High to issue their own press
release under the heading: ``Top 10 Reasons Why Many Concord High
Students Feel Betrayed by Some of the Media Coverage of Al Gore's
Visit to Their School.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students are ``still charged up about how things are
covered'' by the media, McGlynn said in a telephone interview from
her school last week. ``They're concerned, but they aren't cynical
... yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlynn said that while Gore had intended to caution her
students about cynicism, ``It was troubling to see that message get
lost because the press is so cynical about politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear him telling that story totally as self-aggrandizing
because that's the story they are ready to hear about Al Gore,''
she said. ``They've got a pre-existing script about Al Gore, and so
that story fit their script.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and author of a new
biography, ``Inventing Al Gore,'' which includes the inaccurate
``Love Canal'' account, acknowledged that some reporters are ``on a
kind of hair trigger'' with Gore because of earlier exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as ``falsehoods'' Gore's claims that his marijuana
smoking in the 1960s and 1970s was infrequent, that his work as a
newspaper reporter in Tennessee led to the imprisonment of two
Nashville city councilmen, that he took direct enemy fire as an
information specialist in Vietnam, and that he made very few
fund-raising telephone calls from the White House during the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like on `Love Canal' there probably was a rush to
judgment based on some garbled quotes,'' Turque said in an
interview last week. ``But I don't think we're being unfair. What
happens is when you establish a reputation like that, all the
little stuff sticks to you that you might have gotten a pass on if
all this other stuff hadn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Somerby claims that Gore is subjected to a different standard
than the other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Somerby cites the example of McCain, heralded for his honesty
with reporters riding his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was lying straight to their faces that he didn't know
about the Catholic Voter Alert,'' Somerby said, referring to the
McCain-financed organization that was calling Republican voters
with allegations of anti-Catholic bias against Bush during the GOP
primary. ``Meanwhile, they're sifting through 25-year-old letters
Gore wrote to see if they can find some comma out of place, because
the theme on Gore is, Gore makes up things, but McCain is a
straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somerby said he does not object to criticism of Gore, even from
the Republican National Committee (RNC), which sends faxes to
newsrooms around the country repeating some of the inaccuracies
about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the `Love Canal' case, the RNC actually changed the Gore
misquote to make it grammatically correct. The RNC fax quoted Gore
as saying, ``I was the one who started it all,'' along with an
analysis from RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson: ``It's a pattern of
phoniness _ and it would be funny if it weren't also a little
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Yu, an RNC spokesman, defended the RNC's action. ``We
worked off what was reported and we stand by our statement,'' Yu
said last week. ``Al Gore got caught trying to rewrite history. He
did not find a place in upstate New York called Love Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it not news that factually inaccurate press releases
are coming out every day and are being written up in major
papers?'' Somerby asked. ``Isn't it the normal process of the press
to sift through everything for accuracy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be,'' said Bob Parry, editor of the investigative
magazine American Dispatches and author of a recent Washington
Monthly cover article, ``He's No Pinocchio: How the Press Has
Exaggerated Al Gore's Exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Journalism 101, especially in political coverage, has been
replaced by journalism that values entertainment above all else,''
Parry said in an interview last week. Parry is and editor of a Web
site, www.consortiumnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas columnist and author of the book ``Fools
For Scandal,'' a scathing critique of the Washington press coverage
of the Clinton presidency, is just as critical of the Gore
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting the news is not enough,'' Lyons said from Little
Rock in a telephone interview last week. ``You've got to be seen to
be witty. You've got to say things cleverly. And you've got to
assert your superiority to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that celebrity journalists ``achieve a
unanimity'' of views because ``they don't have time to do their own
work any more, they're so busy running from one TV station to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Somerby plans the next edition of The Daily Howler
with no illusions that anything in Washington is going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington press corps is where comedy was, say, 12 years
ago _ it's cool to be negative and dark,'' he said. ``But the
comedy world almost killed itself 12 years ago with all that Andrew
Dice Clay negativity. And that's why people are tuning politics
out.''

 FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE (For
 use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ARTICLE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT; ALSO
MOVING IN THE
 ``K'' CATEGORY)
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Liv''e? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star
Trek''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the ``Washington Post'' and the ``New York Times''.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The'' ``Next Generatio''n) to the current version (``Star
Trek: Voyage''r), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment:'' ``Earth,'' sent an agent from the future
into Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the
arms race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of'' ``Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled `The Wrath of Khan.`
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next''
``Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Countr''y),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' '' &QL;

   PAKISTAN-SHARIF (Karachi, Pakistan) _ Nawaz Sharif, ousted as

convicted Thursday of hijacking a commercial airliner, sentenced to
life imprisonment and ordered to forfeit all his personal property.
Standing along with six co-defendants who each were acquitted, the

``I hope I will soon be able to embrace my son.'' Justice

claiming they have been barred from the city's quintessential
public space. In his third decision regarding protests in front of
City Hall, Judge Harold Baer focused on city officials' decisions

   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES.  ALSO CHANGING SPELLING OF ``KAHN'' TO ``KHAN'') 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infrastructure, they don't fire
real weapons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commentary on
the virtues of anti-interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Khan, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Khan''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''

<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets

get shot.''

`THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT': A SWEEPING SURVEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One was described by contemporaries as ``a third-rate
nonentity,'' another as ``a total failure _ cowardly, weak, senile
and vacillating.'' Still another saved everyone the trouble when he
volunteered this self-appraisal: ``I am not fit for this office and
should never have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   A sorry lot indeed, and happily for the Republic they're gone
now; they're history. Yet for a time these men _ respectively,
Rutherford B. Hayes, James Buchanan and Warren G. Harding _ held
the highest office in the land.
</P>
<P>
   How could that have happened? Beginning Sunday night on PBS,
``The American President'' _ a sprawling, flawed, but ultimately
worthwhile 10-part documentary in which those withering assessments
are heard _ tries to supply some answers.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompts a disconcerting thought: if we're no smarter
than our forebears (and we're not), and if history repeats itself
(as it probably will), what sort of major American electoral
mistakes might be in store for the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, narrated by Hugh Sidey, Time magazine's veteran
White House correspondent, and enriched by commentary by the
eminent Harvard historian Richard E. Neustadt, shies away from
speculating about the future. But in keeping with its respectful
and celebratory tone, the series does offer a reassuring if
unsurprising moral: that no matter who has occupied the presidency,
and no matter how fit or unfit for the job he has been, a certain
genius has nevertheless presided over the land since the founders
put their experimental apparatus of laws in motion, a genius
planted not in the executive's chair but in the country's very
system of government. And that system of checks and balances, the
series makes clear, has endured, albeit fitfully and
notwithstanding the occasional mediocrity or worse at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that ``The American President'' is
weighted toward the misfits. In a manner both grandly comprehensive
and, even in 10 hours over five consecutive nights, necessarily
cursory, the documentary surveys the entire bunch, from George
Washington to Bill Clinton, acting something like the moderator of
a presidential debate as it gives roughly equal time to each.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the project's creators, Philip Kunhardt Jr. and his sons
Philip III and Peter, pride themselves on being the first
documentarians to examine the terms of all 42 presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about as far as their groundbreaking goes. The
Kunhardts have otherwise modeled their series on what has by now
become the industry standard for high-end historical documentaries.
Call it the Ken Burns approach: Find striking archival photographs
and artwork, as Burns did in his ``Civil War'' series; let the
camera pan over or zoom in on the stills to inject movement;
overlay the visuals with evocative period music; interlace with
sage commentary; and hire famous people to speak the words of
distant historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The American President,'' a star-spangled roster of
political and media figures worthy of Washington's best dinner
parties can be heard as the voices of the chief executives, and
part of the fun of watching is waiting to see who gets to be whom.
Thus we hear, among others, Bob Dole as Herbert Hoover, Andrew
Young as Thomas Jefferson (a touch of irony, given Jefferson's
reputed conduct as a slaveholder), Tim Russert as Millard Fillmore,
Ben Bradlee as Warren G. Harding and, perhaps the most inspired
choice of all, Don Imus as the unsavory Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, though, the pairings are off: Abraham Lincoln is
said to have spoken at a higher pitch, but his voice here belongs
to that basso profundo Paul Simon, the former senator from
Illinois. And Walter Cronkite (George Washington) will never be
convincing as anyone but Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   As chroniclers, the Kunhardts have wisely avoided organizing
their series by potentially deadening chronology. Instead they've
taken a thematic approach, linking and juxtaposing a handful of
presidents in each episode by a common characteristic. This makes a
livelier telling of history, and most of the groupings make sense.
One episode rounds up presidents like John Tyler and Chester A.
Arthur, who came to power through the death of a predecessor;
another groups those who made their mark in foreign affairs, like
Woodrow Wilson and George Bush. But some marriages seem strained.
Thomas Jefferson is joined with Calvin Coolidge, for example, as
men of ``executive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   What is lost in this format is the flow of history; a segment on
Ulysses S. Grant and Reconstruction, for instance, is followed by
one on Dwight D. Eisenhower and the nuclear age. Only minor damage
is done here, though; Sidey's pithy narration does well in placing
a presidential profile in context even when lifted out of
historical sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the series doesn't propose to trace an American
timeline as threaded through the executive branch. It's more a
cavalcade of presidential character, a mix-and-match primer on the
men who shaped and were shaped by events, with an emphasis on
personality, idiosyncrasy and illuminating biographical detail.

 UNDATED: biographical detail.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As such, it offers polished and intelligent television to the
general viewer but probably little news to the serious student of
history. Given so much ground to cover, much of it well-trodden,
the series by necessity sacrifices some depth as it forced to leap
from one salient point to another, leaving gaps in between. At one
point we're told how Harry S. Truman went from the bottom of the
popularity polls to an upset re-election victory over Thomas E.
Dewey. How did he pull it off? The documentary says only that
Truman refused ``to be submerged.''
</P>
<P>
   Also missing here is a range of opinion. Neustadt, whose seminal
book ``Presidential Power'' persuaded John F. Kennedy to seek out
its author for advice, provides much adroit commentary and a
charmingly rumpled professorial presence. And he is so steeped in
White House lore that he recalls each president as if he had known
him. But not only is his the final word on every president, it's
the only word. Other historians' views would have been welcome,
particularly concerning more recent presidents whose importance is
still being argued about. (With the exception of the incapacitated
Ronald Reagan, all the surviving former presidents, as well as
President Clinton, are interviewed for their segments.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the case of the impeachment-torn Clinton presidency
and the poisonously partisan environment in which it has
functioned, we're given only one sweeping conclusion to draw, and
as enunciated by Neustadt, it's a debatable _ not to mention
downbeat _ one at that. ``It is now plain,'' he says, ``that every
president, immediately upon election, attracts the serious interest
of political opponents and the professional interests of the media
in tearing him down and pushing him toward resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, then we can thank the founders one more time
for those ingenious checks and balances. &QL;

   Selling a Rubens And Other Gems
</P>
<P>
   Christie's in London seems to be getting some of Europe's
greatest collections to sell. Last summer, in a sale that totaled
$89.9 million, it auctioned Old Master paintings, objects, arms and
armor, as well as one of the world's greatest collections of
scientific instruments, which had been looted by the Nazis and
returned to the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, it will auction artworks from the Wernher collection
of Old Master paintings, French furniture, silver and Renaissance
sculpture, which was housed for nearly a century at Bath House,
Piccadilly, and at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire. The sale is expected to
bring more than $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was formed by Julius Wernher, a diamond merchant
who was a governor of De Beers, the South African diamond
conglomerate, and his friend Wilhelm von Bode, the director of the
Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. ``With the exception of families
like the Rothschilds, Wernher had a kind of taste that didn't exist
anywhere in England,'' said Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Wernher died in 1912, and his second son, Harold Wernher, who
lived at Luton Hoo, followed in his father's footsteps as a
collector and philanthropist. He died in 1973. His heirs and the
Wernher Foundation are selling these works to raise money to
preserve the rest of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's sold some of Luton Hoo's contents in 1995,
Christie's has represented the Wernher family for generations,
negotiating the sales of several paintings to a number of museums.
The most important of these transactions was the sale of ``Christ
Taking Leave of His Mother,'' by Albrecht Altorfer, to the National
Gallery in London in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of Christie's sale is a Rubens, ``Diana and
Her Nymphs Hunting'' (circa 1636-37), one of the famous series he
painted for Philip IV of Spain to display at Torre de la Parada,
the royal hunting lodge near Madrid. This oil sketch is considered
one of the best examples of Rubens' Baroque period. It is expected
to sell for $960,000 to $1.2 million. The sale also includes
Titian's ``Portrait of Giacomo Doria'' (circa 1531), estimated at
$1.1 million to $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale is outstanding silver, including two superb
examples of late Gothic figures: St. Sebastian and St. Christopher.
St. Christopher, made in 1493, is an intricate work that shows him
carrying Jesus on his shoulders across a silver river. The figures
are expected to sell for $1.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   A Picasso Problem
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit may be looming between the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art and the trust established by one of its longtime
supporters, Madeleine Haas Russell, who died last year at 84.
Russell, one of San Francisco's most important philanthropists as
well as a museum trustee and a great-grandniece of Levi Strauss,
set up the trust in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, the trust entered into an oral agreement _ which
Charles B. Cohler, a lawyer for the museum and its trustees Charles
and Helen Schwab, described as legally binding _ to sell Picasso's
``Nude on a Black Armchair,'' a 1932 portrait of his mistress
Marie-Therese Walter. The museum and the Schwabs had agreed to buy
the painting for $44 million and to pay Sotheby's a fee of 5
percent of the purchase price as its commission for negotiating the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwabs intended to make a donation to the museum to finance
its 40 percent interest in the painting. They were also prepared to
acquire the rest for themselves and to leave their share to the
museum upon their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The museum contends that the trust breached its agreement by
deciding instead to sell the painting in November at Christie's,
where Leslie Wexner, chairman of the Limited, bought it for $45.1
million. (That figure includes the $41 million purchase price plus
Christie's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10
percent of the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   Had the trust ended up selling the painting to the museum and
the Schwabs, it would have received $3 million more, and the
painting would have been on public view for at least part of each
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to memos and letters from the museum's lawyers, the
breach of contract cost the institution a prized Picasso, which
would have helped raise its attendance. It is seeking damages in
excess of $18 million, or 40 percent of what experts consider the
fair market value of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the trust say that they had no enforceable contract,
and that if the museum wanted the painting so badly, it could have
bid at auction, as it had done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the museum wait six months instead of trying to stop the
November auction? ``On Oct. 18, the museum and the Schwabs invited
the Russell Trust to resolve this question by private arbitration,
and only last week did they reject that proposal,'' Cohler said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Mead, the lawyer for the trust, said that it had promptly
rejected the October request for arbitration, and that the museum
asked again in March and again was told no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that when the museum trustees give the matter
proper consideration, they will conclude that it would be reckless
to pursue these baseless claims,'' said Mead. Cohler said, ``The
museum is considering its legal rights and remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   A Met Retirement
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
Dr. Wen C. Fong, its first consultative chairman of the department
of Asian art and its curator of Chinese painting and calligraphy,
will retire on June 30. Fong, 69, played a major role in building
the museum's Asian collection, expanding and renovating its
galleries and organizing dozens of exhibitions. Philippe de
Montebello, director of the Met, said a search for a successor
would begin immediately.

ANTIQUES: A SHOW FIT FOR PANDORA 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Costantino Fioratti, the Manhattan antiques
dealer, bought her first antique when she was 16. ``One day I found
a Gothic case covered in red silk velvet in a cardboard box at an
auction house,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it home to mother,'' Fioratti said, referring to Ruth,
Countess Costantino, one of the first female dealers in antiques
and fine art in the United States, ``and she recognized it. She
told me it was very rare and had once belonged to Mrs. Firestone.''
Thus began a passion that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helen has been buying boxes her whole life,'' said James
Montrose Sansum, her partner at L'Antiquaire and the Connoisseur, a
gallery in Manhattan, which opened in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Fioratti writes in the preface to ``Tempting Pandora,'' a
225-page book of scholarly essays, ``The box is truly a temptation
to have, to hold and, of course, to open, as poor Pandora
discovered.'' The book accompanies a show of 150 European boxes
made from 1200 to 1800, at the gallery through April 21. The show
then moves to the Foster-Gwin Gallery in San Francisco, May 16
through June 1. Prices range from $750 to $235,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Greek mythology, Pandora, the first woman on earth,
was endowed with every charm. Zeus gave her a box and told her she
must not open it. She couldn't resist and raised its lid, releasing
all the evils that have afflicted humanity ever since. The
sumptuous boxes in this show make one understand Pandora's
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   These are no mere utilitarian containers but works of art. There
are treasure boxes made for sacred relics or jewels. The group
includes reliquaries, missal coffers made for transport, gilded
leather cases for ink containers, sweetmeat boxes, game boxes,
snuff boxes and cosmetics cases. Made of ebony, ivory, metal,
leather, straw, enamel and wood, they are decorated with silver,
mother-of-pearl, tortoise shell, ivory, embroidery and precious
stones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest boxes is an enameled pyx made in Limoges,
France, about 1230. The pyx is a religious object used to hold the
Communion host or holy oil for baptisms or last rites. This one is
cylindrical, with a conical lid that once held a cross finial. It
is covered with scrolls of gilded copper on blue champleve enamel.
A reliquary coffer made in Constantinople around 1270 was once
owned by John Pierpont Morgan. It is decorated with the Tree of
Jesse, the symbolic depiction of the genealogy of Jesus, and
illustrates the line from the prophet Isaiah: ``And there shall
come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow
out of its roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a red cloak, Jesse is shown sleeping on one side of the
box. Tree branches encircle his son David and other Biblical
ancestors of Jesus. An angel wearing a cuirass and grasping a
scabbard is probably Michael, the archangel warrior. On another
side, a different angel appears in a dream to a figure that is
probably Joseph, warning him to flee Bethlehem and the massacre of
the innocents. The stylized, finely painted faces recall Byzantine
mosaic saints.
</P>
<P>
   Other boxes have no religious significance. In the catalog, the
Baltimore art historian Dr. Martha A. McCrory writes about the
forziere, the painted marriage chest that Italians made in the 14th
and 15th centuries to furnish the camera, or main room, in an
Italian palazzo. The show has several examples of the forziere,
which ``accompanied the bride when she arrived in her new home,
where it served to contain clothing and linens,'' McCrory writes.
``The furniture in the camera was not renewed during the course of
a marriage and was thus an important nuptial acquisition, sometimes
ordered from the most important painters of a city.''
</P>
<P>
   Fioratti added: ``After a wedding such chests were paraded
through the streets to show people how rich and important the
couple was. Only later on, when they were safely inside, did the
husband open it. Often there was a painting of a nude female figure
on the inside of the lid to show the husband what he was getting.''
</P>
<P>
   She has several French strongboxes from the 15th century. They
look like trunks. ``We see the shape as an early Spanish form, but
it was probably influenced by Arab cabinets brought to Spain,''
Sansum said. ``Strongboxes were made by the craftsmen who fashioned
arms and armor.'' The boxes are sheathed with interlocking iron
loops, like chain mail. Some have locks with hidden keyholes. ``You
have to push a secret lever to release the keyhole cover,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the safes is lined in cream-colored linen that is held in
place by bright red leather cross bands secured with golden studs.
The inside is as sumptuous as the outside is forbidding. Other
boxes, originally inspired by Middle Eastern cases designed to hold
the Koran, are inlaid with ivory, ebony, stained bone and precious
woods arranged in geometric motifs. Merchants in the Levantine sold
such inlaid wood boxes to Italy, and the Venetians copied them. The
boxes in the show are Venetian and are decorated in orange, green,
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   One case, which was made to hold an ink container, is covered in
leather. The leather is elaborately tooled with scrolling foliage
patterns. The catalog says the technique of boiling leather to make
cases dates back to Neolithic times and became popular in France
and England only in the 14th century. The leather was softened in
water, molded into a shape, then dried in moderate heat until it
hardened. It was then decorated by incising lines with a pointed
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leather was used to protect precious things that had to be
constantly transported, like books with miniatures or scribes' ink
wells,'' she said. ``If you were an important person, everything
you carried had to show how important you were. You had to have
beautiful accouterments.''
</P>
<P>
   Antique boxes covered in embroidery, applique or needlework are
rare because the ground material, usually silk, faded or
disintegrated in sunlight. The decoration was usually figural,
floral or geometric. ``Many embroideries resembled plans for
landscape architecture, such as the parterres of Versailles,''
writes Annie Carlano, a former textiles curator at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston, in the catalog. ``The great Florentine
needlework traditions were brought to the French court by Catherine
de' Medici, herself an avid embroiderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a university core curriculum when you can learn all
this from a group of boxes?
</P>
<P>
   Audubon Record
</P>
<P>
   A double elephant, four-volume set of ``Birds of America'' by
John James Audubon has been sold at Christie's New York for $8.8
million, against an estimate of $4 million. Francis Wahlgren, head
of Christie's book department in New York, said the March 10 sale
set a world auction record for a printed book. ``This price,'' he
said, ``smashes Christie's previous record of $7.6 million for
Chaucer's `Canterbury Tales,' sold at Christie's London in July
1998.'' The previous record for a ``Birds of America'' was $4
million.

 &HT;    Culture goes from lowbrow to `Nob(registered)ow'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a puzzle for you: Why should Mark Fuhrman, Andrew Morton
and Cynthia Ozick be mentioned in the same breath?
</P>
<P>
   A one-time L.A. cop whose name was made infamous during the O.J.
Simpson trial. A celebrity biographer (Princess Diana, the
Windsors, Monica Lewinsky). A novelist and critic whose work has
appeared in The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   A mixed bag, to say the least. But the answer is that they are
all, in their rather different ways, authors, and if you can guess
which of the three must plead her case, then you know the culture
we live in.
</P>
<P>
   It comes to John Seabrook as something of a surprise, but better
that he know one of the facts of commerce: The masses like their
schlock and the publishing industry is happy to keep their bellies
full. Seabrook, a writer for The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and
Harper's, tells a story of attending a panel discussion at the New
York Public Library on the future of books. The discussion brought
together writers and readers, booksellers and publishers, with
media columnist Ken Auletta moderating.
</P>
<P>
   These tend to be dull affairs, swollen with platitudes, suffused
with piety for the written word. But halfway through the evening,
Ozick voiced a concern of serious writers: the need to preserve
midlist authors, those writers whose books are not automatic best
sellers, who do not pander to the lowest common denominator, who
instead write with wit and intelligence about literature and
culture, history and current affairs.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts she made her plea with much eloquence, and a
sympathetic audience warmly applauded. Then it was Leonard Riggio's
turn.
</P>
<P>
   A question of the bottom line
</P>
<P>
   Riggio is the president of Barnes &AMP; Noble, and his first words
were: ``Well, Cynthia, I happen to have your sales figures right
here.'' He must have anticipated an appeal on behalf of art because
he had his computer printout handy and it showed that Cynthia Ozick
was not a big seller at Barnes &AMP; Noble. She was, Seabrook leads us
to think, a lesser attraction than the Mark Fuhrmans and the Andrew
Mortons.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, no fan of Cynthia Ozick's will be disappointed at
chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble or Borders. She is hardly obscure, and
her books are reliably in stock. Nonetheless, Riggio made his
point: ``So why should the publishing industry support a midlist
book that readers clearly don't want?''
</P>
<P>
   If you say it's a legitimate business question, you must
acknowledge it's also the question of a philistine. When the bottom
line becomes the only arbiter of value, publishing is no different
from network television.
</P>
<P>
   This is the familiar issue _ art vs. commerce _ from which
Seabrook tries to derive a more general cultural significance. To
say that he has bitten off more than he can chew is putting it
generously, but he drops enough names and fires enough buckshot
that a casual reader is persuaded he is not entirely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The old lines that once separated the highbrow from the
middlebrow, and both from the lowbrow, have disintegrated, he says,
and what we have in their place is the triumph of marketing. Nobrow
is the democratization of entertainment in all its forms. They are
nothing more than commodities, up one day, down another, their
worth measured by numbers. What fuels their market value is not
intrinsic merit but ``the Buzz'' _ what people are saying about
them, what people are able to get other people to say about them.
Performance is superseded by promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing deeply on personal experience
</P>
<P>
   None of this is news, exactly, but Seabrook touches all the
obvious bases _ the film industry, the magazine business, books,
music _ and creates the superficial impression of having canvassed
pretty much everything. He draws, for example, on the disappointing
sales of his first book, ``Deeper: My Two-Year Odyssey in
Cyberspace,'' to illustrate what in fact is little more than
personal experience:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the book was about the Net, a
</P>
<P>
   pop-culture subject, the publisher had been persuaded that
`Deeper' would be a popular megastore commodity, maybe even a best
</P>
<P>
   seller, and I had been paid a large advance to write the book.
I, in turn, took the advance as confirmation that I was, in fact,
writing a best sellr. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``the book tanked.'' Publisher's expectations to the
contrary, ``I had produced a book that was neither a high brow
literary work nor low brow guide to the Net, but some unmarketable
combination of categories: the dreaded tweener.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this may be true, but it is only evidence of _ at most _
poor marketing. By implication, that is part of what Seabrook wants
to say. But he is so busy dropping glamorous names and recounting
trivial experiences that the pillars of a real argument are never
planted. It may be, of course, that he takes those pillars to

 &HT;    END URGED TO BAN ON INTERSTATE SHIPMENT OF STATE-INSPECTED MEAT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    BY ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ban on interstate shipment of state-inspected
meat and poultry should be lifted to provide a ``level playing
field'' for the nation's small meat-packing businesses, Congress
was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, consisting of government officials and
representatives from various meat processing organizations, urged
the Senate Agriculture Committee to pass the New Markets for
State-Inspected Meat Act.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will help increase competition in the meat
packing industry, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who along with
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., co-sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only federally inspected meat can be shipped from
state to state. Hatch said, however, that three separate U.S.
Department of Agriculture advisory committees have recommended
lifting the ban on state-inspected products as a way to create more
opportunities for small packers and livestock producers in rural
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's okay to sell state-inspected beef or pork in Utah, but
nowhere else. That make absolutely no sense,'' he said. ``But what
makes less sense is the fact that while those Nevada casinos or
Idaho supermarkets are banned from buying sausage and other
products from Utah, they have no problem whatsoever importing it
from a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one small plants since 1996 have been forced to shut down
in Ohio alone as a result of the ban, said Fred Dailey, director of
the state's Department of Agriculture. A 1997 Ohio State University
study found that Ohio's economy would increase by more than $56
million annually if the ban were lifted, Dailey added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question before you,'' he told the committee, ``is
whether it is time to create a level economic playing field and
provide the same opportunities for all meat and poultry processors,
both large and small, or to continue the government-sanctioned
economic advantage for large corporations and foreign competitors
at the expense of small business owners and operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents told the committee that the proposed law would mean
that the uniform system for meat inspection will be eliminated,
making it easier for diseases such as salmonella to spread.
</P>
<P>
   However, the American Meat Institute would support the bill if
it required state inspectors to follow the many notices, directives
and other federal requirements that are not regulations, but
constitute the ``nuts and bolts'' of the system under which federal
plants operate, said J. Patrick Boyle, AMI president.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truly uniform, state plants must meet these same
requirements and the bill should explicitly state this,'' said
Boyle, whose organization represents plants producing more than 70
percent of the country's beef, pork, lamb, veal and turkey
products.
</P>
<P>
   Before state-inspected plants can ship interstate, USDA will
first conduct comprehensive reviews of all state programs and
confirm that all recommendations from the reviews have been
implemented, responded Richard Rominger, the Department of
Agriculture's deputy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said that under the legislation, all salmonella
performance standards for products eligible for a federal mark of
inspection, whether in a federal or state establishment, will be
collected by the his department and analyzed in its laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will also give consumers confidence in federal oversight
of the system,'' he said.

DARK SIDE: SANDRA BULLOCK FACES HER OWN DEMONS 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly entertainment column with color and black-and-white art.)
 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Sandra Bullock
in scenes from ``28 Days.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Believe it or not, Sandra Bullock _ Hollywood's eternally
buoyant Little Mary Sunshine _ says that a recent four-day stay in
a drug-and-alcoholic-rehabilitation clinic changed her life.
 &HT;    No, of course Bullock doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem,
nor has she ever. The actress visited the rehab center Sierra
Tucson to conduct research for her latest movie, ``28 Days,'' which
will open April 14.
 &HT;    In the dark comedy _ think ``MASH'' (1970) _ Bullock plays
successful New York writer Gwen Cummings, a falling-down drunk
whose life is completely out of control after too many
party-hopping nights on the town. When she's arrested after a
particularly disgraceful exhibition at her sister's wedding, she
ends up sentenced to spend 28 days drying out at a clinic.
 &HT;    A YMCA in Asheville, N.C., stood in for the clinic in shooting
the movie, but Bullock went to Tucson, Ariz., to visit a real
clinic to learn more about both alcoholism and rehab itself.
 &HT;    She was there for only four days, she says, but learned more
than 28 days' worth of life lessons.
 &HT;    ``I have friends in the program,'' she explains, ``and when I
hear of some of their behavior I can't believe it, because it seems
so uncharacteristic of the people I know.
 &HT;    ``But I learned that the fault is in the behavior and not the
person,'' Bullock says. ``It's what the drugs or alcohol make the
person do that's bad. I thought I was going to meet a bunch of
celebrities, rock stars, actors and writers, but these were your
next-door neighbors.''
 &HT;    Co-starring with Bullock is the British actor Dominic West as
her boyfriend, and Viggo Mortensen, Azura Skye, Michael O'Malley,
Steve Buscemi, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Diane Ladd as fellow
patients at the clinic. But in a sense, she says, her real co-stars
were the real-life recovering people she met in Tucson, with whom
she shared tough talking-therapy sessions which required her to
reveal her own personal weaknesses and insecurities.
 &HT;    Many of the patients, she admits, were not happy about the idea
of sharing their secrets with a movie star.
 &HT;    ``I promised them anonymity, of course,'' the actress says,
``but still a lot of them made it clear they didn't want me there.
One person just left.''
 &HT;    Those who stayed learned that even the best-adjusted Hollywood
star can have her share of problems.
 &HT;    ``One of the other women said, `I thought you were one of those
happy, smiling people that nothing bad ever happens to. But now I
see you have as many insecurities as we do,''' Bullock recalls.
 &HT;    It's true, she says. In her own way, she's been as badly off as
her character in ``28 Days.''
 &HT;    ``I've never had drug or drink problems,'' she says, ``but I
will say that, not long ago, my emotional vices were far more
paralyzing. Yes, I'm optimistic and joyful, but I'm also very, very
afraid and insecure.''
 &HT;    That's hard to believe of the woman who inherited Mary
Pickford's nickname ``America's Sweetheart'' after such hit films
as ``Speed'' (l994), ``While You Were Sleeping'' (l995) and ``Hope
Floats'' (1998).
 &HT;    But since coming to Virginia from Germany at age 13 _ her mother
is a German opera singer, her father a voice coach who went to work
for the Pentagon _ Bullock says she has been plagued by
insecurities which, before and even after her success, left her
wracked with self-doubt and low self-esteem.
 &HT;    ``It began in junior high school, when I was 13,'' she recalls.
``I had just come from Germany, and I sounded different and I
dressed differently and I was just reaching puberty. It was a
difficult hormonal time to begin with, but because I was the
outsider the other kids picked on me and humiliated me. I got my
butt kicked a lot of the time, and often came home from school
crying.''
 &HT;    The result, she says, was that it took her a long time to grow
up.
 &HT;    ``I'm beginning to peak now,'' she says, ``while many of my
contemporaries peaked at high school.''
 &HT;    Today, she adds, she's finally got her act together, realizing
that there's more to life than being a $12 million-a-picture movie
star.
 &HT;    ``I've never felt better than I do today,'' Bullock says. ``I
think it's because I like my mind better these days. I feel as if
I've unscrewed my head and washed out my brain. I've also gotten
rid of a lot of my manic behavior _ I don't find it necessary
anymore to be talking and moving all the time. I'm a much quieter
person.''
 &HT;    The turnaround began four years ago, she says, when she left
Hollywood for a home of her own in Texas. She renovated a stone
cottage on a 22-acre site in the woods outside Austin, which now
comes complete with a pool, a lake, a screening room, a gym,
crystal chandeliers from Paris and a huge sleigh bed.
 &HT;    ``I never had a fun childhood,'' the actress says, ``but my new
liberation is giving me the kind of blissfulness and carefreeness I
never experienced before. I find it easier to let go of things I
thought I had to do before.''
 &HT;    For too long, she adds, she was a chronic pleaser, worrying
about other people and neglecting her own interests.
 &HT;    ``I was spending too much time on everybody else's causes and
not enough on mine,'' Bullock says. ``I discovered I needed to stay
home more, to have a home. This place has given me a place of
emotional refuge.''
 &HT;    It has also led to a new boyfriend, Bob Schneider, a musician
based in Texas.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have a life outside of acting,'' she says cheerfully.
``Now I have one.''
 &HT;    In fact, the actress says, she even finds herself thinking of
having children.
 &HT;    ``I know I will have a child,'' she says. ``I will probably have
several. But I won't get pregnant just because I feel my biological
time clock is running out _ I will only have a child with a man I'm
truly in love with.''
 &HT;    Bullock's next film will be ``Miss Congeniality,'' in which she
plays a tough FBI agent assigned to infiltrate a beauty contest to
investigate charges of bribery. Michael Caine plays the senior
agent who teaches her the ropes, including how to walk in a more
feminine fashion.
 &HT;    ``It's an `Educating Rita' type of movie,'' she explains with a
laugh. ``For the film I'm allowing myself not to be a lady, and
it's very liberating.''

ALONG THE ROAD TO RICHES, OR PERHAPS IT'S A DETOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE ROAD TO EL DORADO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Eric Bibo Bergeron and Don Paul &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 89 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zero surprises lie along a sprightly animated path to riches and
reconciliation in 16th-century Mexico. Winners in a shady game of
craps, two rollicking lads, Tulio and Miguel, come into possession
of an average-looking treasure map pointing toward El Dorado, city
of gold. A chase or two later they are shipboard prisoners of a
typically rapacious conquistador sailing off to plunder the New
World.
</P>
<P>
   After routine sea perils, the boys and a white horse named
Altivo wash up on a jungle-fringed beach. Deep in the forest lie
shimmering pyramidal structures, wheelbarrows full of goblets and
plates and whatever glittering encrustations one might expect in a
place like El Dorado.
</P>
<P>
   Here the two young men make standard figureheads in the
leadership struggle between the high priest Tzekel-Kan, an adherent
of human sacrifice, and the kindly tribal chief.
</P>
<P>
   As interlopers, Tulio and Miguel have a problem often
encountered by movie visitors from the north: the white-god
syndrome or, as Miguel puts it, ``If they say I'm a God, that's
what I am.'' Obliged to prove it by summoning a cataclysmic
happening, he gets help from a volcano in the middle distance.
</P>
<P>
   But Tulio and Miguel have their own conflict to resolve. Tulio
is more inclined to take the goblets and run. The more spiritual
Miguel comes out against human sacrifice, mingles with the people
and takes to his godly duties. So who is going? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Tzekel-Kan threatens to toss sacrifices off a cliff,
and it is made clear that El Doradoans aren't gentle with those
needing punishment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Tulio has off-screen relations with Chel, a native girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6: The film makes formulaic, good-looking fare for the
littlest ones, though the smallest might dive for cover in mildly
scary situations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10: For messages, there are the folly of greed and the
value of friendship, but age 10 is the outer edge for this film. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SKULLS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Craig T. Nelson, Leslie Bibb, Hill
Harper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Rob Cohen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 100 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The halls are vaulted and heavily timbered, the students
graduated at last from the high school movie. Now they attend an
unnamed Ivy League institution (Yale) and are initiates in the
Skulls, Hollywood's idea of a campus secret society (modeled after
Skull and Bones at Yale) that produces presidents, moguls and the
cream of the legal establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the goings-on here, that's a little hard to imagine,
or maybe it isn't. Having bought the society's code of honor when
they were students decades ago, powerful old Skulls preside over
gothic initiation rites administered to this year's elite young
designates.
</P>
<P>
   Running the show is Litten Mandrake (Nelson), on his way to a
Supreme Court appointment and every Skull's model of rectitude.
This year his son, Caleb (Walker), a troubled golden boy, will
enter the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Make that the vise. In return for lifelong wealth and power, the
Skulls demand allegiance above all else. In the beginning that is
acceptable to Luke McNamara (Jackson), a working-class boy who
exudes enough top-drawer potential to earn a bid to join the
society.
</P>
<P>
   After ponderous proclamations at the initiation ceremony,
forearms are branded and huge gold watches passed out to cover the
scars. Later there will be hot convertibles for everybody and an
extra $20,000 popping up in checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the Skulls' presumption of infallibility begins to
bother Luke, and it positively nauseates his old friend Will
(Beckford), a student journalist who is investigating the
organization. Suddenly we are in an all-out action film, with hit
men in speeding sport utility vehicles and a couple of killings.
Now a marked man, Luke and his plucky girlfriend (Bibb), an Exeter
girl, are running for their lives. Have they reported this to the
dean's office? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: A student has some help getting his neck broken in a
so-called accident. This being the Ivy League, the goons are in
suits and button-down shirts, but they still shoot and drive to
kill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Sexual activities are alluded to but nothing transpires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Yes, within PG-13 limits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: Not many parents will regard this as the most
worthwhile movie experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: Jackson (``Dawson's Creek''), Walker (``Varsity
Blues'') and others will exert a pull, as will the college scene.
Parental guidelines will vary here, but there is no great harm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: Some teen-agers will think it silly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHATEVER IT TAKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, James Franco &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Raynr &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 92 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pygmalion having gotten a good kicking around as underpinning
for the high school movie, it is now time for ``Cyrano de
Bergerac.'' When there's no possibility of a makeover, one goes
with someone else as a spokesman, or so it occurs to Ryan (West)
and Chris (Franco). A gentle accordion player, Ryan needs Chris'
help to snag Ashley (O'Keefe), the school's reigning female
attraction. Chris, a top roue (and Ashley's cousin), will oblige if
the sensitive and expressive Ryan will put the right words in
Chris' mouth to impress the very down-to-earth Maggie (Sokoloff).
</P>
<P>
   Since Ryan and Maggie are next-door neighbors and true soul
mates, it doesn't take an advice columnist to figure out where all
this is headed. Before that eventuality, however, Ryan nimbly darts
around throwing out enough verbal epiphanies to win Maggie for
Chris. That's distressing to Ryan, of course, and there is the
additional problem of what to do with Ashley, who has responded
passionately according to Chris' recommendation: Treat her like
dirt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: A gentle, sensitive person herself, Maggie exhibits a
surprising knowledge of how to lash a guy (Chris) to the bedposts
and oil him down good and proper. But she's only doing this to tell
him off. There is no sex then or at any other time, only some
suggestive talk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Some. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: Obviously inappropriate from several standpoints. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-14: Of all the screen teen-agers around, these are as
purely teen-age as any. Whatever that implies, it makes for
harmless viewing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: The film is too juvenile for older teen-agers.

<P>
   Al Gore's search for a Democratic running mate will be led by
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, The Associated Press
reports. Christopher also led the task force that helped
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton select Gore as his 1992 vice
presidential running mate. Christopher also helped Clinton pick his
first Cabinet, which included himself as secretary of state. Gore's
staff planned to announce the move shortly, the AP said. Advisers
to George W. Bush say he'll soon put his search committee in place.
</P>
<P>
   AND HE'S PROBABLY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was at the Palm Beach, Fla., home of attorney Bob
Montgomery Thursday night for a $10,000-a-person dinner. Today,
Gore travels to to the Broward County home of Rep. Peter Deutsch,
where he will attend a $5,000-a-person lunch with about 85 people.
The more than $1 million expected to be raised from the two events
is going to the Democratic National Committee. That ``soft money''
money will be used to help elect Democratic candidates. One of
those, of course, is Gore.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING THE PLATFORM TO ALL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is expected to talk today about the Democratic Party
platform and a plan to allow people to send suggestions about
changing the party platform over the Internet. The Democratic
National Committee has formed a partnership with SpeakOut.com, a
Web site that helps people find out about issues and contact their
elected officials. The Democrats plan to use SpeakOut.com to allow
people to read the party platform and make comments.
</P>
<P>
   SORRY, PAT, IT'LL BE LONG BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party leaders overwhelmingly rejected Pat Buchanan's bid
Thursday to move the party's nominating convention from Long Beach,
Calif., to Nashville. The issue arose last month after party
Chairman Pat Choate and the Buchanan camp became concerned that the
Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center had also booked a
big religious conference the same week. Bay Buchanan, Pat
Buchanan's sister and campaign manager, said last week that the
campaign preferred Nashville for logistical reasons as well as its
``middle America'' image. But California is home to 9 million
registered independents and 11 percent of the party's delegates,
said convention Chairman Gerry Moan.
</P>
<P>
   BIG PUSH IN BIG ENCHILADA
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is popular in California, the state's economy
is golden, and Al Gore is leading in the polls. Should George W.
Bush even bother? Bush, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times,
``insists'' that ``he plans to to compete all-out'' there.
Thursday, Bush started his 12th California trip, the first since
the state's primary, and, according to CNN, the state's Republicans
are thrilled. The Bush campaign says he will continue to go to
California because the state is winnable. Even California Secretary
of State Bill Jones, who had defected from the Bush campaign to
support John McCain, is now back with Bush for a race he thinks is
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   DAY OF THE MEDIA JACKAL
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has some clear targets in line for
his next book _ primarily ``media jackals'' and spineless
politicians. It will be called ``Do I Stand Alone? Going to the Mat
Against Political Pawns and Media Jackals,'' his publisher said
Thursday. The book is due out in September, Ann Harris, spokeswoman
for the Pocket Books division of Simon &AMP; Schuster, told the Reuters
news agency. The pro wrestler-turned-politician published a
best-selling autobiography last year titled ``I Ain't Got Time to
Bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S ALWAYS A BETTER WAY
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans are unhappy with the way presidential
nominees are chosen, even though they say they're generally
satisfied with the candidates this year, says a poll released
Thursday. The most popular alternative to the current system would
be a national primary with all states holding their contests on the
same day, preferably in May or June. That option was chosen by 56
percent in the poll by the Vanishing Voter Project, while the
current system was preferred by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   OPEN MINDED OPENING TO HISPANICS
</P>
<P>
   Going after the traditionally Democratic Hispanic vote,
Republicans are airing a Spanish-language TV ad in California that
asks voters to at least consider the GOP. ``This year I plan to
keep an open mind and vote for the best person, and that includes
Republicans,'' a Christina Bustos from Los Angeles says in the ad,
which is also airing in English. The GOP is spending $125,000 to
test the ad in the Fresno, Calif., area and plans to take it
national if it proves effective. The ad will run enough times in
Fresno for the average TV viewer to see it 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   RICKY DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER
</P>
<P>
   Even though New York Gov. George Pataki wants him out of the
Senate race, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio insisted in an interview
with Hearst News Service that he's the best one to run against
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Lazio said Pataki's disapproval would
``disincline me'' from challenging Rudy Giuliani, but he continued
to insist that the controversial mayor was dragging down the GOP
with him. Lazio said Giuliani's handling of fatal police shootings
in New York City is evidence of a political tin ear that's driving
his poll numbers down.
</P>
<P>
   BUT THAT OTHER 10 PERCENT IS POWERFUL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore presented himself to Maryland supporters as a candidate
able to reach across party lines, claiming rank-and-file
Republicans agreed with him on ``90 percent of the issues.'' Megan
Jones, deputy press secretary at the Democratic National Committee,
said the money raised at the $25,000-a-couple dinner at a private
home _ an estimated $600,000 _ will go to the party ``for electing
Democrats at all levels.'' Gore's own campaign finance troubles
were on the minds of a few protesters who chanted ``No more Gore''
as the candidate alighted from his helicopter in Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   AND TO SHOW YOUR LATEST DANCE STEP
</P>
<P>
   Onetime newspaper reporter Al Gore hasn't held a news conference
in more than six weeks, and George W. Bush's campaign is starting
to track the days. They're suggesting Gore is hiding from questions
about fund raising and other controversial matters. The Republican
National Committee _ with the Bush camp's blessing _ launched the
``Al Gore News Conference Watch'' on Wednesday. Opening count: 46
days without one, dating to Feb. 19 in Springfield, Mass. Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer, while conceding that Gore regularly grants
one-on-ones, said those are easier to control. ``News conferences
are a way to see how fast you are on your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   IN FLORIDA, IT'S ALL ABOUT ELIAN
</P>
<P>
   National Democratic Party chief Joseph Andrew cited a
fund-raising appeal by Florida Republicans to accuse them of using
the custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to raise campaign
money. Andrew released an intercepted GOP fund-raising letter in
February that condemned the Clinton administration's handling of
the case. The letter, signed by Cuban-born lawyer Al Cardenas,
appealed for donations to serve as a ``powerful force against the
Democrats and the liberals who act cowardly before the intimidating
tactics, the hysterical speeches and the criminal lies of Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL, AT NO EXTRA COST
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan says the reason he's running for president is to
give voters a new option. ``Unless I ran as the Reform Party
candidate, Americans would not have a real choice,'' he said in
Kansas City. Areas where he said he differs with the major
candidates: Free trade, immigration and the World Trade
Organization, which he says the United States should never have
joined. China _ no normal trade status until it ``stops persecuting
Christians'' and drops threats against the United States and
Taiwan. Bosnia and Kosovo _ bring American troops home. ``I think
it's time we defended the borders of our own country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BAUER SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR FIELD IN '04
</P>
<P>
   After two disastrous White House bids, inheritance-advantaged
Steve Forbes has decided against trying a third time. Appearing at
the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan for the launching of his new
coffee-table book, ``Faberge: the Forbes Collection,'' Forbes said,
``Twice is enough. I'll be lobbing grenades and rolling editorial
bombs from another vantage point on the sidelines. I won't be doing
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   BE MORE LIKE MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is well liked by swing voters who could be decisive
in the battle for control of the House, according to a Republican
survey obtained by The Associated Press. The survey indicates he's
favored _ more than Al Gore and George W. Bush _ by voters who
describe themselves as uncommitted in hypothetical congressional
matchups. The finding emerged from a poll conducted for SAFE, an
organization associated with Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, to help
assure continued GOP control of the House in the fall elections.
House Republicans already were moving eagerly to enlist McCain's
aid in key districts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader, in Iowa to push his presidential
bid as a Green Party candidate, scoffed at suggestions his campaign
merely drains liberal votes from Democrats. He said that shrinking
either major party is ``exactly what we want.'' He pointed to
studies of the 1996 election when he was on the ballot in
California, and said he drew almost as many Republican voters as
Democrats. ``Our two parties are basically one corporate party
wearing two heads and different makeup,'' Nader said. ``There is a
difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but not that much.''
</P>
<P>
   MARRIED, WITH BALLOTS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush are competing heavily for the votes
of white, married mothers, an enormous and critical group that is
emerging as one potential key to the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns and pollsters have targeted these mothers, and
they could deliver a win to either candidate. A new poll (2.9
percent margin of error) released by EMILY's List, an organization
that supports abortion-rights candidates, showed that although Gore
has a slight lead among women overall and has been gaining in
recent months, Bush is ahead among white, married moms by 47
percent to 39 percent. In 1996 and 1992, white married moms voted
for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HAMMERING ON EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore stepped up his attacks on George W. Bush's education and
tax policies before an enthusiastic labor union crowd in
Washington. Gore charged that Bush's education proposals would not
lower class sizes or help rebuild schools that are falling apart
and that his planned tax cuts would create spending deficits. He
called Bush's tax plan a ``reckless scheme that (would) devastate
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY SIDING WITH THE TEACHERS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said that plans to sharply cut back
summer school in New York City represented a ``terrible admission
of failure'' on the part of Rudy Giuliani. She attacked the mayor's
push for teacher merit pay, the issue that led to the breakdown in
talks with the United Federation of Teachers, calling it a crude
and ineffective way to improve public education. Giuliani has
argued for individual teacher stipends based on student test scores
as an incentive for teachers to work this summer and as his opening
move in negotiations with the union, whose contract expires in
November.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY FUND-RAISER SIGNING ON WITH GORE
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his continuing efforts to unite the Democratic
Party, Al Gore plans to announce on Monday the endorsements of a
group of Bill Bradley's Florida supporters. The group will be lead,
according to The New York Times, by Stephen Pajcic, a Jacksonville
lawyer who raised money for Bradley. Pajcic said he also expects to
help raise money for Gore.

`RETURN TO ME': SHE GETS HIS WIFE'S HEART AND HIM, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can hear lots of hearty laughter from the kitchen of
O'Reilly's, the Irish-Italian restaurant in ``Return to Me,'' a
faltering new romantic comedy directed by Bonnie Hunt. It's about a
heart, and an irreplaceable, deep-seated love that can be passed
from one person to another. At least, this love can be passed from
a heart donor, Elizabeth, to its recipient, Grace (Minnie Driver).
After Elizabeth dies in a car accident, the sickly Grace gets her
heart, and a wondrous romance begins to bloom between Grace and
Elizabeth's husband, Bob (David Duchovny).
</P>
<P>
   Probably few actresses convey bemused decency as quickly, or as
well, as the actress and comic performer Bonnie Hunt. In her
directorial debut, her willingness to buff off all the sharp edges
of this story of star-crossed spirits makes a picture that's very
easygoing _ far too easygoing. It's as if she were out to make the
film child-proof. (The opening credit sequence tries to create a
lost-in-love fabric, with a generic overhead shot of Chicago's
concrete canyons and with Dean Martin's confidently slumming his
way through the song ``Return to Me,'' showing only that this
once-underphotographed city is now dangerously close to being
overexposed.)
</P>
<P>
   Weightless and polite when it means to be magical and gentle,
``Return to Me'' is a piece of fruit gone soft from being off the
vine too long. It's top-loaded with Dean Martin songs, including a
soapy version of the title tune that sounds as if it's emanating
from the eight-track of your father's Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Bob is a builder and architect who's madly in love with his late
wife and has to be forced into dating by the requisite best friend,
Charlie (David Alan Grier). When Bob joins Charlie on the set-up
date at O'Reilly's, where Grace is a waitress, he and she first see
each other, and he goes after her, without knowing she now has his
wife's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Mulder, Duchovny's dour character on ``The X-Files,'' has
probably never done anything so mundane as consume a meal on
camera, but Bob seems determined to engage in quotidian behavior in
``Return to Me.'' Duchovny eats, dissolves into tears after his
wife's death and breaks into smiles in this movie more often than
he has during the entire seven-year run of ``The X-Files.'' The
real case of science fiction here is Driver's Grace, who has
apparently been unable to get a date, ever. That's more
unbelievable than the convenient circumstances of Elizabeth's heart
dropping right into her lap, so to speak. Driver's sultry pluck
would get her more play than a Nintendo, but in the sweetheart's
dance of ``Return to Me'' she's waiting for her prince to come.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Reilly's kitchen, her overprotective grandfather, Marty
(Carroll O'Connor), and his best friend and chef, Angelo (Robert
Loggia), worry and commiserate about her life. So does her best
friend, played by Hunt, who has enough to concern herself with. She
has a movie to direct, and she does so in a way so nice-guyish that
it's nondescript.
</P>
<P>

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Wild' Is Right: Planning `Party' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about crunch time. With openings just days away, two major
Broadway productions were doing whatever they could to squeeze
extra time into packed schedules and energy out of exhausted
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was perhaps most intense at the Virginia Theater on
the set of the Public Theater's ``Wild Party,'' where the director
and co-writer, George C. Wolfe, was juggling everything from the
health of his cast to the length of his show. The musical opens on
Thursday; critics are due on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the sniffle front, at least, things seemed to be settling
down after several weeks of uneasiness about the voice of Mandy
Patinkin, who plays the ruffian Burrs. Patinkin, who missed a
stretch of previews in late March because of a vocal inflammation,
has been back in the cast since March 28 but missed last Saturday's
matinee. Toni Collette, the female lead, also missed several
performances this week because of a cold.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, the show's pace has been a principal concern,
and an area of major improvement. Early previews ran about 2 hours
20 minutes without an intermission, causing some audience members
to gripe. Wolfe has trimmed the running time to less than two
hours, but there is still no intermission, on artistic grounds: the
musical is about a party, after all, and few parties have
intermissions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wolfe was continuing to shape the musical and canceled
Wednesday's matinee to allow for more rehearsal time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Party,'' based on a 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure
March, is being watched by Broadway for many reasons, not the least
of which is that it will be the season's last new musical. It is
also bound to be compared to another musical based on that poem
that opened in February at Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Wolfe's own personal mystique, a mix of talent
and ego that is simultaneously admired and reviled by many on
Broadway. A hit with ``The Wild Party'' is likely to be seen as
redemption for Wolfe's most recent Broadway outing, last year's
unsuccessful revival of ``On the Town.'' A pan would be seen as
another costly uptown misfire for him.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he was too busy to dwell on such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that doing a musical is like landing at
Normandy,'' he said Thursday, sounding upbeat. ``It's also akin to
childbirth. You don't remember the pain, otherwise you'd never do
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big-time director, Julie Taymor, has been trying to
steal some extra hours, for ``The Green Bird,'' which is to open on
April 18 at the Cort Theater. Wednesday's matinee was canceled
along with the matinee on April 12 to open the way for more
rehearsals for this tech-heavy show. Practice would seem to be
prudent; on Sunday, the actors Reg E. Cathey and Edward Hibbert
were beaned with a piece of scenery during a set change, and the
performance was canceled. Cathey was taken to the emergency room
for precautionary X-rays. He was fine. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Dead' Ends &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was, from the beginning, an unorthodox musical: a quiet,
meditative piece taken from the writings of perhaps the headiest
scribe of all, James Joyce. Its existence, let alone survival, on
Broadway seemed miraculous to Disney-weary critics, who almost
unanimously sang its praises.
</P>
<P>
   But with a crush of new shows opening, it seemed increasingly
unlikely to producers that such an unassuming little piece could
survive. So on April 16, ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' starring
Christopher Walken, will close its four-month run at the Belasco.
</P>
<P>
   The show had broken even or better most weeks, but sales have
slipped lately. The prospect of Tony nominations next month in
several categories was apparently not enough to save the show.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Mosher, one of its producers, said the show would
continue in several arenas and a national tour is planned. ``It's
strange to close a thing like this having gotten the amount of
support we did,'' he said. ``But this one's going to have a longer
life.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lavin on Broadway &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Charles Busch's comedy ``The Tale of the
Allergist's Wife,'' playing to full houses at Manhattan Theater
Club's snug Stage 2, will transfer to Broadway in the fall. No
specific dates are set, but Linda Lavin is signed to return to her
role as Majorie Taub, a depressed intellectual dilettante whose
life is upended by the arrival of a long-lost friend played by
Michele Lee, who is also expected to return for the Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Roberts is to rejoin the cast as the allergist.
Performances will probably begin in mid-October for a early
November opening. Lynne Meadow directs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naked? No! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Kathleen Turner has no plans to get naked in
``Tallulah.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's opposed to the idea, she says; ``it just doesn't
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is of acute importance, of course, because of
Turner's current project, a stage version of ``The Graduate'' that
opened in London on Wednesday night. Therein, Turner disrobes as
Mrs. Robinson, briefly and in dim light, an event that has been
front-page tabloid news on both sides of the Atlantic and has set
off a more-sex-please-we're-British fervor at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   The limited run has sold out faster than you can say,
``Plastics.'' And the reviews? Although the show's notices were
mixed, Turner is said to do quite well, and looks, in the words of
The Daily Telegraph, ``very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, of course, has given rise to dreams of an American
run. But first, Turner is committed to ``Tallulah,'' a one-woman
play about the salty stage and screen star Tallulah Bankhead, a
woman who, Turner said, ``acts to excess in many ways, both good
and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, in development since 1997, is now scheduled for a
11-city United States tour beginning in October in Minneapolis,
followed by a Broadway landing next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Previous productions of ``Tallulah'' had been criticized for a
weak second act, but Turner says that has been fixed. The play
follows an evening in Bankhead's life in 1947, complete with
remembrance, bons mots and a few visits to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   But no nudity, eh?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try never,'' Turner said with a purr, ``to repeat myself.''

gone big-time with a mega-bucks television deal, stock-car racing
probably will get more serious. But participants in the sport still

You make fun of wrecks, just so you don't have to think about
them.'' (Levine, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The island of Cyprus, off the coast of Asia Minor,
was the Times Square stop on that great mass transit system known
as the ancient Mediterranean world. It was the node where dozens of
cultures, European and Asian, crossed paths in an exchange of
people, goods and ideas before moving on to other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Some whiff of that hustle and bustle comes across in the new
Cypriot galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 600
objects range from colossal sculptures to poppy-shaped juglets
(thought to have been used for exporting opium). And everywhere
there are traces of the various superpowers _ Egypt, Greece,
Assyria, Rome _ that established a presence and contributed to the
sweetly unglamorous carnival of styles known as Cypriot art.
</P>
<P>
   The new galleries, which conclude a second phase in the Met's
renovation of its Greek and Roman collection, also embody a
different, more modern history, one related to a notable, even
notorious episode in the early days of the museum itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Cypriot holdings were amassed more than a century
ago by Luigi Palma di Cesnola (1832-1904), a wily and ambitious
diplomatic-corps type who emigrated from Italy to America to make a
career. He signed up as a Union cavalryman in the Civil War, spent
10 months in a Confederate prison and talked his way into a job as
U.S. consul to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Like other foreign self-seekers on the island, he took up
archaeology as an exotic hobby. It wasn't long before he began to
see himself as being in competition with Heinrich Schliemann, who
was then making headlines with his discoveries at Troy and Mycenae.
But where Schliemann at least preserved some small sense of context
in his work, Cesnola unearthed things willy-nilly and shipped them
off.
</P>
<P>
   And worse, in his drive to produce newsworthy ``discoveries,''
he was not above grafting stray sculptural parts, sometimes from
different eras, or massaging the data about where certain pieces
were found. He announced a trove he called the ``Kourion
Treasure,'' which may never have existed as such.
</P>
<P>
   All this behavior was more or less routine in an era when
museums and archaeology alike were in their infancy and
opportunistic deals were going on all around. (In certain ways
things aren't all that different today, though the cushioning
etiquette around such activities has grown subtler.)
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Cesnola's public relations campaign worked. He
got the attention he was after. His collection was bought by public
subscription for the brand new Metropolitan Museum and provided a
starry-eyed institution with its first claim to international
prominence. No European museum had comparable Cypriot material.
</P>
<P>
   To cap his story, the museum hired Cesnola as its first
director, though his archaeological methods eventually came under
fire, as did the price he had demanded for his collection. After
his death, the Met auctioned off the bulk of his objects, leaving a
core of 6,000 from which the new Cypriot installation has been
culled by the curators Carlos A. Picon, Joan R. Mertens,
Christopher S. Lightfoot, Elizabeth J. Milleker and Sean Hemingway,
all of the Met, and Vassos Karageorghis, former director of
antiquities in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Cesnola did wrong, he left an amazing legacy. Many of
his choicest acquisitions are now back on view as a group for the
first time in half a century, and they give a panoramic summary
view of ancient Cypriot culture.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus was famous in the ancient world as a source of copper.
But most of its early art is of humble stuff like terra cotta and
soft, grainy local stone. The opening gallery, in fact, which
begins with Neolithic work from around 7000 B.C., has a
pots-and-pans atmosphere, like a prehistoric housewares department.
</P>
<P>
   Here one finds dozens of clay vessels, some workaday, others
whimsical. One vase imitates the shape of a leather purse; another
takes the form of a mischievous antlered creature about the size of
a Beanie Baby. There is also, in a nice curatorial touch, a chorus
line of goddess figurines with birdlike faces.
</P>
<P>
   They have an unfussed-over, improvised look, as if made for fun
as much as for use. (Cyprus, the Greeks decided, was the birthplace
of Aphrodite.)
</P>
<P>
   By the late Bronze Age (circa 1600-circa 1000 B.C.), many
cultures had converged on the island. Refugees from the devastated
city of Mycenae brought Greek traditions. Phoenician settlers
introduced Egyptian styles. Cypriot artists, particularly potters,
recast these influences into lively designs, as one sees in a
barrel-shaped jug, circa 750 B.C., with the graphically crisp image
of a sea bird, perhaps a cormorant, with stylized lotuses.

 &HT;    QUIET WASHINGTON SUBURB FINDS ITSELF AT CENTER OF ELIAN SAGA

   BETHESDA, Md. _ About five miles outside the nation's capital,
this normally quiet suburban neighborhood where signs on front
lawns tout ``Vote for Pat Baptiste, Democrat for County Council,''
became an international center of attention Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of news reporters mixed with the chirping of birds to
form a surreal picture outside the tan brick house where Juan
Miguel Gonzalez arrived Thursday morning to wait out the fate of
his son, 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez emerged from the house, which belongs Cuban
Interests Section head Fernando Remirez, once with a Cuban official
to walk around the front yard. He made no statement.
</P>
<P>
   The houses along suburban in the middle of Millwood Road, in
Montgomery County, are like any other, with yellow and blue pansies
in flower boxes, and white picket fences.
</P>
<P>
   Nannies push strollers with snoozing infants and toddlers, while
joggers run up and down the block stopping occasionally to take a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Into that ``American Beauty'' scene Thursday morning, before the
dew lifted from the freshly cut lawns, came the orange and white
barriers, police road blocks and nearly two dozen television
satellite trucks to interrupt the morning's normally tranquil
routine.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to walk his dog Sasha, 25-year resident Marcel
Hodak had to duck under the yellow police tape, and side-step the
TV cable lines that covered the sidewalk outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it, this is something that only
happens on TV,'' Hodak said, mugging for one of the dozens of
camera crews filming the neighborhood. ``Now, I'm on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors, like Alex and Marion Kelly have lived on
Millwood for more than a decade, were more eager to see what was
going on, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with more than 50
television cameras, photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely walk around the neighborhood, and all this
commotion is just providing some excitement for our walk,'' said
Marion Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a possible magnet for protests _ or so the police
believe. The area cordoned off by police for protestors was empty
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic University graduate student Camila Ruiz _ among
several Cuban-American students from colleges and universities in
the Washington area that showed up _ stood behind the barriers
telling reporters that she supported Gonzalez in efforts to get his
son back and hoped he was able to express himself free from the
pressures of Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro has made us (Cuban-Americans) out to be some sort of
mafia,'' said Ruiz, a Cuban-American from Santa Clara, Calif. ``We
only want Juan Gonzalez to come out by himself and to be able to
speak his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In this politically moderate enclave, the sentiment appears to
lean toward the the father being reunited with his son,
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to pass judgement on where a kid should
live,'' said Aileen Cohen, taking her 16-month-old son, Gabriel,
out for his morning stroll.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit her. Pointing toward the media horde, Cohen added,
``It never occurred to me that this could go on for weeks.''

 NEW YORK: stylized lotuses.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outstanding art of the Archaic period (750-480 B.C.) was
figurative stone sculpture. Because Cyprus has no marble, limestone
was the material of choice. And the use of this common, elemental
rock formed from calcified sea shells (marble itself is an
ultrarefined version of it) contributes to the earthy, almost
archetypically provincial charm and variety of much Cypriot art.
</P>
<P>
   A figure of a youth from the sixth century B.C., for example, is
clearly modeled on the Greek kouros. But instead of a ramrod
posture and a buffed nude physique, he has slope-shoulders and
wears unsexy Fruit of the Loom briefs with big rosettes.
</P>
<P>
   His fetchingly nerdy attire is part of a circus of personal
styles. Some figures come with Egyptian kilts and wigs, or curly
Near Eastern beards. Others flash a particularly jolly version of
the V-shaped ``archaic smile'' of Greek sculpture. Finally, one
might locate a real Cypriot ``look'' in a colossal male head
displaying a conical homeboy cap and a large, inelegant, decidedly
un-Grecian nose.
</P>
<P>
   Metalwork also yields transcultural motifs, as in a set of
silver, gold and bronze bowls incised or embossed with narrative
scenes and decorative patterns that draw on sources from Homeric
Greece to Assyria and strings them together with an audacious ``who
cares?'' abandon. These bowls were part of Cesnola's ``Kourion
Treasure,'' and he was right to consider them among his signal
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But if one were to choose a single highlight from the
installation, it would almost certainly be a polychrome limestone
sarcophagus carved around 475 B.C. Monumental in scale and
spectacularly well preserved (recent cleaning has brought out the
color), it shows the vivacious Cypriot International style in its
classical phase. Most of the surface is carved in high relief. On
one short end there are figures of the scowling Egyptian deity Bes;
on the other, the Phoenician goddess Astarte appears, nude, on
tiptoe, touching her breasts. The two long sides depict a stately
but leisurely procession. The men are dressed in Cypriot conical
caps; one holds a Persian-style parasol over his chariot mate.
Greek sphinxes crouch, alert as terriers, on the lid.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought that the sarcophagus was carved at a time when
Cyprus was trying to obtain an alliance with Greece against Persia.
And there's no question that the island saw itself as being, in
some essential way, within the Greek cultural sphere.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparent in two fifth-century B.C. full-length figures:
one has a clean-shaven idealized face, the other a beard and a
Danny Kaye profile, but they share a classical poise. (Both are
also suspected of being Cesnola ``restorations.'' The head of the
first figure and the feet of the second may not be original to the
bodies.)
</P>
<P>
   But political jockeying was old news on an island where
overlords came and went. Persian domination ended during the rule
of Alexander the Great. Then the Romans arrived. With typical
strength and resilience, Cyprus managed to absorb these incursions
and keep to its own track, which was always both inside and outside
the greater imperial loops.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with textbook Mediterranean and Aegean art,
Cypriot work doesn't stack up as a peak, seamless, resolved
achievement. It has neither the abstract ``modernist'' allure of
Cycladic sculpture nor the consolingly idealistic beauty attributed
to sculpture from classical Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in interesting ways the work in the Cesnola collection,
which would be easy to overlook in a greatest-hits museum tour,
makes a perfect fit, both for New York and for the Met. This vast
gathering of provincial material provided the archaeological
foundation for what was, at least at the start, a feisty provincial
institution. And the spirit of the art somehow suits the city
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In place of purity, Cypriot work offers a welter of
style-sampling invention, with results that are by turns madcap and
flat-footed, virtuosic and funky. Its very impurity is what makes
it attractive to us. And in fact, if one were trying to come up
with an Ancient World analogy for art being produced in New York
right now, the Met's Cypriot galleries would be a good place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   The New Cypriot Galleries are on permanent view at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS MIXED RESULTS IN CRIMES AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the number of anti-gay hate crimes and
harassment incidents dropped in the United States in 1999, the
number of violent and deadly attacks increased, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence
Programs and San Francisco's Community United Against Violence show
that the number of anti-gay incidents, such as taunts, instances of
discrimination and police indifference to hate crimes, fell in 1999
by 3 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings, released Wednesday, do not necessarily mean an
increased tolerance of homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and
transgendered people, said Tina D'Elia, the program director for
the Community United Against Violence. The number of anti-gay
homicides across the nation increased from 26 to 29 last year, the
findings show.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of anti-gay incidents overall fell from
2,017 in 1998 to 1,965 in 1999, but much of that decline came from
four of 13 reporting regions, including San Francisco. In the other
regions, there was a 40 percent increase in the number of
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay Area, the number of victims who
reported severe injuries in violent assaults rose to 88, a 20
percent increase over 1998. Transgender victims accounted for 18
percent of all the incidents reported, almost twice that of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the incidents involved a 23-year-old Middle Eastern woman
who was kidnapped and beaten by her family members when they found
out she was a lesbian. The police arrested the family members at an
airport as they attempted to send the woman home. The woman and her
partner later had to change their identities to avoid being found
by the family.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a gay man in San Francisco reported being
beaten at a bus stop by five or six young people who screamed
anti-homosexual epithets at him and attacked him with rocks and
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender in
communities where maybe there isn't the same kind of visibility as
San Francisco are seeing a kind of backlash as they come out,''
D'Elia said. ``In a lot of ways, these people are being sought out
as targets.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the number of anti-gay homicides in
California had tripled to six last year. The highest profile case
involved the slayings of a gay couple near Redding, allegedly
killed by two white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-violence advocates said Wednesday they feared the number of
incidents would increase next year because of anti-gay sentiments
expressed by controversial radio personality Laura Schlessinger and
the divisive battle earlier in the year over Proposition 22, the
voter-approved initiative in California that banned recognition of
gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got an increase of calls in 1999 and already in 2000,''
D'Elia said. ``Hate speech completely fosters people's already
existing fears and prejudices. They'll lash out more, and the
issues will divide people more.''

HABIB BOURGUIBA, LED TUNISIA TO INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE  
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Habib Bourguiba, who was president of Tunisia from 1957 to 1987
after leading the country to independence from France, died
Thursday. He was 96 years old and lived in Monastir, in eastern
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba was a spectacularly durable Arab leader. He was also
relatively moderate and pro-Western and did much to enhance women's
rights in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Supreme Combatant, he long dominated his North
African nation as wholly as Nehru did India or Nasser did Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, after he consolidated power as president, he
was asked about Tunisia's political system. ``The system? What
system?'' he exclaimed cheerfully. ``I am the system!''
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba acquired the title ``president for life'' in 1975, and
he was the only president that independent Tunisia had ever had
when, in November 1987, at the age of 84, he was deposed in a
bloodless coup. He was ousted by his new prime minister, Zine
el-Abidine ben Ali, who declared that the president was too senile
and ill to govern Tunisia's 7.5 million people. Bourguiba had
suffered from various ailments for years.
</P>
<P>
   Tunisia evolved into one of the most politically tolerant Arab
countries during the Bourguiba era and for years was a showcase for
development. Per capita income and literacy soared.
</P>
<P>
   But in the later years of Bourguiba's rule, appreciation of his
past accomplishments dimmed with disillusionment over high prices,
low wages and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, demands from opposing ends of the political
spectrum shook confidence in his stewardship, which had often been
marred by rigged elections.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years in power, Bourguiba took sweeping measures
against militant Islamists, and he was deposed after he had ordered
retrials and capital punishment for several of them. Ben Ali and
others were afraid that if the order were carried out it would
provoke civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But for decades Bourguiba was the fountainhead of Tunisian
political life, first as the leader of the movement for
independence and then, after independence in 1956, as chief of
state, modernizer, women's rights pioneer and advocate of Arab
moderation on the issue of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime he was also a shrewd politician who often preferred
to outmaneuver French officials, Islamic conservatives and other
adversaries rather than confront them.
</P>
<P>
   His tactics, dubbed ``Bourguibism'' by the Paris press, helped
him remain as Tunisia's leader after the rulers of other Islamic
nations _ the shah of Iran, the king of Libya, and strongmen in
Syria and Iraq _ were overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba's relatively restrained attitude did not come
naturally in Tunisia, a nation the size of Louisiana on the
Mediterranean coast between Algeria and Libya. The Vandals were
there in the 5th century and pirates in the 16th. In the early
1950s, Bourguiba's aides unleashed another wave of terror and
violence to wrest their homeland from the grip of France.
</P>
<P>
   But as president he advocated relative restraint toward Israel,
even after the Israeli victory in the 1967 War, when other Arab
leaders demanded revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, taking an approach resembling one later adopted by U.S.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Bourguiba advocated a phased
solution to the Middle East conflict. But his proposals were
ignored in Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Some months before the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, he called for a
``just and lasting peace,'' citing Israel's right ``not to be
exterminated and thrown into the sea.'' But in 1973, as in 1967, he
sent a token military force to show support for the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   And when the guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization
left West Beirut in 1982 after an Israeli invasion, Tunisia _
despite misgivings _ was among the Arab countries that took them
in. About 1,100 PLO members arrived by sea at Bizerte to a
tumultuous welcome. The chief greeter was Bourguiba, waving from
the dock.
</P>
<P>
   The Bourguiba government also let the PLO set up headquarters in
Tunis, which was already the headquarters of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century earlier, soon after Tunisia became
independent, Bourguiba used his power to push through a ``code of
personal status'' that ran counter to traditional Muslim
jurisprudence and custom in enhancing women's rights, a step the
French had cautiously refrained from taking.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy was outlawed. Marriage was redefined as a voluntary
contract that conferred rights upon the wife as well as the
husband. A minimum age for marriage was set, and the consent of the
bride was made mandatory. These stipulations in effect outlawed the
traditional practice of selling young girls. They also underscored
the modern concept of marriage as a bond between two individuals
rather than an alliance between two families.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba also sought to improve life for his country's
seminomadic tribesmen. In a speech to a tribal audience in 1960, he
evoked a theme beloved of Arab historians, the contrast between
desert and city life, in urging the audience to ``follow the
directions of your government so that your children and
grandchildren may accede to city life _ or else you can remain
attached to a primitive type of life, which condemns you to
vegetate on the margins of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba married Wassila ben Ammar, a Tunisian from a prominent
family, in 1961, the year he divorced his first wife, Mathilde
Lorrain. Ben Ammar was seen as a power within the presidency, and
she sought a more open and democratic society and an orderly
aftermath to Bourguiba's presidency. But he divorced her in 1986
after banishing her. She died in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba is survived by a son, Habib Bourguiba Jr.

</P>
<P>
   Habib ben Ali Bourguiba was born on Aug. 3, 1903, in Monastir,
the ancient port in the east, the youngest of eight children in a
family of low-ranking civil servants. He went to school in Tunis,
and an older brother paid for him to go to Paris in 1924 to study
law, political science and French literature.
</P>
<P>
   After three years in Paris, he returned to Tunis to practice
law, write for newspapers and plunged into politics. He was a
founder of the nationalist Neo-Destour Party in 1934 and was
repeatedly imprisoned for his political activities. He spent half
the years from 1934 to 1954 in jail.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected prime minister in 1956, the year Tunisia became
independent, and was chosen president by a constituent assembly in
1957. He was confirmed in the presidency in general elections two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bourguiba supported the Algerian rebels in their revolt against
France, and in 1961 plunged Tunisia into conflict with France over
the French base at Bizerte, Tunisia. After an outbreak of fighting,
the French abandoned the base.
</P>
<P>
   Especially serious antigovernment rioting shook Tunis and other
cities in January 1978, after inflation heated up the smoldering
animosity between Bourguiba's party and Tunisia's labor unions. He
remained secluded in his palace at Carthage, in the suburbs of
Tunis, and calm was restored after more than 40 people were killed.
The disorder underscored the speculation and uncertainty in
Tunisia, even then, as to who would be his eventual successor.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a growing challenge from Islamic fundamentalists, the
government cracked down in September 1981 after militants made
anti-Bourguiba speeches in mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Bourguiba's party allowed opposition groups to
participate for the first time in elections to the National
Assembly, but they won no seats. The opposition charged election
fraud, but the government denied it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last years of the Bourguiba era, Tunisia was racked by
economic problems and discontent, which were underscored by bread
riots in 1984. Unemployment was painfully high, particularly among
the young.
</P>
<P>
   When he seized power in 1987, ben Ali said Bourguiba had
``become totally incapable of undertaking the duties of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward Kamil Cherif, a senior official of the
Information Ministry, cited examples of how Bourguiba's performance
had deteriorated with age.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in October 1987 Bourguiba had appointed a new chief
delegate to the United Nations, but had soon forgotten that
appointment and named another man to the post. In the same month,
Cherif said, Bourguiba appointed several Cabinet ministers _ only
to contend the following day that he had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   The first free elections in independent Tunisia's history were
held after Bourguiba's downfall. He looked fragile but his manner
was jaunty when he cast his ballot in Monastir on April 10, 1989.
``It is a holiday for me,'' he told the journalists on hand for the
occasion. ``I am voting for Mr. ben Ali and for the list of my
party.''

<P>
   LONDON _ A British judge is expected to rule Tuesday(4/11) in
the contentious legal struggle pitting a maverick historian against
an Atlanta professor who accuses him of manipulating history to
diminish the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began in January, has presented a rare
opportunity for Holocaust experts to confront a representative of
the small cadre of revisionist historians who claim that the Nazi
program of mass extermination either never happened or was greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the lawsuit by writer David Irving against Emory
University professor Deborah Lipstadt has been a test of his charge
that she libeled him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The
Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in many ways, the case has been an exploration of basic
assumptions about what happened in Germany and Eastern Europe
during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government considered the trial important enough to
provide Lipstadt's lawyers with the unpublished prison papers of
Hitler lieutenant Adolf Eichmann to help undermine Irving's
assertions. However, the documents were too late to be used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The witness box has been filled with experts on the Holocaust
who packed the record with documents and analyses to sustain
accepted accounts of the Holocaust. The mass and quality of the
defense's witnesses and documentation contrasted sharply with
Irving's often sloppy work and sometimes curious interpretation of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rampton, the lawyer representing Lipstadt and her
publisher, Penguin Books, took the offensive during much of the
two-month trial, which concluded in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense portrayed Irving as a fraud and a liar who
manipulated historical records and ignored others in his effort to
belittle the Holocaust. Rampton argued that Irving was motivated by
an extremist political agenda, deep anti-Semitism and a misplaced
respect for Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Irving doesn't believe the Nazis killed as many 6 million Jews
in a systematic extermination effort. However, he accepts that the
Nazis were responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a
million, most of whom were killed by malnutrition, disease or
firing squads.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany. others???
</P>
<P>
   Irving also rejected as fiction accounts of Nazis gassing Jews
at concentration camps and says the gas chambers still seen by
tourists at Auschwitz are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer of Hitler, Irving also argued that the Nazi leader
was unaware of the campaign against Jews and other minorities until
late in the war. Hitler, in Irving's words had ``a Richard Nixon
kind of complex'' not to know what others were doing to Jews.
clarify???
</P>
<P>
   In his 104-page closing address, Irving asserted that Lipstadt's
book had been financed and directed by Israeli Holocaust specialist
Professor Yehuda Bauer, then of the Hebrew University, who, he
said, had urged Lipstadt to incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   He said this was part of a 30-year international campaign
against him, led by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American
Jewish Committee, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Board of
Deputies of British Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite evident that the ADL, in cahoots with Lipstadt,
set itself the task of destroying my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their campaign, he said he had been banned from
Germany, Austria, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been subjected since at least 1973, and probably before
then, to what would be called in warfare a 'campaign of
interdiction,''' he said. ``I know of no other historian or writer
who has been subjected to a campaign of vilification even one-tenth
as intense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his once lucrative career as an author and public
speaker has been left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Rampton countered that Irving was a victim of his own failures
as a historian and his tireless campaign to debunk the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's denial that Auschwitz was a death camp had been based
on worthless scientific research, Rampton argued, noting that
Irving had never been to Auschwitz himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt, who is flying back to London for the verdict, did not
testify. Throughout the trial, she sat silently near the front of
the court, typing at two laptops on the table in front of her. One
was loaded with court papers _ the other contained notes on the
book she is writing about the case.
</P>
<P>
   She has refused to discuss the case until the judge reaches his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Charles Gray has provided few clues about where he
stands. A libel expert himself, Gray, wearing his traditional wig
and robes, often provided guidance to Irving, who represented
himself in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he on occasion was clearly impatient with Irving's
rambling, inefficient style.
</P>
<P>
   Irving took exception to two particular points in Lipstadt's
book. One was an assertion that he keeps a portrait of Hitler on
the wall behind his desk. The only portrait on his wall, he said,
is that of Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   The second point concerned a report by Lipstadt that Irving had
agreed to speak in Sweden in 1992 along with American black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan, members of the Russian anti-Semite
organization Pamyat and representatives of two Middle East
terrorist groups, Hezbollah and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish government canceled the planned meeting. Irving
argued that linking him to terrorists and anti-Semites was a
``reckless lie'' that exposed him to possible assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
being punished for challenging conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is about my reputation as a human being (and) a
historian of integrity,'' he said.

 &HT;    QUIET WASHINGTON SUBURB FINDS ITSELF AT CENTER OF ELIAN SAGA

   BETHESDA, Md. _ About five miles outside the nation's capital,
this normally quiet suburban neighborhood where signs on front
lawns tout ``Vote for Pat Baptiste, Democrat for County Council,''
became an international center of attention Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of news reporters mixed with the chirping of birds to
form a surreal picture outside the tan brick house where Juan
Miguel Gonzalez arrived Thursday morning to wait out the fate of
his son, 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez emerged from the house, which belongs Cuban
Interests Section head Fernando Remirez, once with a Cuban official
to walk around the front yard. He made no statement.
</P>
<P>
   The houses along the middle of Millwood Road, in Montgomery
County, are like any other, with yellow and blue pansies in flower
boxes and white picket fences.
</P>
<P>
   Nannies push strollers with snoozing infants and toddlers, while
joggers run up and down the block stopping occasionally to take a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Into that ``American Beauty'' scene Thursday morning, before the
dew lifted from the freshly cut lawns, came the orange and white
barriers, police road blocks and nearly two dozen television
satellite trucks to interrupt the morning's normally tranquil
routine.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to walk his dog Sasha, 25-year resident Marcel
Hodak had to duck under the yellow police tape, and side-step the
TV cable lines that covered the sidewalk outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it, this is something that only
happens on TV,'' Hodak said, mugging for one of the dozens of
camera crews filming the neighborhood. ``Now, I'm on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors, like Alex and Marion Kelly have lived on
Millwood for more than a decade, were more eager to see what was
going on, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with more than 50
television cameras, photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We routinely walk around the neighborhood, and all this
commotion is just providing some excitement for our walk,'' said
Marion Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a possible magnet for protests _ or so the police
believe. The area cordoned off by police for protestors was empty
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic University graduate student Camila Ruiz _ among
several Cuban-American students from colleges and universities in
the Washington area that showed up _ stood behind the barriers
telling reporters that she supported Gonzalez in efforts to get his
son back and hoped he was able to express himself free from the
pressures of Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro has made us (Cuban-Americans) out to be some sort of
mafia,'' said Ruiz, a Cuban-American from Santa Clara, Calif. ``We
only want Juan Gonzalez to come out by himself and to be able to
speak his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In this politically moderate enclave, the sentiment appears to
lean toward the the father being reunited with his son,
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to pass judgement on where a kid should
live,'' said Aileen Cohen, taking her 16-month-old son, Gabriel,
out for his morning stroll.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit her. Pointing toward the media horde, Cohen added,
``It never occurred to me that this could go on for weeks.''

 &HT;    WITH DECISION IN HOLOCAUST TRIAL IMMINENT, MORE THAN AUTHOR'S
REPUTATION AT STAKE

<P>
   LONDON _ A British judge is expected to rule Tuesday(4/11) in
the contentious legal struggle pitting a maverick historian against
an Atlanta professor who accuses him of manipulating history to
diminish the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began in January, has presented a rare
opportunity for Holocaust experts to confront a representative of
the small cadre of revisionist historians who claim that the Nazi
program of mass extermination either never happened or was greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the lawsuit by writer David Irving against Emory
University professor Deborah Lipstadt has been a test of his charge
that she libeled him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The
Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in many ways, the case has been an exploration of basic
assumptions about what happened in Germany and Eastern Europe
during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government considered the trial important enough to
provide Lipstadt's lawyers with the unpublished prison papers of
Hitler lieutenant Adolf Eichmann to help undermine Irving's
assertions. However, the documents were too late to be used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The witness box has been filled with experts on the Holocaust
who packed the record with documents and analyses to sustain
accepted accounts of the Holocaust. The mass and quality of the
defense's witnesses and documentation contrasted sharply with
Irving's often sloppy work and sometimes curious interpretation of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rampton, the lawyer representing Lipstadt and her
publisher, Penguin Books, took the offensive during much of the
two-month trial, which concluded in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense portrayed Irving as a fraud and a liar who
manipulated historical records and ignored others in his effort to
belittle the Holocaust. Rampton argued that Irving was motivated by
an extremist political agenda, deep anti-Semitism and a misplaced
respect for Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Irving doesn't believe the Nazis killed as many 6 million Jews
in a systematic extermination effort. However, he accepts that the
Nazis were responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a
million, most of whom were killed by malnutrition, disease or
firing squads.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany. others???
</P>
<P>
   Irving also rejected as fiction accounts of Nazis gassing Jews
at concentration camps and says the gas chambers still seen by
tourists at Auschwitz are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer of Hitler, Irving also argued that the Nazi leader
was unaware of the campaign against Jews and other minorities until
late in the war. Hitler, in Irving's words had ``a Richard Nixon
kind of complex'' not to know what others were doing to Jews.
clarify???
</P>
<P>
   In his 104-page closing address, Irving asserted that Lipstadt's
book had been financed and directed by Israeli Holocaust specialist
Professor Yehuda Bauer, then of the Hebrew University, who, he
said, had urged Lipstadt to incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   He said this was part of a 30-year international campaign
against him, led by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American
Jewish Committee, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Board of
Deputies of British Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite evident that the ADL, in cahoots with Lipstadt,
set itself the task of destroying my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their campaign, he said he had been banned from
Germany, Austria, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been subjected since at least 1973, and probably before
then, to what would be called in warfare a 'campaign of
interdiction,''' he said. ``I know of no other historian or writer
who has been subjected to a campaign of vilification even one-tenth
as intense.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his once lucrative career as an author and public
speaker has been left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Rampton countered that Irving was a victim of his own failures
as a historian and his tireless campaign to debunk the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's denial that Auschwitz was a death camp had been based
on worthless scientific research, Rampton argued, noting that
Irving had never been to Auschwitz himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt, who is flying back to London for the verdict, did not
testify. Throughout the trial, she sat silently near the front of
the court, typing at two laptops on the table in front of her. One
was loaded with court papers _ the other contained notes on the
book she is writing about the case.
</P>
<P>
   She has refused to discuss the case until the judge reaches his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Charles Gray has provided few clues about where he
stands. A libel expert himself, Gray, wearing his traditional wig
and robes, often provided guidance to Irving, who represented
himself in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he on occasion was clearly impatient with Irving's
rambling, inefficient style.
</P>
<P>
   Irving took exception to two particular points in Lipstadt's
book. One was an assertion that he keeps a portrait of Hitler on
the wall behind his desk. The only portrait on his wall, he said,
is that of Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   The second point concerned a report by Lipstadt that Irving had
agreed to speak in Sweden in 1992 along with American black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan, members of the Russian anti-Semite
organization Pamyat and representatives of two Middle East
terrorist groups, Hezbollah and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish government canceled the planned meeting. Irving
argued that linking him to terrorists and anti-Semites was a
``reckless lie'' that exposed him to possible assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
being punished for challenging conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is about my reputation as a human being (and) a
historian of integrity,'' he said.

`SOUTHPAW': AN IRISH BOXER KEEPS HIS CHIN (AND HIS DREAMS) UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By DAVE KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inspirational Irish documentary ``Southpaw,'' directed by
Liam McGrath, is a profile of Francis Barrett, known as Frankie, a
clean-cut, soft-spoken young man with a winning smile and a mean
left hand. He dreams of becoming an Olympic boxer in the
light-welterweight category, and by the looks of things he has some
talent.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett also has a disadvantage: he and his family are
Travelers, members of an old and well-defined itinerant caste. Once
Travelers lived in handsome, horse-drawn wagons, spoke their own
language and grandly roamed the countryside. (See Mike Newell's
1992 film on the subject, ``Into the West.'') These days, though,
they more often occupy dingy house trailers anchored in abandoned
lots on the edge of the city, living without utilities or social
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing, of course, has long been a favorite fictional device for
moving characters up the social ladder; it's a sport that takes
what is assumed to be a lower-class talent _ a skill in physical
violence _ and ennobles it with an upper-class income. But Barrett
is no Jim Corbett or Mike Tyson, living out the American dream by
battling his way from poverty to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His ambitions are modest, and his means appear to be even more
so, as he is shown going about his training in a sadly
underequipped amateur boxing club.
</P>
<P>
   The self-appointed head of the storefront institution, grandly
called the Galway Olympic Club, is Chick Gillen, a middle-aged
barber and expansive local character who doubles as Barrett's
coach. Because Gillen seems to have no actual boxing experience,
his coaching is largely limited to platitudes on the order of
``Keep your chin up.'' His main function in McGrath's film is to
keep the blarney level high enough to please fans of ``Waking Ned
Devine'' and the many other made-for-export Irish comedies that
have lately filled American screens.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise ``Southpaw'' mostly dodges the whimsy and sentiment
that define the Uber-Irish genre, though McGrath can't resist
inserting the occasional reaction shot of a lovable codger pulling
on his pint. (Helpfully, the thickest accents have been subtitled.)
McGrath's filmmaking is plain and straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   What the film resembles more than anything else is one of the
miniature human-interest profiles that the networks have taken to
inserting between the events in their Olympic coverage, little
films designed to increase viewer interest by increasing their
identification with the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign of the anger that Barrett must have known as a
member of a persecuted minority. Instead, the film portrays him as
all smiles and optimism, boyish and unthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southpaw'' begins with Barrett's journey to the Olympic Games
in Atlanta, where his greatest moment comes in being allowed to
carry the Irish flag in the opening ceremonies, and concludes with
him training for the Olympics scheduled for September in Sydney,
Australia. You can only wish him luck.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rapid changes will continue across the eastern half of the
nation Friday as powerful jet stream winds propel storms from the
Plains to the Northeast in less than two days. New England will be
cool and dry with fading sunshine. The Middle Atlantic region
should start dull, but become brighter and warmer, though not as
windy as Thursday. The Southeast will stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of light to moderate snow will fall from the eastern
Dakotas to Wisconsin as a storm strengthens over Missouri. Showers
and a few thunderstorms will dampen the middle Mississippi and Ohio
valleys. A cold rain is expected near the southern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Warm air over the southern Plains will yield to advancing cold
from the north. Snow showers will end in the eastern Rockies. High
pressure building into the Northwest will promote dry, milder
weather.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: STRONG WINDS
</P>
<P>
   A fast-moving storm brought wind gusts between 45 mph and 60 mph
from the Middle West to the Northeast on Wednesday and Thursday.
Steady strong winds can be traced to great horizontal pressure
contrasts in the atmosphere. Extreme gusts usually result when
turbulent air motions, akin to eddies in a rushing stream, mix
winds from thousands of feet above the ground toward the earth's
surface. Winds at altitudes of 10,000 to 20,000 feet, unencumbered
by frictional forces, commonly reach 50 to 100 knots providing the
impetus for gusty ground-level winds. &QL;

THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN EARNING A LIVING, AUTHOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think you don't have time to read this review, maybe you
should make time.
</P>
<P>
   It could change your life.
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument made by Beth Sawi, a top executive of
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. who recently wrote a book on how time
management shapes lives.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Coming Up For Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a
Workaholic World'' (Hyperion, 253 pages, $23.95), Sawi makes the
case that individuals need not work endless hours to succeed.
Rather, success is achieved by establishing priorities and
allocating time to attain those objectives, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people spend time thinking about what is important to
them other than their work,'' Sawi writes. ``This is such a great
loss. Identifying your priorities is like paging through a
scrapbook of fondly remembered times. Each image brings a smile of
recognition and a sense of belonging. Once you reacquaint yourself
with your core values, you'll always have your guiding stars, even
during the darkest times.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lifestyle goals are different for each individual.
Although some people remain focused on the monetary and prestige
rewards that come from work, others strive to spend more time with
their family, focus on charity efforts or simply walk the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Success, the author contends, depends on setting and adhering to
time-management priorities rather than trying to live up to others'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi writes, for instance, of the single mother who decided to
curtail socializing at work so that she could get her assignments
done during traditional working hours. She decided that getting
work done and getting home to her family is more important to her
than catching up on the lives of co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of focusing exclusively on accomplishments that others
acclaim, you need to concentrate on what will make you a happier
and more authentic person,'' Sawi writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focusing on these inner fundamental goals will force you to
reorder your priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's message is akin to many delivered in self-help
books. The difference is that Sawi peppers her writing with
real-life anecdotes and easy-to-understand exercises that simplify
the task of applying time-management lessons in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi brings a realistic outlook to time-management issues and
provides helpful suggestions for dealing with workplace issues,
ranging from demanding bosses to peer pressure to work extended
hours.
</P>
<P>
   She offers readers a useful map for navigating the road away
from workaholism and into a more balanced, rewarding life. Although
some individuals may sacrifice career goals to attain such a life,
the pursuit of balance can empower some to embrace a lifestyle that
makes them more effective at work and happier on a personal basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, people assume that adding balance to their lives
will lessen their work contributions,'' Sawi writes. ``But
frequently, respecting all that's important to you rejuvenates your
entire being, generating more energy both for your work life and
your home life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawi urges readers to establish priorities by imagining what
perspective they will have on life at 80. By analyzing what will be
most important over the long term, people can become more focused
on how to better use the individual moments of each day in reaching
their life goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of your life,'' Sawi writes, ``you won't be
remembered for how you earned your money, but for how you spent
your time.''

   ``Play Like a Man Win Like a Woman: What Men Know About Success
That Women Need to Learn''
</P>
<P>
   By Gail Evans
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Books, $35.95
</P>
<P>
   Women still feel ``baffled, angry, lost, trapped, stuck and
overwhelmed'' in the workplace _ even executives of large
corporations, says Gail Evans, an executive vice president at CNN.
But Evans says some of the glass ceiling is self-created, and she
offers ideas for climbing the corporate ladder that men have always

world, offering a positive approach to women's careers rather than
a rehashing of how bad the obstacles are.

   ``The Cult of Busyness,'' ``TempWorld'' and ``Laptops at the

Capitalizing on the good parts of the business world _ flexible,
fulfilling, independent careers _ while sidestepping the bad parts
_ layoffs, cutbacks, longer days, fewer vacations _ is part of what
business guru and speaker Barbara Moses preaches in her latest
book.

   Congress changed the tax code to make home-based office
deduction rules less restrictive than at any time since 1976,
writes Gary Carter, who has spent more than 20 years as a revenue
auditor, tax practitioner and faculty member at the University of
Minnesota. Before you finish (or start) your 1999 taxes, it might
be worth perusing this book, which focuses squarely on the home
office and what can and cannot be deducted.

 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; movie-list.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching those trailers while people are still finding
their seats and rattling their popcorn bags? Then Movie-List is for
you. The site features theatrical trailers for all the hot movies
coming out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers trailers and so-called teasers (shorter versions
of the trailer) in Quicktime. They are available in high-resolution
or low-resolution formats, depending on the speed of your
connection and how long you want to wait for a download.
</P>
<P>
   Recent additions to the site include trailers for ``The Hollow
Man,''which features Kevin Bacon as a not-so-nice invisible man,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary about the British punk
band the Sex Pistols, and ``Dinosaur,'' a Disney film about
prehistoric creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There also is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a new John Travolta flick
based on an L. Ron Hubbard book and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' the
remake of the '70s movie of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage
and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   So, grab some popcorn and soda, and take a gander. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MAGAZINE REVIEWS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BOY'S LIFE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ESQUIRE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``OUTSIDE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth
picking up for story on the ``Surf Chimp,'' a long-armed surfer
dude named Jeff Hakman who dominated his sport, founded a
multimillion-dollar surfwear company and then lost it all to a
heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno
stuff _ phones, pagers, Iridium satellites _ when you head out to
the wilderness, so you can forget about civilization. What was that
again? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``REASON'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's
innocent, but because he's an expert at managing the news and
handling internal crises. Interesting piece offers ``a five-step
program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever. &QL;

AND ``L'' CATEGORIES) 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books: &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE OPERATOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Tom King (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This biography of producer and record industry mogul David
Geffen is interesting on two levels. First, there is King's
portrayal of Geffen as a man of ratlike cunning, a dealmaker with a
voracious lust for money and power. Even more interesting is
Geffen's involvement with celebrities of the past three decades,
whose professional and personal lives he directed with both
tyrannical self-interest and the concern of a doting den mother. He
was engaged to Cher until she dumped him for Gregg Allman. ``I want
all my presents back!'' Geffen shouted and then went into a deep
depression, which he conquered by attending ``est'' seminars and
facing up to his homosexuality. He was arrested for buying drugs
for David Crosby, and he comforted Yoko Ono at the hospital after
John Lennon died. His friends included Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and
Jackson Browne, and he was once rumored to have secretly married
Keanu Reeves. He even counseled the president and first lady after
the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke _ there is no end to his
territory. King is a reporter for the ``Wall Street Journal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SEEING MARY PLAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Frances Kiernan (Norton, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a word for Mary McCarthy, and it isn't pretty. Today,
more than a decade after her death, she is known for her
controversial meanspiritedness far more than for her fiction or
criticism. As Kiernan says in this honest and oddly affectionate
biography, if she had never written a single word, we would still
want to know about her. She was outspoken, sarcastic, beautiful and
intimidating, a writer who held strong views on many subjects and
did not suffer fools gladly. She is most widely known, perhaps, for
the remark she made about Lillian Hellman in a televised interview
with Dick Cavett in 1980: ``Every word she writes,'' McCarthy said,
`is a lie, including `and' and `the.' '' Hellman sued but McCarthy
refused to back down, even when the lawsuit threatened to bankrupt
her. Kiernan, a former editor at the ``New Yorker,'' conducted
interviews with McCarthy's friends, former lovers, colleagues and
acquaintances, some of whom reveal lingering distaste for a woman
who was capable, as Clifton Fadiman once wrote, ``of dissecting
people and leaving a nasty mess on the table.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``JOAN OF ARC'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Mary Gordon (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delight of the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short biographies
is the pairing of author and subject, and the brevity of the
effort. These ``biographies'' rarely reach 200 pages, and because
of it they take on a decidedly personal tone _ we sense the
writer's pleasure in what he or she is writing about, and it
becomes part of our pleasure as well. Past or planned installments
include Larry McMurtry writing on Crazy Horse, Jonathan Spence on
Mao Tse-tung, Edna O'Brien on James Joyce, Bobbie Ann Mason on
Elvis Presley, and Roy Blount Jr. on Robert E. Lee. Now we have
Mary Gordon, whose writing is steeped in her experience of Roman
Catholicism, pondering the shocking and much-manipulated story of
the French girl-soldier who at 17 left her village to lead an army
and two years later died in agony. Joan was not perfect, and Gordon
addresses her sins as well as her sainthood. She is not so much the
patroness of France, writes Gordon, as ``the patroness of the vivid
life, prized not for military victories but for the gift of
passionate action taken against ridiculous odds, for the grace of
holding nothing back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CYBILL DISOBEDIENCE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Cybill Shepherd (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd has written a memoir about her sex life, and she has
dedicated it to her parents. OK, we exaggerate _ only half of it is
about her sex life (including a romp with Elvis Presley _ you'll
want to read that part). Maybe she's hoping her parents won't
notice. Still, once you get past its unfortunate title and
prologue, this is an engaging book. Shepherd is smart. She says she
reads Henry James and Joseph Conrad and is inspired by Goethe. She
might be making that up, but she uses the word ``flummoxed''
correctly and with a straight face, and we think she means it. She
is funny and self-deprecating in much the same way that Candice
Bergen was in her better-than-average memoir, ``Knock Wood.''
Shepherd talks about her family, career, marriages and lovers,
leading men (Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis), aging and its
ramifications for an actress (``It's OK for Robert Mitchum to get
up early in the morning and look like Robert Mitchum, but it was
not OK for me to wake up in the morning and look like Robert
Mitchum . . .''). She's not Goethe, but there's more to her than
meets the eye.  &QL;

BUTTRESSING AN OLD CITY   WITH NEW ARTISTIC GIRDERS

(An information box appears at end of story.) By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Like the fantasy pleasure dome of Xanadu, the term
movie palace conjures up a magical image: a romantic time when the
film world was bursting with technological advances, complemented
by live entertainment. In downtown Pittsburgh alone, there were
once eight such extravaganzas within a few blocks' radius, and in
their heyday, the 1920s and '30s, people flocked to the cinema and
to vaudeville acts in an atmosphere that dripped with gilded
plaster and crystal chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 30 years. Pittsburgh was in a financial slump. But
the Pittsburgh Symphony, thriving nonetheless, required a new home
beyond the Syria Mosque. Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill was hired to design a new home, but, to the city's eventual
good fortune, the effort stalled. Then in 1967 Henry John Heinz II,
who had recently retired as chairman of the H.J. Heinz Co., made a
momentous visit to the once-lavish Loews Penn Theater, accompanied
by the president of the symphony. With a grant from the Howard
Heinz Endowment, the symphony bought the property and the rest is
legend: Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts opened in 1971, with its
plush three-story-high domed lobby and an arcade of Corinthian
columns with gilded capitals.
</P>
<P>
   This became the turning point and the gold standard for an
imaginative urban renaissance based on Heinz's theory that the arts
lead the way to economic development. Rather than destroying an old
neighborhood to build a congested performing arts center,
Pittsburgh opted to create a performing arts district: many of its
cultural institutions are housed in the restored regal surroundings
of its surviving movie palaces, scattered through a 14-square-block
area that had been a red-light district. It is now called the
Pittsburgh Cultural District and is overseen by the 16-year-old
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent rain-slicked Saturday night at curtain time, the
streets were bustling with theatergoers coming from parking lots
dispersed sensibly through the area or from neighborhood
restaurants. The thrill is enhanced by the great marquee of the
Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, the former Stanley Theater,
where the chaser lights are miraculously intact.
</P>
<P>
   On a side facade of the center, flashing lights still announce
``Stanley's Photoplays.'' Inside, the immense barrel-vaulted lobby
and performance hall have been restored to their original palette
of Etruscan colors, with decorative plasterwork burnished with
aluminum-foil gilt. Relighted with chandeliers, the entire space
glows with a festive air that inspires the audience to dress up for
the occasion, on this evening a performance of Massenet's opera
``Werther'' by the Pittsburgh Opera under the artistic direction of
Tito Capobianco.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural district here, which includes new public squares
and parkland on the Allegheny River, reflects a general mood in
Pittsburgh. As the largest inland port in America (the Delta Queen
calls about twice a year), it is a true early gateway to the West.
At the majestic confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio
Rivers, the city encompasses 40 miles of riverfront and more than
2,000 bridges, representing almost every style of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   While this city boasts old, established cultural institutions
like the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History and obligatory
skyscrapers like the 1984 neo-Gothic spires in reflective glass for
PPG Place by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, there is a new
vivacity that accompanies the emerging biomedical and computer
science industries spurred by the research units of its major
universities.
</P>
<P>
   NEW LIFE FOR OLD BUILDINGS
</P>
<P>
   One could say that Pittsburgh's fighting spirit in the face of
its loss of the steel industry comes from its namesake, William
Pitt, who as prime minister of Britain in the 1750s gave the
colonists the wherewithal to do proper battle against the French.
After his forces captured Fort Duquesne in 1758, one of Gen. John
Forbes' last acts was to name their conquest after Pitt, whose
spirit had made them, he said, ``masters of the place.'' This story
is inscribed on a plaque outside H.H. Richardson's celebrated
Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, two massive turreted piles of
rusticated stone linked across a city street by a Bridge of Sighs
providing secure passage for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pittsburgh's steel industry died, none of its other
important elements did; the city survived, unlike others caught up
in a similar economic downturn. To prove it, three department
stores thrive downtown. But there is a lot of vacant real estate,
and the trick has been to renovate and incorporate the empty
structures there into the texture of urban life in a ``practical,
affordable, useful and beautiful'' way, said Teresa Heinz, who has
carried on the family's philanthropic interests since the death of
her husband Sen. John Heinz III.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural trust's consortium, for example, includes two other
theaters in addition to Heinz Hall and the Benedum, with at least
1,200 events a year taking place in the district. The opera shares
the Benedum with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, the Civic Light
Opera, visiting dance companies and touring Broadway shows. Now in
its 61st season, the opera company has been staging four operas a
year. Next year, a fifth, ``Therese Raquin,'' by the American
composer Tobias Picker and commissioned in a joint production with
the Dallas and Montreal Operas, will be staged at the nearby
1,329-seat Byham Theater, a renovated vaudeville hall the size of
smaller European opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   For a site down the street from the Benedum, on the footprint of
a vaudeville house demolished after sustaining damage in a 1936
flood, the cultural trust commissioned Michael Graves to design the
only new theater in the district. The O'Reilly Theater, now the
home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater, has all the charm of Graves'
own drawings of squat classical stone pavilions in rustic
landscapes.

<P>
   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; movie-list.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching those trailers while people are still finding
their seats and rattling their popcorn bags? Then Movie-List is for
you. The site features theatrical trailers for all the hot movies
coming out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers trailers and so-called teasers (shorter versions
of the trailer) in Quicktime. They are available in high-resolution
or low-resolution formats, depending on the speed of your
connection and how long you want to wait for a download.
</P>
<P>
   Recent additions to the site include trailers for ``The Hollow
Man,''which features Kevin Bacon as a not-so-nice invisible man,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' a documentary about the British punk
band the Sex Pistols, and ``Dinosaur,'' a Disney film about
prehistoric creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There also is ``Battlefield Earth,'' a new John Travolta flick
based on an L. Ron Hubbard book and ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' the
remake of the '70s movie of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage
and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   So, grab some popcorn and soda, and take a gander. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MAGAZINE REVIEWS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BOY'S LIFE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ESQUIRE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``OUTSIDE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth
picking up for story on the ``Surf Chimp,'' a long-armed surfer
dude named Jeff Hakman who dominated his sport, founded a
multimillion-dollar surfwear company and then lost it all to a
heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno
stuff _ phones, pagers, Iridium satellites _ when you head out to
the wilderness, so you can forget about civilization. What was that
again? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``REASON'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's
innocent, but because he's an expert at managing the news and
handling internal crises. Interesting piece offers ``a five-step
program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever. &QL;

PITTSBURGH: rustic landscapes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A BRIGHT NIGHT LIFE
</P>
<P>
   There is also a whiff of Alvar Aalto in the side view of red
brick and blue tile walls. The theater's porous semicircular glass
facade is an inviting presence on the streetscape, making it an
easy stop for buying tickets. At night the second-level foyer,
capped by a barrel-vaulted roof, offers lively views of theater
crowds. Behind the foyer's long bar hangs one of Graves' murals of
pavilions in the Italian countryside. Playing at the O'Reilly on a
recent weekend was Conor McPherson's peripatetic play ``The Weir,''
with some Irish cast members who lent authenticity to the mystery.
The O'Reilly's thrust stage, though close to the audience, is
always an island of space unto itself, thus maintaining the
theatrical illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The show does not stop in Pittsburgh when the performances end,
as a walk in the neighborhood proves. At the central intersection
of Penn Avenue and Seventh Street, two squares face each other with
public sculptures that exert an especially powerful force after
dark. In a fresh interpretation of the civic fountain, the artist
Louise Bourgeois fashioned for the Agnes R. Katz Plaza a
25-foot-high spiral mountain of bronze with water rushing down its
troughs, which are illuminated fiber-optically with a bluish light.
</P>
<P>
   Seen against the lights of Pittsburgh's skyline, this glowing
mound has become a strong nocturnal image, particularly in its park
setting of clipped linden trees designed by Dan Kiley. By
collaborating, the sculptor and landscape architect have produced a
winning urban plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the Russian artist Aleksandr Brodsky
constructed a different sort of mound, a vast pyramid of Beaux-Arts
terra-cotta ornaments from buildings that had been demolished in
the district. Long buried in a ditch, the pieces were retrieved and
inventoried before the artist carefully piled the cornices, columns
and rosettes into a kind of memorial to vanished architecture.
``Palazzo Nudo'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Set behind a chain-link fence and a cage of metal scaffolding
with hanging industrial lights, this elegant scrap pile glistens
with new life on a rainy night. While many buildings were
destroyed, the streets are now lined with others that were once
marred by false fronts but now reveal their original facades
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Night lighting is a major ingredient in animating the cultural
district and is the basis of another ingenious collaboration, this
one between the artist-designer Robert Wilson and the architect
Richard Gluckman. In addition to the main avenues and cross
streets, the district is filled with back alleys and blank walls
next to empty lots where buildings once stood. Lightwalls for
beauty and safety were the answer rather than ugly,
income-producing billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light will be an object and light will be space'' and ``light
will be static and light will be dynamic'' are how the team
describes a phenomenon that it expects will enliven the
neighborhood and in time, no doubt, cities everywhere. While
reviving the movie palaces builds on the past, the lightwalls will
be one of the trust's contributions to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The first one has been installed on a wall next to a parking lot
near the Benedum: an eerie wash of pale light with a horizontal
band of the faintest mauve moving slowly down the side of the
building. It transforms a drab wall into a theater set.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, people are beginning to move into this loft
district (along with one dry cleaner and a florist), and its seven
art galleries are a draw during the day, as are the exhibitions at
the trust's own Wood Street Galleries. The adjoining neighborhood,
called the Strip and home to Pittsburgh's wholesale food markets,
is a lively mecca of shops and restaurants, particularly on
Saturday mornings. Embracing the Rivers
</P>
<P>
   As part of its city planning, the cultural trust has also taken
the lead in opening up the adjacent riverfront area: Pittsburgh,
like many major river cities, had turned its back on its greatest
resource. A 1911 Olmsted Brothers' concept for a narrow collar of
parks along the Allegheny and Monongahela that joined where the two
met the Ohio at Point State Park had lain dormant until it served
as inspiration to another team commissioned by the trust, this time
to design Allegheny Riverfront Park at the edge of the cultural
district.
</P>
<P>
   A match was made between the landscape artist Michael Van
Valkenburgh and the artist Ann Hamilton, who represented the United
States last year at the Venice Biennale. A 4,000-foot-long,
35-foot-wide esplanade runs under the three Sister Bridges; it is
approached from the street by long ramps with an undulating bronze
handrail that connotes thin tree trunks with the smoothness of an
arm. High vine screens for Virginia creeper create a vertical wall
from the street above, where a second phase of the park will
eventually be planted with plane trees.
</P>
<P>
   To border the promenade below Van Valkenburgh has planted a
crush of native flood plain trees and rugged plants, expecting that
they will not all survive the periodic flooding and winter ice
floes, and interspersed among them boulders collected from the area
that give the plantings a Japanese quality and also serve as
convenient seating.
</P>
<P>
   When the cement was poured for the walkway along the water,
Hamilton devised a method to lay dry reeds into the wet cement so
that the promenade has a bulrush pattern that looks like a fossil
from the original shoreline. The rough surface favors walkers over
in-line skaters and skateboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Allegheny on Pittsburgh's North Side, art is also a
catalyst for redevelopment, as is already well known from the
museum dedicated to Pittsburgh's native son Andy Warhol. The story
of the sculptor Barbara Luderowski and the founding of the Mattress
Factory in 1977 as a museum of installation art on Sampsonia Way is
another example of the city's cultural draw.
</P>
<P>
   When Luderowski stopped in Pittsburgh in the early 1970s, on the
way to show her work in New York, she was driven around the narrow
streets of town houses on the North Side and fell in love with the
neighborhood. She never got to New York. Instead she returned to
Michigan, sold her house there and moved to Pittsburgh, where she
eventually purchased the old mattress factory that is an ideal
architectural framework for conveying the imaginary worlds of
installation art. Later she bought a house and a storefront on
adjoining streets to expand the museum.

   A COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS
</P>
<P>
   The title of the current exhibition, ``Installations by Asian
Artists in Residence,'' also explains the museum's method, devised
by Luderowski as the artistic director and by the curator, Michael
Olijnyk. The artists live at the Mattress Factory as a community
while they build their art.
</P>
<P>
   In constructing his phantom house of cast paraffin wax that
fills an entire gallery, the Japanese artist Goro Hirata based his
design on a traditional Japanese house with shoji screens. Because
the material is translucent, natural light from the windows glows
through the walls and shifts during the day. Sora Kim, from Seoul,
South Korea, filled another gallery with a product called
D-Gravitzer, along with its marketing campaign that proves how
being relieved of gravity allows the user to clean ceilings and
difficult corners.
</P>
<P>
   Two of James Turrell's disquieting room installations dealing
with the perception of light are among the permanent exhibits, as
is Jene Highstein's ``Bed-Sitting Rooms for Artist in Residence,''
in which two beds slide back and forth between slots in the wall,
depending on the number of occupants in a room.
</P>
<P>
   Even the garden, designed by Winifred Lutz, is installation art.
In a brilliant stroke, she created an archaeological site by
excavating the basement of a burned-out factory next door,
uncovering several levels reached by steps with twisted iron
handrails. Planted with grasses and wildflowers, it could be a site
from ancient Rome.

ILLINOIS' CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGES PARISHIONERS TO OPPOSE RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic bishops of Illinois have issued a pastoral
letter calling on the 3.7 million parishioners in their state to
oppose all forms of racist behavior, including the use of bigoted
language and racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, focused on bias against African-Americans, was
posted on the Archdiocese of Chicago's Internet site
(www.archdiocese-chgo.org) on Tuesday, the 32nd anniversary of the
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and is being
mailed this week to parishes in the state's six dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter _ asking Catholics to pray for an end to racism,
avoid investing in companies with racist policies and back public
officials committed to racial healing _ is not the first time that
American bishops have spoken out on the issue. In 1979, the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement
describing racism as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois bishops said that although ``some progress'' had
been made since then, no one should be lulled into believing racism
is no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the case,'' the bishops wrote in the letter,
titled ``Moving Beyond Racism: Learning to see with the Eyes of
Christ.'' They added, ``Events continue to remind us that racism
thrives.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they cited hate speech on the Internet; the 1998
murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man chained to a pickup truck and
dragged to death in Texas, and the torture of Abner Louima, a
Haitian immigrant, in a New York police station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is so blatantly racist,'' the bishops wrote, ``that
it can shock and therefore move us to ask again how to confront
more effectively the sin of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anita Baird, executive assistant to Cardinal Francis
George, the archbishop of Chicago, said in a telephone interview
that the letter originated in a 1994 request by those working with
black Catholic parishioners in the Illinois dioceses that the
bishops as a group speak out against racism and economic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the process was interrupted by the death of Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, George's predecessor as archbishop, in November
1996. Later, the bishops decided to release the letter in 2000,
which the church has proclaimed a Jubilee Year, a period that
emphasizes themes of conversion and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping every member of the parishes will have the
opportunity to read it and have the opportunity to discuss it,''
Sister Baird said.

trucks and tractor-trailers have rumbled west on Interstate 30 to a
privately run landfill on the rolling prairie near the
Tarrant-Parker county line. Overflowing with reminders of the March
28 storms, the trucks have disgorged tons of glass, roofing
shingles, old-growth trees, and bent and broken remnants of homes.

   Hollywood, Back When ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was great friends with your mother,'' Leatrice
Gilbert Fountain told Budd Schulberg as they shook hands in a suite
at the Drake Hotel in New York City. The occasion was the annual
New York visit of the Turner Classic Movies Archival Project, an
ongoing initiative of the cable channel to interview every
available witness to the golden age of American film
</P>
<P>
   Fountain, who is the daughter of the silent film stars John
Gilbert and Leatrice Joy, and Schulberg had never met, though both
grew up in the same small town that was Hollywood in the 1920s and
'30s. Schulberg, apart from being the author of ``What Makes Sammy
Run?'' and the screenplay of ``On the Waterfront,'' is the son of
the early Paramount boss B.P. Schulberg and the literary agent Ad
Schulberg.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of encounter that makes the archival project
particularly rewarding, said Tom Karsch, TCM's general manager.
``Out of everything we do, I am most proud of this, because if
Matisse were alive or Degas, you'd want to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day marathon last week, the TCM crew, led by the
producer-interviewers Alexa Foreman and Maureen Corley, conducted
13 hourlong interviews with the likes of Jason Robards, Jane Powell
and Sheila MacRae. Shot on 16-mm film, the interviews will be used
as lead-ins to feature presentations on TCM or incorporated into
profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite thing about the project is the feeling that it's
old home week,'' said Darcy Hettrich, the project's director of
talent. ``People end up seeing people they haven't seen in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   On camera, Schulberg talked about his childhood in a household
where Charles Chaplin and Maurice Chevalier would compete for
attention at parties. His interview concluded, Schulberg expressed
regret that he didn't have time to talk about Marshall ``Mickey''
Neilan, a dashing figure who directed many of Mary Pickford's early
hits, fell on hard times in the '30s and made his last appearance,
shortly before he died, in a supporting role in Schulberg's 1957
``A Face in the Crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Neilan was a great example of the passing seasons of
success, of how fast people could go up and down that roller
coaster. I saw him at the height of his fame, as a 14- or
15-year-old on my bicycle, cruising Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   There were two white Packard Phaetons, open, and in one of them
was Mickey Neilan and his girlfriend Gloria Swanson, and in the
second car were about six members of the Abe Lyman Orchestra, whom
he had traveling with him wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's fascinated me all my life. Nothing fails
in America like success. And everything that's true about America
is doubly, triply true of Hollywood.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tips From the Duke &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right now Iben Hjejle is appearing in two very different films
on New York screens. In Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's Danish film
``Mifune,'' she is a Copenhagen prostitute who takes a job as a
housekeeper on a remote farm; in Stephen Frears' Hollywood film
``High Fidelity,'' she is a Chicago law student struggling to break
off her relationship with a record-store owner (John Cusack).
</P>
<P>
   Two different worlds, two different languages, two highly
engaging, equally convincing performances. How did she make the
transition?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened that `Mifune' was screened at the Berlin Film
Festival last year,'' Hjejle (her full name is pronounced EE-ben
YAY-luh) said by telephone from Denmark. ``There was a party after
the screening and the director, Soren Kragh-Jacobsen, and I went up
to Stephen Frears and said that we really admired his work. One of
my favorite movies is his `Dangerous Liaisons.' So we talked for a
little while, and then Frears asked me if I would be interested in
working in America with him that same summer, because he was doing
this project with John Cusack.''
</P>
<P>
   Hjejle, 29, attributes her ease with the language to her mother,
who taught English for 25 years. ``I grew up with the language, and
also English classes begin in fifth grade here in Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Language is one thing, but how do you learn to be an American?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that different,'' she said. ``My generation grew up
watching American movies and American TV series, and they were
never dubbed; they were always subtitled in Danish with the
original language.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorites were the old John Ford westerns. A lot of
American male actors were my idols when I was a kid. Actually, I
would love to be John Wayne. The gunslinger thing. I thought he was
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hero was Max von Sydow. ``He made the leap,'' she said.
``He was one of the first Scandinavians ever to go to America to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she be following in his footsteps, as well Ingrid Bergman's
and Greta Garbo's? ``They were Swedes, though,'' she said. ``Now,
I'll try to see if I can make it for Denmark.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dignity of Silence &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter Howard A. Rodman has been thinking about Joseph
Mitchell, the New Yorker writer, for almost seven years, ever since
the producer Michael Lieber presented him with the opportunity of
adapting Mitchell's 1964 profile ``Joe Gould's Secret'' for the
movies. The film, directed by Stanley Tucci, opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things he has thought about is Mitchell's three
decades of silence between the publication of ``Joe Gould'' and his
death in 1996. ``Joe Gould'' is the story of a legendary Greenwich
Village bohemian who claimed to have written an ``Oral History of
Our Time'' that was hardly seen and _ except for a few pages _
never published.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitchell's own standards for what prose must be became so high
that he felt he could no longer meet them,'' Rodman said over
coffee at the Gramercy Park Hotel. ``Then there's that Samuel
Beckett quote, `Every word is a stain upon silence.' I think people
who write as well as Mitchell do understand that actually even
better than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I loved about `Joe Gould's Secret' is that rather
than trying to solve the mystery of Joe Gould's silence he gives it
its whole dignity, the dignity of its own ultimate unknowability. I
think that that's the least one can do for Mitchell, which is to
give his silence the same respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another supposition is that he may have gone back to the grand
Joycean novel he describes at the beginning of `Joe Gould's
Secret,' about the young man from the South who comes to New York
and falls in love with a woman who is really New York City. I would
like to think that for all those years he was working on the novel.
But that's a supposition out of whole cloth, and one full of
wishful thinking.''

FORMER PREMIER OF PAKISTAN IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete writethru to add details and reactions to

 By BARRY BEARAK   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Nawaz Sharif, ousted as Pakistan's prime
minister in a military coup in October, was convicted Thursday of
hijacking a commercial airliner, sentenced to life imprisonment
rather than death and ordered to forfeit all his personal property.
</P>
<P>
   Standing along with six co-defendants, who were each acquitted,
the balding, doughy Sharif barely blinked when the judgment was
read. A shriek from his daughter Maryam broke the silence. ``Have
fear of God!'' she cried. Her mother, Kulsoom Nawaz, attempting
stoicism, quieted her and other relatives who had begun to wail.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, 52, was then quickly led away. His family and followers,
many clutching copies of the Koran, tried to chase after him,
shouting, ``Long live Nawaz Sharif!''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's crime was not an ordinary hijacking, at least as most
of the world understands the term. No weapon was used. Sharif was
not even aboard the aircraft. His crime was to issue orders, which
he later rescinded, telling the airport's ground control to refuse
permission for landing to a Karachi-bound airliner, sending it out
of the country. The plane, according to the pilot, then found
itself low on fuel, and the lives of everyone on board were
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 198 people on the plane was Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who
the prime minister had fired as army chief of staff just hours
earlier. Sharif had an urgent reason to keep the general elsewhere:
Army officers had begun to stage a coup. The general, once safely
on the ground, took control of Pakistan and named himself its chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rahmat Hussain Jaffri took these unusual circumstances
into account in sparing Sharif death by hanging and meting out the
lesser penalty of two concurrent life terms _ one for hijacking,
another for terrorism. In Pakistan, a life sentence is defined as
25 years, though there is the chance of an early release for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's attorneys immediately said they would appeal, insisting
that too much weight had been given to the testimony of Aminullah
Chaudhry, the former head of the civil aviation authority and the
man who claimed to have received Sharif's orders to waylay the jet.
Chaudhry, at one time a defendant, won release by becoming a state
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He purchased his freedom with the neck of another person,''
said a defense lawyer, Manzoor Ahmed Malik.
</P>
<P>
   In a 157-page decision distributed Thursday, the judge wrote
that the hijacking ``was committed at the spur of the moment and in
heat of passion'' after Sharif ``came to know that his authority
was eroded by some few army soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, the judge said, fell within the confines of
Pakistan's penal code, which has an elastic definition of
hijacking, assessing guilt to ``whoever unlawfully, by the use or
show of force or by threats of any kind, seizes or exercises
control of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was heard in Pakistan's anti-terrorism court, a venue
for heinous crimes and speedy trials that had been instituted by
Sharif himself. Indeed, he had wanted to ban any appellate process,
though other lawmakers deemed that draconian. As it stands, an
appeal from the anti-terrorism court must be filed within seven
working days. A higher court then has a month to decide. A further
appeal can be made to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors too have a right to appeal, and chief public
prosecutor Raja Qureshi said he objected to the acquittals given
the six other defendants, among them Sharif's brother Shahbaz, who
had been chief minister of the state of Punjab. The government had
asked that Nawaz Sharif receive the death penalty, and Qureshi said
he may well request the higher court to consider the harsher
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the military government seemed pleased with
Thursday's events. Javed Jabbar, a special adviser to Musharraf,
lingered at the courthouse. He wryly and triumphantly said: ``This
was an extraordinarily bizarre situation _ a first in the history
of the world _ where a national leader had decided to become the
country's chief air traffic controller as well. It was a symbolic
expression of Nawaz Sharif's attempt to ruin Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharif case has been an intensely watched political soap
opera. Pakistan is a nation of 150 million people, a developing
nuclear arsenal and a nearly bankrupt economy. It has spent half
its 52 years under military rule _ and half under inept and corrupt
elected officials. Musharraf is but the latest army officer to
overthrow the government only to then claim his intent is to make
Pakistan safe for democracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharif and Musharraf offered competing stories that raised the
question of which came first: the coup or the hijacking?
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court, Sharif explained that he and the
general had been at odds since last summer, after the prime
minister withdrew Pakistani-backed forces from a series of violent
battles with the Indian military in the mountains of Kashmir. He
said he ``had reliable secret information'' that an army coup was
in the works and he tried to head it off by replacing Musharraf
with someone more loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The general has told a far different story, calling Sharif a
corrupt and incompetent leader. He said his officers had reacted
spontaneously to save him and the other airline passengers from
death, taking over the air traffic control tower ``when
circumstances were created which would have forced our plane either
to land in India or crash.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was court testimony that Sharif had ordered the
aircraft diverted, witnesses also suggested that he had changed his
mind when repeatedly told of the plane's fuel problems. He then
decided the airliner could land within Pakistan, but only to be
refueled before leaving the country with everyone still aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge could not bear the pressure of this case,'' Sharif's
wife told reporters a few hours after the sentencing. ``He could
not rule against the army.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there have been international concerns about whether the
trial would be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's criminal justice system has a reputation for shoddy
investigations, concocted evidence and outlandish perjury. Many a
trial, veteran observers say, often follows a formula where the
prosecution fabricates a phony case, the defense manufactures a
bogus rebuttal and then the judge decides in favor of the side
offering the bigger bribe.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers and participants, including Sharif and his
attorneys, said they thought the trial was conducted judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the judge cannot be questioned,'' said Malik,
the defense attorney. ``I congratulate the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's verdict there was little in the way of public
protest. The Pakistan Muslim League, Sharif's party, is badly
fractured, with some members wanting to cozy up to the army and
others wanting to ally themselves with long-time opponents. Kulsoom
Nawaz, a political neophyte, has been the most outspoken defender
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to the verdict, all of Sharif's property is to be
confiscated. Additionally, the judge added various fines. One is
for about $40,000 to be divided among the 198 people who were on
the hijacked plane, including Musharraf.

`ME, MYSELF I': OH, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE! (IF ONLY SHE'D REALIZE
IT) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which of us hasn't wondered in a moment of despondency whether
life might have turned out for the better had a former relationship
not been discarded? That big what-if drives ``Me Myself I,'' a
sugarcoated romantic comedy that is just clever enough to make you
wish it were three times as smart and only a third as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of this grown-up fairy tale, Pamela Drury
(Rachel Griffiths), is a lonely single woman approaching 40 who
gets a magical opportunity to sample the life she might have lived
had she married the man she retrospectively believes to have been
her Right. Except for one final plot twist, the movie is a
be-thankful-for-what-you've-got fable that aspires to be the single
person's answer to ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' Despite some witty
sequences, the slickly plotted fantasy has only a small fraction of
the conviction of Frank Capra's weeping-for-joy classic.
</P>
<P>
   The early scenes find Pamela, who writes peppy articles for
women's magazines, moping about her apartment, shuffling through
snapshots of old boyfriends and pining for romance. One afternoon,
while researching an article, she meets a promising new dreamboat,
Ben Monroe (Sandy Winton), a sensitive hunk whose blazing blue eyes
make Pamela's heart go pitter-patter.
</P>
<P>
   Too shy to call him up for a date, Pamela finds his address in
the telephone book and hand-delivers a letter containing some of
her articles to his house in the middle of a roaring thunderstorm.
It turns out that Ben is at home. And in a moment of excruciating
self-torture Pamela, soaked to the skin, huddles under a window
like a bachelorette Stella Dallas to observe him and his
picture-perfect wife and their two children gazing dreamily out at
the rain. Little wonder that when Pamela returns home, she
seriously contemplates dropping her hair dryer into the bubble bath
and electrocuting herself.
</P>
<P>
   But like a fairy godmother, a perfect clone of Pamela
materializes just in time to shepherd her into the life she might
have lived had she married Robert Dickson (David Roberts), the true
love she left 13 years earlier. The spirit or clone, or whatever it
is, then abruptly vanishes, abandoning Pamela to an existence she
believes to be a dream until she bangs her head against a wall and
discovers that it's terribly real.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife of Robert and the mother of three demanding children
_ henna-haired Stacey (Yael Stone), who is just entering puberty;
Douglas (Shaun Loseby), a feisty little skateboarder; and adorable
towheaded Rupert (Trent Sullivan), who still needs help going to
the bathroom _ Pamela copes absurdly well. (Rupert is the only one
in the family who senses a difference between the two Pamelas.)
Although she never liked children, Pamela swiftly adjusts to her
new life of dirty laundry and no spare time. As compensation she
has the good sex she aggressively rekindles in a relationship that
had gone romantically dry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pamela still turns out hack pieces for a magazine
called Now Woman, her writing career has not progressed as far as
it did when she was single. Pamela also runs into Ben, who is
leading a parallel, alternate life. This time he is single and very
available.
</P>
<P>
   The feature film debut of Pip Karmel, an Australian filmmaker,
``Me Myself I'' is a technically polished piece of work that
maintains a steady and comfortable balance between fantasy and
realism. And Griffiths, as in many of her other roles, conveys
fine, high-strung intelligence beneath a slightly chilly exterior.
Roberts and Winton bring just the right romantic ardor to their
roles. But for its comic warmth, ``Me Myself I'' isn't much more
than a Cosmo girl's daydream, one in which an appreciative
fail-safe Prince Charming is conveniently posted at every junction.

 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most religions, devotional images are not
inanimate objects; they are responsive presences with feelings and
personalities. They console, reprimand, give directions and, for
believers, carry an emotional charge mingling awe with affection.
</P>
<P>
   This dynamic is the subject of an exhibition titled ``Images in
Procession: Testimonies to Spanish Faith'' at the American Bible
Society in Manhattan. The works include Baroque sculptures,
19th-century paintings from New Mexico and documentary photographs
of religious pageants taken in the 1920s in Spain, where the public
ceremonial display of religious art has a long and fervid history.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the works on view are from the collection of the
Hispanic Society of America, one of the world's most comprehensive
repositories of Spanish and Latin American culture. They range from
a grief-drenched relief of the dead Christ surrounded by mourners,
carved by an unknown 16th-century Castillian sculptor, to a
sunshiney depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe done around 1835 by
a New Mexican painter called the Quill Pen Master.
</P>
<P>
   The least familiar entries are the 55 photographs taken by Ruth
Anderson (1893-1983). Anderson was born in Nebraska and studied at
the Clarence White School for Photography in New York. After
receiving her degree, she took a job as photographer _ and later as
curator of costume _ with the Hispanic Society and made several
documentary trips to Spain during the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that intrigued her, in part because they had
been little studied, were religious festivals and, specifically,
the elaborate street processions and performances involving
large-scale portable sculptures. Based on late medieval traditions,
they offered a vivid blend of Roman Catholic orthodoxy, civic pride
and edifying entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson kept a daily journal when she was in Spain, and
excerpts from it appear throughout the show, which has been
organized by Patrick Lenaghan and Ena Heller. Her words convey a
cool ethnologist's remove from what she was seeing, but also a
sense of engagement and wonder. These attitudes come through in her
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest are of Holy Week activities in northwest Spain. In
the provincial city of Zamora, Anderson photographed processions of
large floats, called pasos, bearing sculptural tableaus of scenes
from the Passion. Winding through the streets on Good Friday, they
were accompanied by penitents, members of local confraternities
dressed in face-concealing robes and high ked caps.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Villalcampo, she recorded a dramatization,
performed on an outdoor stage hung with quilts and blankets, of
Jesus' final days. Local citizens play all the parts. A few years
later, in the village of La Alberca on the Feast of the Assumption,
she saw another pageant, in which the devil made a literally
explosive entry, followed by the Archangel Michael, portrayed by a
young girl wearing a white gown and wings.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson often photographed processions from a high window or
rooftop. This distance can give a sense of choreographic symmetry,
as in her shot of a formation of white-clad penitents with the
trains of their robes spread out behind them as if they were
brides. In many cases, though, it makes specific activity hard to
read and gives little for the eye to fasten on.
</P>
<P>
   She was at her best when she moved in close. Her stage-side
shots of the Villalcampo Passion play feel as direct and unaffected
as the performance itself. Her pictures of costumed children _
miniature pentitents looking shyly into the camera _ are wonderful.
Here, one feels, she connected most comfortably with the intensely
emotional events that were her subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensity is all but impossible to distill in an
exhibition, and this one doesn't capture it. As Lenaghan relates in
his catalog, no Spanish processional figures of the kind seen in
Zamora are to be found in American collections; and the sound and
sights of the festivals themselves can only be experienced on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, nothing Anderson depicts is really foreign to
New York, where religiously based processions of all kinds are
still common. One on 14th Street honors the Virgin of Guadalupe.
Another in East Harlem observes the day of the Three Kings with
colorful sculptures and costumes. And far downtown near Wall
Street, hundreds of people wend their way with candles on the night
of Good Friday to the tiny Greek Orthodox church of St. Nicholas,
dwarfed by the towers of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other such events annually in the city; perhaps
information on them will be available at a free public symposium
that is to take place Friday at the American Bible Society. Titled
``Religious Rituals in Europe and the Americas,'' it will address
the same interaction of faith and festivity that Anderson did in
her pictures, and may well do so with her combination of
objectivity and tenderness.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices declined Thursday as some investors took
advantage of rebounding stocks to shift back out of the
fixed-income market.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond declined 3/32, to 106 19/32, while
its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
rose to 5.79 percent from 5.78 percent on Wednesday. The two-year
note, whose yield has plunged recently as investors positioned
themselves away from volatile stocks, fell 5/32, to 100 7/32. Its
yield rose to 6.38 percent from 6.30 percent, still giving the
highest return among various Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank, said in a speech to the New York State Banker's Association
that inflation was all but dormant in the face of strong economic
growth but that the very prosperity that growth generates could
expose the economy to real risks. Traders said his comments had
little effect ahead of a key employment report due Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfarm payroll data for March is expected to confirm that a
very tight labor market could reignite investor fears that the Fed
could become more aggressive still in raising short-term rates to
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting that the March
payrolls number grew by 376,000 and that the hourly earnings
increased by 0.3 percent. The tightness in the labor market is
likely to be underscored by a decline in the unemployment rate to 4
percent, from 4.1 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Rick MacDonald, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a
market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, thinks the
focus will be on wages and unemployment because the payroll number
will probably have two distortions for March: a lift from hiring
for government census workers and an extra week because of the leap
year. So the data for five weeks is condensed into a month normally
reporting four weeks.

`THE BLUE BEDSPREAD': FAMILY SECRETS OF A MOST TERRIBLE KIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With young writers like Arundhati Roy, Pankaj Mishra and Amit
Chaudhuri appearing on the scene in recent years, Indian fiction
seems assured of a bright present and a brilliant future. That
conviction gains force with ``The Blue Bedspread,'' a first novel
by Raj Kamal Jha, an editor at The Indian Express, India's largest
newspaper. Jha, who is in his mid-30s, has produced a spare,
mysterious and somber tale of erotic violence and illicit love that
stays in the mind long after the last page has been turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Bedspread'' begins on a sultry night in Calcutta,
which Jha describes in a way reminiscent of James Joyce's Dublin,
though Jha's Calcutta is viewed through a more lurid and sensualist
lens. It is a city that gives off a kind of luscious odor of decay;
it imparts the feeling of ``an ocean, wet and heavy'' whose every
sound and sight seems magnified. A man who does not give his name
(``It doesn't matter in this city of 12 million names'') receives a
call from the police telling him that his sister has died in
childbirth and that he must take care of her daughter for one
night, until she can be placed with the couple that will adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is the principal narrator of ``The Blue
Bedspread,'' brings the infant home and settles her to sleep. He
then spends the night writing out the stories that he feels she
needs to know if she is ever to understand exactly who she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall retell some stories,'' he tells her, ``the ones your
mother told me, even those that she told not in words, but in
gestures and glances. Like that of the black-and-yellow Boroline
Cream banners catching the wind on Durga Puja day; the dead pigeon,
its stain carried all across the city; the albino cockroach
hanging, upside down, from the bathroom drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Jha's tale takes form out of the jagged landscape of his
narrator's mind, each element of the larger story associated with a
different talisman, like the black and yellow advertising banner
for an antiseptic cream, Boroline, that he associates with an event
from his sister's terrible marriage. Slowly, the reader understands
the deeper purpose of this midnight chronicle. The man intends to
reveal the long-kept secrets of a Calcutta family that, with the
death of his sister, have become his exclusive possession.
</P>
<P>
   They are terrible, disquieting secrets. Jha's storyteller,
seated in his bare study, listening to a drip of water falling on
the red tiles of his bathroom, tells them as if he were pulling
open the heavy door of a crypt, allowing them to emerge _ one by
one, single file, shaking off the heavy dust of the past _ into the
light. As he does so, a picture of childhood affliction takes
shape. The boy stutters; he describes the way words ``grow and grow
until they fill up my lungs and refuse to come out''; he remembers
his sister beaten for an offense that he committed.
</P>
<P>
   At times, when the memories are too sharp, he imagines that he
is telling a story about somebody else, a boy who lies secretly on
the outside of a window and sees his mother beaten senseless by his
father. He tells of the same boy, now explicitly himself,
blackmailed by his father to force him to submit without
complaining to perverted desire. But the biggest secret has to do
with the blue bedspread on which his sister's baby is even now
sleeping in the other room. It is an object from his childhood full
of totemic power, the rectangular terrain on which he and the
baby's mother, seeking a place of safety and solace, played out a
``daily theater of pleasure and fear ... that carried us as if on a
wave from one night to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jha's narrator explicates both the pleasure and the fear, he
imposes no artificial order on his memory but replicates it in its
disjointed reality, allowing it to perform its own juxtaposition of
thoughts, objects, sounds and smells. The boy, at the moment of his
worst terror, hears ``the sound of cars splashing the water in the
potholes outside'' and the ``minibus conductors shout their
destinations: Dum Dum, Howrah, Entally, Roxy Cinema.'' His
nocturnal storyteller notices the imprint of sweat that a woman's
elbow makes when she leans on a glass counter. He sees that two
dead cockroaches are trapped in the frame that holds his mother's
picture. He remembers the way his sister's tears fell onto her
mother-in-law's silk sari, and then disappeared as she ironed it.
</P>
<P>
   He captures in a few images his sister's horrible realization
that she hates her husband, and those images open into a terse
premonition of imprisonment: ``She watched his bare haunches, his
arms, his broad shoulders, the rise and fall of his chest. She kept
staring at the fan, trying to count the blades on her first night,
the beginning of a lifetime in a two-room flat where the sky
squeezes itself into narrow lanes to keep the buildings from
touching each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Jha's world is a cruel one in which all normal yearnings for
happiness are thwarted by poverty, or the dead hand of custom, or
the untrustworthiness of others. But what is really a dismal horror
story is told with a kind of Shubertian loveliness that transforms
it into an elegant, melancholy meditation on love and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Jha exhibits a remarkable honesty as a writer, and he is in
impressive command of a technique that creates a powerful
psychological realism out of a near phantasmagoric collage. His
final paragraphs manage artfully to recapitulate almost all of what
has preceded them, and to suggest the elements of a moral
redemption at the same time. In short, ``The Blue Bedspread'' is a
brilliant beginning for a writer whose voice already shows a
maturity well beyond his years.

PAYING COURT TO A WRY MASTER OF THE FRENCH BAROQUE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a Baroque beyond Bach? Yes, though you may be hard put
to find it this year, with performers and record companies tripping
over one another to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the
master's death.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are outcroppings of Vivaldi here, Handel there. Now
comes the turn of the fascinating figure Jean-Philippe Rameau
(1683-1764), the French composer and theorist who died 14 years
after Bach. (What wonders of Rameau revival might thus await
listeners in 2014, given what has emerged over the last two
decades?)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bach, Handel and Vivaldi, however much they may have
benefited from the modern early-music movement, Rameau was one of
the composers who needed it, or something like it, to make his way.
His music, unsurpassed in elegance and wit, can survive perhaps
anything but the ponderous weight to which it was long subjected.
When, that is, it was noticed at all.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Rameau will be represented modestly on Saturday
evening with one of his ``Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts'' in a
program by the Four Nations Ensemble and Music From China,
``Entertainment for Kings,'' at the 92nd Street Y. Then, on
Tuesday, he takes center stage with a new production of his opera
``Platee,'' directed by Mark Morris and presented by the New York
City Opera at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Performances of Rameau remain rare, and most listeners today
still know Rameau best through recordings. So the classical music
critics of The New York Times are listing their own favorite
recordings in hopes of encouraging listeners to wade farther into
this fascinating repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Be assured, however, that you will probably not go far wrong
exploring even beyond those choices, for most of the performers
involved with Rameau these days are committed, knowledgeable and
highly musical specialists.

<P>
   Jean-Philippe Rameau was 50 before he wrote his first opera, but
``Hippolyte et Aricie'' was, in 1733, a natural progression from
the remarkable harpsichord pieces of the 1720s and a natural
prelude to the ``Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts,'' which arrived
eight years later. Rameau's harpsichord music bristles with
provocative movement and illustrative titles. Here, the hen is
elevated to high art (``La Poule''); New World savages dance
violently (``Les Sauvages''); birds sing (``Le Rappel des
Oiseaux'').
</P>
<P>
   Rameau the man could be imperious and forbidding. (His final act
of music criticism was to cite a priest for singing off key at his
deathbed.) But this is music intended for theatrical display, even
when no theater is in sight. Its forwardness establishes the
fundamental equipoise of the French Baroque: Rameau, brilliant and
imposing; Couperin, wistful, private, tender, heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners interested in completeness may still be able to find
Trevor Pinnock's old CRD recordings in specialty shops. Novices
might prefer to dabble in a variety of performances, and there are
several places in which their fingers might profitably be dipped.
The shallowest waters are the first book of ``Pieces de Clavecin''
from 1706. The second book of ``Pieces de Clavecin'' in 1724 and
the ``Nouvelles Suites de Pieces de Clavecin'' four years later
represent a composer of solo music at his most inventive.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts,'' written during a
five-year interlude in Rameau's opera career, expand into chamber
music, with a flute and two strings as foils to the harpsichord.
Rameau claimed that with an emendation here and there, these five
three- and four-movement ``concerts'' could be reduced for keyboard
alone, but their value is as ensemble music.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Haas plays the first two books on Calliope. The first
has all the energy and bright self-advertisement of a composer in
his early 20s. The disc also includes the 1724 Suites in E and D.
Although Pinnock's playing had a joy and precision that made his
offerings near irresistible, Haas is very good indeed.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts,'' try the quartet of
Gustav Leonhardt, Frans Bruggen and Sigiswald and Wieland Kuijken.
Rameau's sense of high drama and high spirits survive in this
subtler and more involved format, and the playing of these four has
a style and dignity appropriate to an 18th-century home
entertainment of great originality.

</P>
<P>
   The conductor William Christie, the director of the estimable
ensemble Les Arts Florissants, has won deserved praise for his
historically informed and scrupulously rendered performances of
Baroque operas and choral works, especially Rameau's. Still, I seem
to be among the minority who find his work, however impressive,
self-consciously authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   Other fine conductors have performed Rameau with, to my mind,
more spontaneity and grace: Sir John Eliot Gardiner, for one. In
1982 at the Festival of Aix-en-Provence in France, this superb
English conductor presented what was apparently the first complete
performance of ``Les Boreades,'' a tragedie lyrique. Sir John
worked from an edition he had prepared. His beguiling recording
with the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists was
released in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rameau wrote his last opera, ``Les Boreades,'' incredibly, at
81. Rehearsals for the work's premiere at the Paris Opera had begun
when Rameau died; the production was inexplicably canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Far from approaching this work with the trepidation of old age,
Rameau seems to have felt that he could finally write an opera the
way he wanted to, not as the current style dictated. The
semi-mythological story concerns Queen Alphisa of ancient Bactria,
who is permitted to marry only a descendant of Boreas the terrible
god of the north wind, but who, alas, loves a mortal. Though the
plot is explained in detail in the program book, no libretto is
provided (evidently because of legal hassles over rights). In
truth, closely following Rameau's librettos is not exactly crucial
to appreciating his operas, for the composer, famously tolerant of
weak texts, was never a skilled dramatist like his exacting
predecessor Lully.
</P>
<P>
   But the score is wondrous, a mosaic of infectious dances,
glorious arias, ebullient choruses, elegant recitative and vivid
pictorial music that evokes nature, thunder and icy winds. More
effectively than in his other operas, Rameau weaves these separate
pieces into a continuous musical and dramatic structure. Indeed,
the overture, with its hunting music, segues directly into the
opening aria, an innovation that Gluck mirrored 10 years later in
``Iphigenie en Aulide.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: the recording is technically unavailable in the
United States. But Tower Records carries it as a special import.
Gardiner's lithe, humane and vibrant performance is worth searching
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try also two recent recordings of the great motets. Many critics
consider these sacred works lesser Rameau. Either of the recordings
_ one by the excellent conductor Philippe Herreweghe with La
Chapelle Royale, the other by Herve Niquet and Le Concert Spirituel
_ should convince you otherwise. Whereas so many settings of these
Latin texts are thick with contrapuntal writing and expressively
severe, Rameau's have a refreshing lucidity and lightness, the
essence of French refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas McGegan's recording of suites from ``Dardanus'' and the
astonishing comic opera-ballet ``Platee'' with the Philharmonia
Baroque Orchestra is also wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to give credit where credit is due, Christie's account
of the seminal opera ``Castor et Pollux'' is inarguably fine.

<P>
   Because dance was such an essential component of French Baroque
opera, Rameau's stage works yield colorful, rhythmically vital
orchestral suites. It would be an overstatement to say that these
suites offer distillations of the dramas from which they are drawn.
But they tell us a great deal about the fertility of Rameau's
imagination. Faced with standard dance movements that more
typically interrupt the drama than further it, Rameau composed
music of great variety and energy.
</P>
<P>
   There is always, of course, the nagging feeling that one ought
to be listening to the complete opera, that the suite is like a
digest version of a great book. But Nicholas McGegan and
Philharmonia Baroque, a period-instrument group based in San
Francisco, make a superb case for the practice on a disc of suites
from ``Platee'' and ``Dardanus.'' The orchestra's string and wind
textures have an appealing bite as well as complete transparency.
And the playing over all has a kind of electricity that suggests
the drama of the works from which the dances are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Two discs by the Capella Savaria accomplish much the same
effect, in performances of a very different kind. In suites from
``La Naissance d'Osiris'' and ``Les Boreades'' in Volume 1, and
``Anacreon'' and ``Daphnis et Egle'' in Volume 2, this Hungarian
period-instrument group produces a rounded timbre, closer to that
of modern instruments. In addition, the group's director, Mary
Terey-Smith, also favors relaxed tempos, but this preference exacts
no cost in vibrancy or _ in movements like the Contredanse en
Rondeau from the ``Boreades'' Suite _ sheer rambunctiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to opera fairly late in life, Rameau tried his
hand at dramatic writing in a series of magnificent cantatas,
mostly on mythological or allegorical subjects, and mostly
ruminations on the tribulations of love. They are refreshing works.
``Orphee,'' for instance, zooms in on the moment when Orpheus lost
Eurydice by looking back at her as they departed Hades, and Rameau
dispenses with the happy ending found in the Monteverdi opera;
instead, lovers are advised to master their impetuous desires. In
another, ``Les Amants Trahis,'' a dialogue between a naive lover
and a cynic, the cynic prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of these works survive, and the New Chamber Opera
Ensemble, directed by Gary Cooper, has recorded them all, along
with the extant variants. The vocal soloists _ Rachel Elliott,
soprano; James Gilchrist, tenor; Roderick Williams, baritone; and
Thomas Guthrie, bass _ bring attractive timbres, stylish
ornamentation and a necessary depth of feeling to the music, and
one could not want livelier or more beautiful playing from the
instrumental ensemble.

<P>
   Rameau lets us hear Voltaire's smile. His music is often
touchingly expressive, often magical, often joyous, and it
perfectly suits the graceful characters _ too vulnerable to be
quite heroic _ who dance through so many lyric tragedies,
opera-ballets and other classical and exotic entertainments. But
his contemplation of human and musical follies is also, much of the
time, amused. He was in full middle age before he scored his first
big success. He observed his characters' bold declarations and love
affairs, and their constant dancing, with wry wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no recording captures all the qualities of Rameau's gaze
_ the merriment and the fondness, the regret and the elation _
better than Frans Bruggen's of suites from ``Acante et Cephise''
and ``Les Fetes d'Hebe.'' The playing of the Orchestra of the 18th
Century is full of athletic energy and color, and the musicians
bring out the music's huge range of character in the way they toss
off its often irregular or oddly emphasized gestures.
</P>
<P>
   One understands why the Rameau revival had to await the
re-emergence of period-style instruments, with their particular
timbres and ways of speaking. ``Acante'' includes some spectacular
fireworks music in its overture, and is even more than usually full
of choice instrumental combinations and bizarre, vivid strokes. But
charm, delight and fun abound in both suites in these superb and
graphic performances.
</P>
<P>
   Also outstanding _ if not quite matching the delicacy and
earthiness Bruggen finds in such music, often simultaneously _ is
another collection of overtures and dances from two stage works,
this time ``Nais'' and ``Le Temple de la Gloire,'' with Nicholas
McGegan conducting the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. The two
overtures, with trumpets and drums, are sheer excitement: that to
``Nais'' has thrilling syncopations, and ``Le Temple de la Gloire''
opens by piling magnificence on magnificence as trumpets cap horns
and are themselves capped by piccolos, all trilling away.
Brilliance appears, too, in some of the dances, which are again
picturequely scored and picturesquely played.
</P>
<P>
   But wonderful though suites are, one needs to hear at least some
of the stage works in full. Both recent recordings of the earliest,
``Hippolyte et Aricie,'' have their points, including the singing
of Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Phaedra with Les Arts Florissants and
William Christie, and that of Jean-Paul Fouchecourt as Hippolytus
with Les Musiciens du Louvre and Marc Minkowski. You could settle
happily for the Arts Florissants version and hear Fouchecourt's
lively, unusual and stylish high tenor instead in the one-act
``Pigmalion,'' with fit support from Herve Niquet and Le Concert
Spirituel.
</P>
<P>
   Before either ``Hippolyte,'' though, take ``Castor et Pollux''
as also recorded by Christie and his Arts Florissants. ``Castor''
is the stronger piece, as was recognized while Rameau was alive,
and this recording conveys all its sadness and its gaiety, which
are so often mixed in pearly emotional shades. The highlights disc,
including powerful choruses, brilliant dances and one of the most
gorgeous arias in the history of music (``Tristes apprets''), is
the great Rameau bargain.

the 18th Century, on Philips. Happily, good recordings of these
suites and many others abound.

Tower Records, as with ``Platee.'' A rudimentary sense of the
spectacular range of styles in the various stage works can be
gleaned in another Tower import, a lively compilation of 17
overtures, with Christophe Rousset leading the period band Les
Talens Lyriques. The rustic mingles freely with the grand, the
sprightly with the stately in the music, and the performers'
affection is by no means limited to the group's delightful
namesake, ``Les Fetes d'Hebe, ou Les Talens Lyriques.''
</P>
<P>
   My first actual sighting of a Rameau opera came in 1983, with
``Hippolyte et Aricie'' at the Festival of Aix-en-Provence in
France. At a time when early-music attractions often still relied
on big-name mainstream performers to draw crowds, the production
placed Jessye Norman, as Phaedra, awkwardly in the middle of a
cohesive period-style troupe, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a joy to return to that opera and find a singer at least
as expressive and infinitely more congenial to her surroundings,
the superb Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, in the role in a typically fine
recording from William Christie and Les Arts Florissants. Hunt
Lieberson is also to be heard next week in the New York City Opera
production of ``Platee.''
</P>
<P>
   The available recording of that work, despite a superior vocal
ensemble, including Gilles Ragon, Guy de Mey, Guillemette Laurens
and Veronique Gens, boasts no such single asset. Still, it is in
excellent hands, with Marc Minkowski, who has plied this repertory
almost as assiduously as Christie, leading Les Musiciens du Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   As large as the operas of Rameau's last three decades loom, the
earlier harpsichord suites are by no means negigible. In fact, they
are sheer delights in their lively depictions of nature and the
supernatural, their kaleidoscopic colors and their quirky humor. As
remarkable as it is to analyze and appreciate Rameau's various
musical gifts _ for melody, harmony, rhythm, sonority _ they are
hard to isolate in the listening, so compelling and unified is the
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case, at least, in Christie's splendid compilation
of the four suites of 1724 and 1728. If Christie occasionally errs
toward stiffness, his upright manner seems on the whole only to
reinforce the archness of Rameau's humor.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Baumont, on Adda, is a bit freer in approach, and his
recordings provide an alternative hardly less fine. Or try him
instead in Rameau's harpsichord arrangement of his exotic
opera-ballet ``Les Indes Galantes.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is yet another way into those operas. And into them you
will surely want to plunge if you spend any time at all with this
composer.

IF YOU ELECT TO WATCH, PBS'S `AMERICAN PRESIDENT' IS A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: A-  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has tried to memorize the presidents of the United
States in chronological order will be frustrated by PBS's ``The
American President.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-hour documentary series, running two hours each night
from Sunday through Thursday, takes a thematic approach in its
profiles of our 41 chief executives, not a linear one. But, while
obviously contrived to force four men (five, in one case) neatly
into each theme, it's a mostly pleasant departure from the
numerical, ``name-the-16th-president'' style we may remember from
grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Sunday's first installment passes up George
Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in favor
of John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin D. Roosevelt and
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely foursome, it would seem, unless one considers the
title of Episode 1: ``Family Ties.'' All were members of political
clans, which more or less considered the presidency a natural
component of the family business. Presidential scholar Richard
Neustadt, the only talking-head expert who appears in the series,
even suggests that FDR, who was a cousin of Theodore Roosevelt and
who married Teddy's favorite niece, Eleanor (his own fifth cousin),
``saw the presidency as almost family property and thought of the
country as his patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Neustadt doesn't view this as necessarily bad. Even in a
democracy, he says, power often resides in families that pass the
baton from one generation to the next. The beauty of democracy is
that voters eventually tire of such autocratic succession and do
something about it, or fate steps in and takes care of things. Two
of the four presidents in ``Family Ties,'' Roosevelt and Kennedy,
died in office, leaving power in the hands of men who weren't quite
expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Nine such individuals have risen to the presidency accidentally,
but ``Happenstance,'' the second episode airing Sunday night,
focuses only on five: John Tyler (who succeeded William Henry
Harrison), Millard Fillmore (Zachary Taylor), Andrew Johnson
(Abraham Lincoln), Chester Arthur (James Garfield) and Harry Truman
(FDR). The other accidental presidents are themed thusly: Lyndon
Johnson in ``The Professional Politician,'' airing Mon-
</P>
<P>
   day; Calvin Coolidge in ``The American Way'' Tuesday; Gerald
Ford in ``Compromise Choices'' Wednesday, and Theodore Roosevelt in
``Expanding Power'' Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This arbitrary, though not unthoughtful, construction allows
armchair historians to quibble all the way to next Election Day.
Why aren't Andrew Jackson, Taylor and Theodore Roosevelt included
in ``The Heroic Posture'' with other military men? (Well, for one
thing, only 12 presidents have had no military experience, so it
also overlooks James Monroe, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield,
Kennedy, George Bush and several others who served with
distinction.) Or how can Bush be part of ``The World Stage'' _ a
grouping of presidents known for their accomplishments in foreign
policy _ and Richard Nixon not be? (Because Nixon happens to be a
good fit in ``Expanding Power,'' a look at four presidents who did
just that.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the placement doesn't much matter. ``The American
President'' is a precious, well-written resource from the
father-and-sons team of Philip Kunhardt Jr., Philip Kunhardt III
and Peter Kunhardt, all veteran writer/
</P>
<P>
   producers of historical books and TV documentaries. (A companion
volume by the Kunhardts, published by Riverhead Books, is available
</P>
<P>
   &UR; xr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   for $50.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The American President'' may periodically confuse the
chronologically minded as it leaps about from pillar to Polk. But
whether one is seeking great trivia _ Zachary Taylor was Jefferson
Davis' father-in-law _ or great quotes _ James Madison said: ``The
great truth is that governments do better without kings'' _ or
great insight _ Neustadt on apolitical presidents: ``The American
public from time to time wishes to see the trustee who looks
neither right nor left but only up to the heavens and down to the
work before him, a man of independence; it is not, however, a good
formula for doing what presidents have to do'' _ ``The American
President'' does what good TV always does. While informing and even
entertaining viewers, it challenges them to look at things in a
different way, to think, to question, to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   If only we could all be so engaged before electing the next
president ...
</P>
<P>
   The American President. Ten-hour documentary series on the 41
presidents of the United States, narrated by Hugh Sidey. Sunday
through Thursday on PBS. Parental guideline rating: TV-G.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes,
Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R,
101 minutes; winner of best foreign-language film Oscar). A whole
new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical
exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly
sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt.
Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this
film weaves its own soap opera around ``A Streetcar Named Desire''
and tells of splendidly resilient women; Almodovar has aptly
described his material as ``screwball drama.'' Rich and
entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and
impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible San
Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named
Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey (winner of best-actor
Oscar), Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch.
Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes;
winner of best picture, director, cinematography and
original-screenplay Oscars). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays a
buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BEAU TRAVAIL,' starring Denis Lavant and Gregoire Colin.
Directed by Claire Denis (not rated, 90 minutes). A loose
adaptation of ``Billy Budd,'' moved to the present and set in the
East African enclave of Djibouti, Denis' finest film to date
observes the day-to-day rituals of a troop of French Legionnaires
training in a harshly beautiful wasteland. The visually
spellbinding movie depicts their rigorous drills and rituals as
ecstatic rites of purification and the embodiment of an
impenetrable masculine mystique. In this version of the allegory,
the Claggart figure, Sergeant Galoup (Lavant), is a disillusioned
officer, and his prey (Colin) a soldier whose humanity offends the
sergeant. Not to be missed (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank (winner of best-actress
Oscar) and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114
minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and
resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena
Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man.
Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on
screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy.
The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with
the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's
best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize
Theron, Delroy Lindo and Michael Caine (winner of best supporting
actor Oscar). Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with an
Oscar-winning Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned
into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing
out into the world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent
brought up in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine), who
performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young
couple (Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker.
Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative
drive of a 1940s ``David Copperfield'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE COLOR OF PARADISE,' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein
Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful
Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for
his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such
conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the
boy has been attending won't keep him on, the father takes his son
first to the family's woodland homestead, then leaves him in the
care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic
sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of
birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ERIN BROCKOVICH,' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising,
effective beginning in which Roberts proves what a fine actress she
can be and Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of the
most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ``Erin
Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice
Hollywood melodrama.It is a smooth secondhand amalgam of ``Norma
Rae'' and ``Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ``The Rainmaker'' and
``A Civil Action.'' Roberts, playing a working-class single mother
who spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate
negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting
for about 40 minutes, Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a
movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to
bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It's as if she had a
clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right to be
attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen that
Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could
have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,' starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Jarmusch
does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for
the western in ``Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of
cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative,
bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which
may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost
Dog'' is worth seeing for Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a
modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's
offbeat sense of cinematic style and for hip-hop artist the RZA's
brilliant musical effects (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH FIDELITY,' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION TO MARS,' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins.
Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual
design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look
so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the
movie is undermined by De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe.
All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment
for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity
on Mars. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful
patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as
sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in
zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30
seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE NINTH GATE,' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella.
Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an
interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its
tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Langella is Boris
Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired
antiquities who hires Dean Corso (Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer,
to locate a volume called ``The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan get
Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book?
Polanski is out to cross ``Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof
``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary
as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and
not nearly as funny (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE LESS,' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by
Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (Scott). nn

`THE ROAD TO EL DORADO,' with the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Rosie Perez. Directed by Eric ``Bibo'' Bergeron and Don
Paul (PG, 89 minutes). This animated buddy movie aspires to the
airiness of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby ``road'' romp but it's
hopelessly bland even by those timid 1940s standards. Kline and
Branagh provide the nearly interchangeable voices of two perky con
men who foil Hernando Cortes' 1519 invasion of the mythical El
Dorado. Though scenic and fast-paced, the main characters have no
life, and the movie plays history false. Elton John and Tim Rice
provided six clunky songs (Holden). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `WAKING THE DEAD,' starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly.
Directed by Keith Gordon (R, 106 minutes). Gordon's earnest screen
adaptation of Scott Spencer's popular novel about a love that
transcends death aspires to be a kind of intellectualized ``Love
Story,'' set in the 1970s counterculture. But the blend of history
and heartbreak doesn't quite jell. Crudup, as a rising Chicago
politician, and Connelly, as his radical activist girlfriend who
dies in a car bombing, have good chemistry. But the movie is so
busy jumping back and forth between the past and present that it is
continually stumbling over itself and breaking its own spell
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `WINTER SLEEPERS,' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem,
Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated,
124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a
steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled
destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing
village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ``Run Lola
Run'' put Tykwer on the short list of major international
filmmakers, ``Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise
afflicting the generation in its late 20s and 30s. But like ``Run
Lola Run,'' this movie is also about how human destiny has
everything to do with split-second timing (Holden). &QL;

THE BEST PICK FOR BEATING TIGER WOODS IS HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE MEADOWS   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To say Tiger Woods has a great chance of winning this year's
Masters golf tournament at Augusta National is sort of like saying
the Los Angeles Lakers have a great chance of winning the NBA
championship this season.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that in men's professional golf today, there
are two kinds of stories: Tiger Woods and whoever happens to beat
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Will somebody knock off Woods this week at Augusta and, for at
least a brief moment, become that other story?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem likely, although in golf, unlike most sports,
with so many quality players in the field, anyone can find the
magic and beat Woods, especially if Woods helps a little and beats
himself, something he has done at times.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger has won 18 PGA tournaments since turning pro in late 1996,
including the 1997 Masters. By comparison, 45-year-old Greg Norman
has also won 18 times and has never won a Masters, even though he
has come agonizingly close recently with a third-place finish last
year and in 1995, and second place in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember when one player has commanded as much
attention, even if you go back to the glory days of Jack Nicklaus,
Tom Watson or Arnold Palmer. It's tough to recall a player being
such an overwhelming favorite in a field full of such talented
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that like so many other events, as far as
the 24-year-old Woods is concerned, this year's Masters is probably
his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he is ready to play and firing on all cylinders and you
get him on the type of golf course that suits him, he is very, very
difficult to beat,'' said Nick Price this week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Augusta is his type of course _ even though it has been
tweaked to make it ``Tiger proof'' _ is not a question. His
18-under-par winning score of 270 in 1997 beat Tom Kite by 12
shots.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lowest 72-hole score since Augusta opened in 1934 and
the largest margin of victory in a major championship since young
Tom Morris won the British Open by 13 shots ... in 1870!
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won three times already in 2000 _ the Mercedes
Championship, the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and most recently, the
Bay Hill Invitational March 19 in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thing _ well, at least frightening to other
players _ is Woods seems to be getting better. His short game and
putting has improved, he's matured as a person and a golfer, using
better judgment on shots and not relying strictly on his length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been targeting my game ... it's been getting better week
by week,'' he said Monday at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   As far as course changes _ more rough, narrower fairways and
more pitch to several greens _ Woods only smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to play a little differently,'' he said this week.
``It's such a great course ... I don't see the need for these
little changes every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the people at Augusta do. They don't want this kid carving
18 shots off par again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he won't. But chances are he'll play well enough to
win, and if he's close on Sunday ... well we've all seen what
happens when he senses the kill. Just ask young Matt Gogel about
Pebble Beach this past February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very new ... the complete dominance by one
player,'' said Scotsman Colin Montgomerie. ``Tiger seems to have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes one green jacket, but he wants more. At least six,
which is what the legendary Jack Nicklaus owns. Nicklaus, in fact,
has 18 victories in major tournaments, which is perhaps Tiger's
most coveted goal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be challengers in this first major of the
new millennium. I like Jim Furyk _ he's a grinder and somebody who
can perhaps hang with Woods at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the usual suspects like Phil Mickelson,
chasing his first major, David Duval, Davis Love III, Tom Lehman
and Ernie Els, among others. Who knows who else might emerge from
the pack to make things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless, who doesn't think Woods will be in the hunt on
the back nine Sunday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   I think he'll win because majors are what golf is all about for
Tiger Woods. God knows it's not the money, given his incredible
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope it's close and dramatic _ no 12-shot victories _ and
perhaps even comes down to the final few holes.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, wagering against Tiger Woods may be a sucker bet.

   `Three Kings' In Hindsight
</P>
<P>
   As filmmakers' commentaries proliferate on DVD, so do
perspectives on how movies are made. In two separate commentaries
for ``Three Kings,'' to be released on disc and videocassette by
Warner on Tuesday, the director, David Russell, and two of its
producers, Charles Roven and Edward McDonnell, talk all movie long
about a film that succeeded in the end but had particular troubles,
from the time it was shot in the deserts of Mexico and Arizona to
its release in theaters last October.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the American-led offensive against Iraq has just
ended, and four American soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Ice Cube and Spike Jonze) plan to abscond with $23 million worth of
gold bullion plundered from Kuwait by the Iraqis and hidden in the
desert. Instead, against their mercenary instincts, they become
personally involved with Iraqis resisting President Saddam Hussein
and help them escape into Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As with most disc commentaries, the fun is in the details.
Makeup people needed two hours a day to cover Wahlberg's body
tattoos, but there was no way Warner would allow the film to be
made without his taking his shirt off. Clooney's problem was time.
On loan from the television series ``E.R.,'' he could give the
production only three days a week during the 78 days it took to
make the film.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily a television actor, he had to concentrate on looking
at people when speaking to them, a departure from talking on the
run in an emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the White House, which, Russell says, has
second-rate movie-watching facilities. After the film was screened
for President Clinton, the director adds, he and Clinton talked
about the issues involved until the wee hours. The presidential
entourage wasn't sure whether to laugh or cringe at the treatment
of the enemy by excited American soldiers who dash about with no
clear idea of what they're supposed to do with terrified Iraqis who
are suddenly surrendering by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   From there the commentaries get down to larger questions about
the nature and purpose of the film. Originally it was intended as a
straight action film, then as a kind of ``Treasure of the Sierra
Madre'' about tensions among four characters seeking antiquities in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the more politically motivated Russell took aim at the
cultural stew that spilled American consumer goods all over the
desert while everybody tried to determine the point of the war. To
him the point of the movie was a failure by the United States to
support large segments of the Iraqi population who thought the
American military operation was intended to free them from Hussein.
The producers, on the other hand, echo the U.S. position: the
object was to liberate Kuwait and avoid further complications in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, their movie was different, which cost it somewhat
at the box office. The producers talk about the challenge of
marketing a film with action for young male audiences, attractive
men for young female audiences, narrative substance for older men,
heart for older women and a little comedy for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this to be a genre-busting movie,'' Roven says.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   The Insider
</P>
<P>
   With knowledge that cigarette company executives lied about the
effect of nicotine in their product, the chemist Jeffrey Wigand
(Russell Crowe) cautiously gives the story to Lowell Bergman (Al
Pacino), a producer of the CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' who in turn
interests the newsman Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). In the
trouble ahead, however, Wigand finds his confidentiality
compromised, his wife walks out and just when the ``60 Minutes''
report is to be shown, CBS gets cold feet. Pacino's scenery-chewing
can be distracting, but Michael Mann directs his film, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, with ``a pulse-quickening panache that
heightens the tensions within its story.''
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 157 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbleweeds
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing another abusive relationship, the lusty Mary Jo Walker
(Janet McTeer) packs up her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Kimberly J.
Brown), and drives off toward no place in particular. Attracting
men is what Mary Jo does best, and mother and daughter set up
housekeeping with Jack (Gavin O'Connor), a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet, long-suffering child strongly attached to her mother,
Ava blossoms in new surroundings. Jack doesn't work out, of course,
but McTeer melts into the role so deeply that ``what is on the
screen is not a performance at all but a kind of spontaneous
alchemy'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 104 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13. Release date: April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Three To Tango
</P>
<P>
   Needing a ``safe'' male to watch his girlfriend, Amy (Neve
Campbell), when he's not around, a crass developer named Charles
(Dylan McDermott) enlists Oscar (Matthew Perry), an architect who
the developer assumes is gay. Competing to design a $90 million
project controlled by Charles, Oscar goes along, but being avowedly
heterosexual he naturally has a hard time controlling his impulses
toward Amy.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up a self-conscious and uncomfortable time with
homosexuality in an allegedly liberated comedy with ``some nasty
undercurrents that lend it a slightly sour taste'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Warner. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 98 minutes. Closed
captioned. Release date: April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Happy, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A couple of crooks (Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn) duck the law
in small-town Texas by posing as a gay couple who produce
children's beauty pageants. In the town of Happy, they are hailed
as miracle workers who can pump a little life into the Little
Squeezed Pageant. With no alternative, the pair struggles to oblige
in a nonsensical comedy that ``is giddy and cuddlesome with a
gosh-oh-gee enthusiasm that is at first engaging, but quickly
becomes a sign of a desperation to be liked'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 96 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13. Release date: April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   JEAN COCTEAU'S ORPHIC CYCLE. Three films by the novelist, poet,
painter, playwright, screenwriter, director and much else include
his first film, ``The Blood of a Poet'' (1930, 55 minutes), a
highly personalized expression (with Cocteau as commentator) of
fears and obsessions about life and death; ``Orpheus'' (1950, 86
minutes), part Greek myth and part Cocteau's personal experience,
starring Jean Marais as a poet whiling away his talent until he
meets Princess Death; and ``The Testament of Orpheus'' (1960, 79
minutes), with a cast including Picasso and Yul Brynner, about a
poet who travels a mysterious wasteland on his way to death and
resurrection. Home Vision. VHS, $29.95 each; DVD, a three-disc box
set from the Criterion Collection, $79.95. French with English
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   CABARET BALKAN. The leering master of ceremonies in a Belgrade
nightclub before the NATO bombing last year introduces a series of
not-so-nice vignettes aimed at venting a few hatreds and
frustrations. Illustrating what might be called a Pandora's box
theory of social order, Goran Paskaljevic's garishly
expressionistic portrait of life, from murder in the shower to a
mob stoning of a man trying to escape over a fence, lets everybody
lash out. 1999. Paramount. 102 minutes. R. Release date: April 11.
</P>
<P>
   P.T. BARNUM. In an A&AMP;E production, Beau Bridges and his son
Jordan star as the circus impresario and showman who once allowed
that ``without printer's ink, I should be no bigger than Tom
Thumb.'' 1999. Artisan. $19.98. 138 minutes. Closed captioned.

   (UNDATED) _ Sometimes investors seem even more fickle in their
fashions than teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Microsoft verdict this week, the dot.coms and
other high-technology shares had been falling in price, in the
U.S., U.K. and around the globe. Their extraordinary gains last
winter have been going into reverse for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   So, if there was a bubble in these shares, it has certainly
burst. But the harder question to answer is what real effects this
might have on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Is the New Economy past its sell-by date already, dealt a fatal
blow by the verdict of the U.S. courts on its leading company?
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the charges Microsoft would level against the
U.S. government. But it is wrong. The U.S. Justice Department is
giving the New Economy a new lease of life.
</P>
<P>
   An important reason for the vigor of the American economy in the
past century has been its tough anti-monopoly policies. Tackling
Microsoft's monopoly will stimulate more innovation, more choice
and even lower prices in the high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about last year's stock market boom was that it
channelled vast amounts of cheap finance to start-up companies. It
made possible a surge of investment in new infrastructure and
markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear parallel with the railway mania of the mid-19th
century, when investors funded thousands of miles of track that
remain to this day the core of the rail network.
</P>
<P>
   It may become a bit harder now for new companies to raise
finance, if share prices continue to languish and the enthusiasm
for untried businesses dims. Yet investors will continue to look
for high-tech opportunities because that is where the prospects for
future economic growth will lie.
</P>
<P>
   They will become a lot more discriminating about where they put
their money. It will no longer be enough to add a dot.com to the
name of the business to rake in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, drastic falls in share prices could trigger a
slowdown in the economy's growth rate. However, as the Bank of
England and its U.S. counterpart, the Federal Reserve, have been
trying to engineer slower growth, that might be no bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   And looking further into the future, there is no doubt that new
technologies have set in motion a transformation of the economy and
society that has barely begun to take shape _ just as the first
rail companies in the 1840s signalled the beginning of urbanization
and mass production.
</P>
<P>
   The dot.com share bubble has been the first hint of an economic
revolution, not its last hurrah. &QL;

   CUBAN-BOY (Washington) _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has not seen
his son Elian since the boy and his mother left Cuba on a rickety
raft for a new life in America, set foot on American soil here
Thursday and told a crowd of reporters and television cameras that,
``I hope I will soon be able to embrace my son.'' Justice
Department officials said they would move quickly to transfer
custody of the boy to his father. Senior administration officials
made it clear they believed that the arrival of Gonzalez from Cuba

   ISRAEL-RIGHTS (Jerusalem) _ Over the years, Israel has earned a

organizations by invoking national security to explain practices
that were considered exclusionary, discriminatory and coercive
toward Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. But since the right-wing
government was replaced last summer by a broad coalition including
several leftists and human rights advocates, key policy changes

   BBO-POORER-TEAMS (Kansas City, Mo.) _ For baseball fans, hope is
supposed to spring eternal at this time each year. The breeze
blowing through the empty stadium is almost expected to whisper the
universal mantra of fans everywhere: Maybe this year will be the
year. But here in Kansas City, as in Pittsburgh, Montreal,
Minneapolis and many smaller cities with major league teams, that
perennial optimism has withered over the last decade in the face of
a growing gap between rich and poor franchises. There is a growing
consensus among owners, fans and experts on the game that the
disparity between high-revenue teams and those in small markets
threatens the sport's future popularity. Last year, the eight teams
that made it to the playoffs were all among the top ten payrolls in
the game. Some owners are asking how baseball can sustain the
interest of fans and attract new devotees if only a handful of
lucrative teams have a realistic chance of making the playoffs each
year. By James C. McKinley Jr.

   NEW YORK _ As ever, there was some hoopla on Wall Street
Wednesday as two new companies came to the New York Stock Exchange
offering shares in themselves in the hope of raising lots of money.
A blue and white blimp bobbed beneath the clouds overhead and
everyone seemed to be breakfasting on doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what, though? There was not a dot.com company in sight.
</P>
<P>
   These were two decidedly old-economy companies celebrating their
new listings _ Metropolitan Life Insurance, owners of the airship,
and Krispy Kreme, a doughnut firm that has a cult following because
of its retro branding.
</P>
<P>
   The icing is decidedly off the e-commerce and Internet sectors.
Cyber-companies, also known as Netcos, that had been planning
initial public offerings have been advised by the banks to
postpone. With the tech-heavy Nasdaq in bungee mode this week, that
would seem like wise counsel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new fear in the air for Internet-related concerns,
where, until just a few weeks ago, there was only optimism.
</P>
<P>
   It is scary for investors. But what about those legions of
cyber-executives, who may have left good, established employers, to
join the cyberspace gold rush? For them it is terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Darby Williams, for example, who, at 46, left Microsoft to
launch Cook Express, an outfit that allowed consumers to order
gastronomic dishes online for delivery to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, his became the first e-commerce company to
file for bankruptcy in Silicon Valley. When he needed money to
cover debts accumulated during his start-up, suddenly the venture
capitalists told him no.
</P>
<P>
   Or Bill Malloy, who recently resigned as chief executive of
Peapod.com, a site for those who would prefer to shop for food
online rather than visit the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   When Peapod began to come face to face with reality _ started to
run out of cash _ he resigned because of ``physical and mental
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was news last week about the plight of several high-profile
Net pioneers, including Peabod.com, that first began to tilt the
Nasdaq into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings were issued about the ability of Peapod and Drkoop.com,
a health-care site, to stay in business. They followed an
announcement last Thursday from CDNow Inc. that it too faced a
rapid loss of cash and possible closure.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout that seemed to be looming last week now seems
almost inevitable. The desperate plunge in the Nasdaq on Tuesday,
which was later largely recovered, will probably have profound
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ and, arguably, not before time _ investors will be looking
for real signs of profit in the Internet enterprises before they
offer the new money.
</P>
<P>
   Many players will find themselves denied funds. The only
alternative to death will be mergers and partnerships with stronger
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need money because you are trying to pay for a branding
strategy, the it will be hard,'' commented David Golden of Chase
H&AMP;Q. ``Unless companies are on the cusp of profitability, it will
be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the giants of the sector happened to be in New York for
a media conference on Tuesday, as the Nasdaq executed its
acrobatics. Like Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com and George Bell
of Excite &LR; Home. They said they liked what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the focus will be on sustainable business models,
which will be good for the whole industry,'' Bell insisted.
``Investors are coming to grips with how much time they want to
give these customers to demonstrate themselves,'' Bezos added.
``And I think that is great for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite for everyone, of course. Morale in cyberland is
suddenly crashing. Not only are many companies facing some harsh
realities, but their employees are being hurt because many are
remunerated through stocks and options.
</P>
<P>
   When the value of those packages collapse, as so many will have
done this week, the motivation to work will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some CEO's are urging employees to keep their eyes on their
jobs, not on the value of the shares and options.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slatt of Watchguard Technologies, an Internet security
company, sent this e-mail to his staff during Tuesday: ``With these
fluctuations, you'll literally drive looking every day'' at your

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Gates remained defiant Tuesday in the face of a
dramatic court ruling on Monday that his software behemoth,
Microsoft, blatantly violated free competition laws to squash its
Silicon Valley rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling triggered a dramatic meltdown in technology stocks as
investors ran scared, triggering a massive sell-off across Wall
Street Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the stock of his company _ and therefore the paper value
of his own fortune _ continued to plunge, Gates brushed aside
suggestions that his company may be broken up by the courts as
punishment for its transgressions. He also reiterated his promise
to fight the findings in the appeal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage in the battle will be hearings by the same judge
who issued Monday's verdict, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to
determine just what the punishment should be.
</P>
<P>
   They could last four months with the judge therefore reaching
his conclusion in the late summer. That, however, is when the
appeals process is likely to begin.
</P>
<P>
   It will pass through the Washington, D.C. appellate system first
before it goes thereafter, almost inevitably, to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Most experts consider that the entire process will not be
exhausted until the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Because the road ahead is so long, any real pain for Microsoft
is likely to be delayed or blunted. And while the wheels of U.S.
justice continue to turn at their near-glacial pace, innovation in
the marketplace continues to accelerate. In two years time, any
final outcome for Microsoft may be moot.
</P>
<P>
   Options for Judge Penfield Jackson in the penalty phase range
from breaking up Microsoft into several new companies, perhaps as
many as five, to something far less draconian like demanding that
the existing Microsoft simply adopt more competition-friendly
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls on the court Tuesday to take the harshest steps
possible against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has laid the foundation for the breakup of
Microsoft,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader commented. ``Anything
less than that will be like a thundering elephant emitting the
squeak of a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, in an interview with the BBC, seemed sure that would
not happen. ``I don't think any extreme remedy such as a breakup is
at all consistent with what the court put forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Microsoft would prevail on appeal, he added:
``Common sense stands on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   So does time. While the U.S. government may seek to have parts
of whatever remedy Judge Penfield Jackson comes out with applied
immediately, it is likely that any serious sort of sanctions,
certainly including a call for a breakup, would be frozen by the
courts pending Microsoft's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile history shows that Microsoft does better with appeals
judges than in the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the politics of the fight. It remains unclear
whether even the Clinton administration would really have the
stomach to splinter Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates may be hoping for a change of party colors at
the White House. He will be hoping for a victory in November for
George Bush, Jr., who is thought to have a slightly more relaxed
view on enforcement of U.S. monopoly laws.
</P>
<P>
   That there are several factors still on Gates' side was
reflected by investor alerts issues by several leading Wall Street
banks Tuesday, all urging clients to buy Microsoft shares rather
than to dump them.
</P>
<P>
   As well as pointing to the likely length of an appeals effort,
analysts noted that a settlement between the company and the
government remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the case moves forward from here, the government may find
it increasingly difficult to count on the outcome,'' Credit Suisse
First Boston said in its alert. ``This could in turn increase the
potential for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that investors themselves were listening Tuesday as a
continuing sell-off on the Nasdaq exchange in New York pushed it
into what is formally termed a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself continued to suffer a brutal battering, sinking
by midday an additional 2 5/8 to 88. That in turn meant further

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Gates remained defiant Tuesday in the face of a
dramatic court ruling on Monday that his software behemoth,
Microsoft, blatantly violated free competition laws to squash its
Silicon Valley rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling triggered a dramatic meltdown in technology stocks as
investors ran scared, triggering a massive sell-off across Wall
Street Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the stock of his company _ and therefore the paper value
of his own fortune _ continued to plunge, Gates brushed aside
suggestions that his company may be broken up by the courts as
punishment for its transgressions. He also reiterated his promise
to fight the findings in the appeal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage in the battle will be hearings by the same judge
who issued Monday's verdict, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to
determine just what the punishment should be.
</P>
<P>
   They could last four months with the judge therefore reaching
his conclusion in the late summer. That, however, is when the
appeals process is likely to begin.
</P>
<P>
   It will pass through the Washington, D.C. appellate system first
before it goes thereafter, almost inevitably, to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Most experts consider that the entire process will not be
exhausted until the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Because the road ahead is so long, any real pain for Microsoft
is likely to be delayed or blunted. And while the wheels of U.S.
justice continue to turn at their near-glacial pace, innovation in
the marketplace continues to accelerate. In two years time, any
final outcome for Microsoft may be moot.
</P>
<P>
   Options for Judge Penfield Jackson in the penalty phase range
from breaking up Microsoft into several new companies, perhaps as
many as five, to something far less draconian like demanding that
the existing Microsoft simply adopt more competition-friendly
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls on the court Tuesday to take the harshest steps
possible against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has laid the foundation for the breakup of
Microsoft,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader commented. ``Anything
less than that will be like a thundering elephant emitting the
squeak of a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, in an interview with the BBC, seemed sure that would
not happen. ``I don't think any extreme remedy such as a breakup is
at all consistent with what the court put forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Microsoft would prevail on appeal, he added:
``Common sense stands on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   So does time. While the U.S. government may seek to have parts
of whatever remedy Judge Penfield Jackson comes out with applied
immediately, it is likely that any serious sort of sanctions,
certainly including a call for a breakup, would be frozen by the
courts pending Microsoft's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile history shows that Microsoft does better with appeals
judges than in the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the politics of the fight. It remains unclear
whether even the Clinton administration would really have the
stomach to splinter Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates may be hoping for a change of party colors at
the White House. He will be hoping for a victory in November for
George Bush, Jr., who is thought to have a slightly more relaxed
view on enforcement of U.S. monopoly laws.
</P>
<P>
   That there are several factors still on Gates' side was
reflected by investor alerts issues by several leading Wall Street
banks Tuesday, all urging clients to buy Microsoft shares rather
than to dump them.
</P>
<P>
   As well as pointing to the likely length of an appeals effort,
analysts noted that a settlement between the company and the
government remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the case moves forward from here, the government may find
it increasingly difficult to count on the outcome,'' Credit Suisse
First Boston said in its alert. ``This could in turn increase the
potential for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that investors themselves were listening Tuesday as a
continuing sell-off on the Nasdaq exchange in New York pushed it
into what is formally termed a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself continued to suffer a brutal battering, sinking
by midday an additional 2 5/8 to 88. That in turn meant further
devastation of the fortune of Gates himself, who saw its value, in
paper terms, eroded by $12.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the historic ruling, meanwhile, are most of
Microsoft's Silicon Valley rivals, some of whom were instrumental
in triggering the case.

<P>
   We are probably going to have to get used to Bill Gates's nasal
whine insisting that his company, Microsoft, has done ``nothing
wrong,'' and that Judge Penfield Jackson's verdict on Monday _ that
Microsoft has a monopoly position in computer software and has
abused it _ will stifle his company's ``freedom to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court evidence clearly showed that it is Gates who is
wrong, and the judge who was right.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is a company that has abused its position in the
software market to try to create a monopoly of Internet operating
systems, and seems determined to extend its hold to handheld
computers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what remedies the judge should prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break the company up,'' some suggest. In theory it sounds
attractive, but in practice it would be like trying to remove
unwanted software from your Windows PC _ a drawn-out process that
never quite seems finished.
</P>
<P>
   How could one define what pieces of software the different
companies should own? Microsoft has worked very hard to blur the
lines.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up early in the last century, the
process was messy and simply created more powerful siblings. It
would be even more complex with a hi-tech company such as
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than teasing the company strands apart, Judge Jackson has
a simpler remedy available, which would, at a stroke, erase
Microsoft's monopoly while still leaving it ``free to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   He should make the ``source code'' (the ``GPL'' license) of the
many variants of the Windows operating system now on sale publicly
available, for free, and stipulate that changes must also be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would that curtail Microsoft's ability to dominate the
market, but it would be a constraint in keeping with the innovative
nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The source code is the spell that works the magic on the
machine. See it, and you can see how the beast does its work.
</P>
<P>
   For years, software developers have struggled with the fact that
Windows is like a multi-story building with a few dusty windows,
through which they could glimpse the activity in some rooms, and
write their products according to what they saw in those rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's software developers (for Word, or Access) had
complete access to all of the building, giving them the ability to
write products that used far more facilities. And when the contents
of the rooms changed _ which they did with amazing regularity _
Microsoft always had the head start.
</P>
<P>
   Making the source code freely available would mean there was
still an industry standard that could be referred to.
</P>
<P>
   With the source code published, Microsoft would lose its revenue
stream from operating systems. It would be forced to live on its
wits _ forced to innovate, which is something it has done precious
little of in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   We will have to wait for the judge's remedies, which we feel
should also include large financial penalties to indicate the
damage that has been done to companies such as Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we can reflect on this: the U.S. Department of
Justice has shown that the courts can stop a multinational, given
able lawyers and the right laws. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES AND MIAMI _ The day-trading clients hanging on the
telephone at the Charles Schwab brokerage house were begging for
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't tell my husband I've just lost $50,000,'' one
woman sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers were calling to tell the private investors hunched
over their home computers that it was time to settle their
positions and cut their losses before they became any bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts involved were not monstrous _ most day traders do
not hold on to much stock for very long _ but still big enough in
some cases to warrant second mortgages, sell-offs of assets,
cancellations of Caribbean vacations.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of Los Angeles, where for months home-based
investors have reaped the stock market whirlwind and contributed to
a furious boom in house prices and trendy new restaurant openings,
the sobriety of the moment was sinking in fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down 20 percent, what can I tell you?'' said day trader
Lorraine Conn, who missed part of the big slide in prices over the
past few days because she was sunning herself on a beach in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a bust moment for e-tailers and e-commerce
companies, but the big backbone companies like Cisco will bounce
back. We're seeing a lot of margin selling but I think the market
will hit bottom pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a spokesman for Charles Schwab, acknowledged
there had been ``some level of dizziness'' but said most of his
company's clients were level-headed enough to take a long-term view
and not give themselves over to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy day,'' he said. ``But we haven't seen a big
volume of requests for help. We try to encourage people not to
overreact to short-term fluctuations in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not mean the atmosphere was any less than frantic in
the homes of day traders or at securities brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk were the short-term individual investors who had
bought up batches of a few hundred shares in hi-tech stocks on the
Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   When the index plummeted, as it did on Monday and again Tuesday,
those stocks reached a value so low that the difference in purchase
price and current selling price exceeded the credit limit those
investors had with their brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers then ``called in the margins'' _ a polite way of
saying that they were collecting their debts by forcing their
customers to sell, triggering automatic losses running into the
tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   One investment fund noted that day traders were getting ``blown
out'' of the market in this way.
</P>
<P>
   In homes and offices, phones were ringing constantly, with many
callers forced to call back four or five times as lines constantly
cut off without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call back when the markets have closed?'' asked a
harried Michael Strahan of Round Hills Securities in Los Angeles,
before offering the tentative view that the market, in the
``semi-long-term,'' would hit a ``semi-bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet online chat rooms where the New Economy stock
boom started, there was a frenzied mixture of elation, despair and
greed as stocks plunged down, then caught their breath again.
</P>
<P>
   Many _ if not most _ were as gung-ho as ever, in the
relentlessly optimistic atmosphere that characterizes the world of
cyber-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really wish I had more money to throw at the market now...
great leverage opps,'' said Mercury in the Daytraders chat room.
``Covered all my short positions _ first time ever,'' said Segman,
who was being more cautious. ``Alot of houses going to market this
month,'' said DayRaider.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these people? Senior citizens day-trading from their
Boca Raton condominiums? The independently wealthy who became
dot.com millionaires on the tech-stock boom? Or the taxi-drivers,
concierges, cleaners and busboys who have been sucked into the
vortex of the stock-market boom?
</P>
<P>
   They went on: ``Oh, this is going to be a NIIIIIIIIIIICE ride,''
said NDennis0249 in the peculiar grammar-free rhetoric of the chat
room. Racecar called it ``CHARCOAL TUESDAY!'' while CDN was looking
on the bright side: ``Tomorrow the markets ROAR back as everyone
senses a bargain!'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``So so mad no more money to trade,'' said Mercury, still
desperately seeking bargains. ``This is a buy of the year
opportunity right this instant.'' It was 1:23 p.m. Eastern Time;
the Dow was down 210.7, the Nasdaq down 430.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys think this is fun?'' said Node, who apparently had
little time for the fiddling while the Nasdaq burned. ``This is
CRASH!... We beat 1987 CRASH today!''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, market commentators were complaining
vociferously about ``panic buying'' in the technology sector. That
was all a dim memory Tuesday as people watched the initial collapse
in shocked disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body in motion,'' commented Arthur Hogan, the chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``There is really no floor for
this. It's impossible to stop this until they ring the bell.'' &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where euphoria use to reign, a frenzied despair,
verging on panic, gripped Wall Street at times Tuesday as the
Nasdaq exchange staged a second dizzying plunge in the wake of the
Microsoft antitrust ruling and the Dow Jones industrial average
index suddenly threatened similarly to lose its footing.
</P>
<P>
   For many small investors it was their first encounter with a
bear market. The shock waves, and the pain, rippled across America,
which in recent years has become a nation of stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was suddenly feeling less wealthy and less
sure about its mutual funds and retirement plans. But by
mid-afternoon, there were signs that investors were moving back in
to pick up cheap stocks and the worst of the losses would be pared.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-tech stock in London suffered a similar, if less severe,
retreat, dragging the FTSE 100 to a four-week low. The tech-heavy
U.K. techMARK index sank more than 350 points to close at 3,731
points.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile victims included the raft of New Economy stocks
that recently gained inclusion in the FTSE 100 index and the
Web-based retailer, lastminute.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said the sell-down was inspired both by the ruling,
issued late on Monday in Washington, on Microsoft's violation of
anti-monopoly laws, and by investors' concerns over the sky-high
valuations that the sector has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious passersby were gathering Tuesday outside the Nasdaq
exchange's giant ticker wall on Times Square in New York to absorb
the gravity of what was happening inside. The Nasdaq is home to
most of the hi-tech and Internet stocks that until recently had
been so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Most seemed determined to remain calm. ``I am not too worried
and I am just looking for the bottom, then this may turn out to be
another buying opportunity,'' noted Brian Haber, who was at the
window. He expected his Microsoft shares to pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the Nasdaq might have managed a limited recovery
after losing 7.3 percent of its value on Monday were dashed in
morning trading Tuesday. By the lunch hour in New York it had
slipped another 11.25 percent to below 3,749 and was more than 20
percent off its all-time high of 5,0848.62, hit on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was shaping up to be the worst day in the Nasdaq's short
history.
</P>
<P>
   Several recently floated hi-tech companies were being torn

   NEW YORK _ Where euphoria use to reign, a frenzied despair,
verging on panic, gripped Wall Street at times Tuesday as the
Nasdaq exchange staged a second dizzying plunge in the wake of the
Microsoft antitrust ruling and the Dow Jones industrial average
index suddenly threatened similarly to lose its footing.
</P>
<P>
   For many small investors it was their first encounter with a
bear market. The shock waves, and the pain, rippled across America,
which in recent years has become a nation of stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was suddenly feeling less wealthy and less
sure about its mutual funds and retirement plans. But by
mid-afternoon, there were signs that investors were moving back in
to pick up cheap stocks and the worst of the losses would be pared.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-tech stock in London suffered a similar, if less severe,
retreat, dragging the FTSE 100 to a four-week low. The tech-heavy
U.K. techMARK index sank more than 350 points to close at 3,731
points.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile victims included the raft of New Economy stocks
that recently gained inclusion in the FTSE 100 index and the
Web-based retailer, lastminute.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said the sell-down was inspired both by the ruling,
issued late on Monday in Washington, on Microsoft's violation of
anti-monopoly laws, and by investors' concerns over the sky-high
valuations that the sector has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious passersby were gathering Tuesday outside the Nasdaq
exchange's giant ticker wall on Times Square in New York to absorb
the gravity of what was happening inside. The Nasdaq is home to
most of the hi-tech and Internet stocks that until recently had
been so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Most seemed determined to remain calm. ``I am not too worried
and I am just looking for the bottom, then this may turn out to be
another buying opportunity,'' noted Brian Haber, who was at the
window. He expected his Microsoft shares to pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the Nasdaq might have managed a limited recovery
after losing 7.3 percent of its value on Monday were dashed in
morning trading Tuesday. By the lunch hour in New York it had
slipped another 11.25 percent to below 3,749 and was more than 20
percent off its all-time high of 5,0848.62, hit on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was shaping up to be the worst day in the Nasdaq's short
history.
</P>
<P>
   Several recently floated hi-tech companies were being torn
apart. Electronic share-dealing firms were among the worst hit.
Where so many of these companies have been used to making daily
double-digit gains, Tuesday they saw frightening double-digit
losses. The electronic Nasdaq tickers were nearly all flushed with

<P>
   TOKYO _ Keizo Obuchi, the outgoing Japanese prime minister,
disappeared for four hours after suffering a stroke on Sunday and
was out of contact with his government as aides tried desperately
to cover up his critical condition, the Independent has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation came Wednesday as his successor, Yoshiro Mori,
was sworn in as prime minister, three days after Obuchi's sudden
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary sequence of midnight events, which further
raise questions about the Japanese government's capacity to handle
emergencies, the ailing prime minister travelled to hospital in an
unarmored minivan driven by his personal doctor, without his
complement of bodyguards and without the knowledge of any members
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mikio Aoki, the cabinet secretary who took over as
interim acting prime minister, it was early on Sunday morning when
he was informed of Obuchi's condition, more than four hours after
he was first taken ill.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the 62-year old prime minister was accompanied
only by his wife and a junior secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were some reasons to travel to the hospital
without security,'' Akitaka Saiki, Obuchi's deputy press secretary
said Wednesday, who confirmed that during that four-hour period no
one in the government knew where the prime minister was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the prime minister's health condition immediately
impacts on the political situation. I think that's the main reason
his aides wanted to have a minimum amount of information
provided.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has already been criticized for waiting more than
22 hours before announcing Obuchi's illness _ indeed on Sunday, as
he was lying in Tokyo's Juntendo Hospital, an aide told reporters
that the prime minister was working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki has insisted that he was waiting for the results of tests
before making a definitive announcement about his leader's
condition; but there is suspicion that he was buying time for
consultation among officials of Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
   However the latest revelations suggest an even more alarming
scenario: that Obuchi's personal security was compromised in order
to conceal the fact of his hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese prime minister is normally guarded by a dozen armed
members of the Japanese Special Police.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the prime minister's office and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police were unable to say whether any bodyguards had
accompanied him to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister first complained of illness in the first few
minutes of last Sunday, and his personal doctor, Hidehiko Hisaoka
of Juntendo Hospital, was called to his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was conscious at the time and, instead of taking an
ambulance or an official car with security escorts, Dr. Hisaoka
drove there in his minivan, arriving at around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery surrounds the rest of the day. Doctors at the hospital
have refused to make any statement on Obuchi or his treatment, and
the only source of information is Aoki, who claims that he saw the
prime minister at 7 p.m. and was asked by him to take over as
acting prime minster, which he did the following day.
</P>
<P>
   By the official account, Obuchi's condition worsened half an
hour later, and within two hours he had fallen into a coma from
which he has not emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But the only witness to this exchange was Obuchi's wife, who has
not spoken to reporters since her husband's illness.
</P>
<P>
   From the account of Saiki, who worked alongside the prime
minister in his office, it is clear that Obuchi was under intense
physical and mental strain at the time of his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   According to his deputy spokesman, Saiki, Obuchi was working
from 6 a.m. until 11 a.m. and frequently woke up in the middle of
the night to review papers at his desk.
</P>
<P>
   He has not had any time off since last August, and took only
three days of vacation during his entire 20 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   His condition was described Wednesday as ``stable but still
critical'' but, by Wednesday night, Obuchi had already been
consigned to political history.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, his 62-year old university friend, was comfortably
elected as the new prime minister by the LDP-dominated coalition
which has a majority in both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In emergency after emergency _ from the Kobe earthquake to the
nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway _ Japan has been let down by
its crisis control measures, and Obuchi's illness is just the
latest example.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never happened before,'' said Saiki. ``We don't have
the so-called manuals to cope with this situation. But on the basis
of this case I am sure some manuals will be developed.'' &QL;

   He has not had any time off since last August, and took only
three days of vacation during his entire 20 months in office.

<P>
   His condition was described Wednesday as ``stable but still
critical'' but, by Wednesday night, Obuchi had already been
consigned to political history.

<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, his 62-year old university friend, was comfortably
elected as the new prime minister by the LDP-dominated coalition
which has a majority in both houses of parliament.

<P>
   In emergency after emergency _ from the Kobe earthquake to the
nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway _ Japan has been let down by
its crisis control measures, and Obuchi's illness is just the
latest example.

   ``This has never happened before,'' said Saiki. ``We don't have
the so-called manuals to cope with this situation. But on the basis
of this case I am sure some manuals will be developed.'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1989 after the Berlin Wall fell, I was in Prague for the last
days of Communist Czechoslovakia. Every night a half-million people
gathered in 15-degree weather in Wenceslas Square to hear a
playwright and later, President Vaclav Havel, speak movingly about
the corrupt government ruling the nation.
 &HT;    The Czech crowd erupted in a chant: ''We Are Not Like Them! We
Are Not Like Them!''
 &HT;    ''A central defining feature of the Czech revolution was the
contrast between truth and lies,'' writes Os Guinness in a
powerful, new slender volume, ''Time for Truth.'' People said of
the Communist regime, ''They are people of lies and propaganda.
''We,'' the revolutionaries, ''are people of truth.''
 &HT;    Similarly, the American Revolution began with those stirring
words of the Declaration of Independence, ''We hold these truths to
be self evident...''
 &HT;    Today no truths are self-evident in America. Truth is relative.
 &HT;    Edmund Morris, the official biographer of President Reagan, who
had unprecedented access to his subject, wrote ''Dutch'' with
himself as a fictional observer of the young Reagan.
 &HT;    In a post-modern world, Guinness says the question is no longer,
''Is it true?'' but rather ''Whose truth is it?'' What has replaced
genuine truth is ''a world of lies, hype and spin. Truth is dead
and knowledge is power.''
 &HT;    There is no better example than Bill Clinton, who explained on
national TV that he didn't have ''sexual relations with that
woman.'' It all ''depends on how you define alone,'' says Guinness,
or ''what the meaning of the word is, is. Even The Washington Post
had to conclude: ''It is difficult to find a single honest sentence
in the factual defense of the perjury charge.''
 &HT;    Guinness calls 1999 ''the year America learned to live with the
lie. The Clinton/Lewinsky scandal became a profound crisis for
truth in American public life as a trio of forces converged: a
virtuoso liar of a president; his morally contorted supporters from
his fellow Democrats to his wife, who in their support of him
enabled him and demeaned themselves; and a largely confused and
complacent public willing to become complicit in their own
corruption.''
 &HT;    Lies have consequences. Corrupt leaders spawn a degradation of
the culture.
 &HT;    The Parents Television Council reported last week that
prime-time references to oral sex soared from zero in the first
four weeks 1989 to 20 in the same period of 1999. The February
issue of Talk magazine reports that in dozens of interviews,
teen-agers acknowledge that ''oral sex -- which in true Clintonian
fashion, the kids don't think of as Real Sex -- begins considerably
earlier than intercourse.'' The very first scene of the fall
season's premier of ''Ally McBeal,'' features the title character
having sex with a total stranger. Weird sex dominates Academy Award
movies.
 &HT;    Yet neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush have expressed any shock
about the coarsening culture, even though polls show that the
public's highest priority is for a ''restoration of moral values.''
 &HT;    ''Vaporized by critical theories, twisted by ideologies,
hollowed out and replaced by psychological categories, obscured by
clouds of euphemism and jargon, outpaced by rumor and hype,
softened by mawkish sentiment parading as emotion, truth in America
today is anything but marching on,'' writes Guinness, a man born in
China, educated in England and now a U.S. citizen.
 &HT;    What's the answer? At one level, mendacity will be found out.
How long were Clinton's secrets secret?
 &HT;    More important, Scripture is an eternal source of truth. In 19
years of writing this column, I have always found secular evidence
backs up the truth of Scripture.
 &HT;    St. Paul wrote ''Flee fornication.'' Millions ignore this truth
at their peril.
 &HT;    The result? A third of U.S. babies are now born out of wedlock.
On the other hand, those who marry as virgins (there still are
some) have lower divorce rates. Of virgins marrying in the 1960s, a
University of Maryland study found only 30 percent are divorced.
But of those who were sexually active, 50 percent lost their
marriages. Of those who married in 1980-83, only 14 percent of
virgins were divorced by 1988, but 24 percent of nonvirgins.
 &HT;    Thus, the ``sexually liberated'' were two-thirds more likely to
divorce.
 &HT;    Guinness writes that 2000 years ago, Jesus declared his
universal requirement for living free in words that are ``fact for
the poor and powerless no less than the beautiful, the rich and the
important; for people of both genders, all races, every class and
each generation.''
 &HT;    Those words are: ''If you will stand by my teaching, you are
truly my disciples; you will know the truth and the truth will set
you free.''

   (UNDATED) _ A large hole has opened up in the ozone layer over
the Arctic, which scientists believe will severely damage the
natural shield protecting the northern hemisphere from
cancer-causing sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the world's biggest ozone-monitoring experiment show
that more than 60 percent of the ozone layer has been lost at
certain altitudes over the North Pole _ a deterioration on 1997,
the previous worst year.
</P>
<P>
   Climatic conditions needed to trigger ozone destruction by
man-made pollutants were nearly perfect for much of this polar
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These losses are likely to affect the ozone levels over Europe
during spring. This is one of the most substantial ozone losses at
this altitude in the Arctic,'' the scientists said in a statement
issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is the key filter for
damaging ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in the Sun's rays. Without
it, organisms suffer extensive DNA damage, which in humans results
in a greater increase in the risk of skin cancer, eye cataracts and
defects in the body's immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   An Arctic ozone ``hole'' _ actually a thinning of the layer to
less than half its usual density _ could easily be blown south by
high-altitude winds, and appear over populated areas of North
America, Europe and the northern regions of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists taking part in the ozone experiment, a joint
initiative by America's National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the European Ozone Research Coordinating
Unit, based in Cambridge, England, and the European Union's
research directorate, will pass their results to the Meteorological
Office, which is responsible for issuing warnings about UV-B
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although an ozone hole over the South Pole is a regular
phenomenon, it is only in the past five years that scientists have
begun to witness a similar event over the North Pole. &QL;

ISRAELI POLICE RECOMMEND THAT PRESIDENT NOT BE CHARGED FOR
ACCEPTING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At 75, President Ezer Weizman, having endured
military and political battles that span his country's lifetime,
was not about to cap his career by submitting to public pressure to
resign just because he was being investigated by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, his proud obstinacy paid off. The police closed a
three-month investigation of Weizman with the recommendation that
he not be prosecuted for accepting substantial payments from a
French investor.
</P>
<P>
   But the police did not exactly exonerate Weizman, a founding
father of the 52-year-old state who embodies the bluntness and
swagger of the true sabra, or native-born Israeli. And he is likely
to pay a price, at the least by having his biography tainted by
what many political analysts Thursday deemed unsavory conduct that
made him unfit for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, there is a recommendation to close the file on the legal
level,'' said Moshe Negbi, a legal commentator for Israel Radio and
the Maariv newspaper. ``But there is no doubt that in the framework
of norms and principles there is a very strong conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Weizman told a television reporter that he felt
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good?'' the reporter asked. ``Yes,'' Weizman said. ``I feel
good that the case has been closed. What do you want from me? There
are things here and there in the report that I will take to
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have to review the recommendation. But it is highly
unlikely that they will disagree with the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation immediately moved into high gear about the leading
candidates to succeed Weizman in the ceremonial post, among them
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Foreign Minister David Levy and
Moshe Katzav, a Likud Party lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman still has three years left in his second term. But many
people believe that the elderly, sometimes ailing, president will
step down, as he was supposedly planning to do before the scandal
erupted in January.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, there were many calls, some judgmental and some
compassionate, for him to do so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge him to find an elegant way of leaving his post
and retreating to Caesarea,'' the coastal town where he maintains a
second house, said Tommy Lapid, a legislator.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the 120-page investigative report indicates that
the police suspected that Weizman was indeed involved in a
bribe-taking relationship. They said there was insufficient
evidence for a successful prosecution ``beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' but they did not cite ``lack of guilt,'' as they did with
another charge.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had found enough evidence to sustain
charges of breach of trust and fraud for Weizman's failure to
report the payments as income. But the statute of limitations on
those charges had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The police documented an eight-year financial relationship
between Weizman and the French businessman, Edouard Seroussi, a
Sudanese-born Jew who has a house in a suburb of Tel Aviv. The
relationship existed from 1985 to 1993, mostly when Weizman was a
member of Parliament and Cabinet minister. He became president in
May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Seroussi paid Weizman $400,000 in that period,
most of it deposited monthly into a trust. Seroussi also gave
Weizman a car.
</P>
<P>
   The police described a business relationship that evolved into
``a strong friendship between the two that made Seroussi want to
help Weizman in his daily troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows that the beginning of the relationship
between Weizman and Seroussi was based on business and financial
interests,'' the report said. ``Seroussi identified the business
potential in the name Weizman as a name that could cross borders,
and he was willing to invest a lot of money for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence indicates, as a fact, that over the course of the
year a close friendship did, indeed, develop. At the same time, the
existence of the friendship, which is not doubted, does not negate
the other dimensions of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Weizman, who did not live the high life, said he
had spent much of the money caring for his son Shaul, who was
wounded in the Suez Canal in 1970 and died in a car accident in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Seroussi also paid off the $800,000 in debts for a political
party that Weizman tried to create in 1988, the police said.

<P>
   The police mentioned only two instances in which Weizman seemed
to use his position to give Seroussi something in return. But
neither amounted to anything.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Weizman vouched for his friend when he sought to
buy shares in a holding company that controls the First
International Bank. The deal never went through. In the other case,
Weizman tried to help him start an English-language newspaper here,
but the venture never started.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Brussels Wednesday proposed a total ban on testing of
cosmetics on live animals in the EU, but provoked complaints that
the plans will water down existing controls and export cruel
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission announced that it wants to amend
existing legislation due to come into force on July 1, under which
European member states were committed to a ban on the sale of
cosmetics containing ingredients tested on animals after July 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Brussels gets its way, that will now be put on ice in favor
of a full-scale ban on animal testing in the production of
cosmetics inside the EU. Imported goods will not, however, be
covered.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ideas will be discussed on May 5 and, if agreed, the
directive will be suspended until moves to amend it have been
through all their legislative stages.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's plan has lead to accusations that the new
proposal will delay and weaken controls that were first agreed in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Mark Watts, Labour's spokesman on animal welfare in
the European Parliament, said the new measures were ``totally
inadequate'' adding: ``This ban has been on the table for year and
has been subject to endless delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no justification for painful skin tests on
rabbits or testing burning eye drops on mice for luxury products
which can be tested in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Brussels says that it efforts to take imports out of the scope
of the directive has been prompted by fears that new restrictions
on goods made abroad could fall foul of the World Trade
Organization, the arbiter of global trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission said in a statement: ``In order to avoid
any difficulties with our trade partners which would risk putting
into question the EU legislation regarding animal testing, the
Commission proposes to modify the ban to ensure
WTO-compatibility''.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 0.3 percent of the animals involved in the
EU each year in experimentation are used for tests on ingredients
which make up cosmetic products. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Wednesday morning, while walking the dog around the
local park, I bumped into an old friend also walking her dog. ``I
must ask you,'' she said, ``what you think about Bill Gates and the
market. What is going to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   She is not a tech-head, nor does she have a background in
finance, but it transpired that she was renovating an apartment and
was concerned about London property prices.
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively she could spot the links between the Microsoft case,
the price of U.S. hi-tech stocks, the possibility of a global
slowdown and the impact that might have on the price of a London
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   I mumbled an extremely inadequate answer and promised a more
thought-through one in the paper. Here goes.
</P>
<P>
   There are really two questions. What is happening now? And what
will happen next?
</P>
<P>
   When markets jump about as much as they have in the last few
days, they are groping for something that they cannot understand.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they were far too slow in appreciating that the new
communications technologies would change utterly the face of the
business world, they then overestimated the money that might be
made out of these technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The result was always going to be a sharp break in the markets,
and it looks as though that is happening now.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, then there is a nice parallel with the share crash of
October 1987, which occurred immediately after the great storm. For
the storm, read the collapse of share trading on the London market
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no connection between the two. But the
collapse of our share trading technology Wednesday highlights the
vulnerability of companies selling intangibles rather than real
items.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us now spend more on phone calls than we do on lunch,
but you cannot eat a virtual sandwich. People were sooner or later
going to cotton onto the fact that most of the thousands of
entrepreneurial companies spawned by the communications revolution
would end up losers.
</P>
<P>
   While the few winners would transform the whole business world,
figuring out who they would be was like finding Ford out of the
2,000 car makers in the U.S. in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   So we are seeing, in all probability, the first stages of the
hi-tech shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next? Typically, when markets pull back from a
burst of over-enthusiasm, there are several months of indecision.
Things don't happen in a straight-line, orderly way.
</P>
<P>
   Actually that period of indecision started about three months
ago, though initially it was indecision about the impact of the new
technologies on the old economy, and only in the last couple of
weeks has it spread.
</P>
<P>
   As many people have pointed out, were it not for the hi-tech
sector, we would be already clearly in a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   So expect another six to 18 months of uncertainty; expect that
to be most evident in the United States, where valuations have been
pushed to extreme levels, but expect it also to show itself in the
U.K. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That will lead eventually to a period of much slower growth. The
U.S. is particularly vulnerable because of the extent to which the
dollar has been supported by foreign money flowing into the new
industries, but we should not kid ourselves that if the U.S. slows
we will not slow too. We will. And eventually so too will
continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to questions about the timing of the slowdown and its
likely severity. On timing, things always seem to take longer than
you think.
</P>
<P>
   Given the momentum behind the U.S. economy at the moment, with
an extraordinary burst of growth at the turn of the year of about 7
percent, it is hard to see that coming off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who thought there would be a post-millennial flop
have been proved wrong. My guess now is that the slowdown will not
start seriously until 2001 or maybe even 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the pattern of the last downturn to be repeated, with the
U.S. and U.K. slowing first and continental Europe following.
Expect too that the U.S. and U.K. will emerge more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On severity, as far as the U.S. is concerned, expect something
between, on the optimistic side, a couple of years of very slow
growth and, on the pessimistic side, a recession akin to that of
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K. underwent a worse experience in the early 1990s than
the U.S., but this time it should have a less serious one because
the imbalances are less serious.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the year 2002 will be one of very slow growth.
For continental Europe the bad year will be 2003. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if that old, familiar beast called the business cycle is
about to stir, woken by the turmoil on the U.S. share market, do
not expect the first decade of this century to be similar in other
ways to the last two decades of the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   We have all become accustomed to the idea that the cyclical
forces are the most important. Here in Britain the impact of the
business cycle has seared itself into our daily lives though its
impact on house prices.
</P>
<P>
   There are still people who bought homes in 1988 and have only
just emerged from negative equity on them. There are many people
who have fared even worse, losing their homes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Other people found that they made more out of buying and selling
homes at the right time than they made out of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like my dog-walking friend, we are all very sensitive to the
possibility of a share-price crash leading to a property price
one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10, maybe 20, years structural change is going to
be more important than cyclical change. We will still live in the
same sort of houses and drive similar cars. But in other ways _ in
particular in the ways we communicate and work _ our lives will
change utterly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that new companies that have not yet even been
formed will dominate the corporate league tables. Those league
tables may not matter much, as more and more people will work for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the railway boom. Successive waves of massive
investment during the 19th century created the railways, and
successive waves of investors either made fortunes or went bust.
</P>
<P>
   What we are seeing now is equivalent to the end of the first
railway boom. But the railways still got built, and that changed
the lives of humankind. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The result was always going to be a sharp break in the markets,
and it looks as though that is happening now.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, then there is a nice parallel with the share crash of
October 1987, which occurred immediately after the great storm. For
the storm, read the collapse of share trading on the London market
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no connection between the two. But the
collapse of our share trading technology Wednesday highlights the
vulnerability of companies selling intangibles rather than real
items.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us now spend more on phone calls than we do on lunch,
but you cannot eat a virtual sandwich. People were sooner or later
going to cotton onto the fact that most of the thousands of
entrepreneurial companies spawned by the communications revolution
would end up losers.
</P>
<P>
   While the few winners would transform the whole business world,
figuring out who they would be was like finding Ford out of the
2,000 car makers in the U.S. in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   So we are seeing, in all probability, the first stages of the
hi-tech shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next? Typically, when markets pull back from a
burst of over-enthusiasm, there are several months of indecision.
Things don't happen in a straight-line, orderly way.
</P>
<P>
   Actually that period of indecision started about three months
ago, though initially it was indecision about the impact of the new
technologies on the old economy, and only in the last couple of
weeks has it spread.
</P>
<P>
   As many people have pointed out, were it not for the hi-tech
sector, we would be already clearly in a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   So expect another six to 18 months of uncertainty; expect that
to be most evident in the United States, where valuations have been
pushed to extreme levels, but expect it also to show itself in the
U.K. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That will lead eventually to a period of much slower growth. The
U.S. is particularly vulnerable because of the extent to which the
dollar has been supported by foreign money flowing into the new
industries, but we should not kid ourselves that if the U.S. slows
we will not slow too. We will. And eventually so too will
continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to questions about the timing of the slowdown and its
likely severity. On timing, things always seem to take longer than
you think.
</P>
<P>
   Given the momentum behind the U.S. economy at the moment, with
an extraordinary burst of growth at the turn of the year of about 7
percent, it is hard to see that coming off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who thought there would be a post-millennial flop
have been proved wrong. My guess now is that the slowdown will not
start seriously until 2001 or maybe even 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the pattern of the last downturn to be repeated, with the
U.S. and U.K. slowing first and continental Europe following.
Expect too that the U.S. and U.K. will emerge more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On severity, as far as the U.S. is concerned, expect something
between, on the optimistic side, a couple of years of very slow
growth and, on the pessimistic side, a recession akin to that of
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K. underwent a worse experience in the early 1990s than
the U.S., but this time it should have a less serious one because
the imbalances are less serious.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the year 2002 will be one of very slow growth.
For continental Europe the bad year will be 2003. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if that old, familiar beast called the business cycle is
about to stir, woken by the turmoil on the U.S. share market, do
not expect the first decade of this century to be similar in other
ways to the last two decades of the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   We have all become accustomed to the idea that the cyclical
forces are the most important. Here in Britain the impact of the
business cycle has seared itself into our daily lives though its
impact on house prices.
</P>
<P>
   There are still people who bought homes in 1988 and have only
just emerged from negative equity on them. There are many people
who have fared even worse, losing their homes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Other people found that they made more out of buying and selling
homes at the right time than they made out of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like my dog-walking friend, we are all very sensitive to the
possibility of a share-price crash leading to a property price
one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10, maybe 20, years structural change is going to
be more important than cyclical change. We will still live in the
same sort of houses and drive similar cars. But in other ways _ in
particular in the ways we communicate and work _ our lives will
change utterly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that new companies that have not yet even been
formed will dominate the corporate league tables. Those league
tables may not matter much, as more and more people will work for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the railway boom. Successive waves of massive
investment during the 19th century created the railways, and
successive waves of investors either made fortunes or went bust.
</P>
<P>
   What we are seeing now is equivalent to the end of the first
railway boom. But the railways still got built, and that changed
the lives of humankind. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wednesday morning, while walking the dog around the
local park, I bumped into an old friend also walking her dog. ``I
must ask you,'' she said, ``what you think about Bill Gates and the
market. What is going to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   She is not a tech-head, nor does she have a background in
finance, but it transpired that she was renovating an apartment and
was concerned about London property prices.
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively she could spot the links between the Microsoft case,
the price of U.S. hi-tech stocks, the possibility of a global
slowdown and the impact that might have on the price of a London
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   I mumbled an extremely inadequate answer and promised a more
thought-through one in the paper. Here goes.
</P>
<P>
   There are really two questions. What is happening now? And what
will happen next?
</P>
<P>
   When markets jump about as much as they have in the last few
days, they are groping for something that they cannot understand.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they were far too slow in appreciating that the new
communications technologies would change utterly the face of the
business world, they then overestimated the money that might be
made out of these technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The result was always going to be a sharp break in the markets,
and it looks as though that is happening now.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, then there is a nice parallel with the share crash of
October 1987, which occurred immediately after the great storm. For
the storm, read the collapse of share trading on the London market
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no connection between the two. But the
collapse of our share trading technology Wednesday highlights the
vulnerability of companies selling intangibles rather than real
items.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us now spend more on phone calls than we do on lunch,
but you cannot eat a virtual sandwich. People were sooner or later
going to cotton onto the fact that most of the thousands of
entrepreneurial companies spawned by the communications revolution
would end up losers.
</P>
<P>
   While the few winners would transform the whole business world,
figuring out who they would be was like finding Ford out of the
2,000 car makers in the U.S. in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    INTERNET PRIVACY PROVES DIVISIVE ISSUE ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement and civil liberties groups sparred
Thursday over how to balance the battle against cybercrime and the
need to protect individual privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution, the two sides agreed that federal laws must be
updated to reflect Information Age realities, but offered opposite
advice on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of the same information individuals formerly kept in
their homes, file cabinets, wallets and purses gravitates toward
new locations on the Internet's landscape, Congress must consider
whether the government adequately protects Fourth Amendment
values,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. the subcommittee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see laws that have not been updated in many years not being
used in ways that protect citizens under the Fourth Amendment,''
said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, ratified in 1791, provides for ``the right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects,
against unreasonable search and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, it is easier for the government to snoop through a
couple's private e-mails to one another than it is for the
government to listen into the very same conversations if they take
place on the phone,'' said Gregory Nojeim, a legislative counsel
for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that Americans are at risk of losing control of their
personal data, Nojeim added: ``As businesses and schools scramble
to stay apace of rapidly evolving technologies, Congress must jump
in and ensure that our privacy laws are not made obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Di Gregory, a deputy assistant attorney general,
called for more investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When law enforcement successfully investigates, apprehends and
prosecutes a criminal who has stolen a citizen's personal
information from a computer system, (we) are undeniably working to
protect privacy and deter further privacy violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of
America, agreed, noting that ``if the government is unable to
protect us, our institutions and our economy from criminal
activity, then many of the rights we hold so dear, including the
right to privacy, may be little more than a hollow promise.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    INTERNET PRIVACY PROVES DIVISIVE ISSUE ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement and civil liberties groups sparred
Thursday over how to balance the battle against cybercrime and the
need to protect individual privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution, the two sides agreed that federal laws must be
updated to reflect Information Age realities, but offered opposite
advice on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of the same information individuals formerly kept in
their homes, file cabinets, wallets and purses gravitates toward
new locations on the Internet's landscape, Congress must consider
whether the government adequately protects Fourth Amendment
values,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. the subcommittee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see laws that have not been updated in many years not being
used in ways that protect citizens under the Fourth Amendment,''
said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, ratified in 1791, provides for ``the right of the
people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects,
against unreasonable search and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, it is easier for the government to snoop through a
couple's private e-mails to one another than it is for the
government to listen into the very same conversations if they take
place on the phone,'' said Gregory Nojeim, a legislative counsel
for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that Americans are at risk of losing control of their
personal data, Nojeim added: ``As businesses and schools scramble
to stay apace of rapidly evolving technologies, Congress must jump
in and ensure that our privacy laws are not made obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Di Gregory, a deputy assistant attorney general,
called for more investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When law enforcement successfully investigates, apprehends and
prosecutes a criminal who has stolen a citizen's personal
information from a computer system, (we) are undeniably working to
protect privacy and deter further privacy violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of
America, agreed, noting that ``if the government is unable to
protect us, our institutions and our economy from criminal
activity, then many of the rights we hold so dear, including the
right to privacy, may be little more than a hollow promise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New economy'' companies are being caught in the middle of the
struggle, according to Nicole Wong, an attorney who represents such
clients as Dell Computer, Yahoo!, General Electric and the Los
Angeles Times on matters of Internet law for San Francisco-based
Perkins Coie.

   ``In cyberspace we must recognize that the traditional notion of

&HT;     ANOTHER CHAPTER IN ABORTION POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sad but true: Politicians think the voters are so
dumb that they will be taken in by cheap stunts useful for campaign
sound bites but empty of real meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of this fakery is the House approval this
week of a ban on a controversial form of late-term abortion that
members know President Clinton will veto. He has already done so
twice.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time in five years that Congress has tried to
get around the Supreme Court's limited protection of abortion
rights by focusing on a rarely used procedure that is frequently
described as gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   If advocates of the ban were really serious, they would have
approved a proposed exception to the ban if the pregnant woman's
health were endangered. That would not only have been the humane
course but it would have met the president's objections and
eliminated his veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the anti-abortion grandstanders weren't serious. They
wanted the world to hear that they were putting the preservation of
an unborn fetus ahead of protecting the well-being of the living
adult who is the potential mother. She might, they feared, merely
suffer depression or other mental illness, problems they had no
sympathy with. This cold-hearted attitude, they think, is good
politics. As a national policy, it is nuts.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, opposed
the exception because, he said, ``This is a debate about human
dignity.'' Whose dignity? Not that of the pregnant woman, who the
legislators insist should not have any say in the matter of her own
health.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion forces call the procedure in question
``partial birth abortion,'' the better to make it sound horrible
and politically difficult to tolerate. Medically, it is known as
intact dilation and extraction, during which the skull is punctured
to allow a fetus that cannot yet live outside the womb to pass
though the cervix. Calling this a birth is a medical and legal
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The current bill, similar to laws in 30 states, describes the
procedure so vaguely that the ban could technically apply to many
forms of abortion, even those in the first and second trimesters,
the most protected periods under the Constitution. Congress, in
fact, seems eager to provide an excuse to scare doctors away from
performing any legal abortion at all. The Senate has passed similar
legislation by a 63-34 vote, which fell short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the issues before the nation, this does not deserve the
priority Congress gives it. The poohbahs on Capitol Hill find time
to invade the privacy of pregnant women but not to vote on the
important subjects the country really cares about, like Social
Security and education.
</P>
<P>
   The political purpose here is to posture before anti-abortion
activists in hopes of energizing them to cough up campaign cash and
turn out to vote. Only eight Republicans voted against the ban,
along with 132 Democrats and one independent; 209 Republicans voted
for it as well as 77 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to his shame,
voted for the ban. He is usually pro-choice, but he didn't have the
courage to test Missouri's anti-abortion mood these days.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Supreme Court may be about to trump Congress on
the subject. On April 25 it will hear a Nebraska doctor's challenge
to that state's ban as unconstitutionally vague. Federal and state
courts around the country have reached contradictory rulings on the
legality of criminalizing the procedure, and the high bench will
now have the final say.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that the court will rule such laws
invalid as a backdoor method of reversing Roe v. Wade, the 1973
decision that legalized abortion. When the court granted review of
the Nebraska case, it indicated that it would not revisit the basic
question of the constitutional status of abortion, meaning Roe v.
Wade is still the operating precedent.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court ruling that so-called ``partial birth''
abortions are constitutionally protected would make congressional
action look silly _ like the recent failed legislative attempt to
reverse the court's insistence that flag burning is constitutional
free speech. Congress moved to get on the record before that could
happen. This latest abortion stunt is another pitiful indication
that political posturing, not serious legislating, is what such
votes are all about.

<P>
   A couple thousand years after Greece supplied a name for the
continent, Europe is about to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when the euro likely replaces the Greek drachma, the
European Central Bank and its official interest-rate policy will
effectively rule the Greek economy, ending a history of inflation
and financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lenders will sleep more soundly knowing they will be
repaid in euros, rather than drachmas. And Greek companies, which
used to pay double-digit interest rates on loans _ ten years ago,
Greece's inflation rate soared to 24 percent _ will soon be able to
borrow at lower rates than U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's recently hiked Greece's credit rating two
rungs, to A-. The benefits have already shown up in the Athens
stock index, which rose fourfold between January 1997 and January
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Europeans opposed Greece's entry into the
European Monetary Union. If a volatile Greece joined EMU, the fear
was a Trojan Horse of economic woes might sneak inside Euroland:
exploding debt, rampant inflation, and widening deficits. Countries
such as Germany and France might get stuck bailing out Greece
during its next budget crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, Greece has allayed these worries by
successfully fighting fiscal and monetary excess. The budget
deficit has been reduced from 15 percent of gross domestic product
in 1990 to about 1.5 percent; inflation has fallen from 20 percent
to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has also jumped on the privatization bandwagon, selling
stakes in the National Bank of Greece and in the Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization, the biggest telephone firm.
</P>
<P>
   These sales raked in millions of dollars and helped push down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year looks like another good one, with GDP rising to 3.5
percent, higher than most of Europe. That's a good thing for the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Party (PASOK), for it must hold an
election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Greeks have become accustomed to a raging stock
market, PASOK is waiting for stock prices to rebound from a slump
in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Greek newspapers, the benchmark stock index must
return to the lofty 6000 level before PASOK will hold general
elections. (The index peaked at 6188 in September 1999 and sat
around 5100 in mid-January.)
</P>
<P>
   Without a guard as vigilant as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, you can't rule out some stock manipulation to get
prices up to the target. It's a dangerous game, but PASOK might
find it's more dangerous to lose the election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether the party pulls off a victory or not, Greece will
join the EMU, since the opposition New Democracy Party also
supports entry.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the good wishes of other countries that want
to follow the Greek lead. The Czechs, Hungarians, and Poles all
imagine themselves carrying euros in the next five years. Even
Turkey sees itself joining the EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Could Greece ever abide this? Yes, because in order to
demonstrate the good behavior required for its own membership,
Greece had to act the better neighbor. So in December the
government, led by Costas Simitis, officially accepted Turkey as a
``candidate'' for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   With EMU entry no longer a pipe dream for Turkey and the like,
speculators may begin snapping up ``emerging Europe'' equities with
as much enthusiasm as they've done with those in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the cheers going, remember that Athens will host the
2004 Olympics. That will bring plenty of tourists and foreign
currency. Even if Greece wins no relay races or wrestling matches,
she will be a big winner in the spectacle. &QL;

ARAB WORLD TRIES TO PREPARE FOR ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTHERN
LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ In a new sign of Arab unease, officials here
warned Thursday that they could not, and would not, prevent
Palestinian militants from using Lebanese territory to mount
attacks on Israel once its army withdraws unilaterally from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Emile Lahoud, the Lebanese president, said ``daily miniwars''
could break out along the border with Israel unless the United
Nations disarmed the Palestinian refugees living in miserable camps
scattered across Lebanon _ and unless it actively prevented Israeli
retaliation against any Palestinian operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this disarming takes place or not,'' Lahoud said,
``what are the United Nations' guarantees that Israel will not
violate Lebanon's territorial and naval borders and its airspace or
carry out short-term attacks on the south and inside Lebanon?''
</P>
<P>
   The warning came in a rambling letter given to a U.N. envoy,
Terje Larsen, who met with Lahoud and other Lebanese officials
Thursday. Larsen is to go to the Syrian capital of Damascus on
Friday for more discussions about the planned Israeli withdrawal
and the possible role of U.N. forces in south Lebanon in connection
with the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which holds ultimate political and military power in
Lebanon, has maintained a stony silence in the weeks since Israel's
Cabinet endorsed the plan of Prime Minister Ehud Barak to end
Israel's 15-year occupation of a nine-mile-deep strip of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanese politicians, who generally take their cue from
Damascus, have reacted with a series of increasingly agitated
statements. This week, Defense Minister Ghazi Zueiter said Lebanon
might ask Syria to station its soldiers and missiles along the
border after a withdrawal. Syria immediately dismissed his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials have said an Israeli withdrawal would not meet
Lebanese demands unless one of three conditions was met: all
Palestinian refugees' being allowed to return to their homes;
Jerusalem's becoming the capital of a Palestinian state, or
Israel's abandoning Zionism. Those conditions were not part of the
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations, which broke down in mid-January
and have yet to be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   In adding a condition that Palestinian refugees in Lebanon be
disarmed, Lahoud brought up a particularly touchy subject for his
small country, which suffered through a long and bitter civil war
that began as a backlash against Palestinian militants operating
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than 15 years, Lebanese fought Lebanese and
Palestinians, Israel invaded and occupied parts of the country in a
drive to expel the Palestinians, and Syria moved its army into
Lebanon to battle Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Palestine Liberation Organization was eventually
forced out, some 400,000 Palestinian refugees remain in Lebanon.
They are not permitted to live outside their shabby camps, and all
of Lebanon's various political and religious factions vehemently
oppose giving them the privileges of permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army, with its many Christian and Muslim veterans
of the serial battles against Palestinians, does not even enter the
Palestinian camps. Syria, which has 35,000 soldiers in Lebanon, has
a few checkpoints outside of some camps, but it does not police
them either.
</P>
<P>
   The camps house a number of Palestinian factions that officially
reject the peace negotiations between the PLO leader, Yasser
Arafat, and Israel. But the leadership of those factions is based
in Damascus and relies on Syria, which for the past few years has
largely frozen subsidies and other support.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus Thursday, the Syrian vice president, Abdel-Halim
Khaddam, summoned the leader of one of the rejectionist factions,
George Habash, for a brief meeting. But many Lebanese do not
believe that Syria would unleash its Palestinian clients to provoke
a new conflict after an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria has no influence except over a very small number of
groups,'' said Hussein Husseini, a former Lebanese Parliament
speaker and Shiite Muslim leader. Palestinians in the refugee camps
do have weapons, he added, but disrupting the status quo by taking
them away would only end up destabilizing Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The military rulers of south Lebanon _ the Hezbollah militia _
also expressed ambivalence. Nawaf Mousawi, a senior member of the
Hezbollah political bureau, said Lebanon had a right to demand U.N.
help in controlling the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Lebanon going to assign a policeman for every person so
they don't move?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mousawi also indicated that Hezbollah _ supported by Syria
and hugely popular in the Arab world since it began to present
itself as a national resistance to Israel's occupation _ would not
actively aid in attacks on Israel once all of southern Lebanon was
in Lebanese hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's tension in the region, it could lead to an
explosion,'' he said, ``and it does not need Hezbollah
cooperation.''

&HT;     CONGRESS TO WEIGH NEW RULE FOR RYAN WHITE AIDS MONEY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress will be asked this week to change the way
the federal government spends $1.6 billion for AIDS care and
prevention, switching from a system that doles out dollars based on
full-blown AIDS cases toward one based on infection with the HIV
virus that leads to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials argue that it doesn't make sense to
continue distributing federal money to states, cities, U.S.
territories and health service organizations based on tallies of
AIDS cases because new medical breakthroughs have greatly prolonged
the HIV stage of the disease. The result is that federal funding
goes primarily to places where the disease first emerged, leaving
areas with newer outbreaks with less funding.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of such a switch would be to cut the amount of money
going to areas with longer histories of the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 people in the United States have AIDS, while
500,000 to 600,000 others are infected with the HIV virus but don't
yet have the usually fatal AIDS disease, according to estimates by
the federal Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an obstetrician who is introducing
legislation this week to authorize the switch, wants HIV _ not AIDS
_ to be the basis for federal funding by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to emphasize prevention and make sure the
dollars go where the disease is,'' Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn says states and cities with relatively new outbreaks _
especially rural areas _ are not getting needed government
financial support because it may take 10 or more years for someone
infected with HIV to develop AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn says places like San Francisco, where the epidemic hit
nearly two decades ago, ``get a disproportionate amount of money''
because they have a higher percentage of AIDS cases compared with
cases of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's legislation would amend the Ryan White Care Act which
empowers the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pay
for care and medications for people who aren't poor or sick enough
to receive Medicaid, but who don't have private insurance. The Ryan
White program is named after the hemophiliac teenager from Kokomo,
Ind., who contracted the disease through tainted blood and died in
1990 at age 19. The program serves about a half million people each
year and, since 1991, has distributed $6.4 billion to states and
local governments on the basis of a federal formula that counts
AIDS cases but not cases of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system that we built that provided the answers 10 years
ago, isn't providing the answers we need now,'' said Dr. Patricia
Fleming, chief of the HIV/AIDS Surveillance branch within CDC.
``The epidemic has changed and the surveillance system needs to
change too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said scientists know from clinical trials that people
with HIV are surviving longer and that both the incidence of AIDS
and the death rate have declined. However, the states don't know
how many HIV cases are not progressing to AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said she expects every state will have adopted an HIV
reporting system by the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires states to collect AIDS statistics from
healthcare providers. Any program that tracks HIV cases raises
concerns that the privacy of people with HIV could be placed in
jeopardy, harming their ability to remain productive and part of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control recommended last December that
state health officials report HIV cases as they now do with AIDS
cases. Currently, state health officials contact laboratories,
physicians and clinics to get reports of AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states and the Virgin Islands now record HIV cases by
patient name. New York announced last week that it will begin
reporting HIV cases by name in June. Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Vermont and Puerto Rico use ``unique identifier''
codes to report HIV cases. Pennsylvania, California and Oregon have
yet to develop systems for tracking HIV cases.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McClain, a public health consultant who chairs the Care
Coalition, a group that represents cities and clinics seeking more
federal money for care and treatment of people with HIV, said using
HIV data would provide a more accurate measure of the rate of
infection. AIDS data tends to be out of date and ``always talking
about the past,'' McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   But McClain said accurate data wouldn't be available until
states have developed HIV counting methods that would guarantee
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   McClain said many people with HIV are afraid that their health
status could be ``outed'' accidentally to employers or family
members if it is federally recorded. ``It's a legitimate fear,'' he
said. ``Many people with HIV fear losing their jobs and health
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain said people with HIV fear being ``ostracized, isolated,
rejected and disowned, all at a time when you've just discovered
that you have HIV or AIDS We all recognize that using HIV (counts)
nationally would be the best thing, but socially, politically and
technically it's just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kelly, deputy director of the National Alliance of States
and Territorial AIDS directors, said the ``current system for
distributing federal AIDS dollars is inadequate in reflecting the
breadth of the epidemic, but the catch is, we're just not there in
terms of having HIV reporting everywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get there soon, but we need to know that these
numbers are accurate and that we have confidence in our data
collection systems,'' Kelly said. ``When that happens, many of us
believe we should move to use HIV and AIDS as a basis for
distributing these Ryan White Care funds.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forcing a legal and political showdown over the
fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez, his father arrived
here Thursday to reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly impatient to have (Elian) returned to me as soon as
possible and go back to Cuba together, immediately,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzalez said after his arrival at Dulles International Airport,
outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Miami, talks broke down between U.S. immigration
officials and attorneys for the Miami relatives who have cared for
Elian since he was found floating on an inner-tube off the Fort
Lauderdale coast on Thanksgiving Day. His mother, who was divorced
from Juan Miguel, drowned along with 10 others after fleeing Cuba
for the United States in a 16-foot motor boat.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami family emerged after several hours of
negotiations Thursday expressing frustration and anger at federal
government insistence that Elian's custody be transferred from his
great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government rejected the standard of the best interest of
the child as the guiding principle,'' Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an
attorney for the family, said. ``The government will not guarantee
that it will not take Elian away, or try to take Elian away, in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not had his day in court,'' he added. ``This is a very,
very sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is expected to meet Friday with Attorney General Janet
Reno, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian seemed unaware of the new phase in the struggle
over his future. He played on a slide outside his great-uncle's
home and fired a toy gun as the usual horde of reporters and
photographers took note.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said he learned of his father's trip only hours before
it took place.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Miguel said in a ``message to the American people''
after he arrived Thursday morning with his wife and 6-month-old son
_ Elian's half-brother _ that he was traveling with Elian's ``true
family.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Miami relatives of exploiting his son and
demanded a halt to the ``endless confusing legal procedures'' that
have separated them.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez said he hoped to ``soon be able to embrace my
son'' after 137 days of what he described as cruel separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that the U.S. authorities will not allow my
child to continue to be hurt,'' Gonzalez said, adding that he still
hoped Elian's classmates, teachers and Cuban psychologists would be
allowed to come to this country to give him support while they wait
_ possibly months _ for a final federal appeals court decision.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokeswoman said Thursday no decision had
been reached on the request for 22 additional visas.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez' arrival in the United States increases the pressure on
the Clinton administration to resolve the thorny humanitarian,
legal and political issue that has drawn worldwide attention, and
caused the most recent conflict between the United States and the
Cuban regime of President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration
believes ``this is a positive step towards ultimately reuniting a
father with his son. That's what the courts have ruled. The father
coming here is a constructive way to facilitate that process.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS, declared early this year that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is
the only person legally authorized to speak for Elian on the
question of whether the child should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives last month lost a federal suit to
overturn the INS ruling and grant them authority to seek asylum on
the child's behalf. That decision has been appealed the 11th
Circuit Court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Justice Department has allowed the Miami relatives
to retain custody of Elian, but Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
told a Washington news conference Thursday that he expects the boy
to be reunited with his father ``in a relatively short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The father and the son need to be together and, in the coming
days, we will do everything we can to see that that happens,'' said
Holder, the father of a 6-year-old girl. ``I believe reuniting
Elian with his father is not only a matter of federal law . . . it
is simply the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday the delicate choreography over custody of the boy
remained jumbled, however.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives invited Juan Miguel to come to their
home to visit his son, but not take him away. Juan Miguel has
refused to go to Miami and instead insists that his son be brought
to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives also sought assurances that if Elian is
turned over to Juan Miguel, they will not to leave the country
until the appeal is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel has indicated, through his attorney, Gregory B.
Craig that he would remain in the United States until the appeals
court rules. But Garcia-Pedrosa noted that federal officials would
not guarantee that Juan Miguel would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel's family is staying at the residence of Fernando
Remirez, head of the Cuban Interests Section in nearby Bethesda,
Md. Remirez temporarily moved out of his home and waived its
diplomatic immunity, allegedly to lessen the appearance that the
father is under the control of communist Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, there was no movement on bills to grant Elian
either permanent residency status or U.S. citizenship. Both bills
would have the effect of removing the case from INS control and
putting it before a state family court. Vice President Al Gore
recently split with the Clinton administration in supporting the
permanent residency bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Miami, said she did
not anticipate any congressional action on the bills until the
appeals process has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen who spoke by telephone with Lazaro Gonzalez _ and
with Elian _ Thursday morning, described the Miami family as
``pretty dug in'' over their insistence that Juan Miguel come to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives also want Elian to be examined by three
psychologists to determine whether removing him _ particularly from
his cousin, 21-year-old Marisleysis Gonzalez who has been his
primary caretaker in the United States _ would be psychologically
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Miguel Gonzalez said his son ``has had to spend time
under the temporary custody of some distant relatives who had never
seen him before.'' He said the Miami relatives harassed Elian when
the father would call him from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his
personality,'' Juan Miguel said, speaking through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel also charged that ``Elian has been paraded and
exhibited in public rallies and by the media with a clear intent to
obtain political advantage from this tragedy.''

FOLLOW THE STEPS FOR REFORMATTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: For reformatting a hard drive, I have been told
that a CD of Windows 95 or 98 is needed, as well as a floppy with a
CD-ROM driver that's loaded first. Is this true? What is your
reformat procedure?
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean Sweep
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLEAN: First, I prepare a very large pitcher of extra-dry
martinis, because I know it's going to be an extremely long and
frustrating day. In fact, I've found that _ on more than one
occasion _ this approach results in me forgetting why reformatting
seemed like such a good idea to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Nuking your drive is a major undertaking, and you'd better be
prepared. Not only will you be wiping everything off your disk,
you'll have to reinstall Windows, then reload any application
programs, then hope you remembered to back up your data files so
you can stick them back on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   I usually start by making a big, long list of all the programs
I'm going to have to reload, and I make sure I have the
installation CDs or floppies in a safe place that I can find after
two martinis. My work space tends to degenerate into unfathomable
disarray the minute I start one of these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I start backing up installation files and data that exist
only on my hard drive. This is where a CD burner, a Zip drive or
tape backup comes in handy. In my case, I make a CD with everything
I could possibly need during the reinstallation process. Oh, I know
I'll probably forget something, but at least it's all in one spot.
If I can still find my Sharpie after martini No. 3, I label the CD
and stick it with my other installation materials.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the fun part. You'll be wiping out everything on the
hard drive, which includes the drivers that make your CD drive
work. Without those, you won't be able to reload Windows from the
CD. Luckily, Windows 98's Setup Disk utility (in Add/Remove
Programs in the Control Panel) will make a bootable floppy with
generic CD drivers on it. You'll also need to copy the file
Format.com to the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   Boot with the floppy, and make sure the CD drive is working.
About now, I'd freshen my martini, because there's no turning back.
At the A: prompt, type in Format C: /u and let 'er rip. Say so long
to everything on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   When the format finishes, you'll have a machine that's capable
of almost nothing. You still need to load the operating system,
Windows. Aren't you glad you made sure the CD drive was working?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the full version of Windows, too, not just the
upgrade. If you didn't get one, your manufacturer may have included
a restoration CD (it's supposed to make things just like they were
when you bought the computer) or some sort of utility that will
build a set of installation floppies.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Windows has finished installing itself, I'm usually
ready for a nice, long nap. Not because of that second pitcher of
martinis, of course. I simply realize that after I get my Internet
and network stuff working again I'll be spending about a day
downloading and installing Windows updates and the latest drivers
for all my hardware.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, it's time to start reloading all my programs and
data. I think that calls for another martini. I know what you're
thinking, but I can quit reformatting any time I want to.

 &HT;    400 flag protesters arrive in South Carolina capital
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A five-day march that started 120 miles away in
Charleston to protest the Confederate battle flag flying over the
Statehouse dome culminated Thursday in a contest of sloganeering
and posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who organized the Get
in Step with the People of South Carolina March, displayed bumper
stickers demanding ``Take It Down.'' Riley and an estimated 400
marchers arrived about noon on the south side of the Capitol, where
they were greeted by Gov. Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   On the north side of the Capitol, hundreds of Confederate battle
flags _ with the distinctive blue X and white stars criss-crossing
over a bright red background _ flew in opposition to Riley and
Hodges. A small plane towed a banner: Keep the Flag. Dump Riley and
Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Joining those opposed to flying the flag over the Statehouse was
former Gov. David Beasley, who stood on the Capitol steps with
Riley. A Republican, Beasley lost to Hodges in 1998, partly because
he urged legislators to move the battle emblem to historic grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, as South Carolinians, move forward and get this issue
resolved, and we must move the flag from the dome,'' Hodges told
the crowd. ``I don't know about you, but frankly I'm tired of the
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the march, neither chamber in the state Legislature had
made progress on bills before them that would remove the
controversial Civil War emblem from flying over the Statehouse
dome.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, the state Senate took a small step and
agreed to set a flag bill on priority status for floor debate,
possibly on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the march Thursday, Senate Majority Leader
John Land, a Democrat from Manning, said he's optimistic a
compromise will be worked out before the June 1 adjournment and
that it will include die-hard flag supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will end quicker than you think,'' Land said. ``I think
the march must have had some effect. Here's a man who walked 120
miles. That had to have an impact. David Beasley was up there. You
talk about healing. That's very symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Land said he's certain the compromise will be supported by
Republican Glenn McConnell, a Charleston senator and one of the
staunchest flag backers. If McConnell does come on board with a
compromise, ``It'll be over,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   The state House has vowed to debate nothing until the Senate
sends it a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is beginning to become a major factor,'' said House
Speaker David Wilkins. The Greenville Republican has been pressured
to move the flag by Michelin and BMW, two of the top businesses in
his district. ``I'm still hopeful we can work something out. But I
also know the clock is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, the national NAACP formally launched a
tourism boycott of South Carolina. The NAACP said the boycott,
which was begun by the state chapter last summer, has cost the
state at least $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Convention and visitor bureaus in the state have reported losses
of nearly $10 million in canceled meetings, though tourism
officials say exact numbers on the boycott's impact are impossible
to calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Among those demonstrating Thursday in support of flying the flag
was Pamela Ridings, a 47-year-old secretary from Columbia, who held
up a homemade sign: God Save the South. She complained that outside
groups, namely the NAACP, are unduly pressuring South Carolina
lawmakers to bow to their wishes. Further, she said retirees from
up North are trying to change the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not from up there,'' Ridings said. ``Don't take over our
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridings, whose face turned pink in the bright noon sun, said few
of the South Carolinians who fought in the Civil War actually owned
slaves and were just ``working stiffs like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other counterprotesters gathered Thursday, 37-year-old
James Boland said the flag is part of the South's heritage. He
dressed in a $300 wool replica of the cadet blue uniform worn by
Confederate generals and waved a battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides were American,'' said Boland, who took a day off
from his job of making fishing line for a local manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Riley told the crowd that the
heritage of the flag comes from a time long, long ago that is no
longer part of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he received an unsigned letter that promised to put
him in a gunsight. Another protester, the mayor said, displayed a
bumper sticker that read ``John Rocker for President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not heritage, that is hate,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Winston McCuen, 38, drove from Greenville in support of the
flag. A private school in Greenville fired him from his job as an
American history professor because he refused to remove a small
battle flag from his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina has a history of resisting tyranny,'' said
McCuen, now a welder. He carried a $10 rebel flag with the logo ``I
ain't coming down.'' McCuen hung his flag from a flagstaff made of
metal wiring conduit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of being put down by our overlords in Washington
and here in Columbia,'' McCuen said.

CONSULTANT BAIN IN E-COMMERCE VENTURE CAPITAL PARTNERSHIP

<P>
   BOSTON _ The consulting firm Bain &AMP; Co. has formed a partnership
with venture capital giants Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers to
help large non-US companies expand into e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called eVolution Global Partners, will be based in
London. James Allen, former director of Bain's London office, will
be CEO of the new group.
</P>
<P>
   Bain and Silicon Valley's Kleiner Perkins will invest equally in
the new company, along with some partners of Texas Pacific Group, a
Fort Worth-based private equity investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   John Donahoe, worldwide managing director of Bain, said there's
huge demand from consulting clients for strategies on getting onto
the Web. The firm aims to help multinational companies take
advantage of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Bain side, we have been hearing from our clients for a
year on how to best leverage their assets . . . to use the power of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kleiner Perkins, the renowned venture capital shop, this is
a first foray overseas. Brook Byers, a partner at the firm, said
the joint venture is the best way for Kleiner Perkins to take
advantage of opportunities in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, senior editor of the Private Equity Analyst in
Wellesley, said the Silicon Valley cowboys are attempting to take
their business to Europe now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do Europe right, you'd better have an
office there _ and have people who know how things work there,''
Barry said. While Kleiner brings its know-how in start-up
businesses and technology to this new venture, he said, it's also
``a way for Kleiner to get a foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pacific is experienced in leveraged buyouts and
large-scale transactions, Barry said. The firm also has experience
overseas, as does Bain, which consults to companies around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is unusual in that it melds consulting and
investment interests. Consultants have increasingly been jumping
into the venture business on their own. Andersen Consulting and
Deloitte &AMP; Touche have both launched large venture funds. Bain
itself has an incubator for start-ups, bainlab.

LATE EASTER TRIMS MARCH RETAIL GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of this year's late Easter US retailers eked out one of
their smallest monthly gains since 1996, but most analysts said
they found little hard evidence in March retail sales that
consumers have reined in their free-spending ways.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in April. Higher gas prices, higher interest
rates, and a gyrating stock market could persuade consumers to
delay some purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, ``there's not one scintilla of evidence that
consumer spending is slowing down,'' said Kurt Barnard, president
of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   At Talbots Inc., known for classic women's apparel, March sales
at stores open at least a year were up a whopping 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Talbots said Thursday it expects its first-quarter
earnings to exceed Wall Street's estimates. Now some analysts think
Talbots could beat last year's first-quarter earnings by 40
percent. On the New York Stock Exchange, Talbots shares rose
$2.3125 to close at $60.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Talbots customers remain ``enthusiastic about our spring line,''
said president and chief executive Arnold B. Zetcher.
</P>
<P>
   Not all that long ago, Talbots was routinely disappointing
investors; now Talbots is exceeding Wall Street's expectations on a
regular basis, said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus Group, a luxury retailer, also had a big month.
Sales at stores open at least a year were up 16.3 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Easter, a big shopping event, fell three weeks
earlier, and that meant strong sales in March.
</P>
<P>
   With Easter coming on April 23 this year, most Easter shopping
is expected to occur this month. To get a true picture of spring
retail sales, the two months of March and April need to be looked
at together and compared with the same two-month period last year,
said PaineWebber analyst Richard E. Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this year's March sales looked somewhat anemic
in comparison to March 1999, but analysts warned against jumping to
conclusions until April numbers are available.
</P>
<P>
   In gauging consumer spending, retail analysts look to a measure
called same-store sales _ that is, sales at stores open at least a
year.
</P>
<P>
   At BJ's Wholesale Club Inc., March same-store sales rose 4.4
percent, boosted by brisk demand for spring seasonal merchandise,
jewelry, housewares, computer equipment, and health and beauty
aids, said president and chief executive Jack Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   The TJX Cos., which operate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, saw
same-store sales rise 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the late Easter, TJX chairman and chief executive Bernard
Cammarata said, ``We look forward to a very strong first quarter
and remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees Inc., the discount department store chain, said March
same-store sales fell 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Easter shift, Bradlees expected sales to be lower
this March, said Peter Thorner, Bradlees chairman and chief
executive. ``When taken together, we believe that March and April
sales results will reflect the continued growth and strength of our
business.''

BLEDSOE FIELDS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He does not own a car dealership or a
restaurant. Drew Bledsoe's outside activity is the Drew Bledsoe
Foundation, a nonprofit education organization that focuses on good
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Its offices are now in Rodman Park, about one mile south of
Foxboro Stadium, where Thursday Bledsoe became the first big-name
professional athlete to begin an Internet service provider
(Bledsoenet.com), with most of the proceeds going to fund the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While Bledsoe also commented on issues such as the Patriots' new
uniforms, the new offense, the team, and his contract, the day was
really to launch his business venture. There's an ironic twist to
the venture. Bledsoe was burned by the very medium that he is now a
part of _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Late last season, an Internet rumor concerning his personal life
was picked up by local radio stations, which caused the quarterback
considerable anguish and led him to wonder how a rumor could
suddenly be legitimized in the mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with the Internet was a bit uncomfortable to say
the least,'' said Bledsoe. ``You can't control what is out there
and what your children have access to. That's a major reason we
started Bledsoenet.com, so that parents of young kids can have a
certain level of comfort knowing what they have access to is
filtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you can't control everything that comes across. We
will specifically filter out pornography, bomb-making recipes,
hate-crime type of things. They'll be filtered out through our
filtering service. The second reason is to fund our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, flanked by foundation CEO Don Berube, said the filtered
service would cost $19.95 per month while unfiltered service would
cost $17.95. Start up will be explained on the Bledsoenet.com Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Berube said the service would soon provide DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my kids grow up, I'd like to have some certainty and
comfort that Stu (Bledsoe's oldest son) can't just pull up porno
sites and bomb-making recipes,'' said Bledsoe. ``There are many
other ways he'll get into trouble without having easy access to
anything he wants to get to. The filtering service is done through
a third party which is updated hourly, and they're constantly
filtering out sites that are not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proactive reaction to what happened to me. If
somebody is going to send out an e-mail starting rumors about
somebody, we're obviously not going to be able to control that. But
what happened to me last year was eye-opening in that while the
Internet is a great resource, and while it is the wave of the
future, there are downsides to it in that everybody can put
anything out there. This was important to me as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rumor surfaced, Bledsoe threatened to sue those who
broadcast it, but now says that's less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe considered himself a ``computer nerd'' when he was in
college, but he said he got away from it until his wife, Maura,
bought him a laptop for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's currently trying to enroll some of his teammates,
and has already taken much ribbing. He said right guard Todd Rucci
now writes ``ToddRucci(at)Bledsoenet.com'' on his e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his full-time job, Bledsoe said he likes the new
uniforms (darker blue) and added there's even a ``Monday Night
Football'' uniform that would include the navy blue jersey and navy
blue pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said there was nothing new with his contract extension
and said, ``The contract I signed I'm perfectly happy to play that
out. There are no monetary reasons to redo it, but if it gives us
more leeway to signing free agents, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His preliminary meeting with new offensive coordinator Charlie
Weis has also given him reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have more formations, spread the field out more
on early downs, and what that does is spread the defense out,''
Bledsoe said. ``That will allow me to determine what the defense is
trying to do to me right away. When you're in a base formation, the
defenses can give you all of their exotic coverages and all their
disguises. When you spread the field, they have to declare what
they're going to do. Hopefully it'll help our running game a little
bit.''

&HT;     CENSUS OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MAIL-IN RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Census Bureau officials said Thursday they will
meet and possibly exceed their goal of a 61 percent mail-in
response to the forms they sent to 120 million households last
month.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, the response stood at 58 percent. The bureau has
set a minimum goal of 61 percent and a maximum target of 70 percent
before Census officials begin making house calls to non-respondents
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public debate about privacy and the personal nature of
some questions, the response was higher than at the comparable time
in 1990, when 49 percent of the public had responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting, hoping that by the weekend we will cross the
61 percent mark,'' Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt told a
House Appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic that we will get better than 65
percent,'' Edison Gore, the bureau's assistant division chief for
field programs, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   However, criticism of the 53-item questionnaire that was mailed
to 20 million households may have lowered the return rate for those
forms.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks several Republican leaders have objected to
census questions that some of their constituents had complained
about, particularly those on the long form.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential
nominee, said last week he might not answer all of the questions on
the long form if it were mailed to him. And Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., encouraged people to leave blank any questions
they felt invaded their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, 60 percent of the recipients of the
six-question short form had responded while 48 percent had returned
the long form. In 1990, the last census, 66 percent answered the
short form and 60 percent returned the long form.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-in responses have declined dramatically from 1970, when 80
percent responded. The bureau chose the 61 percent response target
for this year based on an expectation of further declining rates,
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials privately expressed concern in March that they
might not meet the minimum target, but are now heartened by the
response so far.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bureau projected a lower response than in 1990,
it challenged cities and states to encourage residents to
participate in the census. The census is used as a basis for
apportioning federal aid and in congressional districting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 census forms were mailed on March 23 and officials began
door-to-door visits for non-respondents on April 26. This year
mailings began March 13 and officials will begin to canvass homes
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 21 days remained until census workers begin
their visits. In 1990, with the same number of days remaining
before the home visits, the response rate was 49 percent.

downtown Phoenix. Two girls with butterfly wings, blue body paint
and not much else stand on the sidewalk waiting for the doors to
open for the rave. They are joined by other teenagers and young
adults. The scent of clove cigarettes fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Cottier passes out bottles of water with labels that read
``Without love there is nothing,'' and include the Urban Ministry
of Sound's e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, is that free water? Can I have one?'' asks a guy with a
stud just below his lip. They stop and talk. Cottier gives the guy,
who just moved from Seattle, a bottle of water and his phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   For Cottier and the rest of the Valley techno musicians and
deejays who make up the Urban Ministry of Sound, this is the way to
Jesus. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, Cottier and the others go where most
wear-a-tie-to-church people would be uncomfortable _ bars, skate
parks and raves _ to play their music, pass out water and make
friends.
</P>
<P>
   They all have day jobs but their music is good _ mixes by
Cottier and Gilbert have hit the top spots on secular and Christian
dance charts here and in Europe, and the songs have been featured
on CD compilations.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Harold and Geoff Wilcoxin, who perform original electronic
keyboard music as mint, are working on a contract with a secular
recording company. NSoul Records will be producing and distributing
an album of dance music from all the members of Urban Ministry of
Sound through such outlets as Target and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath their rhythms is a desire to build real friendships
with the teens and young adults, and let them know this: Jesus
loves you no matter what you look like or what kind of music you
like.
</P>
<P>
   The group spent more than a year finding its niche. Dance
parties were held at some Valley churches, but church officials
didn't appreciate the drinking and smoking in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are in several venues, mostly secular. None of the
music is ``Christian,'' but it is positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got the idea that God wanted us to go to the people
instead of coaxing them to come to us,'' Cottier says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's idea of a Christian is Channel 21,'' he says,
referring to the Christian TV station.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are anything but Channel 21. Outside the rave Cottier
gives out water while inside Wilcoxin and Harold play.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Routh, 19, of Mesa likes mint and says it doesn't matter
if the group is Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they feel good about their music and as long as
they are into the grooves and everyone else can feel it, that's all
it takes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Ministry of Sound's ideas of love and acceptance play well
with the scene, where the crowd is used to insults _ like the punk
rockers on Mill Avenue _ from the established church.
</P>
<P>
   Some pastors are beginning to see the value in this kind of
ministry, says Scott Blackwell, a deejay/mixer/producer who founded
NSoul Records and is president of MYX, a Christian dance label. He
lives in LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are starting to realize the gap between the church and
youth culture is so wide that they need to rethink
evangelization,'' he says. ``The real ministry comes with the
lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Urban Ministry of Sound are popping up all over the
country, the second generation of musicians who first pioneered
dance music in the Christian community over protests the music was
the devil's beat, Blackwell says.
</P>
<P>
   The going is slow, but Urban Ministry of Sound has seen some
results, as in this e-mail from a Goth kid in New Mexico: ``You
said that Jesus's love is the only thing that mattered. You were so
right and you knew that if I accepted him then the other garbage
would fall away. I have even begun to use my real name again.
Talked to my parents last weekend, first time in four months.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth Sunday of the month, the Urban Ministry of Sound
hosts an X-treme Worship Service at Lifeline Community Church in
Phoenix. Except for the lyrics and the absence of cigarette smoke,
the beat and the lighting invoke the atmosphere of a dance party.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different experience for those who didn't think church
could be hip.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the music at the skate park, some boys from a
group home have attended services there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cool with them. They don't have to be us. They don't
have to act like us,'' says Dorie Anderson, Lifeline's associate
pastor for youth, college and career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, these are the kids who need the help the most,
and there's nobody who will relate to them and touch their lives.
They are too shook up about the paraphernalia and the piercings.
That has nothing to do with the person.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the hope of Urban Ministry of Sound: More churchgoers
will be accepting and more people who have given up on their
parents' God will find a God.
</P>
<P>
   In Heaven, says Cottier, ``I could see this totally
purple-haired, body-pierced guy saying, `Man, you don't know me but
. . .'' &QL;

   Throughout the Phoenix area, growth is outpacing the telephone
infrastructure.

 &HT;    BREAK DOWN IN TALKS, FATHER'S ARRIVAL LEAVE MIAMI FAMILY LITTLE
BARGAINING ROOM
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0407.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A day that began with hopes for a compromise sparked by
the dramatic arrival of Elian Gonzalez's father in the U.S. ended
with another tense stand-off as the Miami relatives of the
6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor refused to meet federal demands
to turn the boy over voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has made the decision that they will . . .
change custody to the father even though the government has never
even spoken to the boy or had the boy evaluated by psychologists,''
said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the Miami family. ``What
the government has decided is a very dangerous thing for this
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials made no immediate comment after
their five days of talks with the family's lawyers broke down with
no agreement. They have insisted, however, that Elian will be
placed in his father's custody, with or without the help of the
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   News of the impasse sent a stir through a crowd of about 100
protestors gathered outside the Little Havana home where Elian has
been living with his Miami relatives. Late in the day, a convoy of
dump trucks descended on the neighborhood, blocking some streets,
while about 50 women and children formed a human chain in front of
the house, vowing not to let federal officials take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said they purposefully excluded men from the
group to avoid any angry confrontations near the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sit on the ground and they will have to drag me out,''
vowed Doris Salazar, 51, who joined the protest earlier in the day.
``People in this country don't understand that he's not going back
to his father. He's going back to (Cuban President) Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But any attempt to take Elian from the home likely won't come
immediately. With federal officials reluctant to confront the
protestors, the stage seemed set for further legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said that without the family's
cooperation, they would probably send a letter very soon informing
the family that they plan to transfer Elian to his father. A second
letter would then tell the family when and where they should
deliver the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyers might respond by asking the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to block the action until their lawsuit
over the case is resolved. The court is scheduled to hear arguments
in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the day, one of the Miami family's attorneys held
out hopes for a different scenario _ letting the family meet
without the boy, or lawyers _ to try to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the lawyers and the government to walk away and
let the family sit down and discuss what is in Elian's best
interests,'' said Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for the Miami
family. ``We're hoping that (Elian's father) Juan Miguel will agree
to do this at any location.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business at such a meeting would be to
heal the wounds from the increasingly heated rhetoric the two sides
of the family have exchanged in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Castro announced that Juan Miguel Gonzalez might
soon come to the United States, lawyers for the family aired
accusations that he had abused Elian in telephone conversations by
telling him his mother was still alive and waiting for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother drowned with 10 other people after the boat they
were using to flee Cuba sank. The boy was one of only a few
survivors, and was rescued Thanksgiving Day off the For Lauderdale
coast.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in Washington early Thursday, Elian's father also
blasted the Miami relatives, saying they have paraded his son
before the media and subjected him to a long television interview
without the father's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his personality
already weakened by the terrible trauma,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez remained in the Washington, D.C. area Thursday, staying
at the home of a top Cuban diplomat. He planned to meet Friday with
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, Commissioner
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami talks broke down when immigration officials refused to
budge on the family's demands, insisting that the only option is to
turn the boy over. The family's main demands were that Elian be
evaluated by a team of psychologists who would decide what is best
for him, and that the boy's father promise he would not take Elian
back to Cuba before the court appeal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he would remain in this country until the
appeal is heard, but federal officials say there is no legal
obligation that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Pedrosa seemed outraged at the refusal of federal
officials to compromise, saying ``they would not even promise not
to come to try to take the boy in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment seemed sure to stir an even more determined vigil
among Miami's exiles.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said the words were a sign of the family's
increasing desperation _ and narrowing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only leverage the family has is political pressure,''
Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami immigration attorney, told reporters.
``All the chips are in INS's hands.''

   But legal experts said the words were a sign of the family's
increasing desperation _ and narrowing options.

   ``The only leverage the family has is political pressure,''
Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami immigration attorney, told reporters.
``All the chips are in INS's hands.''

EASING NATIONAL SECURITY RULES, ISRAEL IMPROVES ITS HUMAN RIGHTS
RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Justice Minister Yossi Beilin calls it a ``quiet
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Israel has earned a regular place on the
blacklists of many human and civil rights organizations by invoking
national security to explain practices that were considered
exclusionary, discriminatory and coercive toward Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   But since Israel's right-wing government was replaced last
summer by a broad coalition including several leftists and human
rights advocates, crucial policy changes have been made that
together with a spate of High Court decisions, point toward a sea
change.
</P>
<P>
   The torture of Palestinian suspects has been banned. The
practice of stripping Palestinians of their residency rights in
East Jerusalem has all but ended. In a landmark ruling, the equal
right of Arabs to land allocated by the state has been affirmed.
And for the first time in Israel's history, land long considered
part of a Jewish town was taken away and returned to the Arab
village from which it was expropriated decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Palestinian administrative detainees, those
imprisoned without charges, has plummeted to 9 from 66 last April
and hundreds in previous years. On Wednesday, Israel released one
of 16 remaining Lebanese who are being held, in contravention of
international law, as ``bargaining chips'' for captured Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is almost a stealth liberalization process, an
incremental phenomenon rather than a declared program. Committed to
peace, Israel is dropping several policies that it justified by its
near perpetual state of armed conflict with its neighbors. As it
undergoes normalization, many say, Israel is slowly letting down
its guard, losing its fear and relinquishing a sense of itself as a
special nation living under such special circumstances that it
cannot be judged by the norms applied to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``During war, democracy can be more restricted,'' said Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident and human
rights champion. ``But we are not at war. We are engaged in a peace
process, and we are trying to live a more normal life. That means
dealing with questions we have avoided answering for years. That
means removing inequality in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of normalization is incremental, and it involves the
shedding of deep-seated anxieties and ingrained habits. Some
Israeli Arab lawmakers, critics of Israel's settlement policies and
Palestinian leaders say that Israel still has a long way to go.
They point to continued abuses by border police officers, to the
continued expropriation of Arab land, to habitual discrimination in
education, employment and housing.
</P>
<P>
   But Beilin, who like Sharansky is a leading catalyst of the
change, said the process was an evolution. He is working to
eliminate the underlying legal justification for Israel's
self-definition as a special-case society.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry is preparing the groundwork to end by this
summer a 52-year-old legal state of emergency, which has given the
Israeli cabinet the power to supersede the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said he thinks that it has taken Israelis many years to
internalize the peace process. ``And then it began to happen,'' he
said. ``And we said to ourselves, `We are approaching peace, and we
still have a legal system that acts as if it were in a state of
war. And it justifies things that are no longer, if they ever were,
justifiable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli Arab leaders say mainstream Israelis see as
groundbreaking some events that appear to them to be token or
trivial _ like the recent employment of four Arab flight attendants
by El Al, or the crowning last year of the first Arab woman as Miss
Israel. Enough rage is still bubbling in their communities to have
fueled a strident Land Day protest last week, after which an
elderly woman died and her fellow villagers instantly asserted _
despite the hospital's denial _ that her death was caused by
exposure to the Israeli troops' tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   But other changes, even unofficial ones, are undeniably
fundamental, changes that reflect a relaxation of Israel's
eternally security-conscious attitudes toward territory and the use
of force.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of illegal homes of Arabs in East Jerusalem and
the West Bank, for instance, has declined sharply since Prime
Minister Ehud Barak took office in July, according to statistics
kept by the Btselem human rights organization. In East Jerusalem,
all the demolitions since November were done by the municipality,
which is run by a right-wing mayor, and none by the national
government, which also has the authority.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an official policy change, which could provoke
intense political debate, but a quiet change in practice _ like a
recent freeze in the authorization of new settlement construction
and in the paving of ``bypass roads'' that connect settlements to
Israel, circumventing Palestinian towns. Settler leaders say none
of the 60 or 70 construction permits requested recently were
authorized, although construction authorized by Benjamin Netanyahu
when he was prime minister has not been frozen, infuriating the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation began under Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated prime
minister, and went into abeyance during the anti-liberal tenure of
Netanyahu, experts say. It began picking up steam again when the
election of Prime Minister Barak, who reinvigorated the peace
effort, emboldened the High Court and even politicians who served
in the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the High Court stunned Israel by handing down a
decision to outlaw brutal methods used by Israeli security agents
during the interrogation of Palestinian suspects. Since then,
Amnesty International experts say, while there are reports of
isolated cases and some evidence that the use of solitary
confinement has increased, the systematic use of torture has indeed
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, in the ensuing political debate, when right-wing
lawmakers proposed circumventing the court with legislation
permitting the use of torture, several centrist legislators
publicly revealed a new sensitivity to Israel's image. Ophir
Pines-Paz, who heads the One Israel faction, brought to the
Parliament floor a briefcase filled with letters from around the
world urging Israel not to ``go backward.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the High Court is supposedly above the political fray, its
rulings, and the timing of their release, appear to be affected by
the political climate, many say. Legal experts think the court had
sidestepped an overarching ruling on the torture issue for years.
Chief Justice Aharon Barak had written in 1997 that it was a
``grave mistake'' to view human rights issues in times of war and
emergency as similar to those in times of peace. That was the
prevailing attitude of the court for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the torture decision revealed a fundamental
evolution of Israel from ``a defense state to a much more open and
internally dynamic society,'' as Yaron Ezrahi, a political
scientist, said. ``The Israeli society,'' he continued, ``is in a
process of demobilization, reflecting its sense of security,
militarily and economically. The fact that it is willing to give up
its practice of using these torture methods indicates that security
is no longer invoked as the be all and the end all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased, of course. Several right-wing lawmakers
think that such thinking is just denial, and that recent court
decisions and new policies will be self-defeating for Israel.
``Israel is still fighting for its very existence as a state and
for the very existence of its people against the possibility of a
new Jewish holocaust,'' said Yuval Steinitz, a lawmaker from the
opposition Likud Party. ``If anyone here thinks different, he
deludes himself.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers oppose Beilin's move to end the state of
emergency for that reason _ because the state of emergency, they
say, is a chronic one.
</P>
<P>
   But Beilin, supported by many others here, disagrees, arguing
that ``we shouldn't be screaming `fire' every day.'' In the case of
a genuine emergency, the government always retains the power to
declare one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A panoply of laws, from those regulating the permitted uses of
baking powder to those permitting administrative detention, are
technically emergency provisions. Striking workers are ordered back
to work, as happened with lifeguards last year, under a legal
mechanism designed for quick governmental response during actual
war. When tens of thousands of Russian immigrants poured into
Israel, the government used the emergency regulations to circumvent
planning boards and building procedures and slap up inexpensive and
often shoddily constructed housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about being a real democracy, this is a
basic flaw in the structure,'' said Anat Scolnicov, a civil rights
lawyer. ``The executive branch has the constant power to overtake
and overturn the legislative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're running a country on the premise that, technically,
anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other recent decisions, or new practices, show that security is
not the sacred cow it once was here. In the last few years, the
identity of the security chiefs, always top secret, has become
public, and the recent process of nominating a new General Security
Services director was even publicly debated. The Justice Ministry
is seeking to create open government oversight of security agency's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Several army decisions, formerly sacrosanct, have been
overturned by the courts and the government in the last few months.
Facing unrelenting pressure from environmentalists, Prime Minister
Barak, who is also the defense minister, recently overrode an army
plan to build a base in the Shaked Forest. It was the first time
that a popular revolt interfered with the army's construction
plans. And the High Court recently ordered the army to return some
Palestinian cave dwellers to their homes; they had been evicted
from what was termed a firing range, even though it was not in use.
</P>
<P>
   After the High Court decision on torture, the ground shifted
again when, despite right-wing protests, Israeli Arab lawmakers
were appointed to security-sensitive government positions. Then
Sharansky halted the Israeli practice of stripping Palestinians in
East Jerusalem of their residency if they had moved the center of
their life elsewhere for seven years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that the phenomenon, which human rights group
had called a ``silent deportation'' and Palestinians considered
``ethnic cleansing,'' has essentially ended. Fifty-five
Palestinians lost their residency rights last June, the month
before Prime Minister Barak took office, and only three in
December, the last month for which statistics are available.
Additionally, Sharansky recently decided to make his policy
retroactive and return residency rights to some of the thousands
who lost them.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky has surprised many here, because he is a hard-liner on
the peace effort. But he explains his positions as consistent. He
does not trust peacemaking with undemocratic partners who do not
respect human rights, he said, and he is determined to raise
Israel's standards of democracy as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical decision, Sharansky returned to Kfar Kassem,
an Arab village, some land that had been confiscated ``for security
reasons'' in the 1950s. This involved taking the land, which is
zoned for an industrial park, away from the Jewish town of Rosh
Ha'ayin.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, in addition to being the first of its kind,
reverberated here because of the history of the village. Israeli
border guards massacred 49 Arab villagers in Kfar Kassem in 1956,
and this year, for the first time, in another sign of the changes,
the massacre is included in the Israeli history curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here see it as an anti-Zionist move,'' Sharansky
said. ``I think we can no longer justify those lands being
confiscated for security reasons. It's a rather safe area. And this
village deserves an industrial park, the jobs and the tax benefits,
as much as Rosh Ha'ayin. If you want to have a stable, normal,
democratic Zionist society, you have to give minimal rights, at the
least.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a watershed legal decision, the High Court ruled
that a Jewish community on state land may not exclude Arab
residents. Speaking to the heart of Israel's complicated definition
as a Jewish, democratic state, the court said the country's
identity as a refuge for Jews cannot be used as a basis for
discriminating against any of its citizens. It cited the the U.S.
Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation
decision, saying separate but equal is a policy that inherently
hurts the minority.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dan Yakir, legal adviser to the Association for Civil Rights in
Israel, said that in an informal hearing two years ago, Chief
Justice Barak fretted about the ``unforeseen ramifications'' of a
such a decision. The justice urged the parties to settle the matter
among themselves, to find a way to allow the plaintiffs, an Arab
family, to moved into the Jewish community of Katzir.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Yakir said, the judge added, ``Imagine if
Brown vs. the Board of Ed had been solved by mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mediation failed, and with one of the justices presiding in
the case slated to retire this spring, the court was forced to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the change of government eased the way for such a
decision, because it was clear that at least the government would
not attack the court,'' Yakir said. ``Also, that the change in
government reflected a growing tolerance in society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another change in government, back to the right, could once
again slow the process. Or, in the volatile Middle East, anything
that once again raises the anxiety level in Israel _ a spate of
fatal terrorism or a border war _ could retard it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But most here, both those opposed and supportive, think that
there is a kind of inexorable evolution taking place, a willful, if
in some cases tentative, hike toward normalization.

 &HT;    CLINTON HOSTS CARTERS DURING NOSTALGIC WHITE HOUSE EVENING
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One leader's trip down memory lane was another's
glimpse into the not-too-distant future Wednesday night when
President Clinton hosted former President Jimmy Carter for a
private dinner and a personal tour at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by his wife Rosalynn and their daughter Amy, Carter
dropped in with half a dozen of the couple's 13 grandchildren in
tow to take them on a long-promised walk-through of the Georgians'
former digs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was so taken by the assemblage that he spent nearly two
hours with the Carter clan _ deferring a flight to his new private
residence in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton overnighted in Chappaqua with First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who is spending most of her time in New York campaigning
for a U.S. Senate seat, before returning to the White House on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   President and Mrs. Carter, meanwhile, slept at the White House
in what must have been a nostalgic visit to the place they lived in
from 1977 until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finally lifted off of the White House lawn aboard
Marine One, the presidential helicopter, Clinton received a unique
send-off: the Carter entourage waving from the balcony above the
portico overlooking the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Carter had promised his grandchildren a tour of the
residence and the White House, and the president, I think, hung
around a little bit later than expected last night to make sure
that he could lead it
</P>
<P>
   personally,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters _ some of whom stood by looking at their
watches the previous night before Clinton's long-delayed departure
_ Lockhart shrugged, ``Yeah, well, it's a big building.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, dressed in a blue check shirt, dark blazer and gray
slacks, and Mrs. Carter, in a tan trench coat, had plenty of time
to amble about their former quarters.
</P>
<P>
   No official notetakers were on hand, but it's hard to imagine
that the subject of life after the presidency wasn't on both men's
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has distinguished himself in his presidential afterlife
with global missions centered on peacekeeping, democratization and
ridding the developing world of disease and hunger. He's provided
an ambitious template for Clinton, who has yet to crystallize his
own plans for life after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said he's started to appreciate the role
ex-presidents play in American culture,'' one White House official
said, conceding that the subject was a likely topic of conversation
between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   It's probable also that the group lingered over rooms and
furnishings that connect the two administrations, perhaps none more
so than the 19th Century walnut conference table used by both men
for signings of historic Mideast peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had the table _ commissioned by President Ulysses S.
Grant _ hauled out to the front lawn bordering Pennsylvania Ave.
for the inking of the Israeli-Egyptian Camp David accords in 1979.
Clinton placed it on the South Lawn for the signing of
Israeli-Palestinian agreements in 1993, and again the next year for
an Israeli-Jordanian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton treated the Carters to an impromptu dinner in the White
House solarium, a room on the private third-floor of the
presidential living quarters. Favored by Mrs. Clinton for reading
and study, the airy room was dubbed the ``sky parlor'' early last
century by former First Lady Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter's own marks can still be seen. An active advocate of
the American arts, she was instrumental in securing the private
donations of some two dozen paintings still hanging in the White
House. On her watch, also, workers began carefully chipping away at
42 coats of paint that had begun to obscure hand carvings in much
of the stone work there.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Clinton and Carter _ the only two Democrats to
occupy the White House over the past three decades _ have been
strained at times.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a devout Christian who still teaches Sunday school in
his tiny hometown of Plains, Ga., has a personal image somewhat
different from that of Clinton, whose relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky threw the institution into 15
months of turmoil and impeachment proceedings that ended with his
acquittal last year.

&HT;     CITY RELEASES DETAINEES AFTER DEADLY CLASH AT COLLEGE CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ Fifteen college students, teachers and
administrators were released from jail here late Thursday after a
clash with police that left one officer dead and several other
people wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, hundreds of students at the Matamoros Institute of
Technology were rallying on the campus in preparation for a march
on City Hall to demand the release of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Matamoros officials meeting at City Hall had given little
indication they would release the detainees. They said they turned
the investigation of Wednesday's confrontation over to the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city government demands strict application of the law, and
it will support totally any decision by the state,'' Matamoros
Mayor Homar Zamorano Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the attorney general's office could not be
reached for comment. Zamorano said he regretted the events of
Wednesday evening, when, he alleged, a large group of police
officers was attacked by students on the campus resulting what the
authorities said was the beating death of the policeman, identified
as Manuel Davila Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was not available reached for comment after students
were released.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the technical college, which has an enrollment of
1,500, told a different story than that given by city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering student Daniel Flores said a minor traffic accident
between a college student and the son of a police commander
triggered the confrontation. The police were unfairly and
inaccurately blaming the college student for the mishap, Flores
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the fault of the police officer's son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, a group of students came to the police
station looking for justice Wednesday afternoon, and ended up
commandeering a patrol car. They drove it back to the campus where
it was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Students also set at least one other vehicle on fire, the police
said. Students admitted burning the patrol car, which has been done
as a sign of protest in the past. But they said they did not
provoke the confrontation that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Manuel Garcia Reyna, the head of one of the college's
engineering divisions, said about 150 police and transit officers
showed up at the campus gate Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Unprovoked, they entered and began beating the 30 or so students
and bystanders present with clubs and pelting them with stones,
Garcia said. The officers broke car windows, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no call for this kind of force,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence continued unchecked until the 15 individuals,
including the college's director, Nicolas Baca Cisneros, were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said about 10 people were treated for injuries, including
a teacher who was severely beaten on the head. Engineering
professor Claudio Alcala de Salinas showed up for a news conference
Thursday with bruises and cuts to his face and lacerations in his
scalp, saying he was the one who was beaten by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police attacked people indiscriminately, Garcia said,
including a student who was five months pregnant. She fled.
</P>
<P>
   It was near the end of the police attack that Davila clutched
his chest and fell to the ground, apparently suffering a heart
attack, according to one student witness.
</P>
<P>
   However, a photograph of Davila in Thursday's edition of El
Bravo showed a body with lacerations and contusions on the face.
</P>
<P>
   One administrator at the college, who did not identify himself,
said Davila was not injured, nor did he die on the college campus.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said that eight months ago the police also showed up at
the campus, but they resolved their problems in talks with
administrators that time.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said there is a long history of hostility between the
students and local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very different,'' he said. ``Some of them can't read,
and they can't write.''

EL-AMIN TO ANNOUNCE BID FOR NBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Connecticut guard Khalid El-Amin is expected to
announce that he will forego his senior season and submit his name
for the NBA draft in June.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, barring any last-second change of heart, which
should be formally announced at a press conference Friday at UConn,
is based on several factors.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin has until May 14 to declare his intentions regarding the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin has told friends he has done what he could at UConn,
which includes being part of a team that won 91 games in three
seasons, and won the national championship in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, the 5-foot-10-inch, 200-pound point guard
averaged 16.5 points and 5.2 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   Another, even larger, factor was the scrutiny which surrounded
El-Amin, involving not only his play on the court, but his
lifestyle off the court, which includes his family.
</P>
<P>
   Although El-Amin shrugged most of it off, he was particularly
upset this season about references to his family, which includes
two children, one born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee eliminated UConn in the second round of the NCAA
tournament, El-Amin went home to Minneapolis to talk over his
decision with his wife, Jessica, and his parents.
</P>
<P>
   While there was apparently some sentiment for the junior to
return for one more season, the consensus opinion was that El-Amin
would be best served if he moved to the NBA, where most experts
project him as a late first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin came back into town earlier this week and met with
Huskie coach Jim Calhoun Thursday, informing him of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The draft will be held June 28 in El-Amin's hometown of
Minneapolis.

`RULES OF ENGAGEMENT': IT'S A WAR OUT THERE, SOLDIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bitter veteran looking to gain a shot at long-lost glory takes
on one last big job, maybe even against his better judgment. That's
Tommy Lee Jones, the star of ``Rules of Engagement.'' He plays a
Marine lawyer who barely escaped Vietnam with his life and now
takes on a court case to defend Samuel L. Jackson, as the man who
got him out alive.
</P>
<P>
   But that plot line could also describe the trajectory of William
Friedkin, whose seminal genre films ``The French Connection'' and
``The Exorcist'' put him on Sugar Mountain in the 1970s and who has
been trying to rekindle the legend ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engagement'' starts with a Vietnam moment as Hays Hodges
(Jones) and Terry Childers (Jackson) slog through the mud and
Hodges is caught in a firefight. Taking control of the situation,
Childers makes a command decision that helps bring Hodges back
alive. Almost 30 years later Hodges is retiring from the corps.
``He got blown up in Vietnam, went to Georgetown Law and became a
cynic'' is the way Hodges is described, although he's not nearly as
cynical as the people behind this movie.
</P>
<P>
   When Childers becomes involved in a situation in Yemen that
seems a contemporary My Lai, he seeks out Hodges as legal counsel.
``I don't want some Starbucks drinker who's never seen combat,''
Childers growls. In rescuing the U.S. ambassador (Ben Kingsley,
employing the same dead-voiced American accent he used as the vice
president in ``Dave'') and his family from the embassy while under
attack, Childers ordered a retaliatory strike on a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He's the only surviving member of his unit to have witnessed the
crowd's fire on the defenders, but to the rest of the world it
looks as if he initiated an attack on innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Childers is targeted as a scapegoat, since he has made a
potential mess of U.S. relations with moderate Middle Eastern
countries. It doesn't matter much that he's telling the truth,
especially to Sokal (Bruce Greenwood), a national security adviser
who destroys a videotape showing that Childers was justified in his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an epic clash of acting styles, or even
sparks, between Jones and Jackson is bound to be disappointed.
Because they are fiery actors with intense and contrasting
approaches, the idea of the theatrical Jackson's going nose to nose
with Jones of the proud mein and military directness (even his
``good morning'' sounds threatening), has the promise of a welcome
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   But there's not much going on here, and since ``Rules'' makes
the tactical error of showing Childers' innocence at the outset,
there is little suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a twist is that Jones doesn't fall back on
his characteristic command. He is shaken and unsure of himself,
starring in a movie that is basically like the world's most
expensive episode of the television show ``JAG'' as written by
Aaron Sorkin (``A Few Good Men'').
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gets to blow out a few of the cobwebs, but not enough of
them. Jones and Jackson get into a fistfight so they can bond, a
Friedkin ritual that was hoary even in ``French Connection'' days.
They show up in court, bruised but unbowed _ bloody brothers,
closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jones works hard on dramatic points that seem lifted out of
``The Verdict'' (on which Richard D. Zanuck was also a producer);
he's an alcoholic who vomits just before he enters the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast mostly serves as kindling for Jones and
Jackson to burn through on their way to proving the truth. Guy
Pearce, as an honorable prosecutor, seems to have been cast because
he can bite out hard enunciations as well as Jones, although heaven
knows what kind of accent he's supposed to have.
</P>
<P>
   With actors like Jones and Jackson, ``Rules of Engagement''
doesn't need to stack the deck so heavily in its favor. While
making this picture, Friedkin must have fondly thought back to the
'70s, when movies weren't so pro forma and stars could even lose
every once in a while. &QL;

 &HT;    McEnroe's drive leading U.S. team
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The late Harry Hopman was the life's blood
of Australia's 16 championship teams in the 1950s and '60s. No
other Davis Cup captain had assumed the same stature as his
superstar players.
</P>
<P>
   Then came John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1995, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras
will be Davis Cup teammates, when the U.S. meets the Czech Republic
in a quarterfinal that begins today.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, the rookie captain who brought together these reluctant
patriots, is no less vital for what has become at least a mild U.S.
resurgence in Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   His first asset is star quality, and his second gift is the
respect of his players. Not to say that he can't bruise an ego.
After Sampras withrdrew injured from the U.S. team in the first
round, McEnroe said he thought that Sampras did not want to go to
Zimbabwe in the first place. They've since made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to bring Davis Cup to the forefront and make people
think about Davis Cup,'' McEnroe said. ``And it's critical that the
best players play.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sampras, McEnroe actually needed little persuasion, although
Sampras hasn't played Davis Cup singles in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be remembered when my career was done (for) how often
I was No. 1,'' Sampras said. ``It's time to find the motivation to
do some other things. Davis Cup fits right in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, on the other hand, didn't come so easily. He has been a
Davis Cup warrior over the years, once winning a U.S.-record 16
matches in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he bolted the team last year with harsh words for
then-president of the USTA Harry Marmion. Agassi accused Marmion of
ignoring the players' feelings in site selection and in the firing
of the team doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it really wasn't much of a team anymore,'' Agassi
said. ``I want to be able to make decisions with the team that are
important to the team, and that starts with our captain.''
</P>
<P>
   When new USTA President Judy Levering's tenure began Jan. 1, she
immediately asked what the players wanted.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe was in, replacing Tom Gullikson. Even though Gullikson
had been a well-liked captain, he couldn't secure top U.S. players
for the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's sudden emergence as a USTA authority figure is not
without irony. As a player in 1985, McEnroe essentially was banned
from the team by then-USTA President Randy Gregson for his churlish
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Levering said she has not given McEnroe's history a second
thought since hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very impressed with John's passion,''
Levering said. ``That's something you can't buy.''

`READY TO RUMBLE': WALLOWING IN THE WORLD OF WRESTLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ready to Rumble'' is a courageous, devastating expose of the
brutality, misogyny and homophobia that pervade the so-called sport
of professional wrestling. The film goes to shocking lengths to
show how this wildly popular form of entertainment transforms its
young male fans into uncouth, slack-jawed dolts who think that
punching women in the face is an acceptable mode of foreplay, and
who are entirely unable to distinguish fantasy from reality. The
movie also explores, with candor and sensitivity, the undercurrent
of sado-masochistic homoeroticism that has made wrestling a
big-money attraction for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Brian Robbins' ``Ready to Rumble'' is not a satire of
the idiocy of professional wrestling, but a long, self-satisfied
wallow in it. The film was made with the cooperation of World
Championship Wrestling, an organization whose logo is much in
evidence and several of whose real-life stars (if that's the right
phrase) turn up to break chairs over other people's heads. Compared
to WCW, the better-known World Wrestling Federation looks downright
highbrow; after all, the WWF has recently been the subject of a
documentary, a word few of the characters in ``Ready to Rumble''
are probably able to spell.
</P>
<P>
   You may say I'm missing the point. Everyone knows pro wrestling
is fake, everyone knows it's stupid, and that's part of the fun.
Well, far be it from me to stand against the atrophy of human
intelligence, but ``Ready to Rumble'' is not much fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   It stars David Arquette and Scott Caan as Gordie and Sean, a
pair of portable-toilet maintenance workers dumbed down from the
``Bill and Ted'' movies of an earlier, more sophisticated age.
Gordie and Sean's line of work provides the film's first half with
its big laughs, including a high-concept highway accident involving
their sewage-filled tanker truck and an 18-wheeler carrying a big
load of toilet paper. It's downhill from there. Soon Sean and
Gordie have embarked on a crusade to save the career of their hero,
a bulky WCW figurehead named Jimmy King (Oliver Platt). To call
their plans (or the script) harebrained is to insult the cognitive
ability of rabbits. Suffice it to say that the plot calls for
smackdowns aplenty, and a climactic triple-cage death match at the
MGM Grand in Las Vegas. If you don't know what these terms mean,
consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to a great many injuries (some of which look as if
they really hurt) is the spectacle of Platt, always a good sport,
singing Run DMC's ``King of Rock'' wearing a studded black leather
body suit and a gimcrack crown. And then there is the Oscar winner
Martin Landau delivering whippings to anyone who crosses his path.
These men are good actors, as is Joe Pantoliano, who plays a
villainous WCW impresario. Let's hope that they got their money up
front, and that the winsome Rose McGowan, playing a ``Nitro Girl''
exotic dancer who is briefly Gordy's love interest, manages to
forget she was ever mixed up in a movie in which the only thing
women are called upon to do is strip down to their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   As the credits roll, ``Ready to Rumble'' runs the now-obligatory
blooper reel, which is indistinguishable from what has come before
and leaves the disturbing impression that Arquette may not have
been acting at all. At the end we are treated to a montage of kicks
to various groins, a perfect expression of the film's idea of humor
and its opinion of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think a loser would have tickets to the championship?''
Gordie taunts a stuck-up french fry slinger named Brittany, played
by Jill Ritchie, early in the action. Brittany's incisive response
is ``yes.'' It's the smartest line in the movie.
</P>

US-FUNDED LAB DISPUTES CLAIM THAT HUMAN GENE IS DECIPHERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another dispute over deciphering the human genetic blueprint
broke out Thursday, with Celera Genomics Inc. telling Congress it
had identified all the DNA ``letters'' in a single human blueprint
and a government scientist calling the claim a ``nonstory.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim was made by J. Craig Venter, founder of the Rockville,
Md., company that is racing to decipher the human DNA blueprint _
and give the information preferentially to paying subscribers _
against the government's Human Genome Project, which routinely
gives its data free to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, testifying before a subcommittee of the U.S. House
Committee on Science, said his scientists had deciphered all the
chemical units making up all the genes of one individual. But
Celera has only determined the order of all the ``bases,'' or
chemical units in thousands of small pieces of the blueprint: it
still has to assemble them in the proper order, a process they say
can be completed in weeks using powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the key milestone,'' Venter said. He added that the
gene blueprint was that of a single human being. ``By the end of
next week, we will have finished the gene sequence for a female.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the finished blueprint of the human genome is
expected to lead to revolutionary new and safer drugs and leapfrog
treatment in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Because people have individual differences in about 1 of every
1,000 bases along the chromosomes that carry the DNA, a number of
peoples' genomes (the set of all genes) will have to be sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Lander, a leading genetic scientist who heads the
federally funded Center for Genome Research at the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass., disputed Celera's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``A naive listener might get the mistaken impression that Celera
was announcing that it had just sequenced the human genome,''
Lander said. ``In fact, it has produced only a small fraction of
the data required _ and actually less data than has been produced
by the international public sequencing consortium.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera and government scientists have previously argued about
the company's claims and about Celera's strategy of withholding its
sequence data until it has finished the job.
</P>
<P>
   But even what finishing the job means is a matter of contention.
All the DNA in the nucleus of human cells amounts is made up of an
estimated 3.2 million bases _ the individual letters that, in long
sequences of genetic code spell out the instructions in the genes,
of which there are an estimated 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequencing'' the genome means discovering the exact order of
all 3.2 million bases, so that their message can be read. As
gargantuan a task as this is, it isn't done when all the bases have
been read through one time. Inevitable errors will creep in, so the
task has to be done several times over to ensure accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lander said that Celera has only read the order of bases three
times, ``and you cannot assemble the vast majority of sequence''
accurately without many more repetitions of the task. He noted that
Celera, which recently announced it had sequenced the entire genome
of the fruit fly, covered the genome 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   But Lander said it is ``a mistake to think in terms of
milestones'' in the sequencing effort. There is no finish line, he
said, because scientists have been using the public sequence data
as it pours into the GenBank database the U.S. government operates.
And there will be no neat conclusion to the sequencing effort
either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run,'' said Lander, ``in three or four years, no
one's going to care'' who ``won'' the race. ``All of this hoopla is
just a footnote'' to the sequencing project, ``which is a tribute
to 20 years of molecular biology.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors picked a winner Thursday, pushing Celera's stock
up nearly 22 percent. Shares of PE Corp., Celera's parent company,
rose $25 to $140 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

ALBRIGHT CITES US CONCERN OVER VIOLENCE IN HAITI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright says the
Clinton administration ``is very disappointed'' with the political
violence now roiling Haiti, but has so far been unsuccessful in
getting former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to help ease the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the right thing'' by invading Haiti in 1994 and ousting
the military leaders who had seized power, Albright said during a
meeting with Boston Globe editors and reporters Thursday.
``Horrible things were happening, people had their faces ripped
off, thousands were (fleeing) on rafts. But there is a genuine
problem now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was restored to the presidency by the 20,000-strong US
invasion and billions of dollars in American and international aid
was spent restoring order and attempting to revive the economy and
political system.
</P>
<P>
   But elections have been repeatedly postponed in the past 18
months by Aristide's successor and protege, Rene Preval, who
dissolved parliament in January 1999. The impoverished Caribbean
nation now is in a state of political gridlock, and politically
motivated violence is rising. A prominent journalist was
assassinated on Monday; thousands of elective offices are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aristide wants to get back (in office), no question,'' said
Albright, who was in the Boston area to drum up support among
business and technology leaders for the administration's proposal
to normalize trade relations with China. ``He ought to allow there
to be parliamentary elections, and then presidential elections. He
ought to get there is a way that builds the democratic system.. . .
We are trying to persuade him he is going about it in the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lake, the US special envoy to Haiti and former head of
the National Security Council, met Aristide on Wednesday in Miami,
and a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
characterized the talks between the two as ``clear and direct. It
was a good meeting.'' But the official declined to say whether
Aristide made any promises regarding the timing of legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electoral problems are procedural issues,'' said Michelle
Karshan, a spokesman for Preval, in a telephone interview from
Port-au-Prince. ``That doesn't have to do with Aristide. That has
to do with the capability of the electoral council and the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the problems include making 4 million photo ID cards
for voters and establishing electoral offices in areas of the
country that don't have electricity, which render computers and fax
machines useless.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting at the Globe, and in a speech at Agilent
Technologies in Andover, Albright also strongly advocated
administration proposals before Congress for divorcing trade policy
toward China from human rights concerns, ending the annual review
of China's human rights practices now required for China to have
the same trade status that almost all other nations have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important national security vote,'' Albright
said, explaining that involving China in the World Trade
Organization and other international bodies ``is a way to have
leverage over them without the US having to be the enforcer.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that while the administration has found attempts to
link trade to human rights are not effective, ``there is no doubt
in my mind that the kind of information technology goods that would
be going into China'' in a free-trading situation would encourage
broader human rights and freedoms there.

 &HT;    Dell: Internet growth could double revenue in next few years
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Dell told Wall Street analysts Thursday that
the explosive growth of the Internet in both hardware and services
could lead his $25 billion company to double in revenue in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But that means winning the battle for the hearts, minds and
wallets of companies that buy servers, the machines that power
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you type www, you're accessing a server
somewhere,'' Dell told analysts at The Pierre, a Four Seasons Hotel
across Fifth Avenue from Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Looking past Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., the world's
largest personal computer maker ahead of Dell, the Round Rock,
Texas, company's boss threw down the gauntlet at the feet of Sun
Microsystems, which saw revenue hit almost $12 billion in its last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said there already are signs in some market segments of
passing Compaq as the leading seller of Intel-based servers in the
United States, where Compaq holds about 40 percent of the market
vs. Dell's 25 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is banking on continued growth of less expensive
Intel-based server systems as an alternative to Sun and its
proprietary, high-powered Unix-based servers that enjoyed a large
part of the early market for Internet servers. Dell's servers are
made in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ground Zero for Dell,'' Dell said. ``Sun is the
relevant competitor here in server share and growth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dell unveiled a much-expected line of low-cost,
efficient servers called Internet appliance servers designed to do
specific individual tasks, such as store Web pages, handle e-mail
or manage Web site traffic. Traditional full-service servers are
more expensive and generally designed to handle multiple tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we're seeing in the market is that you don't need
a Sun E-10,000 to run these complex (Web) sites,'' Dell said.
``Obviously, we're going to pour kerosene on that fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Walter Winnitzki of Chase Hambrect &AMP; Quist, however,
predicted a long battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight,'' he said. ``Sun's well
entrenched.''
</P>
<P>
   Servers are just one part of Dell's efforts to capitalize on the
opportunity created by the Internet. The company on Wednesday
unveiled a service program aimed at Internet service providers and
application service providers using Dell equipment. Dell said it
will partner with consulting firms Arthur Andersen and Gen3
Partners to offer its e-commerce expertise to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also is stepping up its efforts to provide Internet access,
from dial-up service to broadband and wireless offerings, as well
as Web-site hosting. The moves are part of Dell's continuing effort
to move beyond simply making desktop computers and hardware,
tapping into what it believes is a huge potential market for
closely related services driven by expansion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer James Schneider told analysts that when
services, access, consulting and Web-hosting are added to the mix,
the potential worldwide market in 2003 nearly triples to $1
trillion from a $351 billion market for hardware alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine just having 10 percent of this extended market, what
kind of company would it look like?'' said Schneider, who succeeded
Tom Meredith as Dell's chief financial officer a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schneider and the rest of Dell's executive team were
extremely cautious not to raise analysts' financial expectations
after spending most of last year telling Wall Street to expect the
company's growth to slow to about 30 percent annually from the 50
percent range it enjoyed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're really out to keep expectations low because
they've got burned in the past,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dell missed analysts' earnings expectations in the third and
fourth quarters last year because of supply problems and a
Y2K-induced slump in corporate computer purchases. Its stock was
hammered as a result and has only recently climbed back above $50
per share. The stock closed at $51.56, down $2.36 a share, Thursday
in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company isn't abandoning the personal computer segment, a
business that's still growing at about 25 percent a year, even
though margins have been declining, executives assured analysts. On
Thursday, Fort Worth-based American Airlines said it chose Dell to
provide computers to its 100,000 employees, who will pay no more
than $12 a month, including Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokesman Andy North estimated the contract to be worth at
least $15 million over three years. American is the latestcompany
to offer subsidized computers to its employees, following the lead
of Ford Motor Co. and Delta Airlines. But it's the first of these
new contracts Dell has won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do business in something where we won't make
a profit,'' Schneider told analysts before the American
announcement.

</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They're baaack.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after paralyzing the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle, the same groups of protesters have begun
arriving in Washington, D.C., to make life difficult for the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are hoping to disrupt the two groups' annual
spring joint meeting April 16 and 17, which is scheduled to bring
together finance ministers, central bank governors and other
officials from 182 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers around the country have told their members to
employ some of the tactics used in late last November and early
December in Seattle _ including hanging banners, blockading streets
near the meeting site and civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   While disavowing violence, Carol Welch, spokeswoman for Friends
of the Earth, a Washington-based environmental group helping to
coordinate the protests, says her organization and others ``want to
make our voice heard and to wake up the world to what the (IMF and
World Bank) do.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank provides long-term loans for economic development
projects in poor countries while the IMF arranges short-term loans
directly to countries in sudden economic crisis _ often imposing
severe austerity measures on them in return for the aid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters charge that the two lenders' policies result in harsh
conditions on poor countries and favor western creditors and large
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions push poor countries to structure their
economies and start projects that give all the power to large
corporations, which could care less about the local people or
environment,'' Welch says.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are calling on the international organizations to
push for greater environmental protection, minimum wage standards
and better distribution of wealth, especially through debt
forgiveness for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations should not be allowed to dictate how the world
should live just to increase their profits,'' says Welch, who
expects several thousand demonstrators to descend on the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have urged dozens of groups _ from the Forum of
Indian Leftists to the Progressive Librarians Guild _ to send their
members here for a week of marches, teach-ins and musical
performances. The protesters have set up their own Web site,
www.a16.org, to promote their cause.
</P>
<P>
   A Jubilee 2000/USA will be held Sunday to call for the
cancellation of the debts of African, Latin American, Asia-Pacific,
and Caribbean countries. Later in the week, lectures and rallies
will focus on the global economy. The demonstrators, using giant
puppets and outlandish costumes, will stage their main protest next
Sunday and Monday at the World Bank and IMF joint meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But with the violence in Seattle still fresh in their memory,
protest group leaders are urging demonstrators to be
peaceful.``When fights break out between protesters and police, the
media tend to forget the message of the rally and focus on the
fights, which is not what we want,'' Welch says.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some ``rogue protesters'' among the 35,000
demonstrators in Seattle caused great property damage to downtown
businesses, Welch said her group has been working with other
organizations on nonviolent techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assurances, the March of Dimes last month canceled
its annual fund-raising walk set for April 15 in the nation's
capital to avoid potential street violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle the protestors shut down the opening ceremonies of
the World Trade Organization's annual meeting. The demonstrations,
televised worldwide, quickly turned tumultuous. Police sprayed tear
gas and fired rubber pellets at many peaceful protesters but failed
to stop the window-smashing and looting by a relatively small group
of vandals less than a block away. Damage was estimated at several
million dollars, and 600 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police Chief Norm Stamper, criticized for his handling
of the protests, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a similar scene, Washington's Metropolitan Police
Department has been preparing for the IMF/World Banks protests for
months. Nearly 1,500 officers took a special daylong course to
train for the demonstrations. They watched videos of how Seattle
police lost control and practiced scenarios such as how to handle
5,000 protesters trying to block a major street. Hundreds of
officers from federal and other local law enforcement agencies also
will be standing by in case they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't foresee any real problems,'' says Metropolitan Police
Executive Assistant Chief Terrance Gainer. ``We're sure we can both
let the protesters get out their message and keep the city running
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainer says that unlike the Seattle police, D.C. police have ``a
good deal'' of experience dealing with demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   But just to be sure, the police here purchased $1 million worth
of riot gear for the event, including helmets with neck protectors
and arm, chest and shin guards. In addition to service weapons,
officers will carry gas masks, and some will bear arms that can
shoot rubber bullets or deliver tear gas. However, officers are
forbidden from launching any tear gas without orders from Gainer or
Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   IMF and World Bank officials insist that no meetings will be
canceled because of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect any changes in our schedule,'' World Bank
spokeswoman Merrell Tuck says. She adds that her organization has
worked hard to reach out to protest groups and address their
concerns. She pointed to items on the spring meeting's agenda aimed
at bettering the condition of all people, such as a poverty
re-education strategy paper and a dialogue about HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that these groups will also come to listen to what the
bank is doing to fight poverty,'' Tuck says. ``On a lot of issues
we're on the same side.''But Welch disagrees, insisting that while
the IMF and World Bank often talk about helping the poor, their
policies are geared toward enriching corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were doing everything they say they do, we wouldn't be
here,'' she says.

INTERN SAYS HE REFUSED TO RECREATE KEY LEWIS MEDICAL RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than a day after Reggie Lewis died of heart
failure while shooting baskets at a Brandeis University gym,
Brigham and Women's Hospital officials called a former medical
intern who had been involved in the Celtics star's care and asked
him to recreate a key document missing in Lewis's medical record.
</P>
<P>
   The intern, William Maisel, testifying Thursday for the first
time in the retrial of the medical malpractice lawsuit stemming
from Lewis's July 1993 death, said he refused the request because
``I didn't feel that it was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Maisel testified that he had dictated the information before
Lewis left the hospital in May 1993 and left it to be transcribed.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the document, a discharge summary that would have
outlined Lewis's diagnosis and treatment plan, has been a
particularly contentious issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   During the first trial, which ended in a hung jury last year, a
lawyer for Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis -- who sued Lewis's
chief cardiologist, Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., for negligence after her
husband died -- claimed that the record had been purposely lost or
destroyed. Hospital officials testified that the omission was due
to sloppy record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The document is important because Mudge has testified that
although he announced publicly that Lewis had a benign fainting
condition that would not end his basketball career, he also
believed Lewis might have a potentially life-threatening heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge has also testified that he, the Lewises, hospital
officials, and Celtics representatives agreed to conceal the
second, more worrisome, diagnosis from the public. Harris-Lewis has
testified that Mudge never told her or her husband that he could
have a potentially fatal disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawyers contend that the missing discharge
summary would provide conclusive proof of Mudge's diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in recent weeks that the Brigham's
record-keeping has been called into question. Last month, in an
unrelated case, a judge awarded the family of a brain damaged child
$6.5 million -- removing the statutory cap of $20,000 on damages
against charitable organizations such as hospitals -- because the
Brigham had lost a key medical record in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Maisel, who was not called to the stand during the first trial,
testified that he dictated a discharge summary of roughly one to
one-and-a-half typed pages in length upon Lewis's departure from
the Brigham. But he said he did not know if the dictation was ever
transcribed, and he conceded that the document is not in Lewis's
medical record.
</P>
<P>
   He was not asked what he had dicated and he did not volunteer
the information.
</P>
<P>
   Maisel, who now practices at the Brigham, also testified that
Mudge did -- as he claims -- have a second, unpublicized diagnosis
for Lewis that pointed to a serious heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Maisel was pressed repeatedly on that point by Neil Rossman,
Harris-Lewis's lawyer, who has established that nowhere in Lewis's
medical record was there any indication that Mudge believed Lewis
had a deadly heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a brief ``discharge note'' Maisel wrote for Lewis,
Rossman asked Maisel to indicate where there was a reference to a
deadly disorder. In reply, Maisel said the phrase ``exercise
monitoring,'' which was written in the note, was meant to indicate
that a second diagnosis was also being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Mudge felt that Mr. Lewis's (problem) could be due to
neurocardiogenic syncope'' -- the benign fainting disorder -- ``but
he had not completely excluded an arrhythmia'' -- the
life-threatening heart condition -- ``and that is why he didn't
want Mr. Lewis to exercise without being monitored,'' Maisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., contends that Lewis
contributed to his own death by continuing to play basketball
against Mudge's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Rossman if he was surprised that Mudge mentioned only a
benign fainting disorder when he publicly announced Lewis's
diagnosis, Maisel replied that was.
</P>
<P>
   Rossman also questioned why Maisel, who was ten months out of
medical school when he assisted with Lewis's care, had been given
the authority to draft discharge documents. Maisel replied that at
the time he was a licensed physician who had treated ``hundreds of
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying Thursday was former Celtics general manager Jan
Volk, who -- as he testified last year -- said that during a
meeting in which Mudge briefed him on Lewis's medical condition,
Mudge made no mention of a life-threatening heart disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But noting that Volk said Mudge also told him further testing
would be done on Lewis, Dailey attempted to show that Mudge was
merely in the process of evaluating Lewis's medical condition, and
had not yet reached a conclusive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey also questioned why Volk -- from the time he met with
Mudge till Lewis's death -- never contacted Mudge to inquire about
Lewis's health and ask when he would be able to play professionally
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our very best player,'' Volk said. ``We were going to
give him all the space we could.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a spot for Reggie whenever he was ready,'' he added.
``He was irreplaceable.''

DOCTORS PERFORM UNIQUE SURGERY ON NEWBORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Little Sarah Savage entered the world abruptly two
weeks ago, when Boston doctors, in a rare and daring maneuver,
pulled her halfway out of her mother's womb _ still attached to the
placenta _ to treat a lung blockage that would likely kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is set to go home. But this extraordinary venture in
fetal surgery, carried out March 22 at Children's Hospital, would
take another twist before Sarah could breathe on her own.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded team of obstetrical and surgical experts from
Children's and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center intended to
perform the delicate operation and return the baby to the mother's
womb. But they soon feared that removing the cyst blocking her
airway would take too long, that the placenta would quickly stop
functioning, and the lungs would become totally obstructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to buy more time,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sachs,
chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Beth Israel.
</P>
<P>
   So in another rare move, Sarah was fully delivered, though six
weeks premature, and hooked to a mechanical heart-lung bypass
device. The decision gave the surgeons several hours to perform the
operation and repair her tiny windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah is now fully normal, and weighing about six pounds, and
the dozens of medical specialists at Beth Israel and Children's who
joined forces to save her are basking in the knowledge that it all
finally worked. ``A tremendous amount of work and coordination
behind the scenes made this all possible,'' said Sachs. The
preparations even included getting permission for Beth Israel
Deaconess obstetricians to deliver Sarah at Children's, which has
no maternity service.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's parents, John and Lucie Savage of Pembroke, said they
were confident throughout the ordeal. It helped that Lucie is a
nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit at Beth Israel. ``People
asked me if that made me more nervous, but it was actually the
opposite,'' said Lucie Savage Thursday. ``It reassured me; I knew I
was in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, when a happy outcome was not assured, the plan
seemed fraught with ethical concerns, because the mother would be
risking her own health to save the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was fascinating for lots of reasons,'' said Dr.
Russell Jennings, the surgeon who heads the fetal treatment program
at Children's, and who has brought to conservative Boston a long
experience in operating on infants while still in the womb _ a
medical frontier that was opened in San Francisco, where Jennings
trained.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the half-Cesarian birth procedure, known as EXIT,
has been done many times elsewhere, ``but in Boston, everyone's
very nervous about it'' because it is so rare, said Jennings,
adding that it actually poses relatively little risk to the mother.
The major concern is that by opening the womb with a surgical
incision and leaving it open while treating the infant, there's a
risk of major bleeding, requiring transfusions or even a
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The situation created a potential collision of interests: the
mother's and the fetus's. Yet in cases like this, ``the mom is
always committed to her fetus, so she can't be the best advocate
for herself,'' said Jennings. But John Savage, 36, said the doctors
did a good job ``of making us understand that we could risking
Lucie's life for the sake of this unborn child. That was one of the
hardest parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, the obstetrics chief, took it on himself to be Lucie
Savage's advocate in the operating room, in case doctors focused on
trying to save the baby began to put the mother at increased risk.
Fortunately, Lucie Savage fared very well during the surgery; her
health wasn't compromised by the efforts to save Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Savage, who also has a 19-month-old, had a normal pregnancy
under the care of Beth Israel doctors until a routine ultrasound in
the 15th week of gestation revealed a growth in the fetus'
breathing passages. Savage was referred to Dr. Deborah Levine, a
radiologist, and Dr. Geoffrey Wong, an obstetrician who manages
high-risk cases, and also to Jennings at Children's.
</P>
<P>
   For many weeks, and through a number of different medical
imaging sessions, the doctors were unsure whether the growth was a
major problem or not. But by her 31st week of gestation, Lucie had
developed excessive fluid in the womb caused by the cysts' growth,
which was putting pressure on the lungs and heart.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing danger forced the combined medical teams to move
ahead faster than they had planned toward the rare operation. At 34
weeks, Lucie Savage was moved from Beth Israel to Children's
Hospital where the delicate procedure began at around noon. After
Sarah was delivered, Jennings and his colleagues worked for several
more hours to remove the cysts, which they believe occurred as an
accident during development, and to repair the breathing passages
to which it was attached.

 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He does not own a car dealership or a
restaurant. Drew Bledsoe's outside activity is the Drew Bledsoe
Foundation, a nonprofit education organization that focuses on good
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Its offices are now in Rodman Park, about one mile south of
Foxboro Stadium, where Thursday Bledsoe became the first big-name
professional athlete to begin an Internet service provider
(Bledsoenet.com), with most of the proceeds going to fund the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While Bledsoe also commented on issues such as the Patriots' new
uniforms, the new offense, the team, and his contract, the day was
really to launch his business venture. There's an ironic twist to
the venture. Bledsoe was burned by the very medium that he is now a
part of _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Late last season, an Internet rumor concerning his personal life
was picked up by local radio stations, which caused the quarterback
considerable anguish and led him to wonder how a rumor could
suddenly be legitimized in the mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with the Internet was a bit uncomfortable to say
the least,'' said Bledsoe. ``You can't control what is out there
and what your children have access to. That's a major reason we
started Bledsoenet.com, so that parents of young kids can have a
certain level of comfort knowing what they have access to is
filtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you can't control everything that comes across. We
will specifically filter out pornography, bomb-making recipes,
hate-crime type of things. They'll be filtered out through our
filtering service. The second reason is to fund our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, flanked by foundation CEO Don Berube, said the filtered
service would cost $19.95 per month while unfiltered service would
cost $17.95. Start up will be explained on the Bledsoenet.com Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Berube said the service would soon provide DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my kids grow up, I'd like to have some certainty and
comfort that Stu (Bledsoe's oldest son) can't just pull up porno
sites and bomb-making recipes,'' said Bledsoe. ``There are many
other ways he'll get into trouble without having easy access to
anything he wants to get to. The filtering service is done through
a third party which is updated hourly, and they're constantly
filtering out sites that are not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proactive reaction to what happened to me. If
somebody is going to send out an e-mail starting rumors about
somebody, we're obviously not going to be able to control that. But
what happened to me last year was eye-opening in that while the
Internet is a great resource, and while it is the wave of the
future, there are downsides to it in that everybody can put
anything out there. This was important to me as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rumor surfaced, Bledsoe threatened to sue those who
broadcast it, but now says that's less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe considered himself a ``computer nerd'' when he was in
college, but he said he got away from it until his wife, Maura,
bought him a laptop for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's currently trying to enroll some of his teammates,
and has already taken much ribbing. He said right guard Todd Rucci
now writes ``ToddRucci(at)Bledsoenet.com'' on his e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his full-time job, Bledsoe said he likes the new
uniforms (darker blue) and added there's even a ``Monday Night
Football'' uniform that would include the navy blue jersey and navy
blue pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said there was nothing new with his contract extension
and said, ``The contract I signed I'm perfectly happy to play that
out. There are no monetary reasons to redo it, but if it gives us
more leeway to signing free agents, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His preliminary meeting with new offensive coordinator Charlie
Weis has also given him reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have more formations, spread the field out more
on early downs, and what that does is spread the defense out,''
Bledsoe said. ``That will allow me to determine what the defense is
trying to do to me right away. When you're in a base formation, the
defenses can give you all of their exotic coverages and all their
disguises. When you spread the field, they have to declare what
they're going to do. Hopefully it'll help our running game a little
bit.''

 &HT;    Gingrich divorce settled in secret
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich is a bachelor again.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in
the former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret
settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Judge Dorothy Robinson made the Gingriches' divorce
final and agreed to seal the agreement, which they signed early
this week. By doing so, the Gingriches spared themselves any
embarrassment that could have come from trying their case in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' said Tom Browning, an attorney for Newt Gingrich,
who was not present at Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A sedate Marianne Gingrich, who did attend the hearing, had only
this to say about the often bitter eight-month-long divorce
process: ``It's been a difficult period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the courthouse after the hearing, Marianne
Ginther Gingrich, 48, added that she will keep her ex-husband's
last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know me by that name,'' she said. ``We've been
married a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair
with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce July 29. The
couple and their attorneys spent nearly the next five months
arguing over depositions and money, going to court twice.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 16, during a court-ordered mediation that ended
after 12 hours, the Gingriches reached a tentative agreement. The
couple's attorneys took another three months to work out the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's short and relatively quiet hearing was in stark
contrast to the posturing by both sides early on.
</P>
<P>
   In his July divorce petition, Newt Gingrich said the marriage
was ``irretrievably broken,'' a standard clause under Georgia's
``no fault'' divorce laws. In her answer, Marianne Gingrich denied
the claim, offering no explanation for why.
</P>
<P>
   And she still won't say. On Thursday, Marianne Gingrich told the
judge that the marriage was indeed ``irretrievably broken.'' Here's
what else the public likely will never know:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Newt Gingrich tried to transfer ``certain valuable
assets'' before filing for divorce, as Marianne Gingrich alleged.
</P>
<P>
   _ The details of Newt Gingrich's affair with Callista Bisek, a
33-year-old scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, and how
he carried it on without Marianne Gingrich's knowledge. Bisek was
ordered to sit for a deposition with Marianne Gingrich's lawyers,
but the case was settled before that happened.
</P>
<P>
   _ What the couple's associates would have to say about the
marriage and Gingrich's affair. Newt Gingrich won permission to
depose Marianne Gingrich's sister and a friend, both in Ohio.
Marianne Gingrich won permission to depose members of her husband's
political and business associates, including his self-described
closest adviser, Joe Gaylord. None of those depositions occurred.
</P>
<P>
   _ And what Newt Gingrich earns. That information is sealed away
in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Since resigning as speaker and from the congressional seat he
held for 20 years, Gingrich has been making a living giving
speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as
a political analyst on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich plans to continue her work with the Red Cross
and various charity groups. She indicated Thursday that she is
evaluating several business opportunities as well, but would not
elaborate.

   MIAMI _ Crowds tossed long-stemmed carnations over police
barricades Thursday to show that Cuban exiles are prepared to
warmly receive the father of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we will greet Juan Miguel Gonzalez if he
decides to come here to see his son,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, a
protest organizer who last week led the crowds in exercises to form
a human chain around the home where 6-year-old Elian has stayed
since being rescued from the
</P>
<P>
   ocean Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   But protestors made it clear that the father, who arrived in the
United States Thursday morning to reclaim his son, could quickly
wear out his welcome if he came only to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa, stay here,'' read a freshly painted poster hanging on
the chain link fence in front of the Little Havana home of Lazaro
Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he gets into the house, I'm sure he will ask for
political asylum,'' said Jose Cruz, 21, of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
one of about 200 Cuban-Americans protesting outside the home
Thursday. Cruz said the father was not speaking his heart when said
he wanted to return immediately to Cuba after taking custody of his
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks he's speaking freely is naive,'' said
Michael Reyes, 23, of Miami Beach. ``His mother and father are
still in Cuba and he could have been threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, saying he'd welcome the defection of
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, criticized the Clinton administration for
permitting the Cuban government to keep him and his family in the
residence of a Cuban diplomat outside of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be surrounded 24 hours a day and be under the fear and
terror of Cuban security agents,'' Carollo said. ``Why isn't he
staying in a hotel?''
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said he's convinced the father would defect if allowed
to freely visit his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he breathes the air of freedom, I'm sure he'll stay
here.''

   CUBAN-BOY (Washington) _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has not seen
his son Elian since the third week of November when the boy and his

small chartered plane, he announced somberly that he had come with
his new wife and 6-month-old son to bring Elian back to Cuba.

 &HT;    Gore's angers party loyalists with stand on Elian
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few days after he learned that Al Gore planned to
support legislation granting Elian Gonzalez and his family
residency status in the United States, Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.)
met with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The gravel-throated congressman from Harlem considered venting
his anger over the vice president's sudden move, which appeared to
many on Capitol Hill as a clumsy attempt to curry votes among Cuban
Americans in Miami. But Rangel, who has endorsed Gore, bit his
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't think it was my place to be cussing out the vice
president, even though it was my understanding that some members
did,'' said Rangel, one of the House's most senior Democrats. ``It
was a stupid thing that he did. I can't for the life of me think
that he was dumb enough to think that he picks up any political
points in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the controversy over 6-year-old Elian, such blunt
criticism of Gore was rare. For the most part, Gore and
congressional Democrats have been reading from the same play book,
promoting issues that they believe will help Democrats win back the
Congress and keep the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the Elian controversy, which angered many members of his own
party, demonstrates the pitfalls Gore faces as he attempts to
appeal to diverse constituencies around the country, while still
maintaining his support among Democrats on Capitol Hill. Another
potential point of friction between Gore and congressional
Democrats looms. House Republicans on Wednesday scheduled a vote
for the week of May 22 on granting China normal trade status on a
permanent basis, a requirement for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, hotly opposed by organized labor, deeply divides
Democrats on Capitol Hill. Gore supports the legislation, which
President Clinton has made one of his top priorities for his last
year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the most dicey issues for Vice President Gore
because the key component of his constituency, organized labor, is
opposed to the administration's position,'' said Marshall Wittmann,
a congressional analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank. ``This is a hot-button issue that divides
the new Democrats from the old Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, most of whom support the China trade bill,
are demanding that Clinton produce as many as 100 Democrats in
support of it, putting pressure on the administration to wage an
aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has said he will help pass the legislation, it
remains to be seen how active he will be. Minority leader Richard
Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Thursday that he was not yet aware of any
effort on Gore's part to lobby for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously has every right in the world to talk to people,''
Gephardt said. ``That's up to him. I don't pretend to tell him one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Several key Hill Democrats and observers said they believe that
Gore will wage only a token effort, effectively getting a bye on
the issue, because of organized labor's strong opposition to the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a presidential priority,'' said Will Marshall,
president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist
Democratic organization closely allied to Gore. ``I don't think
anyone expects the vice president to be up there bending arms on
this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Taylor, legislative director for the AFL-CIO, which plans
to bus over 10,000 union members to Capitol Hill April 12 to lobby
against the China trade bill, said the union ``would much have
preferred not to have this fight in an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said it remained an open question how much Gore's support
of the China legislation would dampen enthusiasm for his
presidential campaign among union members.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor also said that the union leadership felt comfortable
with Gore on other issues important to union workers, such as the
right to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Begala, Gore's campaign spokeswoman, downplayed any
potential fallout from the upcoming China vote, noting that the
vice president's free trade positions are widely known both on
Capitol Hill and among union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be differences between Democrats,''
Begala said. ``But when it comes to the issues that drive this
election _ health care, education, continuing the economic
prosperity, we agree. Overall, we are clearly a united party.''
</P>
<P>
   While congressional Democrats also largely subscribe to this
view, several indicated that Gore cannot afford too many
controversies such as the one generated by his support of residency
for Elian and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I know more than they do about (Latino) issues, that
campaign is in deep trouble,'' said Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), who
fired off an angry letter to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If the residency bill comes to the House floor, Serrano said he
would consider offering an amendment that would grant residency
status to the 7 million other undocumented aliens living in the
United States. And then he would expect Gore to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the morally correct thing to do,'' said Serrano, who is
still seething over Gore's decision to support congressional
legislation that singled out just one family.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gore has sought to mollify his critics by clarifying
his position. He asserted that giving Elian and his family
residence would permit the family courts in Florida the freedom to
resolve the dispute, something Gore has argued all along. Serrano
said he was unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell me this is something you had to do for political
reasons, I can live with that,'' Serrano said. ``But don't insult
my intelligence by telling me this is something you really believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rangel is willing to let the matter drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever problems I have with the vice president, I just take
a good hard look at George W. Bush and the warts disappear,'' he
said.

IT SOARS. IT TUMBLES. AND THE INVESTORS STILL BELIEVE.
</HEADLINE>
   (Norris column) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Quint Slattery is the very model of a modern money
manager. He is young. He knows technology. He often sells stocks a
day or two after buying them. He appears to be fearless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to the volatility,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday. ``I haven't had any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable attitude for a man who manages two funds
that were sent reeling by Nasdaq's version of March Madness. One
fund, the PBHG New Opportunities Fund, lost 42 percent of its value
in less than four weeks. The other, the PBHG Select Equity Fund, is
managed a bit more conservatively and went down only 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable still is the fact that his investors don't seem
very alarmed either. ``Redemptions have not been a problem,'' he
said. That could change, however. AMG Data Services estimates that
about 10 percent of the assets in Select Equity, and 20 percent of
those in New Opportunities, have been withdrawn over the last three
weeks. But those figures are dwarfed by earlier inflows, and most
investors appear to be hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the secret to the rebound of the Nasdaq market over
the last 2 1/2 days _ a bounce that provided a 9 percent rise for
New Opportunities and a 10 percent gain for Select Equity. The
people who made a lot of money buying high flying technology stocks
over the previous year, and particularly over the previous six
months, are not convinced that anything has changed. The volatility
may have shaken out some speculators, but many still believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to own the fastest growing companies in the
universe, regardless of price,'' Slattery said. Let others worry
about valuation. He goes for growth, whatever the value. It is an
attitude that drives some veteran money managers crazy. But it has
worked very well for Slattery.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, the 27-year-old Slattery, who uses a nickname rather
than his formal moniker of Frank P. Slattery V, completed his first
year as a fund manager. The fund that was started for him in early
1999, the New Opportunities Fund, was up 622 percent during that
first year. It had been closed to new investors in November, and he
took over another fund, the Select Equity Fund, at that time. Even
with the recent travails, both funds are still up nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery keeps around 80 percent of New Opportunities in what he
views as the 30 fastest growing companies. He says he keeps them
until the growth slows, paying no attention to price. The remainder
of the fund is used for what amounts to day trading as he looks for
stocks that are about to catch the attention of other speculators.
``The stock moves two or three bucks and I move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he keeps the stocks he really likes. One such stock is
MicroStrategy, which produced a return of more than 1,000 percent
for Slattery the first year he owned it. Then the software and
Internet company was forced by its auditors to change its
accounting, and the stock tanked. It is down 82 percent from its
March 10 high, which came on the same day the Nasdaq market peaked.
Slattery figures that Strategy.Com, MicroStrategy's Internet
subsidiary, would trade for more than the $4.7 billion the whole
company is now worth, if it were separated.
</P>
<P>
   What will scare away the investors in such funds? A few bad
weeks won't do it. For many, it will take a long, grinding process,
one that produces bad news in repeated quarterly statements, not
just in newspaper headlines. The belief that growth will justify
any price is still alive.

ILLINOIS' CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE PARISHIONERS TO OPPOSE RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic bishops of Illinois have issued a pastoral
letter calling on the 3.7 million parishioners in their state to
oppose all forms of racist behavior, including the use of bigoted
language and racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, focused on bias against African-Americans, was
posted on the Archdiocese of Chicago's Internet site
(www.archdiocese-chgo.org) on Tuesday, the 32nd anniversary of the
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and is being
mailed this week to parishes in the state's six dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter _ asking Catholics to pray for an end to racism, to
avoid investing in companies with racist policies and to back
public officials committed to racial healing _ is not the first
time that American bishops have spoken out on the issue. In 1979,
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement
describing racism as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, titled ``Moving Beyond Racism: Learning to see
with the Eyes of Christ,'' the bishops wrote: ``Events continue to
remind us that racism thrives.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they cited hate speech on the Internet; the 1998
murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man chained to a pickup truck and
dragged to death in Texas, and the torture of Abner Louima, a
Haitian immigrant, in a New York police station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is so blatantly racist,'' the bishops wrote, ``that
it can shock and therefore move us to ask again how to confront
more effectively the sin of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anita Baird, executive assistant to Cardinal Francis
George, the archbishop of Chicago, said in a telephone interview
that the letter originated in a 1994 request by those working with
black Catholic parishioners in the Illinois dioceses that the
bishops as a group speak out against racism and economic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the process was interrupted by the death of Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, George's predecessor as archbishop, in November
1996. Later, the bishops decided to release the letter in 2000,
which the church has proclaimed a Jubilee Year, a period that
emphasizes themes of conversion and reconciliation.

ILLINOIS' CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE PARISHIONERS TO OPPOSE RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct spelling of `URGE' in hed) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic bishops of Illinois have issued a pastoral
letter calling on the 3.7 million parishioners in their state to
oppose all forms of racist behavior, including the use of bigoted
language and racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, focused on bias against African-Americans, was
posted on the Archdiocese of Chicago's Internet site
(www.archdiocese-chgo.org) on Tuesday, the 32nd anniversary of the
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and is being
mailed this week to parishes in the state's six dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter _ asking Catholics to pray for an end to racism,
avoid investing in companies with racist policies and back public
officials committed to racial healing _ is not the first time that
American bishops have spoken out on the issue. In 1979, the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement
describing racism as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois bishops said that although ``some progress'' had
been made since then, no one should be lulled into believing racism
is no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the case,'' the bishops wrote in the letter,
titled ``Moving Beyond Racism: Learning to see with the Eyes of
Christ.'' They added, ``Events continue to remind us that racism
thrives.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they cited hate speech on the Internet; the 1998
murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man chained to a pickup truck and
dragged to death in Texas, and the torture of Abner Louima, a
Haitian immigrant, in a New York police station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is so blatantly racist,'' the bishops wrote, ``that
it can shock and therefore move us to ask again how to confront
more effectively the sin of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anita Baird, executive assistant to Cardinal Francis
George, the archbishop of Chicago, said in a telephone interview
that the letter originated in a 1994 request by those working with
black Catholic parishioners in the Illinois dioceses that the
bishops as a group speak out against racism and economic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the process was interrupted by the death of Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, George's predecessor as archbishop, in November
1996. Later, the bishops decided to release the letter in 2000,
which the church has proclaimed a Jubilee Year, a period that
emphasizes themes of conversion and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping every member of the parishes will have the
opportunity to read it and have the opportunity to discuss it,''
Sister Baird said.

RUDDER PROBLEM MAY DELAY SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ NASA on Thursday evaluated a rudder problem on the
shuttle Atlantis that could delay the spacecraft's planned April 24
launch to the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   A launch pad test of the shuttle's tail rudder revealed
hydraulic pressure readings three times higher than specified, said
Joel Wells, a spokesman for NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The rudder is used to steer the shuttle as it descends to a
landing and to brake the ship as it speeds down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers were expected to take at least a couple of days to
determine whether a hydraulic system component in the shuttle's
tail compartment was responsible for the high pressure and whether
it can be replaced with Atlantis on the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   If a launch pad repair is feasible, the shuttle and its
seven-member crew could lift off as scheduled. However, if Atlantis
must be transported to its large processing hangar for the work,
the mission could be delayed, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew plans to make several repairs to the
uninhabited first components of the new station and prepare it for
the arrival of Russia's crew module in July.

NAPSTER IS STIRRING PIRACY CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shawn Fanning doesn't look, talk, or walk like a revolutionary.
The 19-year-old from Harwich hardly seems like an incendiary
capable of fueling the wrath of the establishment. But that's
exactly what happened after he began tinkering with a computer as a
freshman at Northeastern University last year. He wrote one little
program, and now the lawyers are sharpening their claws, the
students are circulating petitions, and the pundits are predicting
the beginning of a brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   The program is called Napster, which allows computer users to
share digital music files (called MP3s) almost instantly over the
Internet. Faster and more reliable than other MP3 search engines,
Napster is wildly popular among college and high-school students,
who use it to trade both legal and pirated music. Some folks,
however, are not enthralled. The Recording Industry Association of
America has filed suit, and scores of colleges have banned the
program on their campus computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the guy who started the whole brouhaha write the
program in the first place? ``I was bored,'' Fanning says. ``I had
some free time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fanning has barely had a minute since he dropped out of
college to found Napster, Inc., a startup in San Mateo, Calif.
Fanning himself isn't in the direct firing line; the company
recruited a CEO to handle the business while he puts in long hours
as a software engineer (with stock options, of course). As such,
he's not allowed to talk about the legal issues and seems frazzled
by the controversy. ``I knew Napster had potential,'' he says
during a frequently interrupted phone interview. ``But I didn't
think it would gain this kind of popularity. I didn't think it
would be . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Contentious? Litigious? He finishes the thought this way.
``Handing over the business stuff was not difficult at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company is now embroiled in a lawsuit that could
determine the future of the music industry, which is struggling to
redefine itself in the digital age. Napster (the Mac version is
Rapster) enables each user to post his entire MP3 collection online
for others to download, making it simple for anyone to obtain
high-quality music illegally. For instance, tracks from the new 'N
Sync album, ``No Strings Attached,'' were available for downloading
through Napster on Wednesday, the day after the record hit the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association filed its lawsuit late last
year, contending that Napster facilitates piracy. Artists and their
agents contend that such programs are robbing them of their
royalties. Sean ``Puffy'' Combs says the program is a form of
``abuse,'' while Scott Stapp, lead singer for Creed, has said that
Napster is ``robbing me blind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Napster CEO Eileen Richardson begs to differ. ``We want to
create a place where new artists can keep in touch with their
fans,'' she says. Digital distribution, she argues, makes it
possible for unsigned bands to bypass the insular record industry
and market their music directly to millions of potential fans.
Plus, Richardson says, Napster isn't doing anything illegal itself;
the site (www.napster.com) includes a disclaimer warning users to
obey the copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer or not, the primary use of Napster is to download
pirated music. And the program uses a ton of bandwidth, causing a
different kind of fury at scores of colleges. Indiana University,
for one, banned the program in February. Sophomore Chad Paulson
started www.savenapster.com, a grassroots drive to convince college
administrators to restore access to the program. To date, he has
gathered more than 13,000 signatures on a petition, and this week,
the university announced it was restoring an updated version of
Napster on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   The ban at Indiana never had anything to do with the copyright
issues, says Mark Bruhn, the school's information technology policy
officer. The program was eating up more than 60 percent of the
university's network capacity. ``This isn't a legal issue,'' Bruhn
says. ``A screwdriver isn't illegal unless you use it to break into
a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all college officials agree. Robert Weir, vice president of
information services at Northeastern, banned Napster primarily
because of piracy issues. ``A condition of using our systems is
that you don't do anything illegal, and copyright infringement is
illegal,'' he says, allowing that former Northeastern student
Fanning ``wrote a cool piece of code.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Paulson, who fought to reinstate Napster at Indiana,
doesn't argue that most folks use the program to promote legal
MP3s. ``Piracy is wrong,'' Paulson says, claiming that he only
downloaded one song illegally on Napster and immediately deleted
it. That sounds like the musical equivalent of ``I didn't inhale.''
But Paulson also champions independent bands and legal MP3s on his
Web site and says the Internet will bring democracy to the
oligarchic music business.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, both sides are right, and both sides are wrong.
And it's unclear who is going to win the latest round of the music
wars. But neither outcome is particularly attractive. The music
industry is trying to protect its turf and curtail progress; at the
same time, artists deserve to be paid. ``If the recording industry
wins, we lose the huge social advantages,'' says Harvard Law School
professor William Fisher. ``But if the recording industry loses,
artists' rights are eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher envisions an alternative outcome in the battle, a sort of
new model for the music industry that he whimsically calls ``Doing
Well by Doing Good.'' Under his scenario, artists would release
their music files online in an unprotected format, offering certain
services (such as advance concert tickets) to honest fans who pay
as they play. David Bowie has mastered the concept at
www.davidbowie.com, which offers users everything from Internet
service to CDs (as in compact disc and certificates of deposit).
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's vision is eminently reasonable, since it offers a
compromise that encourages artistic freedom for the masses but
doesn't require artists to work for free. However, the recording
industry isn't going to give in without a fight that could go all
the way to the Supreme Court. And entrepreneurs are not going to
stop coming up with new programs. Just last week, engineers at
Nullsoft, Inc., introduced Gnutella, an open-source program that is
similar to Napster. The only problem was, Nullsoft is owned by
America Online, which recently merged with Time-Warner, which
happens to be a member of the Recording Industry Association.
Gnutella was taken down within hours of its release, but copies are
available all over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's Napster, tomorrow it's Gnutella, and the next day,
it's something else,'' says Northeastern's Weir. And who knows?
Maybe Shawn Fanning will start another revolution some day. ``I
have other ideas I'd like to address,'' he says, ``but right now,
I'd like to get some rest.''

MUCH OF WORLD'S BLOOD SUPPLY IS UNSAFE, SAYS U.N. AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ More than two-thirds of the world's nations are
failing to supply safe blood supplies to their populations,
according to the World Health Organization. Their failure adds
significantly to the spread of the virus that causes AIDS, as well
as potentially deadly forms of hepatitis and other disease.
</P>
<P>
   The countries where people are most at risk are the poorest and
often are those where diseases are spreading fastest, WHO found in
a survey. These countries contain 80 percent of the world's
population, or about 4.8 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, WHO, in cooperation with the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, will begin a campaign to
improve the safety of blood around the world. Friday is World
Health Day, which WHO is marking this year with the safe-blood
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries face obvious cost problems in making the blood
supply safe. But that is not the only cause of the failure, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Poor social policies with a low priority on public health
programs contribute to the problem, as does inadequate testing.
Hospital equipment may be contaminated, sometimes reused, and blood
may be stored improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Most important may be the ubiquitous Third World practice of
buying blood. ``Paid donors, it has been demonstrated many, many
times, are at much higher risk of being infected,'' said Dr. David
Brandling-Bennett, deputy director of the Pan American Health
Organization in Washington. ``That, of course, means that even if
you do good testing, you have a higher risk of missing somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandling-Bennett said in an interview that travelers who visit
developing countries on business usually do not need to fear blood
contamination if they avoid risky behavior and, in emergencies, go
only to hospitals approved by U.S. embassies or consulates. In the
United States, immigrant populations need to have explained to them
the importance of full disclosure when people give blood, he said.
Blood is no longer bought in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Hemisphere, said Dr. Jose Ramiro Cruz, the Pan
American Health Organization's adviser on laboratory and blood
safety, is the world's safest in the handling of blood. ``Data
collected in the last five years from every single country in Latin
America and the Caribbean shows that the position has improved
dramatically,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Other regions are not so lucky, said WHO. It estimates that tens
of thousands of people pick up the virus that causes AIDS and
millions are infected annually with hepatitis B and C, which can
lead to liver failure or liver cancer. South Asia, particularly
India, and Africa are special concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Cahill, an expert on tropical diseases in New York,
and the president of the independent Center for International
Health and Cooperation, said that economics and attitudes both play
a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with many countries where the total health
expenditure per capita is in the range of $15 a year, as in some
African countries, the thought that you can spend that amount
typing and cross-matching blood _ it's a fantasy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just blood-banking is a low priority; health is a low
priority in most developing countries,'' Cahill said. ``Health and
humanitarian issues should be central in foreign policies, not
peripheral issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Women of childbearing age are among the most vulnerable people
in the developing world, experts say. Corinne Whitaker, senior
program officer for Africa at the International Women's Health
Coalition in New York, said this is especially true in societies
where women bear children young and often. They are frequently
anemic and their small size makes them prone to injuries in
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting access to any blood is a challenge in much of
Africa,'' Whitaker said in an interview. ``That's further
complicated by the issue of screening for safe blood.'' She said
that women go to hospitals with ``walking blood banks'' in the form
of relatives to guarantee the availability of blood that is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the blood supply have not been limited to
developing nations. Over the last decade court cases have
demonstrated to what extent early warnings about the virus that
causes AIDS were ignored in the United States, France, Germany,
Switzerland and other countries, with the result that thousands of
hemophiliacs and others in need of blood may have been infected.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pan American Health Organization, Brandling-Bennett and
Cruz say that now the problem is a decrease in donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that countries should be targeting to have about 5
percent of their populations regularly donating blood,''
Brandling-Bennett said. ``The U.S. is at about 4 and a half
percent; Canada is a little over 3 percent.''

BY FAITH, AND A LITTLE TINKERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallelujah. It finally works.
</P>
<P>
   After much tinkering, I've set up the basics of a modern
computer network at my church. At the heart of it all is a gateway
to our high-speed DSL Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   We've had DSL for a couple of months now, and getting it was an
adventure in itself. Bell Atlantic is still a telephone company at
heart, and barely has a clue about delivering good DSL service.
It's not that they don't try; the folks I dealt with were
unfailingly polite.
</P>
<P>
   And I dealt with so many of them. There was one number to call
to order the DSL service, another number for actually setting up an
Internet account, and a third number to call when things went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did. The original installation was scrubbed because
the DSL modem hadn't shown up. Bell Atlantic has the package sent
to the customer, and if it's not there when the installer arrives,
tough luck. We had to start the process all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we eventually got everything we needed. The installer _ a
clever lad who reads my column faithfully _ soon had everything up
and running. But only on one Windows computer.
</P>
<P>
   What about the others? We plan to hold Internet classes for the
members. Our pastor and his secretary want e-mail access. I'd love
to set up a machine in the lobby so visitors can visit our church
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The DSL connection provides Internet downloads at up to 640,000
bits per second. That's plenty for all our needs. The problem was
figuring out how to connect lots of computers to this one line.
It's a problem many of you will soon have. Computers are becoming
almost as popular as TV sets in American homes, and many of us are
starting to network them. Then you get home DSL or cable modem
service, and everybody wants a piece of the Internet. How do they
get it?
</P>
<P>
   I decided that our church needed a gateway _ a computer that
would be dedicated to linking our internal network to the Internet.
I had an old Pentium PC lying around that was well-suited to the
task. It already contained an Ethernet port for connecting to the
church network. I added a second Ethernet card for plugging in the
DSL line.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'd have to get software that would route any Internet
requests from the networked computers to the gateway, then out to
the DSL line. I visited a local computer store to see what was
available.
</P>
<P>
   There are several products for connecting multiple Windows
computers to a single Internet access point _ Ositis Software
Inc.'s WinProxy, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But I was annoyed to discover that WinProxy's price varies
according to the number of computers you want to hook up. It was
$60 for a starter pack, and for that, I could connect just three
computers to the network. The unlimited version of the product
costs $700. Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. offers a cheap alternative. Their upgraded
version of Windows 98, called Second Edition, has a feature called
Internet Connection Sharing that's supposed to make for easy shared
access.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, I decided to dive off the deep end and use the
Linux operating system. Linux, after all, is free, powerful and
versatile. Simple, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic doesn't support DSL for Linux machines.
Fortunately, Roaring Penguin Software Inc.
(www.roaringpenguin.com), a Canadian Linux software firm, makes a
free DSL program. Unfortunately, they only provide the program's
raw ``source code.'' Before you can use it, you must use a program
called a compiler to transform it into machine language. I hadn't
installed the compiler on the computer when I'd installed Linux.
Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But I put it right. Soon I had the Linux box linked to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I took advantage of ``IP masquerading,'' another free
Linux feature that does the same thing as Internet Connection
Sharing. It took a lot of tinkering to make it all work properly.
But now the Linux box hums quietly away, shoveling data packets
back and forth across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And putting additional machines online is a simple matter of
plugging them into a network hub.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the pastor will have his e-mail, our kids and senior
citizens will have Internet training courses, and I'll be free to
spend less time in the computer room and more time in a pew.
Hallelujah.

CUBAN NEIGHBORS TAKE CALMER LOOK AT ELIAN'S PLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ There was no human chain around 170 Cosio
Street Thursday. No angry, fist-waving protesters. No wall of
spotlights, cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the small, black-and-white sketches of the
cherubic boy that dot a blue wall of this modest stucco dwelling,
it would be hard to know that this was where Elian Gonzalez used to
live.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 6-year-old boy's other home, the one in Cuba, the
country he left with his mother back in November and the one that
desperately wants him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need protests here or anything like the circus you
see in Miami,'' said neighbor Carlos Navarro, sitting on a homemade
wooden bench. ``We don't need all that publicity because we don't
tell lies. We want Elian back and we don't want any politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone here is certain that Juan Miguel will come back
with Elian. Some whisper that the father might give in to the
pressure and cajoling of his American relatives to stay in the
United States, while others worry that Elian, having grown
accustomed to his comfortable American lifestyle, might fight
coming back to poor, provincial Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's home here _ and two nearby houses of relatives _ were
locked Thursday, the family still traveling in Havana, the
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he'd really want to come back here?'' one
neighbor said, covering her mouth as if to keep from being heard by
too many people. ``This would be another big change for him. It
will be hard for him to go from having so many things given to
coming back here. He would have to bring his toys.''
</P>
<P>
   As Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, went to the United
State Thursday in hopes of taking back his child, friends, family
and neighbors in this city of 100,000 about 80 miles east of Havana
offered their prayers and support in quiet fortitude. That stood in
sharp contrast to the naked emotions that have been seen and heard
in front of Elian's current residence, his great-uncle's home, in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of family, not an issue for politics,'' said
Elsa Diaz, 59, another of the Gonzalez's neighbors. ``The son
should be with his only surviving parent. We believe and know that,
and we don't have to have protests or violence to prove we're
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's eyes grow wide and her expression goes blank as she
recalls memories of Elian in the neighborhood: there's Elian
playing with toy guns with the boy next door; there he is again,
darting back and forth across the street, callling out for his
mother, Elizabet, who perished on the trip in November across the
Florida Straits; and then there's Elian joining other boys while
bathing in the flooded streets during the summer rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Elian hovers over this street and this town like a friendly
ghost.
</P>
<P>
   In Cardenas, as in Havana and other Cuban towns, there are signs
all over urging for Elian's return. On the front door of Elian's
grandmother's apartment, which sits above a pharmacy, a sign reads,
``You'll return to the heart of your family, town and country,
symbolic boy, heroic boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the freedom of little Elian,'' reads a billboard on the
main road that leads into this small city, where most people work
either in surrounding fields or in the hotels of the nearby resort
city of Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marcelo Salado Primary School, Elian's likeness is
painted in the school's uniform: red pants, crisp white shirt and
red neckerchief. His old desk has been converted into a shrine, and
there's a book containing good wishes and signatures from his
classmates, teachers and even from Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss him and we wish he would come back,'' said one student
named Jose. ``But we don't really understand all of the other
things about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Cubans, the neighbors along Cosio Street got the
news that Juan Miguel would be leaving directly from Castro, who
made the announcement in a nationally televised speech just hours
before his departure.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. Wednesday, Castro joined several members of the
Gonzalez family, which had been brought to Havana from Cardenas
earlier in the week, at the Jose Marti International Airport to say
goodbye to Jose Miguel, his wife and their 6-month-old infant. All
three of them boarded a private jet for Dulles International
Airport outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the lucky few residents who have access to pirated
satellite television signals from the United States or to the
Internet, most of the country's 12 million residents have been
given daily updates on the situation _ filtered through
government-friendly broadcasters _ in a ``roundtable'' transmitted
at 5 p.m. on state-run television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans believe it was inevitable that Juan Miguel Gonzalez
would have to travel to the United States to be reunited with
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child is in danger, then it's your duty as a father to
go get him,'' Victor Matas, 25, said as he sat in a Cardenas
barbershop watching his own 8-year-old son, Victor Jr., get a
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Before the custody controversy began last fall, the Gonzalezes
were like many Cuban families: a core of relatives on the island
with another close branch of the family in Florida, New Jersey or
elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But its clear from friends in the neighborhood _ where this kind
of news travels quickly _ that the battle over Elian has sharply
divided the two families, and the family members that spent
holidays together just a year ago, has stopped talking to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad to see how politics can tear families apart,''
Diaz said.

CENSUS BUREAU ALARMED BY LACK OF RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ON LONG
FORMS
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of concerns raised by some Republican
leaders over the intrusiveness of some census questions, Census
Bureau officials have become alarmed that a smaller percentage of
households are mailing back their census long forms than did so in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials said this week that 48 percent of
households had filled out and returned the long form, compared to
58 percent of those who had mailed back the short form. At a
comparable time in 1990, the response rate for the long form was 6
percentage points behind that of the short form.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, census takers interviewing people in households
that did not mail back the long form were able to close the gap
between the mail-back rates for the short and long forms to 4.5
percentage points. But officials are fearful that unless there is a
significant upturn in the number of households sending in the long
form, the gap might not be significantly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can be,'' said William Barron, deputy
director of the Census Bureau. ``I don't think it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The long form is a 53-question form that is mailed to one in six
households nationwide. It asks people to provide personal data on
things like income, the amount of time it takes to commute to work,
the amount paid for utilities, and what kind of plumbing facilities
are in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast the short form contains only eight questions and
only seeks information about things like name, age, sex, race and
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways this year's long form is less intrusive than in
years past. In 1990, the long form had 58 questions, in 1980 it had
65. And this year's form pales in comparison to the long form of
1940, which had 83 questions.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the long form are considered critically important,
especially for the economic data that government produces. They are
used as the base for such items as the consumer expenditure survey,
a key component of the consumer price index. Long form data are
also used to develop the monthly unemployment figures issued by the
Labor Department and the National Crime Victimization Survey that
is put out by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a serious matter,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a West Chester, Pa., economic
forecasting company. ``The census data is a key ingredient in
nearly all other economic statistics that the government produces.
It's used in the construction of many of the surveys that the
government issues in the years after the census.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks as the Census Bureau has received numerous
complaints from the public that many of the questions on the long
form were too personal and too nosy. Census Bureau officials say
the level of complaint from the public is not significantly
different from what it was in 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican leaders, responding to some of the
complaints, suggested last week that people fill out the form and
simply skip questions they find objectionable. Campaigning in
Milwaukee last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the probable
Republican presidential nominee, said people ought to mail back
their form and ``If they're worried about the government intruding
into their personal lives, they ought to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A private survey conducted for the Census Bureau indicated that
in the first two weeks after the forms were mailed out, 10 per cent
of those polled said they believed the census was too intrusive,
according to kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director. In the
third week, as news accounts appeared detailing concerns of some
Republicans over the questions, the number of people who said the
census was being too intrusive jumped to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House have sharply criticized the actions of
these Republicans, noting that the Census Bureau had sent copies of
potential questions to Congress in 1997 and 1998 and asked for
comments. They received none.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 and 1998 not one of these sanctimonious census
reformers said one thing when they received books on their desks
that said this is what we're going to ask,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney of New York, who is the ranking Democrat on the House
Subcommittee on the Census.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Republican leaders have been scrambling not to be
seen as trying to undermine the census. On Thursday, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois; Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, head of
the House Republican Conference, and Rep Dan Miller of Florida,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Census, held a joint news
conference to urge people to complete their forms, though they
still left out the possibility for people to skip some questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every American ought to fill it out to the best of
their ability,'' Hastert said. ``If they have reservations about
their phone number or some things that they think are private, I
think that's a condition that they ought to be able to make their
own decision on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Republican leaders sought to be seen as friends of
the census, some business groups that rely heavily on census data
feel the 2000 Census may already be irreparably damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow's out of the barn,'' said David Crowe, staff vice
president of the National Association of Home Builders. ``We've had
some very negative statements from some influential politicians. I
don't know how you counteract that.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Super recliner an easy-does-it hit

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ What comes out of this normally sleepy
Piedmont town over the next seven days will dictate what you will
buy, or at least, want for your home right now.
</P>
<P>
   Like the fashion shows that control what we wear, the world's
largest furniture market, held here each spring and fall, controls
how we nest.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are the emerging ``must-haves'' after Day One?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chintz Charming. What better way to title a press luncheon
where New York designer Mario Buatta, aka ``The Prince of Chintz,''
rolled out his new collection for John Widdicomb Co. as 70,000
retailers and interior designers poured into town on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The eight pieces, reflecting New York 1930s glamour, include a
cocktail table, drawer chest, sofas, chairs and ottomans, with
subtle fabric designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone came through with the chintz repellent,''
said the comical Buatta, known to lighten his design talks with
such antics as tipping his toupee to the audience. ``But decorating
always follows fashion, and everything's cleaner here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lazy surfing. La-Z-Boy and Microsoft subsidiaries WebTV
Networks wowed shoppers with their ``E-Cliner,'' a chair with all
the plush comfort of a recliner but with an arm-attached keyboard
that allows the occupant to surf the Web, send e-mails, watch TV
and plan their show lineup without sitting at a desk (left).
Expected retail: $1,049. ``Reaction has been phenomenal,'' La-Z-Boy
spokeswoman Kay Degenhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hemingway's Paris. Thomasville Furniture has added a new group
to its Ernest Hemingway Collection of pieces inspired by the
author's homes and travels.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alexander Julian. The Home Improvement Warehouse is bringing
fashion and furnishings designer Julian aboard with a new
do-it-yourself decorating program for the chain using _ you guessed
it _ Julian's lamps, rugs and wallpapers.

DELL'S NEW LAPTOPS IMPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Dell's Latitude laptops were the gold standard for
many businesses with employees on the go. The company's new
Inspiron line of mobile computers carries on this proud tradition,
with many enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   These computers have screens so large and keyboards so good that
a growing number of businesses are purchasing Dell Inspiron 3800
laptops as desktop replacements. Although I think this is a
mistake, it's easy to see why a company might be lulled into such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspiron 3800 is an impressive machine. It can be purchased
with a huge 14.1-inch liquid crystal display that has a larger
visible area than many 15-inch video tubes. Unlike other laptop
vendors, which force users to choose between a track pad and an
eraser-like pointer-stick device, the Inspiron 3800 comes with
both. It has stereo speakers built into its base, a built-in modem,
and the full complement of ports.
</P>
<P>
   There are two bays underneath the keyboard. The one on the right
can hold a battery. The one on the left can hold a battery, a
CD-ROM drive, or a DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you need to shut the machine down if you want to
swap the floppy for the CD-ROM. You can also put a blank piece of
plastic into the right-hand bay, which lightens the load on the
system somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with many new laptops, the new Dell battery has a
built-in meter: Just push a white button on the side, and five LEDs
indicate the charge. You must remove the battery from the unit to
use the meter, though.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has also caught iMac fever: Its 3800 series comes in four
colors, midnight gray, Tahoe blue, forest green, and Sierra maroon.
The case is textured with a denim-style print, which makes it
easier to hold and hides fingerprints. Unlike some other laptops,
the screen folds flat to the table, which in some circumstances can
prevent it from breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, one of the most difficult things a laptop
does during day-to-day operations is suspend and resume. Some
laptops do it well. Others never seem to wake up properly. Here,
the 3800 has an uneven history. Speaking with friends whose
companies have adopted the machines, I have learned that some 3800s
have no problem waking up, while others seem to crash frequently.
This may be the result of software that's been added, or it may be
the result of manufacturing problems and minor hardware and
software differences between machines.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's reputation for service is good, but not terrific. The
company prefers to do tech support through its Web site, which is
great as long as you have a working computer. In the past two
years, several friends have had Dell equipment speedily replaced if
it broke down within the company's three-year warranty period.
</P>
<P>
   But one co-worker repeatedly had his tech-support queries lost,
because somebody at Dell mistyped his name. Dell made amends by
replacing his laptop's motherboard free of charge, even though the
warranty period had passed, but that might not have happened if I
hadn't intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Te 3800 is available in a wide range of configurations. The
slowest processor is a 450 Mhz Celeron; the fastest is a 650 Mhz
Pentium III with Intel's new SpeedStep technology, which lets the
processor run faster when you are plugged into the wall, but slower
with batteries. The screen is either 12.1 or 14.1 inches (both in
the XGA resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels).
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $1,638 (small screen, slow processor, with
32MB of RAM) to $2,864 (fast processor, big screen, 96MB).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's just the beginning of Dell's laptop
configuration extravaganza. You can boost the system's memory to
512MB ($1,700), replace the 4.8GB hard drive with an 18GB drive
($449), swap the floppy with a 120MB superdisk drive ($139), and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite option is a second lithium ion battery ($99). Get
three, and you can forget about carrying around a charger.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other vendors, Dell will also sell you a second 18GB hard
drive ($598).
</P>
<P>
   These prices are all pretty good. Dell sells a high-performance
laptop for less than $500 above the price of a similarly configured
desktop system.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, too many companies are forsaking desktops and
giving their employees laptops to use at home, at work, and on the
road. The two problems with this strategy are ergonomics and
durability.
</P>
<P>
   Typing on a laptop keyboard (which has keys that don't move as
far as on a full-size keyboard) and looking down at a laptop screen
for eight hours a day is an invitation to eye strain, neck aches,
and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Dell is a strong computer, the fragile
connectors on its back and sides are not. If you constantly plug
and unplug cords and connectors, they will break.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a simple solution: another Dell accessory,
of course. It's Dell's Home Base Bundle, which includes a port
replicator, a full-size keyboard, and a mouse. The port replicator
connects to the big docking connector on the back. You leave your
desktop gear connected to the replicator, and slide your laptop in
and out as you need it.

 &HT;    POW in Germany risked life to photograph what he saw; his mages
go on display at the National Prisoner of War Museum in
Andersonville, Ga.
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSONVILLE, Ga. _ Angelo Spinelli never shot a single German
soldier, but he was decorated for shooting many of his friends.
With a camera.
</P>
<P>
   The only U.S. prisoner of war known to have taken photographs
while in captivity, Spinelli, now 83, has donated more than 400
negatives he shot in German stalags to the National Prisoner of War
Museum in Andersonville. He'll be honored today when the museum
opens an exhibit of 92 of his little-seen pictures, taken in three
German POW camps between 1943 and 1945, each at the risk of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sanchez, the museum's chief curator, maintains that
Spinelli deserves the Medal of Honor, because every time he took
one of 1,200 pictures, ``he was performing way beyond the call of
duty.'' Sanchez is spearheading a campaign by the National Park
Service to convince the Pentagon that Spinelli deserves the
nation's highest award for heroism and valor.
</P>
<P>
   The negatives were sought by museums around the country.
Spinelli says he decided ``Andersonville should get them because
it's the one place that honors all POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big coup for us,'' Sanchez says. ``It's
unbelievable.'' According to the museum, no other American prisoner
in any war has managed to take photographs inside a prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is timed to coincide with the second anniversary of
the POW museum, erected to honor all U.S. war prisoners. After
Memorial Day, the exhibit will be sent to the 8th Air Force Museum
near Savannah, then to the Fort Benning National Infantry Museum
and, next January, to the state Capitol in Atlanta. Museums across
the country already are lining up to get it after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told these negatives are priceless,'' says Spinelli,
who owned a jewelry store in New York before retiring to
Hallandale, Fla., in 1989. ``But money you could spend and forget
about it. I want the collection to be available to all Americans,
so they will know what POWs and all soldiers endure. I told my son,
`Money doesn't do nothing. Let's donate them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spinelli's pictures capture both the grim realities of POW life
_ a Russian prisoner shot dead reaching for a cigarette, Americans
sleeping outdoors to escape their lice-infested barracks _ and the
sometimes humorous ways the soldiers learned to cope _ GIs clowning
as women, playing baseball or just goofing around. One baseball
picture shows Mickey Grasso, who made the major leagues after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Other images show the mundane side of camp life: men carrying
water, walking away from the latrine, dividing food parcels from
the International Red Cross, cooking over small stoves or standing
near dreary barracks in deep snow. One photo shows Spinelli himself
_ he'd handed his camera to a friend _ reading a letter from home
beside a Christmas tree loaded with homemade decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted into the Army in 1941, Spinelli was assigned to a combat
photography training unit because he had taken pictures in high
school and loved cameras. Rising to the rank of sergeant, he was
told to photograph whatever reflected GI life.
</P>
<P>
   After he landed in North Africa, for several months the only
action he saw was awards ceremonies. But on Valentine's Day 1943,
Spinelli and a dozen other men were assigned to take some German
POWs to the rear. They got lost, and ``all of a sudden we were
right in the middle of the Battle of Kasserine Pass,'' he says.
``In no time we were surrounded by Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a prisoner of the men who had been his prisoners.
``Prior to being caught, I spoke with the Germans and gave them
cigarettes and chocolates,'' he says. ``That paid off. I thought
they were going to kill us, but they treated us fine. They took us
out of our locked room for breakfast, lunch and dinner at a place
overlooking the Mediterranean.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, he was put on a plane for Sicily, then to Naples,
Italy. There, he boarded a reeking boxcar to Stalag III-B, near
Furstenburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, the prisoners in Spinelli's camp began
receiving Red Cross parcels, which contained cigarettes. Some GIs
traded cigarettes to German soldiers, so he approached an older man
who claimed not to be a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   They struck up a kind of quasi-friendship, and Spinelli offered
the German cigarettes in exchange for a camera and film.
Surprisingly, the German agreed, and soon handed over a compact
Voightlander Besser 20 mm folding bellows camera. (Spinelli is also
donating the camera to the Ander-

</P>
<P>
   sonville museum.)
</P>
<P>
   sonville museum.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Spinelli was trading cigarettes regularly for film,
even a tripod. The German even took the film to a nearby town and
had prints made, which Spinelli hid carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``My orders were to take pictures of anything that would be of
interest to us, so I took the chance and took them,'' he says. ``If
they'd have caught me, I'd have been a dead man. Cameras were
strictly verboten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told we were going to die anyway,'' he adds. ``At that
age, I didn't have any fear. If I'm gonna die later, so I die
sooner, and at least I have left evidence behind, they will know
how Americans lived in a POW camp.''
</P>
<P>
   To take the photos, he attached a strap to the camera that
allowed it to hang down to waist level, and concealed it in baggy
paratrooper pants. ``The guys would watch out for me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He kept taking pictures after he was moved to Stalag III-A, just
south of Berlin, in January 1945. Somehow, the guards searching the
prisoners overlooked his tucked-away camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was with me,'' he says. ``If they'd have found it, I
wouldn't be here now.''
</P>
<P>
   By spring, Russian troops closed in. One morning all the Germans
were gone. Spinelli, who had lost 35 pounds to weigh 115 during his
imprisonment, hitched a ride to American lines. He arrived in New
York in June.
</P>
<P>
   He showed his photos around, and got them published in a YMCA
pamphlet. But when he contacted Time-Life Books, he was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editor had them on his desk for four weeks,'' said
Spinelli. ``Being young, I got disgusted, and said, `You don't want
to publish them, give 'em back.' I put them in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later, Time-Life editors stumbled onto the
YMCA pamphlet at the Library of Congress, contacted Spinelli and
published several of his photos in a book, ``Prisoners of World War
II.'' Later, in 1988, when President Reagan went to Moscow, CBS
News did a piece on Russian and American POWs, and Spinelli had a
few minutes of fame, along with a few of his pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a few have been published. When Spinelli tried to
strike a deal with Yale University _ his negatives in return for
tuition for his three grandchildren _ he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Now a widower bowed with a severe case of osteoporosis, Spinelli
remains feisty when recalling his years as a POW. ``I almost died
several times,'' he says. ``One time I got shot through the pants,
just below the groin, when I went over the warning fence for a
baseball. Two holes in there. Guess it's good I'm bow-legged.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinelli credits his faith for his survival, but also a
determination to do his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to take pictures,'' he says, ``and I did.''

<P>
   XIALING, China _ The air was thick with incense and the
cacophony of homemade horns recently as the people of this village
on China's southern coast prepared to celebrate their most sacred
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning a procession led by the village elders dressed in
blue robes and wide-brimmed hats moved up the hill to Xialing's
elaborate tiled temple, adorned with brightly colored beasts.
</P>
<P>
   After a luncheon feast, the 350 residents of the village, in
Guangdong Province, gathered around a makeshift altar beside the
highway to make offerings, sing and pay homage to four carved
wooden deities: the Heaven Mother, the King of Three Mountains, the
Grandfather of Virtue and the Grandfather of Wealth. Unmarried
girls in white jackets and floppy white hats tended incense sticks
the size of rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   The incense may evoke Buddhism and the gods may resemble Taoist
deities, but the villagers have no interest in such formal faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, this is not Taoism or Buddhism,'' said Zeng Qingle,
66, his gold teeth gleaming under the huge brim of his hat. ``This
is our own rdligion and local tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers here primarily worship the Heaven Mother _ ``our own
special god,'' Zeng explained _ ``who brings the village
prosperity, harmony, wealth and strong children.''
</P>
<P>
   All over rural China there has been a renaissance of
idiosyncratic home-grown religions. It started in the 1980s but has
quickened in the last five years, fueled by increasing prosperity
and relaxed government control.
</P>
<P>
   Although China's leaders have spent much of the last year
denouncing cults and superstition, in part to justify their ban on
the Falun Gong spiritual movement, they have mostly turned a blind
eye toward the abundance of folk religions that have re-emerged as
a focus of rural life.
</P>
<P>
   Although such religions were common in pre-Communist China,
their practices and ceremonies were labeled ``feudal remnants'' and
banned during the first 30 years of Communist rule. Today virtually
every village on the southern coast has at least one temple or
shrine, generallY devoted to ancestors or local deities.
</P>
<P>
   In tiny Xialing, traditional ceremonies were disbanded in the
early 1950s, and the village's old temple was smashed to bits in
1966 during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Religious ceremonies were not revived in the village until 1992,
and its temple was rebuilt several years later, said Zheng Xiaoren,
a village elder. ``At that time our village had become very poor,
and we were eager to revive the ceremony and the temple to bring
fortune and prosperity to our town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China has four officially sanctioned religions _ Buddhism,
Taoism, Christianity and Islam _ and praying to spirits or deities
is officially ridiculed and strongly discouraged. Still, the local
authorities often have a strange symbiosis with the indigenous
temples, which have become powerful economic and social forces.
</P>
<P>
   Many temples have grown rich from the donations of villagers,
and a number spend that money on public works, like planting trees
or building a school, as a means of honoring gods or ancestors.
This assistance has been a boon to cash-strapped local governments,
which are in no position to refuse the aid on ideological grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the government has branded these movements as
superstitions or even cults, in reality the local government often
arrives at an understanding with the local temple,'' said Luo
Hongguang, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
who has studied the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these religions have become a focal point of village
life, he said, providing a framework to replace the rigid Communist
system of the Mao era, which has now largely crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These religions bring together individuals who would otherwise
be loose and scattered,'' Luo said, ``and they also give guidance
and significance to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival is occurring all over China, he said, but is most
prominent in the southern coastal regions, where the economy has
grown quickly and clan ties have remained powerful. In many
villages in this part of Guangdong every household shares the same
surname. In Xialing, for example, most villagers are named Zheng or
Zeng.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this part of China the number of rich has grown quickly,''
Luo said. ``Now people have more wealth and more freedom how they
spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Xialing, a poor farming village of simple gray brick homes,
villagers raised $50,000 to rebuild their temple and replace its
statues, and they contribute $5,000 to pay for their annual
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It is an astounding sum in a region with an annual per capita
rural income of less than $500, in a village that recently shut its
elementary school for lack of funds. But the people believe that
donations to the temple will be repaid abundantly with good luck
and wealth in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All villagers contribute money as they can afford it,'' said
Zheng Xiaorun, the village elder. ``Richer ones give more and
poorer ones give less.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Xialing's 100 or so native sons who have gone to work in
cities still send donations home. ``They often can't come here _
travel is expensive _ but they want to enjoy the good fortune a
donation brings,'' Zheng explained.
</P>
<P>
   In some places the local religion has far outstepped the local
government in its influence on people's lives. Last year, 200,000
people attended the annual celebration at the Black Dragon Temple
in a sparsely populated region of central Shaanxi Province, said
Luo, who has studied that sect.
</P>
<P>
   People from miles around went to pray and to ask the Black
Dragon, a rain and water god, advice on matters large and small, he
said. Petitioners buy slips of papers inscribed with historical
parables or sayings from ancient scholars, which are supposed to
yield clues that will aid in decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the Black Dragon Temple has become wealthy, even
hiring traditional opera troupes to perform at its annual temple
fair. As the temple has grown, local officials have made it
officially register as a Taoist temple, although its practices do
not really resemble that religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the head of the temple is at all scared of the
government,'' Luo said. ``The two sides accommodate, and there are
usually not too many conflicts, unless they get too independent,
like Falun Gong. Then it's an entirely different matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Xialing the government has adopted a hands-off policy toward
its little shrine, although some tension remains. ``Since opening
up and reform, we've had freedom of faith, so the government does
not dare interfere,'' Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of local religions owes some of its success to the
same sense of social dislocation that gave rise to Falun Gong,
which was wildly popular before it was outlawed last summer. But
their practices have little in common with Falun Gong's ascetic
philosophy, which focuses on personal spiritual growth through
exercise and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   In local religions the goals tend to be unabashedly down to
earth _ a new job, more rain, a new son _ and the methods center on
exuberant excess.
</P>
<P>
   In Xialing this year, as horns wailed, drums thumped and huge
red banners flapped in the breeze, Zheng Lin, 63, a businessman
with cropped hair, giddily viewed the lavish ceremony to honor
Xialing's gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' he said. ``As our little village has become more
prosperous, this celebration has become bigger and bigger each
year.''

FILLING SEATS WITH ONLINE DISCOUNTS

<P>
   Ticket discounts for online customers, already favored by the
airlines for filling empty seats, are rapidly spreading to sports _
and entertainment might be next. But the same technology that
allows discounts is also likely to allow higher prices for some of
the sports and entertainment seats that everyone wants.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association offer
discounts to anyone who signs up for ``Nets News'' online
bulletins. Last week, the team offered $50 seats to Sunday's
Detroit Pistons game for $20, and $20 seats for $17.
</P>
<P>
   Since last season, Texas Rangers followers who signed up on the
Web for the baseball team's fan club, Inside Pitch, have received
e-mail offers of steep discounts. Hockey fans get similar breaks
from the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly successful,'' said Jeff Cogan, executive vice
president of the Southwest Sports Group, a company led by the
Dallas investor Thomas O. Hicks that owns the Stars and Rangers.
Aided by data from online sales, Cogan is also considering higher
ticket prices for games on weekends or against popular rivals for
the Stars this fall and for the Rangers next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of online ticket sales makes it much easier for
sports teams or entertainment companies to gather data and set
prices according to demand. The newest technology will let online
buyers print their own tickets rather than having to wait for them
to arrive by mail or pick them up at box offices.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, fans attending sports events at the Staples
Center in Los Angeles, the First Union Center in Philadelphia and
22 other sites will be among the first in the nation to use tickets
they printed on their own computers. Within a year, that capability
is likely to spread to wired patrons of most major theater chains,
stadiums, arenas and performing arts centers.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting convenience is expected to help raise online
ticket sales from $300 million last year to $4 billion by 2004,
according to Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Sports and entertainment executives are already debating whether
they are entering a new era of pricing seats according to demand.
W. Thomas Gimble, chief executive of Tickets.com, based in Costa
Mesa, Calif., which has formed partnerships with the Stars and the
Rangers, has no doubts. ``When you can print your own tickets, it
busts apart the old rules of selling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sports teams, promoters and entertainers, fearful of
alienating their fans, are proceeding cautiously, especially in
raising prices. In November, Tickets.com began auctioning some
prime seats for Elton John and Backstreet Boys concerts at an
average of 45 percent over face value, but the extra proceeds go to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of movie theaters and some concert halls are openly
skeptical. Mark Pascucci, a senior vice president of Loews Cineplex
Entertainment, which has 2,900 screens, says that discounted movie
tickets for some shows would only steal audiences from others.
``There's no practical reason for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loews is joining the Regal and Edwards theater chains to begin
an online ticketing service this summer. Movietickets.com, based in
Boca Raton, Fla., and owned by the National Amusements theater
chain, AMC Theaters and CBS, plans to begin selling movie tickets
online over Memorial Day weekend. Both groups plan to let filmgoers
to print their tickets at home, beginning in December. To attract
customers, both sites plan to forgo service charges for at least
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets printed at home on standard paper and printers will
include bar codes that can be scanned by readers at theaters and
stadiums. The printouts might also include driving directions,
seating charts, parking coupons or restaurant advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Stars, however, have already gone a step
further, using software from Talus Solutions of Atlanta that helps
airlines and hotels gauge demand and set their rates. Marriott
International uses Talus software to set as many as 10 different
rates for identical hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium and team owners are especially eager to fill empty
seats, because so much of their revenue comes from food, drink and
souvenirs. ``To those owners, it's a big deal, regardless of what
patrons pay for the tickets,'' said Tom R. Madison, president of
Talus Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, wanting to fill some of the 15,000 seats that, on
average, remain empty in their stadium, are also offering breaks
like free extra tickets or coupons for discounted food and
beverages to frequent ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is the perfect opportunity to introduce dynamic
pricing because so many seats go unsold,'' said Gimble of
Tickets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gimble's company also expects to allow ticket buyers to print
their own tickets beginning this summer for some of its 4,100 other
sites, which include those at Lincoln Center. But sports teams are
more likely to adopt variable pricing than the entertainment
industry, Gimble said.

   BETHESDA, Md. _ Standing on common soil with his 6-year-old son
for the first time in more than four months, Juan Miguel Gonzalez
unleashed a torrent of angry words against Elian's guardians in
Miami Thursday, even as US officials indicated as much confidence
as ever that the boy would soon be returned to his father's care.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Elian had been subjected to ``cruel psychological
pressures'' by ``some distant relatives who had never seen him
before,'' Gonzalez, 31, vowed to reclaim custody of the boy as soon
as possible. He delivered the heated remarks at a dramatic airport
news conference shortly after dawn, then retreated, with his wife
and infant child, to the suburban Washington home of a Cuban
official for the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance in the nation's capital did little to deter
public attacks from the Miami relatives of Elian, who have cared
for the child since his ill-fated sea journey from Cuba last
Thanksgiving, and who have resisted every entreaty to send the boy
back home. Late Thursday, as talks between the Miami relatives and
federal attorneys broke down, a family spokesman said the
Immigration and Naturalization Service had announced it would carry
out its longstanding threat: to revoke Elian's parole and transfer
custody to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said
that despite 40 hours of negotiation the US officials refused to
make a single concession. That resistance remained strong with
Thursday's arrival of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will not guarantee that it will not take Elian
away or try to take Elian away in the middle of the night,''
Pedrosa said at a news conference outside the Miami federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton viewed Gonzalez's arrival as a ``positive step
toward ultimately reuniting a father with his son,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said
Gonzalez's presence ``adds an immediacy'' to the agency's goal of
resolving the case, which has resurrected four-decade-old tensions
between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe his being in the United States will help us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by late afternoon, officials could not report any
progress in resolving the greatest public relations puzzle: exactly
how Elian might be turned over to his father's care.
</P>
<P>
   The family expects to be told where to deliver Elian to Gonzalez
or US representatives as early as Monday. But protesters, many of
them Cubans who fled the regime of Fidel Castro years ago, are
conducting a near-round-the-clock vigil outside the Miami home
where Elian is currently housed, making it virtually impossible for
US officials to retrieve the boy against the relatives' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, protesters suggested they would block even Gonzalez
from taking his son away _ although Gregory B. Craig, the attorney
for the father, indicated he was unlikely to show up in such a
hostile environment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Gonzalez's arrival and attempt to communicate
through the media did not convince the Miami protesters of his
sincerity in wanting the best for his son. After watching his
speech, broadcast live on national TV, many dismissed Gonzalez's
words as too impersonal, too controlled, to have been written by
anyone but Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cancio, 27, and the mother of a boy around Elian's age,
said she remained convinced the boy is better off with distant
relatives in Miami than with his father in Havana. She said she
believes that ``deep down'' Gonzalez knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just reading a speech today,'' she said. ``Those were
written words and they aren't his words.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rita Oliva, a 32-year-old college student and mother of a
13-year-old son, put it: ``I think Fidel Castro should win the
Oscar for best director. And did you see that suit they had made
for him? He looked like a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez arrived from Havana wearing a tailored, dark blue suit
and a lighter blue shirt and tie. After flying in by private jet,
he greeted a throng of reporters at the airport, with his wife,
Nersy, holding their 6-month-old, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke through a translator, appearing quietly angry but
controlled. At one point, a handful of anti-Castro protesters
shouted so loudly that Gonzalez could hardly be heard. Later,
critics said it was a mistake for him to appear in Washington at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a sad day,'' Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the
Cuban American National Foundation, said. ``We have said from the
beginning that we welcome Juan Miguel in the United States. It's
just sad he took the plane to Washington and not to Miami to come
and embrace his son.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez does regain custody of Elian, he will be free to
leave for Cuba immediately, an INS official said.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the ongoing negotiations, Gonzalez has agreed to
stay in the United States until all the custody proceedings are
resolved. The INS ruled in early January that the Miami relatives
should return Elian to his father, and it has been widely assumed
ever since that the 6-year-old will eventually go home. But his
Miami relatives have appealed to a federal court in Atlanta, where
the case is scheduled to be heard May 11. If that fails, the
relatives' only remaining course would be an appeal to the US
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   An INS official said the agency expected Elian to be returned to
his father long before the May 11 court date.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Miami relatives had demanded that
government psychologists examine Elian and accept their
recommendations concerning the boy's future. Thursday, lawyers for
the relatives said the government had balked. Attorney Roger
Bernstein said: ``The government is still unwilling to speak to
Elian and understand what he is feeling.''

PLAYING SOLITAIRE AT WORK? SOFTWARE LETS EMPLOYERS TRACK YOUR 
MOVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY E. NEVALA   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been used to catch a Connecticut embezzler and an Eastern
Washington electronic solitaire whiz playing on company time. An
Oregon law firm installed it to snag employees planning vacations
at work, and a Virginia consulting company fired a man after
watching him spend days e-mailing friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers use this to find out what's happening in their
business,'' said Richard Eaton, the Kennewick, Wa.-based developer
of Investigator, a software sleuth that nets employees who use
their computers to slack off or sneak around _ and more _ on
company time.
</P>
<P>
   Stealthy software programs like Eaton's enable employers to
watch every tap of the their employees' keyboard _ including
deletions never stored or used in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   Memos typed, e-mail sent, proposals drafted and Web sites
visited _ all can be viewed by bosses without the employees'
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator software users pooh-pooh their Orwellian powers and
lavish praise on a program they say tightens security and helps
eliminate workplace slouches and cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates worry about the fuzzy laws still
surrounding the workplace computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees often think they have privacy rights, when in fact
they have very little,'' said Jeff Mathias, an Iowa attorney and
employment law producer with the Seattle-based Prairielaw.com, a
legal issues Web site.
</P>
<P>
   No federal laws specifically address the issue, and in court
cases regarding workplace computer privacy, employers more often
emerge victorious, Mathias said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, former Microsoft employee Bill McLaren Jr. argued in
a Texas court that Microsoft invaded his privacy by reading his
e-mail stored in a ``personal folders'' application on his office
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The courts ruled for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument is that since the computer belongs to the
company, they have a right to view everything on it,'' Mathias
said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer monitoring is completely legal, said Eaton, who
describes his $99 Investigator software as ``a security audit
trail. It's there in case there is trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He has sold more than 6,500 licenses worldwide to corporations,
government agencies, businesses and private individuals since he
developed the program in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Daily sales jumped from five licenses to 20 this month after the
Wall Street Journal included Investigator in a story.
</P>
<P>
   Customers include Exxon Mobil Corp., Delta Air Lines, Lockheed
Martin Corp. and Ernst &AMP; Young LLP. Government users include the
U.S. State Department, the Navy and the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Competing computer-monitoring software Silent Watch, which
allows stealth surveillance of 50 computers from a central PC, has
enjoyed similar success, said Roy Young, vice president for sales
and marketing of Adavi Inc. in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month our sales increased 53 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of similar programs, including pcAnywhere, Desktop
Surveillance, RealSecure and CyberCop can be purchased from
software companies or downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a demand,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of U.S. companies engage in electronic
surveillance of their employees, according to a 1999 American
Management Association survey. That includes companies which watch
Internet and e-mail, monitor telephone calls and use video
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Banking, brokerage, insurance and real estate industries lead
among those who monitor, the survey said. Performance review and
legal compliance topped the list of reasons for employee
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Nabbing cyberslackers, e-mail-happy employees and computer game
enthusiasts are others.
</P>
<P>
   In Orondo, Wash., John Auvil installed Investigator after
workers at his fruit company habitually shrugged at the ``no gaming
on company time'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty minutes after we installed it, boom, we caught someone
playing solitaire,'' said Auvil, the company's network
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty employee, a man killing time while defrosting company
refrigerators, received a verbal reprimand but still has his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Privacy Act, which prohibits recording private
communications by phone, radio, telegraph or other device without
the consent of all parties, does not apply to e-mail and online
chats, according to Spokane County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the judge in a Spokane case _ involving a man
trapped in a sting operation while seeking sex with minors he met
online _ ruled that Washington's privacy law does not apply to
computer communications.
</P>
<P>
   The words of the statute do not specifically mention computers
as a covered device, the judge concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have had little success passing workplace computer
privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   In October, California's governor vetoed a bill that would have
required employers to notify workers when monitoring e-mail traffic
and computer files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws like this are seen as anti-business and anti-industry,''
said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association survey found that 84 percent
of companies inform their employees of surveillance policies
through bulletin board postings or during hiring orientations.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said he added a warning default statement commonly used on
government computers to his Investigator software.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is visible at the discretion of the installer
during the log-in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals using this computer system without, or in excess
of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities
on the system monitored and recorded by system personnel,'' it
reads in part.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Maltby, president of the non-profit National Workrights
Institute in New Jersey, argues companies could go a step further
than simply warning their employees that they are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that companies track the time people spend on the
Web, rather than spying on every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of rummaging through every computer file, Maltby
said companies should specifically target the file in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, employers have a right to know if their employees are
doing illegal things. But if your boss wants to read your personal
e-mail for fun, he can do it,'' Maltby said. ``And that's just not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigator is nearly impossible for the user to detect and
even harder to kill from the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic,'' said a network administrator at a Portland, Ore.,
law firm after Investigator caught one of his employees building
personal home pages on company time and another scouring vacation
sites and buying books online.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut real estate manager last month used Investigator
to catch an employee siphoning money from his firm to her personal
bank account via a company computer.
</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia, Doug Dobrynski recorded two employees at his
government consulting business who spent their days
instant-messaging friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent entire days just goofing off. We're talking zero
productivity,'' said Dobrynski, the company's director of
management information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The company fired one employee and the other left voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said 90 percent of his Investigator licenses sell to
business and industry. Private individuals, from suspicious spouses
to parents of cybersavvy teenagers, make up the other 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Compson, a Maryland mother of four daughters, programmed
Investigator to send daily reports of her teenagers' online
discussions to her laptop computer while she vacationed in
Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Compson said she worried about the strangers her children met in
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can trust your children to an extent, but you have to keep
their safety in mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said he created Investigator's first version as a help
system to track tangles encountered by his software system testers.
</P>
<P>
   By seeing each keystroke, Eaton eliminated the problem-causing
guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When glitches happened we had no way of tracing that. We
couldn't see what caused the software to crash,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has used Investigator for similar purposes, Eaton said. The
program allowed its scientists in one state to witness every detail
of computer work happening thousands of miles away, saving time and
money flying personnel across the country to monitor work.
</P>
<P>
   While Investigator and programs like it have ruffled some
feathers, ``they are neither good nor bad, they're just tools,''
said Bill Machrone, vice president of technology for Ziff-Davis, a
New York computer magazine publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Software monitoring programs are like a hammer, he said. ``You
can build a house with a hammer, or you can kill somebody with
it.''

 &HT;    Get wired without a PC
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to check your e-mail but don't have time to fire
up the computer? Check it on your cell phone or from the dashboard
of your car.
</P>
<P>
   Need some sports scores but left your laptop in your trunk?
Punch a few buttons on your Web wristwatch and you're online in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the escalating consumer clamor for easy e-mail and
user-friendly online access, technology companies have been racing
to develop more and more methods for connecting to the Web without
a clunky computer. These new gadgets are appealing to two markets:
Techno-savvy users who want on-the-go Internet and people
uncomfortable with PCs who just want a taste of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``As computers become easier to use, there's still some level of
technology that's beyond most people,'' says Scott Testa with
Mindbridge.com, a company that creates Web-based software.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want simple devices that don't do everything but do two
or three simple tasks very easily,'' says Testa. ``You're going to
see the computer, the TV, the telephone morph into these devices. A
typical house may have one computer, one of these appliances and a
TV with Net access.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Association's International Show in
Las Vegas in early January, the products that generated the most
oohs and aahs were these so-called Internet appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an explosion in these kinds of devices,'' says
CEA's Jeff Joseph. ``More and more people want Web access without
having to be tied to a desktop computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``best of show'' honors went to InfoGear's iPhone, a $399
gadget complete with a touch screen, keyboard and software that
lets users communicate by phone and e-mail, and access the Internet
_ including both banking and shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone has been around since 1998 but has gone through a
half-dozen upgrades since then, based on customer feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new Net appliances are geared toward the
techno-shy. Products like MailStation ($99.95 and up) and MailBug
($129.95) are countertop devices that let you have e-mail without
the price and complexity of a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that there are so many folks who are so intimidated
by PCs. They want e-mail but have no need or interest in learning
how to operate a PC,'' says MailBug's Bryan McCormick. He quotes
statistics: 50 percent of American households don't have a PC, but
93 percent have a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think e-mail should be as ubiquitous as the telephone, and
it will never happen if it's dependent on something as complicated
as a computer,'' says McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Another device generating a lot of buzz is the i-opener from
Netpliance. Resembling a slimmed-down computer, the device offers
easy e-mail and Internet access with a flat-panel screen and
keyboard. Retailing at $199, the i-opener promises to be up and
working within five minutes after it arrives at your door.
</P>
<P>
   For James Bond types, Casio even offers a wristwatch that lets
you exchange data with your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of this technology is fairly new, many people have
been surfing without a computer for some time on WebTV. For more
than three years, WebTV has offered subscribers the ability to surf
the Net and send e-mail from the comfort of their recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Now in 1 million homes, WebTV ($99-$199) offers a range of
possibilities _ like creating Web pages and playing along with
Interactive TV programs. According to WebTV customer demographics
information, nearly three-quarters of all WebTV subscribers don't
own a computer; more than half have no prior Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that allows e-mail and Net surfing isn't limited
to stand-alone appliances like TV sets and phones, however. A
company called Planetweb makes Internet software that goes into
non-computer consumer electronics. Currently, that technology is
available in the home video game, Sega Dreamcast ($199), letting
game players go online, using their TV set as a computer screen,
their remote control as a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Planetweb Internet browser will start appearing
on some new DVD players _ called iDVDs. It will allow viewers to go
online and check movie reviews, program guides and more before
watching a show. The price of the iDVD will depend on the company
that uses the technology, says Planetweb spokesman Jim Wallace. So
far, Aiwa is on board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their out-of-the-box cost, all of these new
Internet appliances require an Internet connection. If you already
have an Internet service provider, there's no additional cost for
most. If you're not already plugged in, you can either choose your
own ISP or take advantage of special deals that most of the
manufacturers provide. The monthly access fee is often $10 or so _
usually half of what the major ISPs charge per month.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these products are already available, some are
still on the drawing board. Some auto manufacturers, for example,
are working on built-in hands-free e-mail retrieval from the
comfort of your car. While you're driving, you can check e-mail
messages and even answer them using voice-recognition capabilities.
(Sounds an awful lot like voice mail!)
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are boom boxes that would have wireless
connections to the Internet. You could download MP3 files right
into your boom box and play them instantly on the go.
</P>
<P>
   These products apparently aren't so far-fetched. Industry
analysts agree that Net appliances are the hot techo-gadgets du
jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I need a computer to surf the Web is like saying I need
a computer to talk on the phone,'' says Internet expert and author
Mark Minasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We geeks thought the way the world would get wired was that
everybody would grow smart and techy. We were wrong. The products
just got simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Minasi likens these Net appliances to the traditional telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid we had one phone. Now we have them all over
the house,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years from now _ maybe less _ every room in the house
will have Internet access. This is coming so fast you can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agrees the CEA's Joseph, ``We have met the Jetsons and they are
us.''

BAY STATE ANTI-TOBACCO RULES ON THE LINE IN FEDERAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The national battle over tobacco control hits a
critical crossroads in a federal courthouse Friday where
Massachusetts is defending its crackdown _ the toughest in the
nation _ on children's exposure to cigarette advertising and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's top legal aides will
stand before three members of the US Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit to argue that a lower court ruling in January upholding the
state's right to sharply curb tobacco ads, promotions, and
storefront displays should stand.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the legal struggle over the state
regulations and the ultimate outcome of these hearings is far
reaching, and will have national implications, experts in tobacco
control say.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom arguments mark the first confrontation between
regulators and the tobacco industry since the US Supreme Court
ruled last month that the US Food and Drug Administration has no
authority to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the major cigarette manufacturers will argue that
the attorney general's unilateral regulations _ issued under the
state's consumer protection act _ violate free speech under the
First Amendment, and that federal law preempts state regulations on
advertising and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision, which forced the FDA to shut down
its campaign to keep cigarettes out of the hands of children and to
back off plans to limit harmful chemicals in tobacco products, was
a major victory for the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Howard K. Koh, the state public health commissioner whose agency
operates one of the country's most comprehensive and heavily funded
tobacco control programs, said the recent high court ruling has
dramatically elevated the significance of the battle over Reilly's
regulations, which closely mirror the now inoperative FDA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely critical decision,'' Koh said. ``And the
timing is critically important because now the FDA can't regulate
and Congress continues to study the issue, so the states must act.
This is an opportunity for Massachusetts to once again take the
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kline, an attorney with the Tobacco Control Resource
Center at Northeastern University School of Law, said the arguments
and the court decision will focus on one of the most important
debates on tobacco control: the power of states to regulate the
promotion of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Kline noted that, unlike other states, which have implemented
less sweeping rules, the Massachusetts regulations were put in
place by the attorney general a year ago, using the state's
consumer protection laws, not by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can lead other attorney generals to take the same
approach,'' Kline said. ``State houses around the country are often
confounded by the tobacco industry and their allies. This is a
completely different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the tobacco companies have declined to
comment until the court hearing is completed. Reilly aides said the
attorney general and his staff would not comment while the case is
pending before the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts regulations would ban, within 1,000 feet of
schools and playgrounds, all tobacco advertising on billboards, ads
in stores and in their windows, and other promotions for
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area encompassed by the ban covers virtually the entire
populated area of Massachusetts,'' laywers for the industry argue
in their brief. They also argue that the ban eliminates much of the
ability of cigarette makers, distributors, and retailers to provide
consumers with ``truthful brand and pricing information.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would also ban the marketing of clothing such as
hats and shirts that carry tobacco logos and prohibit tobacco
sponsored cultural or sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the US Supreme Court ruling, the national
antismoking effort is realizing that the decision is in fact a
victory for regulation because states could take even more
aggressive control measures than what the FDA was doing.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also is a gamble. The Massachusetts case _ along
with a handful of other cases around the country _ is certain to
land in the Supreme Court, where the industry could prevail with a
ruling that essentially preempts states from regulating tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the states prevail in the courts, the
aggressive lead by Massachusetts and other jurisdictions may very
likely force Congress to adopt strong national regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments will center on the regulations issued by then
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger shortly before he left office
last year. Using the state's consumer protection laws, the attorney
general argued that the tobacco ads and promotions were ``unfair or
deceptive acts or practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also placed the cigar industry under the same
advertising restrictions and ordered that its packages for the
first time carry warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William G. Young, chief jurist in the Boston federal
district, issued a ruling in January that strongly backed Reilly's
arguments and rebuffed the industry's position. He described
cigarette advertising as ``functional pornography'' in the context
of the First Amendment and argument over free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both cigarette advertising and pornography are protected forms
of speech, reaching out to offer messages or products desired by
and legal for adults,'' Young wrote in his opinion. ``At the same
time we leave it to our government to seek to shield our children
form both the forms of speech, believing them to be either
inherently corrupting (pornography) or an inducement (cigarette
advertising) to engage in an activity unlawful for minors.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Spring is in the air, and it's time for a little low-tech
cleaning
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's spring and the automated birds outside of
TechnoBuddy Ranch are singing, the trees are fringed with green and
the pollen has me and Buddy the Maine Coon Cat both sneezing. And,
me being a traditional sort of a guy, it's spring cleaning time at
my house.
</P>
<P>
   That means that I'll have to set off a small nuclear device to
clean out the basement and also identify some of the objects that
the cat has placed under the beds and couches. But, for my
computers, it's also spring cleaning time. The truth is that it's a
really low-tech way to make sure that the computer has a chance of
lasting through spring into next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Dust and dirt builds up inside a computer. And unlike the
dustballs under your bed, this dust can literally kill your
computer. The good thing about this problem is that it's one you
can fix, even if most technical things leave you flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to warn you. This does involve taking the top off
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll go in easy stages, so that you can do the chores that
feel comfortable to you and just ignore those that make you feel
quivery inside.
</P>
<P>
   So let's leave the screwdriver alone for a moment and clean your
mouse. It's easy and my guess is that you'll notice the difference
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Just remove the retaining ring that holds in the little rubber
ball and take a look at the rollers inside the mouse. Use a cotton
swab, moistened with alcohol, to remove the dirt. Hold the mouse
upright, while you do this, so that any trash inside falls out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's do another easy chore. Clean the monitor's screen
(you're going to be surprised at the amount of dirt you find) using
either special screen cleaning pads available at the computer
store, or just a small amount of glass cleaner sprayed on a paper
towel.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is a little steeper, but I promise that you can do
it. We need to open up the computer for this one. Since not all
computer cases work the same way, you'll either need to figure it
out by looking, or dig out the manual.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid doing any harm, make sure that you don't touch anything
inside before you discharge any static electricity you may have
accumulated. You can do that by either buying a ``grounding strap''
which is a weird little gizmo that you wear on your hand, or you
can just make sure and touch the chassis before touching anything
inside the computer.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to unplug the computer, of course (although
professionals usually work inside with the computer plugged in, but
for mere mortals it's important to unplug the PC). Now find the
cooling fan toward the rear of your computer. Check to make sure
that it is free of dust and dirt. The fan keeps your computer cool
(a processor chip, while the computer is running, generates enough
heat to make popcorn). Since heat can age or even destroy
components, you need to make sure the fan is running correctly. And
anything that blocks the exhaust fan contributes to heat buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to inspect the rest of the inside of the
computer, especially the main circuitboard called the motherboard.
Dust and dirt on the board can literally conduct enough electricity
to cause a short circuit. I once recommended that people use
compressed air to blow away the dust, or even a small hand vacuum
to clean it away (without letting the vacuum touch the components).
But since this is for beginners and since a mistake can do more
harm than the dust, I think I'll just recommend that you check for
excessive dirt and _ if you find it _ to get a professional to
clean the inside of the case for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for today. Spring cleaning is over. Now you can
perform the last ceremonial spring task. And that's to have some
spring tonic. I favor ice tea on the deck where I can watch the
trees.

 &HT;    Bystander admits shots at Lewis car
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man on Thursday admitted he was the person who
opened fire on Ray Lewis' stretch limousine as it sped away from an
Atlanta intersection where two men lay dying of stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Burros, 33, said he was a friend of Richard Lollar, 24,
and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur, Ga., who were stabbed to
death during a fight after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the All-Pro linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens, and two
associates, Reginald Oakley of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting of
Miami, have been charged with murder in the stabbing deaths. They
go to trial May 15.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who fired the six shots at Lewis' limo has
lingered since the incident. No one was harmed by the shooting, but
one of the limo's tires was flattened. Emergency medical
technicians have told police that shell casings from the bullets
were found on top of and close to Baker's body.
</P>
<P>
   Burros has not been charged with firing the shots. Asked if he
expected to be prosecuted, he replied: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Burros said he was walking far behind
his friends, who had just left the Cobalt, a lounge in Atlanta's
enterainment district. Burros said as he walked further up the
street, he saw Baker and Lollar lying on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement given to law enforcement authorities March 16,
Burros said he ran back to his 1999 GMC Yukon to retrieve his
.45-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Burros told authorities he
bought the gun three or four years ago in Ohio from a man he could
not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Burros said his Yukon was about 50 feet away from the
intersection. He told authorities he was in a state of shock and
fired because he wanted the people inside the limo to ``pay'' for
what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if they were dead,'' Burros said in the
telephone interview. ``But I knew they were badly hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy reports show that Baker and Lollar died of stab wounds
to the heart and chest.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Oakley and Sweeting strongly deny the murder charges, and
some witnesses have said that Lollar and Baker instigated the
deadly fracas. In court motions, Sweeting's attorneys have said
Lollar may have been carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Lollar and Baker have strongly denied that theory,
saying the deceased were not looking for a fight and were victims.
</P>
<P>
   Burros said he did not witness the fight that led to the
stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and three other friends drove away from the scene
before police and an ambulance arrived, leaving Baker and Lollar
lying on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he drove away, Burros said: ``What do you
think?'' When pressed, he answered that he left the scene because
``I'd fired the weapon.''

 &HT;    Baseball was never this easy
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're a baseball fan, you've been there. It's late
in the game and the coach can't seem to pull the starting pitcher,
who's getting shelled. Or maybe it's August, the left fielder is
starting to wilt and the coach won't bench him for a few games to
get his strength back.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all this, other than starting an Internet company,
selling it in 18 months and then buying your own team, is fantasy
baseball. The Internet version.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Web, fantasy baseball required effort. Here's how it
works: A group of people form a league, pick teams and hold a draft
to divide the best major league players. Eight to 12 teams per
league are recommended. Any less packs teams with all-stars. More
makes each team the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Teams earn points based on how well their players perform. The
everyday players are ranked using their offensive statistics: team
batting average, home runs, runs batted in and stolen bases.
Pitchers earn points by team earned run average, wins, saves and
team WHIP ratio (walks plus hits, divided by the number of innings
pitched).
</P>
<P>
   In the pencil and paper days, that meant a lot of record
keeping, tons of stat-checking and some serious math. Hardly tasks
fit for a sports mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Web sites offer free fantasy baseball leagues; most
do the math for you.
</P>
<P>
   Owners can check their team performances each day, and the
previous day's performance already will have been factored in. It
reduces fantasy baseball to the relative joy of dialing up
Yahoo.com to check your stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   That frees you to do the real work of the owner _ making trades,
firing coaches and angling for taxpayer-subsidized stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is loaded with fantasy sports sites. A quick search
last week on Google.com, one of the Web's best search engines,
found 17,900 fantasy baseball entries in less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasybaseballcentral.com is as thorough a place as any to
start. It divides links to fantasy baseball-related sites by
category.

BROWN UNIVERSITY PROBED FOR TEAM RECRUITING VIOLATONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least five sports teams at Brown University are being
investigated for allegedly violating Ivy League recruiting
regulations, university and Ivy league officials confirmed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown officials are expected to file a report as early as Friday
detailing the results of its own investigation, university
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of improper recruiting of athletes for the
incoming 2000 class prompted Brown in early February to launch a
review of its policy of awarding ``supplemental financial awards''
to attractive athletic prospects, said Laura Freid, a Brown
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are technicalities that I can't get into that might have
been only available to athletes,'' she said. ``But there may have
been unintended consequences to changes in our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the moves of other Ivy League schools, Brown in
February of 1999 amended its financial aid policies to allow
students to use non-university or supplemental scholarships to
defray tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, students, including star athletes, had to rely on
grants, loans and other forms of aid provided by the university.
Grants gained from other sources (such as neighborhood rotary clubs
or companies) would offset the amount of aid the university gave.
</P>
<P>
   The change, however, has opened up the university to charges of
luring athletes with financial aid packages unavailable to other
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the specific sports that are really the issue,'' said
Carolyn Campbell-McGovern, senior associate director of the Ivy
League athletic conference office based in Princeton, N.J. ``It's
the way the athletes were recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Freid, Campbell-McGovern, and NCAA officials all said they were
reluctant to discuss the specifics of the allegations, which
include how Brown's basketball team recruited its players. But they
said the investigation should be concluded and any penalties
against Brown made public by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Such penalties could parallel the punishment of the University
of Pennsylvania in 1997, which was forced to forfeit several
football victories after an investigation disclosed the team had
used ineligible players.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other investigations of similar alleged violations
at other Ivy League schools, Campbell-McGovern said. The Ivy League
is the only NCAA Division I conference that doesn't award athletic
scholarships. Athletes, like star students, lured to such schools
receive an array of grants, cushy campus jobs and low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its relatively limited financial resources, Brown,
unlike Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, has traditionally had to rely
more on loans than grants, which don't have to be paid back. And,
Freid said, that has often rankled Brown's coaches, who have lost
many promising prospects to other Ivy League schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in our policy was meant to encourage all students
in finding outside scholarships,'' she said. ``We're now looking
into any complications in that process.''

PUTIN BACKS AWAY FROM REGIONAL POLITICAL CONFRONTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ As President-elect Vladimir Putin flew
north beyond the Arctic circle this week to ride a nuclear powered
submarine and burnish his image as commander-in-chief, the event
that was making political waves was the scuttling of his
hand-picked candidate for governor of his home region here.
</P>
<P>
   In a humbling concession by Putin to the political strength and
popularity of the incumbent governor, Vladimir Yakolev, the new
Russian president on Tuesday recalled Valentina Matviyenko, his
first deputy prime minister, from her vacation and, according to
Matviyenko, asked her to pull out of the race she had entered with
the Kremlin's blessing less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, while viewed as politically pragmatic by political
observers here and in Moscow, was nonetheless seen as a galling
retreat for Putin, who has long reviled Yakolev as a ``Judas'' for
allegedly betraying his political loyalty to the late Anatoly
Sobchak, who died on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, as mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, was
among the first generation of charismatic pro-democracy reformers
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He recruited both Putin and
Yakolev as deputy mayors only to be ousted by Yakolev's insurgency
in the 1996 elections. Yakolev's victory put Putin out of a job
and, as Putin recently revealed in a series of interviews, ``I came
to the conclusion that working with Yakolev was impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Matviyenko announced she would bow to Putin's
request. She closed her campaign headquarters here at No. 1
Revolution St., saying, ``I am quitting the list of candidates, but
not the city.'' She will return to Moscow, she said, to help Putin
form a new government for his swearing in as president on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, in remarks from Murmansk, as he prepared to take a dive
to 1,300 feet in a Delta-class ballistic missile submarine and then
observe a series of missile firings, offered a somewhat different
account by saying that it was Matviyenko's decision to withdraw
from the race and that when he asked her to return to Moscow, ``I
didn't mean that she should stop her election campaign. After all,
I conducted my campaign while carrying on working.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president-elect added that ``we were coming to a
critical moment in forming the government, and she is one of the
most successful social ministers. I needed her to join our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating her own account, Matviyenko told campaign workers
the same day, ``I was sure about my victory until Vladimir Putin
convinced me to change my decision.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political analysts here and in Moscow, said the decision to end
the Kremlin-backed campaign against Yakolev reflects Putin's
recognition not only that his deputy was likely to lose in the May
14 balloting here, but also that the Kremlin could not afford an
antagonistic battle with a regional boss like Yakolev at a time
when Moscow is preparing to undertake a much anticipated economic
reform program in the wake of last month's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision shows that Putin's priority is to put together a
strong team on the federal level, and this is much more important
to him than fighting a war with Yakolev,'' said Grigory Tomchin, a
liberal member of the national parliament, or Duma, from St.
Petersburg. ``And from the beginning, it was also clear that
Matviyenko was not the best candidate to defeat Yakolev.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sergei Fetishev, a seasoned political journalist who
covers city hall here, `` Putin had to face the reality of local
power, and therefore it is definitely something of a blow to his
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst outcome would have been for Putin to back a loser, as
he did in December when he supported an insurgent candidate against
the powerful mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, said Sergei Markov, the
director of the Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose in another important region would not look good for
his image,'' Markov said, ``and that is why he decided to join a
winner,'' however personally distasteful that might have been.
``It's a signal that he puts political interests higher than
personal relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also saw the hand of Russia's most prominent
oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, shoring up Yakolev's candidacy in an
effort to sway the Kremlin to do the same. ``We need to ensure the
continuity of power, especially in the regions,'' Berezovsky was
quoted today as saying in the Moscow Times. He added, ``Yakolev has
made many mistakes, but the alternative candidate was just not
strong enough to control the problems plaguing the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the serious problems here are the organized crime
syndicates who frequently stage contract killings in broad daylight
along the canals and tree-lined esplanades of the city. In the most
recent, on Wednesday, Gennadi Ivanov, 35, the general director of a
textile conglomerate that employs 4,000 people, was fatally shot by
a man who walked up to his blue Volvo 950 when it stopped at a

<P>
   The most notorious assassination here of a liberal
parliamentarian, Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down in her
stairwell in November 1998, remains unsolved _ like hundreds of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Putin was vaulted into the prime minister's post and
then the presidency, Yakolev's position has been seen as vulnerable
to challenge by a strong Kremlin-backed candidate. Matviyenko's
entry into the race, at first appeared as a settling of accounts
until opinion polls revealed that she was not making headway
against Yakolev's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yakolev may be an alcoholic or even a crook, but he has done a
lot for the city,'' said Sergei Kilmenko, 33, a former army captain
who was on the streets today looking for a job. ``Matviyenko is
seen as a wooden, Communist youth type of person, and the mafia
structure here would have squashed her in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Like Peter the Great, who founded this city of Venetian canals
and palaces on the banks of the Neva River, Yakolev is also known
as a builder who keeps the roads repaired, pays the pensioners on
time and manages to find restoration funds to keep the city's
baroque palaces and monuments from crumbling into the canals. In
his plodding and unflashy manner, Yakolev has forged a broad-based
local political machine that for now seems as unassailable as the
Peter and Paul fortress that secured this swampy territory as
Russia's capital for two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   With one serious rival out of the way, Yakolev Thursday plunged
confidently into another day of campaigning among workers at a
pasta factory in the suburbs, visiting workers' dormitories and
avoiding questions about his own mysterious trips to Moscow last
week and again on Monday, the day before Matviyenko's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As St. Petersburg prepares to host the world ice hockey
championships on April 29, Yakolev is taking most of the credit for
having secured the venue. The governor is also giving away tens of
thousands of free tickets to citizens who help clean up the city
this month, an offer that some critics see as a blatant form of
vote buying just weeks before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked under Sobchak and he understands the rules of the
game,'' Klimenko said.

CUBAN FATHER DECRIES TREATMENT OF REFUGEE SON IN US 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Standing on common soil with his 6-year-old son
for the first time in more than four months, Juan Miguel Gonzalez
unleashed a torrent of angry words against Elian's guardians in
Miami Thursday, even as US officials indicated as much confidence
as ever that the boy would soon be returned to his father's care.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Elian had been subjected to ``cruel psychological
pressures'' by ``some distant relatives who had never seen him
before,'' Gonzalez, 31, vowed to reclaim custody of the boy as soon
as possible. He delivered the heated remarks at a dramatic airport
news conference shortly after dawn, then retreated, with his wife
and infant child, to the suburban Washington home of a Cuban
official for the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance in the nation's capital did little to deter
public attacks from the Miami relatives of Elian, who have cared
for the child since his ill-fated sea journey from Cuba last
Thanksgiving, and who have resisted every entreaty to send the boy
back home. Late Thursday, as talks between the Miami relatives and
federal attorneys broke down, a family spokesman said the
Immigration and Naturalization Service had announced it would carry
out its longstanding threat: to revoke Elian's parole and transfer
custody to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said
that despite 40 hours of negotiation the US officials refused to
make a single concession. That resistance remained strong with
Thursday's arrival of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will not guarantee that it will not take Elian
away or try to take Elian away in the middle of the night,''
Pedrosa said at a news conference outside the Miami federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton viewed Gonzalez's arrival as a ``positive step
toward ultimately reuniting a father with his son,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said
Gonzalez's presence ``adds an immediacy'' to the agency's goal of
resolving the case, which has resurrected four-decade-old tensions
between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe his being in the United States will help us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by late afternoon, officials could not report any
progress in resolving the greatest public relations puzzle: exactly
how Elian might be turned over to his father's care.
</P>
<P>
   The family expects to be told where to deliver Elian to Gonzalez
or US representatives as early as Monday. But protesters, many of
them Cubans who fled the regime of Fidel Castro years ago, are
conducting a near-round-the-clock vigil outside the Miami home
where Elian is currently housed, making it virtually impossible for
US officials to retrieve the boy against the relatives' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, protesters suggested they would block even Gonzalez
from taking his son away _ although Gregory B. Craig, the attorney
for the father, indicated he was unlikely to show up in such a
hostile environment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Gonzalez's arrival and attempt to communicate
through the media did not convince the Miami protesters of his
sincerity in wanting the best for his son. After watching his
speech, broadcast live on national TV, many dismissed Gonzalez's
words as too impersonal, too controlled, to have been written by
anyone but Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cancio, 27, and the mother of a boy around Elian's age,
said she remained convinced the boy is better off with distant
relatives in Miami than with his father in Havana. She said she
believes that ``deep down'' Gonzalez knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just reading a speech today,'' she said. ``Those were
written words and they aren't his words.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rita Oliva, a 32-year-old college student and mother of a
13-year-old son, put it: ``I think Fidel Castro should win the
Oscar for best director. And did you see that suit they had made
for him? He looked like a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez arrived from Havana wearing a tailored, dark blue suit
and a lighter blue shirt and tie. After flying in by private jet,
he greeted a throng of reporters at the airport, with his wife,
Nersy, holding their 6-month-old, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke through a translator, appearing quietly angry but
controlled. At one point, a handful of anti-Castro protesters
shouted so loudly that Gonzalez could hardly be heard. Later,
critics said it was a mistake for him to appear in Washington at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a sad day,'' Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the
Cuban American National Foundation, said. ``We have said from the
beginning that we welcome Juan Miguel in the United States. It's
just sad he took the plane to Washington and not to Miami to come
and embrace his son.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez does regain custody of Elian, he will be free to
leave for Cuba immediately, an INS official said.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the ongoing negotiations, Gonzalez has agreed to
stay in the United States until all the custody proceedings are
resolved. The INS ruled in early January that the Miami relatives
should return Elian to his father, and it has been widely assumed
ever since that the 6-year-old will eventually go home. But his
Miami relatives have appealed to a federal court in Atlanta, where
the case is scheduled to be heard May 11. If that fails, the
relatives' only remaining course would be an appeal to the US
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   An INS official said the agency expected Elian to be returned to
his father long before the May 11 court date.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Miami relatives had demanded that
government psychologists examine Elian and accept their
recommendations concerning the boy's future. Thursday, lawyers for
the relatives said the government had balked. Attorney Roger
Bernstein said: ``The government is still unwilling to speak to
Elian and understand what he is feeling.''

 &HT;    End Task with care

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   When I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, the screen shows a list of running
programs, many of which I don't recognize. For example: Explorer,
NsDee32, Realplay, Osa, Tsystray, Rundll, Systray, Aim, Imgicon.
Are these necessary? Should I End Task on each of them or just
ignore? Can, or should, they be deleted? Do they affect the speed
of my computer?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Goldberg
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On Windows 95/98 machines, any time you do a
Ctrl-Alt-Delete to reboot your computer, the Task Manager will come
up. It's a list of all running applications, some system-critical.
It manages the applications that are activated and working and
those no longer responding. If you don't know what an item is
(because it may be a system app), do not End Task.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Be careful. System apps make your computer go.
``End-Tasking'' them won't speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I made the mistake of letting my kids play games on my Macintosh
Powerbook G3. They changed my password, and neither of them can
remember what they used. Can I access the computer to restore or
change my password without losing data? I called a couple of
dealers, and they want to charge me too much.
</P>
<P>
   _Keith W. Allen Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Ah, it seems you are now the proud owner of an expensive
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: No, Sue's making a funny. All is not lost. We checked
with Apple Tech Support and found that, unless you want to
initialize your hard drive, you must take your Powerbook and
receipt to an Apple dealer to have the password reset without
losing data. If your computer is under warranty, you may not have
to shell out anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you really want to do this yourself, initializing is the
only way. Apparently, the password is written to the driver level.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I lost the basic toolbar in Microsoft Word. I can't see the
File, Edit, Tool, maximum, minimum or the ``X'' to close the
window. They are off the screen. This happens only in Word. I have
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _Anthony Kuchta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Let's start simple. Did you accidentally move the Menu
Toolbar to the side, or is it now a floating menu? Is it minimized
into the menu bar at the bottom of your screen? This is easy to do
and can cause some confusion. I've been there. You also should go
to Toolbars under the View Menu and select Customize. Is Menu Bar
selected? If not, put a check in the box.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Also, it could be a deeper issue. Have you installed
software lately? We've seen software conflicts that cause menus to
get wiggy. Try reinstalling Microsoft Word. Nine times out of 10,
it'll do the trick.

PROTESTERS TRY FLOWERS AFTER WEEKS OF SHOUTING
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBAN-BOY, CUBAN-BOY-ENVOY) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After weeks of angry shouts, name-calling and vows that
little Elian Gonzalez will only be taken from his relatives' house
over their dead bodies, demonstrators outside the home in Little
Havana adopted a fresh tactic here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They waved flowers.
</P>
<P>
   As news filtered through the crowd of more than 100
demonstrators that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had landed
in Washington, to take legal _ but not yet actual _ custody of his
child, leaders of a four-month-long demonstration outside the house
began handing out long-stemmed pink carnations and yellow lilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These flowers represent the love for Elian and for his
father,'' said Jorge Chavez, 25, a Dade County schoolteacher who
had the day off for spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a victim,'' Chavez said of Elian's father, whom Chavez
believes is just a pawn of the Fidel Castro government in Cuba.
``It's not his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, many of them wearing George W. Bush for President
pins, said the boy's father was welcome here, echoing the family's
entreaty that he go to their home to eat a meal and speak with them
as family, without the otherwise ever-present lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, family members were accusing Gonzalez of
verbally abusing his son and lying to him, saying that he had told
Elian on the telephone that his mother, Elizabet Brotons, who
drowned in a failed crossing with Elian from Cuba in November, was
still alive and on the island.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Adam Rassi, a 29-year-old grocery employee who has
slept outside the home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, for
several nights, said he welcomed Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to hurt him,'' said Rassi, who is one of about
20 watchers who carry walkie-talkies and stand ready to call others
to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home, one demonstrator told reporters that while she
might spit at Juan Miguel Gonzalez, she would not hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talks between the boy's Miami relatives and
immigration officials broke down again, as lawyers wrangled over
how to remove the boy from the tension-filled atmosphere at the
home on Northwest Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   Family members here had wanted Juan Miguel Gonzalez to promise
that he and Elian would stay in the United States until a decision
was rendered in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
but lawyers for the family here angrily warned late Thursday
afternoon that there was nothing to prevent Gonzalez from leaving
for Cuba with Elian once the boy was in his actual custody.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer for Elian's Miami family, said the
government would not discuss anything with the family except ways
of removing him from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have appealed a federal judge's ruling that
upheld Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to send the boy back.
The appellate court hearing is scheduled for May 11 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has failed to get a written agreement from
the family to hand the boy over peacefully, something government
lawyers wanted from the relatives here in return for their promise
to keep Elian in the United States until after the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials can now take the boy at any time, although
a Immigration and Naturalization Service official said that might
not happen for a few days, if that soon.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said they do not want to have federal
officers go in and take the boy by force. For months, there had
seemed no other way, as demonstrators vowed to block any effort to
remove him.
</P>
<P>
   But, as newspaper editorial pages across the country blasted
Miami-Dade County elected officials for saying they would side with
Cuban exiles here over the rule of law and that any bloodshed would
be on the hands of President Clinton and Reno, demonstrators who
had talked about sacrificing their lives in chaos in the streets
were instead tossing flowers.
</P>
<P>
   They held hands and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed, really,'' said Angel Cruz, a farmer in Cuba who
came to the United States five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough, already,'' Cruz said of the previous harsh
language directed at the father by demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father cannot speak the truth, Cruz said, because of the
repressive government in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, of the Movimiento Democracia exile group and
the most visible demonstration leader, again promised that
demonstrators would remain nonviolent, but he has warned that civil
disobedience will follow any move on the house by federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators have seldom spoken with one mind. Some have said
they would do anything, including commit acts of violence, to stop
the boy from being taken, while others said they were merely links
in a planned human chain intended to peacefully block federal
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But many demonstrators said they could feel the situation coming
to a close soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a little more nervous every day,'' Rassi said.
``Anything can happen.''

MCENROE, SAMPRAS LEAD US INTO DAVIS CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pete and Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it Mac and Pete?
</P>
<P>
   Which one gets top billing _ rookie captain John McEnroe or
newly enlisted Pete Sampras _ is a tough decision as the Davis Cup
marquee is hoisted Friday in the City of Angels, and their team,
the United States, goes against the Czech Republic in a
best-of-five quarterfinal series. And don't forget Andre, of the
Las Vegas Agassis, who is No. 1 in the diversion called
professional tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But it's pious Pete and non-angelic Mac, back together again
after eight years, who make you wonder. Is this the start of a
beautiful friendship? Or just a
let's-get-along-for-appearance-sake, a symbiotic relationship that
could bust a US drought in the Davis Cup dating back to the 1995
victory over Russia, 3-2, crafted virtually by Sampras?
</P>
<P>
   ``John questioned my integrity,'' said Pete Thursday. ``That
made me very uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   His brown eyes were grave as he stood in a corner of the Forum,
the arena where he'll lead off against top Czech, No. 39 Jiri
Novak, this afternoon. Agassi follows against Slava Dosedel, No.
48, with the order flip-flopped Sunday. Doubles (Alex O'Brien and
Jared Palmer against Novak and David Rikl) is the middle match
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very uncomfortable week for me, sitting home
watching it on TV, thinking over what John said.'' recalled Pete,
of the February US win over Zimbabwe, 3-2, that he missed because
of a hip injury incurred while losing an Aussie Open semifinal to
Agassi the previous week. When Pete, who had committed to play,
withdrew from the team, McEnroe commented in a ghosted column under
his name in an Australian newspaper that he never believed Sampras
would show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, nobody wanted to go to Africa right after the
Australian. It was tough on Andre,'' said Pete. ``But I intended to
go. My dad had bought a plane ticket to go to Zimbabwe to watch me.
I've never gone back on my commitments, and John's opinion hurt a
lot. He questioned my integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some phone conversations, and worked it out. He
apologized, so here I am. You know, I don't think there has to be a
lot of talking (between captain and player). That's not my way. I
think it's going to go OK with John. We've got a team that won't be
beat if we play our games.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is smart enough to say, ``Am I going to tell Pete, or
Andre, how to win? They've been here before. Since I played on some
pretty good teams (five Cups between 1978 and 1992), I'm just going
to say, when some people say, `this is the greatest team the US has
ever had,' that Pete and Andre are two of the greatest ever to pick
up a racket. And Alex and Jared are a very fine doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper we shouldn't lose a match here. But the good thing
about sports _ and strange things can happen in Davis Cup _ is it's
not scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently reluctant Pete hasn't started for the US since 1997,
when he suffered a leg injury against Magnus Larsson in the final
at Sweden, a 5-0 defeat, on the first day. During his last
meaningful Cup performance, five years ago on clay in Moscow, he
won both singles (over Andrei Chesnokov and Yevgeny Kafelnikov) and
the doubles, with Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Pete's pouty regret was that the White House didn't summon him
for a Presidential audience. ``Where I'm at now in my career,''
said Sampras, ``I want to get more into Davis Cup. I didn't think I
could do both, stay No. 1 (a pro record six straight years,
1993-98), and give myself wholeheartedly to Davis Cup. Now I want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras says this isn't a reaction to McEnroe's very public
campaign to shame him into re-enlisting, asserting often, ``It's
time for Pete to do his duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing John did,'' said Sampras. ``I just wanted to be
part of it'' _ and almost wasn't when Mac got a little too
personal.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago Sampras said he would never play for
McEnroe if Mac got the captaincy. They had last teamed in the 1992
final, victorious doubles accomplices in a wild five-set comeback
over Jakob Hlasek and Mark Rosset as the US barely defeated
Switzerland. Pete, the antithesis of Mac on court, didn't
appreciate his partner's vitriolic tongue in spewing foul insults
at the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, 40, claims his parental role as father of six has
tempered his famously tempestuous deportment. ``I'm going to try to
just not be in the way. I think we've found a comfort level as a
team where this should be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief comfort-leveler has been US Tennis Association president
Julia Levering, largely responsible for the Pete and Mac and Andre
mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   She chose McEnroe after consulting the players. (``First time
the team has been part of the decision-making,'' said Agassi.) She
retrieved Agassi, who had quit in a huff last year when team
physician and close friend George Fareed was fired, one of those
bureaucratic goofs for which the USTA is justly celebrated. She
``was impressive when she talked to me about playing again,'' said
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically Petes's curious behavior last July in Boston probably
landed the job for Mac. Rejoining the team for a doubles cameo in
the quarterfinal loss to Australia, he declined to play singles, an
activity at which he is the planetary best. Had Sampras led a very
possible victory, the US might well have gone on to win the Cup
(seized by Australia), and surely his pal, Tom Gullikson, would
have remained in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fareed, by the way, says Agassi's sprained right ankle that may
have cost him the Ericsson Open semifinal last week against Guga
Kuerten, is ``fully recovered. But it will be taped.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Agassi breakdown would encourage the Czechs, victors
over Britain in the opening round. ``We don't have nothing to lose.
There's no pressure on us,'' said Jiri Novak, correctly. It looks
4-1, US, from here, and a trip to either Spain or Russia for a July
semifinal, most likely on dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andre and Pete are ranked Nos. 1 and 2 and
O'Brien-Palmer are world No. 1 in their precinct, Mac is in no
hurry to annoint them as incomparables. He recalls the last such
glittering lineup, considerably before his minions' time: 1984.
Then Mac himself and Jimmy Connors were 1-2, and Mac and Peter
Fleming No. 1. That ``greatest team of all-time'' reached the
final. But the inconsiderate hosts staged it not on paper but on
messier clay in Goteborg, and the Americans were upstaged, 4-1, by
Sweden.

 &HT;    Record companies should make digital downloads play to their
tune
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Even bad publicity is good publicity,'' the saying
goes. When it comes to digital downloads that's especially true.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Napster.com (www.napster.com). Napster offers
free downloads of a program that searches the Web for MP3 digital
music files and lets users download, share them and play them back
with Napster software.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is so easy to use that it became a favorite with college
students around the country. In fact, as you read this, they are
downloading and playing digital music files over the high-speed
Internet connections most colleges and universities provide.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone goes running off to download Napster with the
notion of hopping on the digital music bandwagon, it's important to
note that most online digital music files are bootlegs that are not
authorized by the artist or the recording company. If you download
the latest from the Smashing Pumpkins, Moby or Santana, it won't
cost you anything, but the artists don't make a dime _ not one red
cent. Many artists are more than a little upset about this, and the
Recording Industry Association of America is extremely upset.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the RIAA sued Napster, charging that its software
makes illegal music distribution easier. RIAA is asking for
$100,000 for each illegally distributed song.
</P>
<P>
   Also being sued for copyright infringement is MP3.com, the first
digital download ``portal'' that helps music lovers locate recorded
music available over the Internet. MP3.com has always defended its
business, saying that if the music industry would just stop
worrying and learn to love the Internet, there would be a way for
everybody to make money.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com founder Michael Robertson believes the music industry
should have taken the lead in providing a distribution method for
selling its wares online. Robertson said that way, there wouldn't
be so many ordinary people sifting through CD collections and
uploading digital copies of their favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com has recently added a new section to its Web site called
``Lawsuit Central'' where users can read up on the latest salvos in
its ongoing battle with the music business.
(www.mp3.com/news/546.html).
</P>
<P>
   Although MP3.com is one of the most popular sites on the Web,
it's busy, complicated and hard to use. In an odd way, this has
worked to the record companies' advantage. If the average user
can't figure out how to download music files, then the industry
didn't have much to worry about. But then Napster came along and
changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is so easy to use, all users have to do is type in the
name of their favorite musicians and _ poof _ thousands of songs
pop up on the screen. Click on the one you want to download and in
a matter of minutes or hours (depending on your modem speed) you
have CD quality music on your PC.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good for the record industry, which now finds itself
looking at an easy-to-use program designed to download digital
music that they could have come up with themselves if they had
taken a long, analytical look at the Web a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Aram Sinnreich says Napster is a
very low-tech program that is very easy to replicate. He sees
Napster, not as something music companies should try to stomp out
or buy, but one that they should adapt to suit their own needs.
``It's all about more flexible product formats,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA suit is a vain attempt to make Napster and MP3.com
simply go away. But ironically, every stand the record industry
takes against online downloads seems to fan the flames and the
demand for online digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is all the publicity. The very existence of Napster
first became known to mainstream music lovers because of the
lawsuit and efforts by Indiana University and Oregon State
University to block students from using the software. The colleges
said the high volume of students downloading music was taking up
too much bandwidth. This in turn, set off a storm of protest from
students. There is a ``Save Napster'' Web site
(www.savenapster.com) which calls the ban a form of censorship.
There are online blueprints outlining ways to circumvent the
university computer network. It also sparked a huge and continuing
debate over copyright and censorship laws on the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium (WWWAC) e-mail list of Silicon Alley insiders.
All of the interest has raised the profile of Napster, which has in
turn raised interest in digital downloads. Good for Napster, bad
for the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   All the fussing and shouting is increasing interest and demand.
Maybe it will finally move the record companies to do what
Jupiter's Sinnreich suggests: Finally develop their own Web
business mode similar to Napster but incorporating some way to make
money from it. While the lawyers work on copyright protection,
maybe a few designers should be working on their Web sites.

 &HT;    Best search engine results come from knowing right techniques
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By now you are probably a veteran of the Web, with
dozens of bookmarks that help you return to the sites that fit into
your work and personal life. As long as you are searching for the
kind of information that falls within your usual routine, you
probably navigate your way along the Web efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problems come when you need to get outside that
normal box. If you spend most of your time comfortably learning
about epoxy chemicals and suddenly need to find information on
beekeeping, you may have to spend some time searching unfamiliar
areas to find what you need.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a search engine comes in. Because all use slightly
different techniques, it's a good idea to check the help section to
find out the best way to structure your search. To give an example
of how you can use good technique to make a search easier, we'll
start our search of search engines with AltaVista, at
www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is to avoid getting off-topic hits. So if you're
looking for information about your old friend Bill Husted on
AltaVista, you don't want to type that name in the keyword area. If
you do it that way, you'd get all the Bills of the Web and all the
Husteds. One way to narrow a search on AltaVista is to use the +
symbol before a word. If you search that way, and use this search
(+Bill +Husted) you'll get pages that must contain both names.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the best way. What you really want is a page with
the exact name. To get that, you need to put the name in quotes
like this: ``Bill Husted''. And that same technique works, of
course, if you want pages that contain the exact phrase ``for whom
the bell tolls'' ... you'd put the phrase in quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's move over to Yahoo, at www.yahoo.com, one of the
oldest of the general purpose search engines on the Web. It's handy
to know that the use of quote marks in a search term works exactly
the same way here. But there's a characteristic of Yahoo _ based on
the way it searches _ that can be of great help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first choices you'll see, if you do a Yahoo search,
is the fact that almost any search will return _ besides specific
Web pages that contain your search term _ a broader Yahoo category
that relates to your search. Here's an example that will help you
understand how that works. Let's say that you are searching for
garden seeds for spring planting. You'll get a list of companies
offering garden seeds that way, but you'll also get a list of
categories _ for instance, ``Business and Economy-Companies-Home
and Garden-Lawn and Garden-Seeds''
</P>
<P>
   (click on them and you'll be taken to a list of companies and
sites that fall within that category). That's a handy way to let
Yahoo do a lot of the searching work for you.
</P>
<P>
   A newer search engine that is really developing a big following
of fans is Google at www.google.com. If you know how to use
AltaVista, you already know how to use search terms on Google for
the most part. You can use the + symbol to require that a word be
included in the search and the - sign to require that a term not be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the use of the - sign in a search. Let's say that
you want to find out about the American eagle but that you're
interested in the bird, not an airline with that same name. So you
could frame a search this way (''American eagle'' -airline) and be
sure that you won't get hits from pages that discuss the airline or
flight schedules.

 &HT;    Georgia failed Terrell Peterson, official says at bill signing
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes admitted Thursday that the state
failed to provide proper safeguards for 5-year-old Terrell Peterson
in his strongest statement to date of who was responsible for the
death of the Atlanta youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes called the story of Terrell's death after a brief life of
abuse and neglect ``the tragic tale of the state's failure _ of our
failure _ to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes made the remarks at Hughes-Spalding Children's Hospital
in Atlanta before signing into law four bills passed by the General
Assembly this year, three of which are designed to provide a
broader safety net for Georgia children at risk from abuse or
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Wood, executive director of the Georgia Council on Child
Abuse, said Terrell's death ``was a case where multiple systems
designed to protect him failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell died in January 1998 despite repeated reports to the
state Division of Family and Children Services that he and his
siblings were being neglected or abused. He weighed only 29 pounds
when he died. The boy's grandmother, aunt and the aunt's boyfriend
have been charged in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell became the poster child for a series of bills in the
Legislature that their sponsors hope will better protect children
and revamp DFACS. The action by the lawmakers came following a
series of stories in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution earlier this
year that cited the deaths of hundreds of youngsters in Georgia
after they had become known to state officials because of reports
of abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   One bill named after Terrell gives doctors the authority to take
temporary custody of children they believe are in imminent danger
from abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said doctors ``need this authority to stop abuse. They
are our first line of defense, because abused children fall first
into their hands, before police officers or caseworkers or social
workers ever get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also signed into law his bill creating the Child Advocate
Office to oversee DFACS, and a piece of legislation that makes
county DFACS directors more accountable to the state and the
commissioner of the Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth bill signed into law Thursday is designed to stop
discrimination by insurance companies against women who have been
victims of domestic violence, a practice known as ``pinklining.''
The new laws take effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he has no timetable for naming the child advocate
but hopes to do so ``within the next two to three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also said that a GBI inquiry into the deaths of hundreds
of children that he ordered in January ``should be complete in the
next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arrests in the case, Barnes said, but ``we
have referred several cases for review to the attorney general's
office'' to determine if there is enough evidence for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff DiSantis, spokesman for Attorney General Thurbert Baker,
declined to provide any specifics of the cases, saying ``the
investigation is still ongoing and we are assisting the GBI in the
review of these cases.''

BROWN UNIVERSITY PROBED FOR TEAM RECRUITING VIOLATONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least five sports teams at Brown University are being
investigated for allegedly violating Ivy League recruiting
regulations, university and Ivy league officials confirmed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown officials are expected to file a report as early as Friday
detailing the results of its own investigation, university
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of improper recruiting of athletes for the
incoming 2000 class prompted Brown in early February to launch a
review of its policy of awarding ``supplemental financial awards''
to attractive athletic prospects, said Laura Freid, a Brown
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are technicalities that I can't get into that might have
been only available to athletes,'' she said. ``But there may have
been unintended consequences to changes in our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring the moves of other Ivy League schools, Brown in
February of 1999 amended its financial aid policies to allow
students to use non-university or supplemental scholarships to
defray tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, students, including star athletes, had to rely on
grants, loans and other forms of aid provided by the university.
Grants gained from other sources (such as neighborhood rotary clubs
or companies) would offset the amount of aid the university gave.
</P>
<P>
   The change, however, has opened up the university to charges of
luring athletes with financial aid packages unavailable to other
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the specific sports that are really the issue,'' said
Carolyn Campbell-McGovern, senior associate director of the Ivy
League athletic conference office based in Princeton, N.J. ``It's
the way the athletes were recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Freid, Campbell-McGovern, and NCAA officials all said they were
reluctant to discuss the specifics of the allegations, which
include how Brown's basketball team recruited its players. But they
said the investigation should be concluded and any penalties
against Brown made public by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Such penalties could parallel the punishment of the University
of Pennsylvania in 1997, which was forced to forfeit several
football victories after an investigation disclosed the team had
used ineligible players.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other investigations of similar alleged violations
at other Ivy League schools, Campbell-McGovern said. The Ivy League
is the only NCAA Division I conference that doesn't award athletic
scholarships. Athletes, like star students, lured to such schools
receive an array of grants, cushy campus jobs and low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its relatively limited financial resources, Brown,
unlike Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, has traditionally had to rely
more on loans than grants, which don't have to be paid back. And,
Freid said, that has often rankled Brown's coaches, who have lost
many promising prospects to other Ivy League schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in our policy was meant to encourage all students
in finding outside scholarships,'' she said. ``We're now looking
into any complications in that process.''

 &HT;    Program changes how Windows looks on screen
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Generally speaking, I adhere to the dictum that, like
the old commercial in which a ditzy woman in robes intoned that
``it's not nice to fool Mother Nature,'' it generally doesn't pay
to fool Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm having a lot of fun with a $20 shareware program
called WindowBlinds from Stardock.
</P>
<P>
   WindowBlinds is a one-trick pony, which is really to its
advantage. It doesn't try to change the way Windows works or add
anything to it. It just changes its appearance _ a little or a lot,
depending on your taste.
</P>
<P>
   It does this through the use of what it calls ``skins,'' which
apply different colors, borders and so forth for Windows and the
programs running under Windows. The program comes with half a dozen
of these skins, and you can download a lot more from the company's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   You can even make your own, if you are so inclined. It involves
learning the program's simple programming language, but I don't
think it would be a huge task.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the selling points of WindowBlinds: if you are
running a company with a lot of PCs, you can design a skin that
includes your company logo not only on the desktop but also
inserted artistically into the title bar or whatever on every
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skins are quite soothing and tasteful; one I just
downloaded is a zingy number with lights chasing each other
constantly along the title bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the extensive help file, StarDock warns that you may very
well have problems with WindowBlinds at first, generated by various
programs or pieces of hardware that don't get along with it.
Trouble-shooting routines are provided to help you work around
these problems.
</P>
<P>
   I had a problem which, according to the guide, was caused by my
display card. The suggested work around took care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while I get an obscure error message that
doesn't seem to be having an effect on anything. If I intend to
keep using WindowBlinds, I'll have to spend some time figuring out
how to cure whatever's causing it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rub. Do you want to do a cosmetic make over of
Windows badly enough to spend $20, a mere pittance as software
goes, and likely inherit problems that have to be ironed out?
</P>
<P>
   I think the skin I'm running now looks great. It remains to be
seen whether I'm attached to it enough to put some time into
trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
   WindowBlinds is a subset of Stardock's Object Desktop, which is
an elaborate program that does change the way Windows works and
adds features to it.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to www.stardock.com and follow the menus to get more
information on WindowBlinds and download the program for trial.

NEW PLANET IS A MERE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Hawaii)   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What some astronomers believed to be the only planet ever
directly observed outside the solar system has turned out to be an
ordinary dim star, NASA announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent discovery, announced in May, 1998, will also be
retracted in a forthcoming paper whose lead author is Dr. Susan
Terebey, the astronomer at Extrasolar Research Corp. in Pasadena,
Calif., who led the team that made the original observations.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the original announcement, NASA was strongly
criticized in an editorial in the journal Nature for announcing the
results at a news conference before they had been critiqued by the
scientific community. ``One does not need to read between lines to
perceive a deep need within NASA for publicity,'' the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terebey and her colleagues made the original observations using
the Hubble Space Telescope. The observations seemed to reveal a dim
``rogue planet'' moving away from a double star system in the
constellation Taurus. Seemingly connecting the object to the star
system was a streamer of reflective dust.
</P>
<P>
   Follow-up observations with the Keck Telescope in Hawaii have
revealed that the object is far too hot to be a planet. According
to a NASA news release issued Thursday, the object is more likely
to be a dim star, perhaps partly obscured by dust, that happens to
lie almost directly behind the double star system. The news release
did not say what the apparent streamer might be.
</P>
<P>
   Terebey's paper, which is scheduled to appear in the May issue
of Astronomical Journal, does not cast doubt on the approximately
30 extrasolar planets that have been detected indirectly. The
existence of those planets was inferred by observing a wobble in
their parent stars.
</P>
<P>
   Tereby was traveling abroad Thursday and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few months the skepticism has been growing about
this,'' said Dr. Robert W. Noyes, an astrophysicist at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ``I guess a formal
retraction was expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Savage, the public affairs officer for space science at
NASA headquarters, rejected the criticism directed at the agency by
Nature. ``Their premise was that we should only do press
conferences on peer reviewed material,'' he said. ``That is no
guarantee that things are true or valid or factual. We felt it was
in the public interest to put it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Boss, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington who was involved in the original news conference, said,
``at the time of the press conference, the weight of the evidence
was that it was a planet.'' He added that while the evidence now
favors a background star, planet discoveries are ``a fast-breaking
field'' in which announcements often occur before a final

BEYOND COMPUTERS IN COMPUTER SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the power and complexity of modern
computer networks, practical computer security against cybervandals
may ultimately be found in the commonplace concept of a burglar
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   That is the notion of Bruce Schneier, one of the nation's
best-known cryptographers _ people who specialize in writing and
cracking secret codes. Schneier, who is a computer scientist and
the author of a best-selling technical book, ``Applied
Cryptography,'' has recently transformed his small consulting
practice into an Internet alarm company backed by venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Schneier's credentials include creating the Twofish encryption
algorithm, which is a candidate to become the advanced encryption
standard being set by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. So it may seem odd that a scientist who designs
unbreakable mathematical locks for protecting information is
calling on e-commerce companies to put mere people back in the
computer-security equation.
</P>
<P>
   But Schneier argues that to trust the safety of information
stored in a computer system to even the most powerful computer
security software alone is foolhardy. That is why his new company,
Counterpane Internet Security, has adopted a business model
remarkably like that of ADT Security Services, the burglar alarm
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic philosophy is that technical protection mechanisms
such as fire walls, encryption and authentication only go so far,''
Schneier said, referring to some of the more popular computer
security technologies. ``Every protection mechanism ever built has
a flaw. They can be hidden for years, but they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Counterpane, based in San Jose, Calif., and which last year
raised $7 million in financing from Accel Partners and Bessemer
Venture Partners, has just finished building its first secure
operations center in nearby Mountain View, Calif. (A backup center
is being built in Chantilly, Va.)
</P>
<P>
   The operations center, which has high-speed links to the
Internet, is reinforced to resist physical attacks and further
protected by video surveillance and special ``biometric'' access
controls that require positive physical identification of staff
members before they are allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, operators work in shifts around the clock, watching
their clients' computers, which are connected via the Internet from
locations around the world. Although various companies have been
taking part in tests, the one paying customer Counterpane would
identify last week was VoteHere.com. The center's operators monitor
information generated by a program that Counterpane developed,
known as Socrates, which assigns categories and priorities to the
network activities it detects, seeking signs of hostile computer
attacks. Certain events that might be normal at one time _ backup
files being made over a network at 3 a.m., for example _ might
suggest a hostile intruder or an attack at another time.
</P>
<P>
   The Socrates software also maintains a separate audit log. That
is a potentially invaluable tool for forensic analysis after a
computer break-in, since one of the first things that most
sophisticated computer intruders do after illicitly entering a
computer is to erase the local log files to cover their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Counterpane may be a company in the right place at the right
time, according to computer security market analysts. International
Data Corp., a research house, estimates that the national market
for computer security management services was $703 million last
year and will reach $2.2 billion a year by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, according to analysts, the market for such
network-monitoring services has remained largely in the military
and large corporate data processing markets and has been dominated
by companies like IBM, Electronic Data Systems and Computer
Sciences Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the rise of the Internet has created the need for such
monitoring and alarm serves for e-commerce companies of all sizes.
Besides Counterpane, Internet Security Systems and Pilot Network
Services are among the new entrants to the monitoring field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to build businesses here is huge,'' said David
Tapper, a research analyst at International Data.
</P>
<P>
   Schneier, the Counterpane founder, likes to draw an analogy
between Internet security and a conventional metal safe.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that modern safes are given specific Underwriters
Laboratories safety ratings, which tell the safe owner how long it
will take a skilled safe cracker to get at the information or money
stored inside. The rating TL-30, for instance, means that it will
take a skilled safecracker with tools a half-hour to break in.
TL-TR-60 indicates that the safe will buy an hour's safety against
the same safecracker, even if he has an acetylene torch at his
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means is that you bought an hour of security when you
purchased the safe,'' said Schneier, who contends that clients
deserve similar assurance with computer security software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present state of computer security just isn't working,''
he said. ``There are just too many attacks.''

PATENTS: E-COMMERCE SPURS CHANGES AT PATENT OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a couple of minor changes, officials at the federal agency
responsible for patents and trademarks last week began what they
say is a program to make the organization more efficient and
responsive to inventors, patent holders and intellectual-property
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The real import of the changes, however, appears to lie not in
the patent office's efforts to streamline operations, but in
revised procedures for handling the increasing number of
applications for Internet-related patents, like those in business
method software and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, many of the changes appear cosmetic. The
agency once known as the Patent and Trademark Office renamed itself
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last Wednesday. It also
changed its leader's title from commissioner to director.
</P>
<P>
   But other changes are more substantive. In return for meeting
specific goals in customer service and performance, the agency is
released from government protocols on hiring, procurement and
budget-handling. Other reforms include eliminating employee sign-in
sheets, offering flexible working hours and developing new
procedures for buying computers.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are intended to inaugurate the agency's new role as
a so-called performance-based organization, an element of Vice
President Al Gore's program to reinvent government. Only one other
agency has metamorphosed this way, the Office of Student Financial
Assistance in the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   But while promoting its makeover last week, the patent and
trademark agency also took the opportunity to address a heated
controversy over the way it handles business method software
patents, a category that includes patents on ways of doing business
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to complaints that the agency's examiners are too
quick to patent basic methods of doing business, Q. Todd Dickinson,
the office's director, announced plans for increased training,
supervision and review of examiners, as well as a program to reach
out to the software and computer industries for help in
understanding technology and business trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a good job of examining business methods patents now,''
Dickinson insisted. ``We keep up very well. But this area is as
cutting-edge as can be; it's emerging so fast that we've got to
ensure the public's level of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dickinson said the new procedures were part of the
agency's long-planned transformation, they came after months of
mounting reproach from outsiders over the agency's awarding of
patents for simple online business methods like ``one-click''
shopping, reverse auctions, customer profiling and electronic
payment systems.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in e-commerce has been followed by a boom in
business method software patents, as more entrepreneurs and
investors realize the value of owning a way to do business on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the agency created a separate department for processing
those patents. At the time, 12 examiners were assigned to evaluate
920 applications. The next year the number of applications
increased to 1,300, and they doubled in 1999 to 2,600. By then, 40
examiners were working on them.
</P>
<P>
   Each application takes an average 26 months to process, compared
with 18 months for general patents. In 1999, 583 business method
software patents were issued.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued 161,000 patents overall in 1999, so the number
of business method software patents was still a small fraction of
the total. Still, they are a crucial component of the
high-technology economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics have said the agency approves such patents too readily
because its examiners do not understand current technology and
Internet practices well enough. They have charged the agency with
hampering competition and innovation by allowing commonplace
business practices to be rendered private property, and with
restricting innovation by entrepreneurs wary of infringement
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That argument has been made many times and has never proved to
be the case,'' Dickinson countered. ``On the contrary, patents spur
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the dispute over a patent for ``one-click'' shopping
that was awarded to Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of
Amazon.com. The patent is one of the most contested, and is at the
center of a long court battle. But Dickinson believed it resulted
from a process that is intended to encourage innovation and reward
it through patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that Barnes &AMP; Noble has now invented a new system,''
he added. ``I understand they created something better. That's how
innovation works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the patent office seems to have concluded that
some of these patents might deserve greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedures sound remarkably similar to those begun in
1994, after a crisis over patents for software-related inventions.
At the time, the agency was denounced for awarding undeserved
patents because its examiners were not trained software engineers,
were unaware of the latest innovations in software and lacked
comprehensive research materials.
</P>
<P>
   The patent office countered with plans to face the future by
hiring new examiners and training them for two years, and by
expanding its meager software library. Yet the future has arrived,
bringing software for Internet business practices with it, along
with renewed charges from critics that the agency is still
unprepared and continues to award patents for universal practices.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson made it clear that even though his agency might be
redoubling its hiring and training to process this new type of
software patent application, there will be no re-evaluation of the
merit of business method patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventors who worked at a workbench or in a garage are now
online,'' he said. ``But they're still creating inventions they
deserve to have protected, so people can't come along and rip them
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

SOME COUNTRIES SEEK KEYS TO DIGITAL CODE SCRAMBLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Governments around the world are relaxing their
controls on the technology used to scramble computer communications
and keep them secure. But according to a survey to be released
Monday, that trend is coupled with attempts by law enforcement
authorities to gain new surveillance powers.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the third international review of encryption
policies that has been conducted by the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a public interest research group in Washington.
The study (www2.epic.org/reports/crypto2000) finds that many
countries have abandoned earlier attempts to require that a
third-party escrow agent be given a spare key to an encryption code
as a condition for loosening government controls.
</P>
<P>
   But some countries have adopted new laws requiring people to
hand over such keys on demand to law-enforcement agencies, and a
number of other countries are considering such proposals. Such a
trend, the report says, raises new legal questions, like whether
forcing people to release the code that unscrambles their private
data is in effect self-incrimination, which individuals are
protected against in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore and Malaysia are the only countries that have enacted
laws that require users to disclose their encryption keys or face
criminal penalties. In both countries, police have the power to
fine and imprison users who do not provide law-enforcement
officials the keys upon demand or unscrambled versions of the files
or e-mail messages in question.
</P>
<P>
   But similar bills are pending in the United Kingdom and India,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands,
legislation is pending that would require the third-party escrow
agents to release encryption keys and other information, but would
not force a person to incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has rejected past attempts by the Clinton
administration to impose any system in which users of strong
encryption would have to file their code keys with a third party.
But as use of encryption technology becomes more widespread, more
users _ particularly corporate users _ are being encouraged to
voluntarily keep their codes on file with escrow agents.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are considering proposals that give intelligence
and law enforcement agencies new powers to conduct surveillance,
break into buildings or hack into computers to get encryption keys
and obtain information.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world are
also demanding and receiving substantial increases in budgets for
computer surveillance. These new powers and budgets raise concerns
about the expansion of government surveillance and the need for
public accountability, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of countries around the world are not interested
in controlling encryption,'' said Wayne Madsen, a senior fellow at
the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``However, a few nations
are now proposing surreptitious and covert methods for obtaining
private keys and access to encoded communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, the center's executive director, said the report
would contribute to the continuing discussion about the right to
communicate freely and privately in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong encryption is critical for the development of networks
that will safeguard personal communications,'' Rotenberg said.

NEW DISK JOINS CROWDED FIELD IN DATA STORAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fierce competition in the market for portable computer
memory is to get a new entry on Wednesday, when DataPlay Inc. plans
to introduce a disk about the size of a half-dollar that is capable
of storing digital images, audio and multimedia presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators say the disk can record information just like a
computer floppy disk, but will have 500 megabytes of memory,
roughly the equivalent of a full-sized CD-ROM. DataPlay said the
disk conceivably could be used in digital cameras, portable music
players and portable organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive is Steve Volk, a businessman and
scientist who previously helped develop the 2.5-inch disk drive
used in notebook computers, and the 1.8-inch hard drive used to
store data on portable PC cards.
</P>
<P>
   But DataPlay, a start-up company in Boulder, Colo., is entering
a market crowded with inventors and businesses seeking to create
the next major ``form factor'' _ the medium, like the floppy disk
and DVD, that becomes used widely for data storage.
</P>
<P>
   In the music and digital film industries, hardware manufacturers
have gravitated to ``flash'' memory _ solid-state storage media
enclosed in small, plastic cases. But flash memory has drawbacks:
For one, it's expensive. Sixty-four million bytes can cost $200.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts say DataPlay, while its technology is
compelling, will have to persuade makers of portable devices to
make compatible hardware. And the company will have to persuade
record labels and other so-called content creators to embrace the
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Volk said DataPlay would introduce the technology this week at
the Internet World trade show in Los Angeles, where the company
plans to announce several partners, including at least one record
label and several consumer electronics makers. Volk said the new
associates had expressed keen interest in the technology because it
is inexpensive ($5 to $7 a disk), and can be prerecorded with music
or other content or used by consumers to save data.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of the disk's potential, he said record labels
could sell an album on the disk, but also embed five additional
albums. Consumers might then have the option of paying for the
other albums at a later date, when the embedded music would be
unlocked and activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has such broad applications, it's frightening,''
Volk said.

E-COMMERCE: PEPSI TAKES THE PLUNGE, WITH AN ONLINE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PepsiCo's recent announcement that it would conduct a joint
promotion of its products with Yahoo, one of the most popular sites
on the Internet, is promising news for Web site operators that have
struggled to persuade the richest advertisers to spend their money
online.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Internet achieved mass-market audience levels,
consumer goods advertisers like Coca-Cola, Nabisco and _ until now
_ Pepsi, have kept their wallets shut, spending mere pocket change
on the Web. They have argued that the medium may be great for
direct marketing, but it does little to advance their primary
advertising goal: increasing brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Although that sentiment still dominates, industry executives say
such advertisers have begun to experiment more with Internet
advertising campaigns. ``Experiment,'' in fact, is the operable
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us have made commitments to Internet
advertising,'' said Dave Burwick, vice president for marketing at
PepsiCo. ``We've all tried different things, and we're all trying
to learn from each other, because nobody's cracked the code.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever can, analysts said, could open a vault. Consumer goods
companies account for about one-quarter of the $200 billion spent
in non-Internet advertising annually. But online, that share is
still well under 10 percent, said Patrick Keane, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this business to really take off, it's incredibly
important for the consumer brand advertisers to join in,'' Keane
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the deal between Pepsi and Yahoo is noteworthy
more for the companies involved than for the dollar amount.
Burwick, of Pepsi, said the arrangement was ``essentially a barter
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi will promote Yahoo on 1.5 billion soft drink bottles and
with displays at 50,000 stores around the nation. Yahoo, in turn,
will promote Pepsi's products on a new, co-branded site that Yahoo
will operate, called PepsiStuff.com. During the promotion, which is
scheduled to begin in August, bottle caps of Pepsi's brands will
contain codes that can be redeemed online for prizes and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Burwick said that even though this first deal would not involve
a monetary investment, it would ultimately result in future ad
spending on Yahoo. ``It would've happened anyway, but it wouldn't
have had the teeth it'll have now,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
learning that will go on with this, about what works and what
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   What does not work, Burwick said, is an advertising approach
that mirrors television. ``TV viewers are passive _ they say,
`Entertain me. Move me,' '' he said. ``On the Web, they're saying,
`Interact with me.' So you have to have a more active experience.
It's different than throwing a bazillion banner ads out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, consumer goods advertisers have consistently derided
banners, the rectangular ads that appear at the top of Web pages,
which remain the workhorse of Internet advertising. The consumer
goods companies, which are accustomed to high-impact television
spots designed to elicit an emotional response, say banners are too
small and too limited in what they can convey through sound and
video.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia banner ads do exist, but many Web site publishers
reject them because they generally slow down the performance of the
site for people who have modem connections _ still the majority of
Web surfers. So advertisers are left to pitch their products with
flat, unobtrusive ads that are frequently ignored. Although some
studies have shown that static banner ads can increase brand
awareness, the stigma remains.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising agencies have also been reluctant to find creative
ways to make banners work, said Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group. ``There's an
institutionalized preference for TV on behalf of agencies,'' he
said. ``The big creative guns are more interested in sitting by the
Beverly Hills Hotel pool shooting a TV package than putting
something together for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But such obstacles are diminishing in the face of other factors,
said Anil Singh, Yahoo's chief sales and marketing officer. ``The
Web has become such a mainstream lifestyle element that companies
can't ignore it anymore,'' he said. ``So for us, everything's
coming together nicely and we're seeing a lot more activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are as well. Over the past several months, ads for
consumer brands like Pizza Hut have shown up on Lycos. And Unilever
has deepened its commitment to Microsoft's MSN portal, sponsoring
channels with brands like Lipton tea and Dove soap, and agreeing to
sponsor the MSN Europe site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies like Nike and Johnson &AMP; Johnson have bought
multimedia Internet ads using technology created by Unicast
Communications. Since the ads do not slow a site's performance
demonstrably, they have gained approval from sites on America
Online's network, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are moving a little more quickly than we'd thought''
with consumer products companies moving online, said Keane, of
Jupiter Communications. Last year, Keane predicted that consumer
goods companies would slowly increase the share of their
advertising budgets on the Internet, from 2 percent in 1999 to 7
percent in 2003. If the online experiments by Pepsi, Procter &AMP;
Gamble and others bear fruit, he said, those dollars should flow
even more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, of Yahoo, said ad campaigns on the Web could be
constantly tested and refined _ giving the Web an advantage over
other media like television or print, where the absence of direct
feedback makes testing logistically difficult, and where production
costs are higher and lead times longer.
</P>
<P>
   Since Web portals and Internet advertising networks like
DoubleClick Inc. cover multiple sites and tens of millions of
users, they can test campaigns and refine them in a multitude of
ways. For instance, they may experiment with sponsorships, banners,
contests and e-mail advertisements, evaluating the response by
tracking the respondent's behavior and, in some cases, through
surveys. ``There's a lot of work that goes into finding things that
meet the advertisers' objectives,'' said Mike Siegenthaler,
marketing manager for MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Siegenthaler said that refinements had even yielded success with
static banner ads. That, in turn, has begun to change the lowly
reputation of banners. In past years, he said, advertisers focused
on so-called click-through rates of banner ads _ the rate at which
users clicked on an ad _ to determine a campaign's effectiveness.
Advertisers saw click-through rates plummet from about 2 percent in
1998 to 0.5 percent in the past year, and used that data to justify
their continued refusal to buy such ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now people are realizing that there has to be value in all
the other ads that are not clicked on,'' he said, referring to the
brand awareness that can result from the banner ads' simply
appearing on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketers remain unconvinced, however. Burwick, of Pepsi,
used banner advertisements last year, with the introduction of
Pepsi One. But he said he would now limit such efforts, and instead
seek more innovative marketing arrangements, such as the one with
Yahoo. ``Unless it's a new product where you have real news,
banners are just not effective,'' he said. ``We don't want to view
this medium as another mass broadcast vehicle.''

BIG PUBLISHERS LOOKING INTO DIGITAL BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the weeks since Stephen King's e-novella made its debut with
the unexpected fury of Carrie at the high school prom, traditional
publishers are quickening their entrance into the emerging market
of digital books with a mix of anxiety about security issues and
optimism about nurturing new forms of literature.
</P>
<P>
   Random House, the nation's top trade publisher of popular books,
is quietly poised to buy a 49 percent stake in an Internet
start-up, Xlibris, according to publishing executives with
knowledge of the deal. This digital vanity publisher offers any
would-be author the chance to self-publish electronic books or
short print runs of paper copies for a rock-bottom fee as low as
$450. (Editing frills not included.)
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom, the second-ranked trade
publisher which was overwhelmed with publicity about King's
electronic version of ``Riding the Bullet,'' is also seriously
considering posting more works by its major authors online. And
Fatbrain.com, the online bookseller that has nudged the market
forward by commissioning electronic manuscripts, reported that
other top publishers are moving to post works through its service,
MightyWords, which in the last two weeks filled 50,000 orders for
essays by prominent authors like Pete Hamill and Doris Kearns
Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people understand the future is now and that
gives it a sense of urgency to a number of players,'' said Jonathan
Newcomb, the chief executive of Simon &AMP; Schuster, who noted that
``the big players are looking around and seeing if there's some
opportunity in a digital environment. And I think some of the
distinctions between books and magazines and journals are going to
become less relevant. I think you're going to see a melding of
various kinds of print media.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether customers will exhibit the same
level of enthusiasm for electronic books when they actually have to
pay for them. The MightyWords essays, for example, are free. And
King's 66-page e-novella attracted a burst of 500,000 orders while
some major online booksellers were giving it away without charge.
That demand quickly tapered off after the first 48 hours that the
title was posted on March 14, with orders far below King's usual
sales of more than a million per title.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, the horror meister cast a long shadow on the
evolution of the e-book market because his work offered lessons on
publishing in a new environment and greatly raised expectations
about the immediate future among publishers in the United States
and in Europe. Online booksellers like Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com could not keep up with the pace of the initial
orders. And it took less than two days for hackers to figure out
how to break through security measures and to post the material on
Web sites along with instructions enabling others to crack the
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it matter in the beginning if some high-profile things
get hacked?'' said Martin Eberhard, the chief executive of
NuvoMedia, which developed the Rocket eBook reading devices. ``The
trouble is that you create a culture of hacking, and a high-profile
story like Stephen King is impetus to create the software. It's
exactly parallel to what happened in the music industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the wave of publicity about King's novella was another
significant event that might have a greater impact on the nascent
digital book market. Gemstar International Group in California and
the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia announced a deal to
plunge into the electronic book industry to create a mass market
for digital reading devices with the aim of producing 500,000 of
them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar, which earlier in the year purchased NuvoMedia and
another e-book pioneer, Softbook Press, is licensing its electronic
book technology to Thomson, which will manufacture the devices in
exchange for a share of revenues from books sold for reading on the
minicomputers. Between NuvoMedia and Softbook Press, there are
fewer than 15,000 of the electronic readers on the market and up
until now these small companies lacked the clout and volume to
persuade publishers to distribute many titles electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell less books than a corner book store right now,'' said
Gemstar's chief executive, Henry C. Yuen, noting that the result
was that publishers previously offered Softbook and NuvoMedia
``small numbers of titles now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the announcement of the Thomson alliance and the
popularity of the Stephen King novella, he said that three of the
nation's top publishers are now in final negotiations with his
company to make available everything _ from new front list titles
to perennial favorites from the back list. He declined to identify
those companies. And he added that Gemstar is also involved in
discussions with other manufacturers to build other brands of
e-books.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, which makes TV sets under the RCA label, is working
feverishly to design a lighter weight model with more capacity and
functions that will be available for Christmas. This new design
will be a little larger than a paperback, weigh less than a pound,
come in screens of color and monochrome, and offer memory cards so
that a consumer can shift from reading books to listing to titles
or music, said Lou Lenzi, vice president for new ventures at
Thomson Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   He said these new devices will be able to download digital books
not only from personal computers, but directly from telephone
lines. The devices do not even have a name yet, he said, but plans
are also under way to offer a removable memory card for the
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to popularize the platform of electronic books,'' said
David Arland, director of public relations for Thomson, which has
its headquarters in Paris and its U.S. offices in Indiana. ``I
think we have the capability to do that much faster than a start-up
like NuvoMedia or Softbook. Our hope is to digitize publishing in
that same way that music and videos have been popularized.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the monochrome readers will be sold for about the
same price as NuvoMedia's $199 Rocket eBook, but Thomson said it
wants to bring the price closer to $100. Yuen said that as part of
the Thomson deal, he has pledged to subsidize a multimillion dollar
ad campaign for electronic books, but only if the 500,000 units
reach the market.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it could be a bonanza for book publishers, who
generally do not have deep budgets to advertise individual titles.
Yuen said he will spend more on such advertising than the combined
ad campaigns of top publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing this, I'm able to say to the publishers that not only
am I real, but I'm going to help the industry and so please make
titles available to me. I have to do this because in reality I'm
asking them to bet on the future,'' he said.

<P>
   Feeling left out of the business-to-business bonanza?
</P>
<P>
   Well, just wave a magic wand and call yourself a B2B company!
</P>
<P>
   Lately, everyone from ancient software firms to ailing Web
stores has been making the leap to business-to-business e-commerce.
Never mind that few so-called B2B firms do much Internet business.
And some have yet to sign on customers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been looking for a narrow definition of B2B, the
Net's latest rage, you won't find it. But here's a good starting
point. It's any business that sells to other businesses online or
helps them sell on the Web or . . .
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Blame investors for the B2B hype. After abandoning unprofitable
and free-spending virtual retailers, they raced toward seemingly
sexier ventures such as Chemdex Corp., which sells laboratory
supplies to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Companies that weren't B2B scrambled to become part
of the B2B trend. Last month, Lands' End, a catalog and online
retailer, raised its B2B banner, announcing plans to supply
companies with branded apparel and luggage through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lands' End in B2B land are a host of cash-hungry virtual
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com, a California software retailer that couldn't make a
profit selling to regular shoppers, is now targeting businesses.
And last week, MotherNature.com, an online vitamin retailer that
has been trimming costs, said it would pursue a B2B strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  How do you keep a curious employee from nosing through the
corporate network and into his company's salary database? And how
do you give a preferred client a larger helping of Internet options
than a regular customer?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, corporations are turning to software firms such as
Marlborough-based Gradient Technologies Inc. to help them set
different levels of network access for employees, vendors, and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determine who (the users) are, and give them appropriate
information,'' said Tracy Mansolillo, a Gradient spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gradient's NetCrusader technology was named ``The
Best of Security Solutions'' at the Internet Commerce Expo in
Boston. The company's customers include Citibank, Kaiser
Permanente, and Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, closely held Gradient also has been helping its
corporate customers track people who click into their Web sites.
The function has become more important as hackers continue to break
into corporate sites, swiping valuable information and embarrassing
executives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  As demand for Web site builders skyrockets, many of their
corporate customers are complaining about long delays, huge fees,
and arrogant consultants, a new survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   Executives told Forrester Research that some service providers
refused smaller projects, put off work, jumped ship, and demanded
equity in their firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me either more than I wanted or not exactly what
I wanted,'' an executive with a publishing company told Forrester.
``They have an attitute that I should be grateful to buy their
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting a large share of the gripes were hot developers of
integrated software systems, according to the survey of 50
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients chase integrators the way teenagers chase rock
stars,'' explained Christine Ferrusi Ross, a Forrester analyst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  The .nu guys on the domain block are beginning to rattle
their more established .com colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The first spat involves Expedia.com, a big online travel service
spun off last year by Microsoft Corp., and cybersquatter
Expedia.nu.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia Inc., which owns the trademark for the word Expedia, has
challenged the Swedish company that registered the domain name
Expedia.nu. The fight will be arbitrated by the World Intellectual
Property Association, part of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the skirmish is .NU Domain Ltd., which has been handing
out domain names such as Microsoft.nu, Harvard.nu, and Amazon.nu to
anyone with a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's Web site, www.nunames.com, users can buy new
domain names for less than $100 a pop. Still available: Gillette.nu
and Procterandgamble.nu.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that the UN is watching.

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the cooler things to happen to photography in the digital
age has been the emergence of 360-degree pictures. They create a
``you are there'' experience for viewers, who use their computer
mouse to control what part of a panorama they see.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the technology has quickly found a host
of uses, such as remote tours of homes for sale and interactive
entertainment. You can use your computer to pick which room or part
of an event or scene you want to see and zoom in as if you were
standing there watching with your own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While the pictures can be incredibly fun to look at, they can
also be a bear to make, requiring expensive equipment and complex
efforts to stitch together two or more pictures into a continuous
image.
</P>
<P>
   A firm that just moved its headquarters from Manhattan to
Westborough, Mass., however, is starting to roll out what it
promotes as a fast, cheap, one-click way to create ``interactive
images'' _ and a way to move quickly into real-time 360-degree
video for people who have powerful enough Net connections.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Cyclovision Technologies Inc., has just renamed
itself Remote Reality. It makes extensive use of technology
developed at Columbia University's computer science labs, including
seven patented or patent-pending inventions.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how its system works, try to imagine you are
looking up the stem of a martini glass to the reflections on the
underside of the cup. If you could counter-distort and greatly
magnify the images, you would have a way of looking at almost the
entire room.
</P>
<P>
   What Remote Reality now sells is a $500 lens that does just
that. The device has a convex mirror, about the size of a hamburger
bun, mounted by a pen-size stem to the front of the lens. It fits
most digital cameras, including Agfa, Nikon, and Olympus models.
You also have to buy a $300-a-year software license for converting
the images into a usable form.
</P>
<P>
   To take pictures, instead of looking through the camera and
aiming at a point in front of you, you aim the lens up at the
ceiling or sky to take in the whole scene.
</P>
<P>
   Through a fairly simple software process, pictures can be edited
and posted on the Web within minutes. And they can be downloaded in
a second or two with a broadband-speed connection. It might take up
to a minute, however, for a dial-up modem, because an individual
image may easily contain 2 megabits of data.
</P>
<P>
   Once the image is on your computer, you have everything you need
to see and rotate it because Remote Reality runs on so-called Java
applets rather than a special plug-in program you have to download
from a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the company plans field tests of a streaming video
product it expects to become available this fall. That will open
the door for people who have broadband-speed Net connections to
watch sports events, concerts, or street scenes in interesting
places as if they were standing there.
</P>
<P>
   The video system uses digital compression that can make images a
little herky-jerky. Without using billions of pixels, there is only
so far you can zoom in before the picture starts looking like bad
satellite surveillance of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, you could easily spend $25,000 on digital
cameras and associated software to create 360-degree images. You
could also take years off your life enduring the frustration of
making usable pictures. Both the price and complexity have since
plunged, though possibly not far enough for the average amateur
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the field to date has been Silicon Valley-based
Interactive Pictures Corp. or Ipix, whose system requires taking
two images with a 180-degree fisheye lens to create one panorama.
It can cost as little as $330 if you already have a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   However, you have to pay Ipix a fee for every image you make,
like buying Polaroid film _ about $1.25 a pop for the consumer
product and a lot more for professional systems. If the light
levels in the two images are starkly different _ a picture at
Fenway Park, for instance, showing the sun-dappled field and the
gloomy grandstand _ getting the images to synch up can be vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have paid Remote Reality your annual software licensing
fee (which includes upgrades), you can take all of the images you
want, including plenty of bad practice shots to get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   Remote Reality's president, Jeb S. Hurley, is so convinced
people will love the product that he left a job running a $1
billion division of Eastman Kodak to take over the 14-person
company last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You turn photography into an experience, as opposed to a mere
presentation of images,'' Hurley said. ``I think Web advertisers
are going to love this because they are really thirsty for
something more compelling than click-through banner ads.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hurley's demonstrations shows the inside of a Lexus. You
get all the same visual information you could get from looking at
five or six sequential pictures of the dashboard, passenger seat,
rear window, and driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to explain without seeing it yourself, but trust your
reporter: When you sit in front of the computer scrolling around
the inside of the car in a continuous loop, you can really imagine
you are sitting on the gearshift.
</P>
<P>
   The potential applications for 360-degree photography and
videography are huge, going beyond entertainment and advertising to
include videoconferencing, military surveillance, one-camera video
security systems for office lobbies, and interactive photographs
for Web news sites that put you in the journalist's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Once millions of people finally have broadband-speed Net access,
it is easy to imagine that something as common as sending a
relative a picture of your new home will take on a totally
different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending her some snapshots of the porch and the
kitchen and the kids' room, you would zap her a file that would
make her feel that she was standing there with you. As Hurley puts
it, with 360-degree pictures, ``You begin to change the very way
you think about an image.''

HIGH-FLIERS SHARE THE WEALTH WITH THEIR OLD SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ In this enclave of fabulous wealth sits a
public school that works hard to blend in with its unassuming
surroundings, lest it betray its high-profile benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which runs from kindergarten through eighth grade,
counts among its friends Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle
Corp. and unofficial Silicon Valley playboy; L. John Doerr, the
uber-venture capitalist who has funded Amazon.com and Netscape;
and, Scott Cook, cofounder of Intuit Inc.
</P>
<P>
   All like to give generously to the school's multimillion-dollar
foundation through an annual auction that has come to symbolize the
power of new money. At last year's auction, described in caustic
and hilarious detail in David Kaplan's recently published book
``The Silicon Boys,'' Ellison offered a week in the French Riviera
on his 192-foot yacht, complete with an 11-person crew. The outing
went for $125,000, thrusting the total amount raised to $439,000
(of which $99,000 went to pay for the auction itself).
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid was lobbed by Bruce Thompson, superintendent of
the Woodside School District. Thompson, it turns out, was bidding
on behalf of a Woodside resident rumored to be J. Taylor Crandall,
financial adviser to the Bass family.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson discreetly declined to confirm the rumor but gracefully
agreed to give a tour of his 580-student school. The tour begins in
a kindergarten classroom decked out in tiny blue chairs and red
Play-Doh. Thompson explained that the school gets about $4,400 in
state funding for each pupil, but the Woodside School Foundation
kicks in another $3,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be very ordinary if it weren't for our parents,''
said Thompson, a slender mustachioed man whom students greet as
``Mr. T.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out the various extras afforded by the foundation.
There are two full-time reading specialists, a full-time librarian,
a dedicated art teacher, and a half-time math specialist who,
Thompson carefully notes, has a doctorate in mathematics. Their
salaries are paid primarily from earmarked foundation dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These poor teachers. I don't know how they can continue to
live here,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 40 teachers at Woodside live in the town,
where the average home sale price was $1,592,625 in February,
according to the San Mateo County Association of Realtors. Teacher
salaries average only $32,000, Thompson noted. He does not explain
how teachers feel about a seventh-grade math assignment in which
students are asked to spend $1 million imaginary dollars and
display the results on a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   The tour continues to the school's science center, a building
that came about entirely from two $500,000 donations. The
classrooms have views of a idyllic green lawn surrounded by tall
native oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is occasionally interrupted by the din of
construction crews working on a $12 million project that will add a
gym and six new classrooms. About half of the bill will be footed
by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make his school appear as normal as possible,
Thompson mentions that many public schools in California now have
foundations, including those in neighboring Portola Valley,
Hillsborough, Atherton, and Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, public school foundations are ubiquitous in California,
said Michael Kirst, professor of education at Stanford University.
But the average amount of voluntary contributions is about $100 per
student, making Woodside's foundation a statistical ``outlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodside is a very unusual community,'' Kirst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't exist on state dollars,'' Thompson said. He
explained that Proposition 13, the state's 1978 initiative that
limited property taxes to 1 percent of the property's value, put a
severe crimp on the amount of money spent on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's insta-wealth has changed this horsey, old-money
community, said Thompson, who has been at Woodside School for 15
years and is retiring later this year to teach at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of Silicon Valley is that everything has to be
done yesterday,'' said Thompson, who has taken to reading Fortune
and Business Week magazines to better understand his student's
parents. ``That does come into the school. The kids are so highly
programmed that they practically need a Palm Pilot to figure out
where they need to go next. More is better. And the parents are
always negotiating with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The school tries to tone down the Valley's hypercompetitive
culture by requiring that each student perform at least 30 hours of
community service between their sixth and eighth grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to teach them to give from the heart,'' Thompson said.
``Many of them will be our future philantropists.''

TIME TO DO SOME YELLING ABOUT THE `QUIET PERIOD' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BETH HEALY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was going to be a darned interesting story about a
start-up's fund-raising experience. We did the interviews. We got
all the juicy details on its next-generation TV services, its
money, and its financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the chief executive talked to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He called back and said he shouldn't have spoken to us because
(gasp) his company is in the dread and oh-so-mysterious ``quiet
period.'' If we wrote the story, he claimed, he'd be in trouble
with the feds. Worse, if a story appeared where he seemed to be
touting his IPO _ which is slated to happen not this month, but
``sometime this year'' _ it might derail his stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   We'll still write that story, of course. But the incident
brought to a head the frustrating mythology of so-called quiet
periods, which are being overused in this heyday of high-tech stock
offerings, nervous chief executives, and overly zealous lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts. First, there is absolutely no rule in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's books about quiet periods. In
fact, no such words show up anywhere in securities law.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to quiet periods, observes Stuart Cable, a partner
at Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar in Boston, ``Much of what you're dealing
with is lore, rather than law.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. All of the rules related to the quiet period have
been written by lawyers, who are paid worrywarts. They all agree on
one central rule: that companies should clam up as soon as they
agree with their investment bankers to do an initial public stock
offering. The period lasts from then until the day their stock
starts trading, which is usually around 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. The point is _ and always has been _ that
companies should not be talking up their stock, or priming the
market, in advance of an offering. That means they shouldn't be
seeking press, urging their buddies to invest, making forecasts
that aren't in the IPO papers, or suddenly doubling their
advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   It does not mean they should fail to respond to routine
questions about their operations, executives, and prospects during
that time. Nor does it mean that every corporate maneuver,
investment, or buyout thereafter begets a quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   Two wildly successful local companies, Akamai Technologies Inc.
and Sycamore Networks Inc., recently declined to talk to the Globe,
citing quiet periods. Sycamore was doing a secondary stock
offering, Akamai wrapping up a previously announced acquisition
(which was not the subject of the story).
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these are great reasons to shut off the flow of
information. Lawyers say a secondary offering requires less
solemnity than the IPO. An acquisition shouldn't spark a quiet
period, they say, unless the company's finances will be
significantly impacted by the event.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lynnette Fallon, a partner at Palmer &AMP; Dodge in Boston:
``There's no quiet period that gets triggered by an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon says companies are under gag orders simply because some
lawyers and executives are very conservative. They'd rather say
nothing than risk trouble. They're all fearful after the mistakes
of Webvan Group Inc., a Silicon Valley online grocery start-up,
which gave interviews to Forbes Magazine and to TheStreet.com
before its IPO last year. The SEC stepped in, in that case, and
called for a ``cooling-off period,'' delaying the IPO for one
month.
</P>
<P>
   Says Fallon: ``There's a lot of market fear. No one wants to be
the one that gets delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But once a company is public _ like highfliers Akamai and
Sycamore _ there are far fewer excuses not to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cable tells his clients that ``normal corporate news,''
unrelated to a stock sale, is ``natural, desirable, and entirely
consistent with the objective of disclosure to the public which
underlies the federal securities laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the SEC itself pushes for maximum disclosure to average
investors. The regulators have been pushing companies to stop
giving details to Wall Street analysts that they won't give to the
public, or to reporters who are writing to inform the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Unless a company's a few months from going public,
the quiet-period excuse is pure fiction. Why should the growing
ranks of ``insiders'' _ company executives and their families, the
lawyers, venture capitals, and Wall Streeters _ hoard information
that ordinary investors should have, too?
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't. And it's time they grow up and act like the real
companies they profess to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT'S A 'QUIET PERIOD'?
</P>
<P>
   A ``quiet period'' is not required by law but is based on
lawyers' recommendations. It starts the day a company agrees with
its underwriters to go public and ends the day the company's stock
starts trading _ typically about 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   During the quiet period, lawyers tell clients:
</P>
<P>
   --Don't suddenly increase your advertising plans.
</P>
<P>
   --Put one person in charge of all information that goes out of
the company in response to questions.
</P>
<P>
   --No employee, officer, or director should encourage anyone to
buy the stock.
</P>
<P>
   --No employee, officer, or director should divulge forecasts or
other company information not in the IPO prospectus to people
outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   --Respond to legitimate inquiries for facts on the firm's
financial condition and business operations.

 &HT;    1ST Update
 &HT;    EDs: Clarifies Texas' coverage of contraceptives in 11th graf.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Crusading for women, and against Bush
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ How ironic: Two early stalwarts of Planned
Parenthood were George W. Bush's paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Now the national president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America is trying to make sure women around the country know
that the grandson _ the Texas governor and Republican presidential
nominee _opposes a woman's right to an abortion except in cases of
rape or incest or to protect the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Texan Gloria Feldt, who was born in Temple, graduated from high
school in Stamford in West Texas and started her career with
Planned Parenthood in Odessa, is the driving force behind the new
pro-active stance of the longtime family planning organization.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt, 57, who has three kids and four grandkids, is traveling
the country, focusing on college campuses. She's warning younger
women that reproductive rights they take for granted may be at
stake in this year's
</P>
<P>
   election.
</P>
<P>
   She's very aware of some male-female ironies. For instance, the
birth control pill celebrates its 40th birthday this month _ but
most insurance plans still don't cover its use, Feldt said. Yet
``when Viagra came out, insurance plans instantly covered it _
instantly!'' Feldt said. ``So male sexual performance was obviously
more important than women's reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's a big issue. It's one of those little injustices
that people tended not to know about, and we're making sure that
they know about them.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly aggressive Planned Parenthood organization set up an
independent political arm and a political action committee in 1998
so it could endorse candidates and let voters know its stands on
reproductive
</P>
<P>
   rights issues, Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee pushed issues to ``hold legislators feet to the
fire,'' such as forcing insurance plans to cover contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises most people to know that only about a third of
insurance plans cover contraception routinely, and very few plans
cover all medically approved methods,'' Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   The group pushed that issue in Congress and before state
legislatures, and now federal employees' contraceptive items are
covered, and nine state legislatures have required insurance plans
covering prescription drugs to include contraceptives, Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, through a Texas Department of Insurance regulation, since
1978 has required coverage of oral contraceptives by insurance
plans that cover prescription drugs. But coverage of other forms of
contraception, like patches and injections, is not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt's target this year is Bush. While Planned Parenthood ``is
a quintessentially nonpartisan organization,'' Feldt said ``that
doesn't stop us from doing voter education.''
</P>
<P>
   And in election year 2000, her organization, which an aide says
has more than 5 million women visiting its 900-plus service
delivery centers annually, plans to make sure Americans know about
Bush's stands on
</P>
<P>
   reproductive health and rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has generally soft-pedaled his pro-life stance during
elections in Texas. But in competing for his party's presidential
nomination this year, he became more outspoken. For instance, he
said the Roe decision ``was a reach (and) overstepped the
constitutional bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has already announced himself to be the most
anti-abortion governor in the country,'' Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made the arrogant statement that Americans hearts
aren't right; that's why he can't outlaw abortion altogether just
yet,'' she said. ``But I suppose he thinks he's going to put our
hearts right. I find that about as insulting as anything I've ever
heard _ as if our hearts are not up to his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, several polls show Bush ``has been very good at
obfuscating his position, and in making it sound as though he's not
an extremist, and so therefore he won't make it a big issue,''
Feldt said. But, she reminded, in the U.S. Supreme Court, ``Roe vs.
Wade hangs by a one-vote thread right now _ one vote.'' The next
president will probably have several appointments to the court,
Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, as the November general election nears,
Bush and Democratic nominee Al Gore will move toward the center on
issues such as education and health care to appeal to the broadest
number of voters,
</P>
<P>
   Feldt predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) there will be clear-cut differences between these two
candidates on reproductive health and rights issues,'' she said.
``So what could easily happen is that reproductive rights could
become one of the _ if
</P>
<P>
   not the _ most explicitly defining issues of the race.''

 &HT;    Texas employers may fire workers at will
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Employers do not have a legal duty to act with
``good faith and fair dealing'' in their relations with workers,
the Texas Supreme Court said Thursday in one of several rulings
involving employers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the first time the court ruled specifically on
the issue, its conclusion conformed with the state's ``at-will''
employment doctrine, under which employers can fire and employees
can quit ``for any reason or no reason at all,'' as the court put
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, brought by five current and former Midland police
officers, the court compared an insurer's legal obligation to act
in good faith and provide fair dealing to policyholders with an
employer's relationship with employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an insured suffers a loss, he cannot simply contract with
another insurance company to cover that loss,'' said the unanimous
ruling written by Justice Priscilla Owen. ``By contrast, an
employee who has been demoted, transferred or discharged may seek
alternative employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also said it saw no difference between government and
private employers on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Levy, legal director for the Texas AFL-CIO, said he was
struck by the fact that the court ruled unanimously. ``On such a
critical issue it shows the court is marching pretty much in
lockstep with the agenda of employers and isn't finely attuned to
the needs of working people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Texas Association of Business and Chambers
of Commerce, a group that often speaks to employer concerns, could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who had been transferred or lost their status as
peace officers, had sued, alleging retaliation and discrimination.
They lost on most of their claims, but two of them will get a new
hearing on another issue at the trial court level on their claims
for reinstatement.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Streets were blocked off around the suburban
Washington house that is the residence of Cuba's senior diplomat in
the United States _ and as of Thursday, the temporary home of the
father of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, Fernando Remirez de Estenoz, runs the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington, the de facto embassy for a
government that has not had full diplomatic relations with the
United States since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity that Remirez seemed to enjoy in an affluent
neighborhood in Bethesda, Md., disappeared Thursday with the
arrival of Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat's two-story brick home, on a street with trees
abloom with cherry blossoms, was surrounded by television satellite
vans, police cruisers and crowds of neighbors interested in the
commotion in what is otherwise a quiet corner of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government announced Thursday that while Gonzalez
remains in the house, it will not be considered a diplomatic
residence, putting the home under the jurisdiction of American law.
The announcement was apparently an effort to answer Cuban-American
critics who say it would be wrong to unite father and son on Cuban
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, many of Remirez's neighbors probably did not
know what he did for a living. Even fewer may have known that the
government of Fidel Castro maintains a relatively large diplomatic
presence in Washington despite the decades of hostility between
Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The interests section, which is formally affiliated with the
Swiss Embassy although it maintains separate offices in a
nondescript building in downtown Washington, is larger than many
embassies here.
</P>
<P>
   It has a staff of about 20 diplomats and other officials whose
activities are supposed to be tightly monitored by the State and
Justice departments out of concern that some of the Cubans are
spies for the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a diplomat assigned to the interests section was
ordered expelled from the United States on espionage charges. He
was accused of having maintained contacts with a U.S. immigration
official in Florida who has also been accused of spying for the
Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage charges are leveled even more often by the Cuban
government against U.S. diplomats assigned to the U.S. interests
section in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. interests section, which is in the seafront,
seven-story building that once served as the U.S. Embassy in
Havana, is regularly denounced as a ``den of spies'' by Cuban news
organizations and is under intense surveillance by Cuban
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban office here and the U.S. interests section in Havana
were established in 1977, during the Carter administration, in what
was seen at the time as an effort to improve relations between the
United States and Cuba. Like their Cuban counterparts here, the
Americans in Havana operate under the auspices of the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The work of both offices is much like that of an embassy. Both
issue visas. The U.S. mission in Havana has issued more than
100,000 visas and other travel documents over the last five years.
The Cuban interests section here issued 1,300 visas last year for
reporters, editors and photographers seeking to cover Pope John
Paul II's visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The principal restriction on the activities of the diplomats is
one of travel. Cuban diplomats assigned to the interests section
here cannot travel more than 25 miles out of the capital without
the State Department's permission. U.S. diplomats in Havana cannot
pass beyond the city limits without similar permission from the
Cuban Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to try to open a new relationship with the
United States and to try to create the best environment with the
Cuban-American community,'' said Luis M. Fernandez, the spokesman
for the interests section. ``We want to try to get rid of the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long-standing hostility between the U.S. and Cuban
governments, he said Cuban diplomats assigned here generally
enjoyed living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work, but really, it's a pleasure,'' Fernandez
said. ``It's exciting. We realize that we are doing something very
important for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emotions generated by the case of Elian Gonzalez,
the spokesman said, the interests section does not anticipate any
trouble at Remirez's home in Maryland if Gonzalez and his son take
up residence _ at least, no special trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been living for more than 40 years in a crazy
situation, so it's very difficult to say this will be different,''
Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they work in Washington, Fernandez and many of the
Cuban diplomats assigned here choose to live in neighboring
Maryland for a reason that many parents in the Washington area
understand: the public schools in Maryland are considered superior.
``The schools are much better than in Washington,'' he said.

 &HT;    BOUNTY HUNTERS: LONG ARMS OF THE LAW
 &HT;    Relentless pursuit of quarry has few rules for the chase
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Dana Tofig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Martin Johnson sits in his business systems class
Tuesday night and has no idea he is being hunted.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know that two bounty hunters, Garrett Hester and Bob
Fitzgerald, are talking to his brother-in-law, his wife and even
one of his utility companies, trying to find him. And he has no
idea when he pulls into his suburban apartment complex that Hester
and Fitzgerald are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson parks his car, the two hunters pounce. They pull
their black Jeep, brights glaring, nose to back bumper against
Johnson's Altima. They jump out on either side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin, let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!''
Fitzgerald screams. ``Do not move! Do not move!''
</P>
<P>
   Hester gets Johnson out of the car, handcuffs him behind his
back and explains that Johnson missed a court date on a simple
battery charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hester and Fitzgerald work for the company that had posted his
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, their quarry is in the back of the Jeep being carted to
the Dekalb County lockup. After a few moments, Johnson breaks the
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he says with a half-smile, ``this is what you guys do?''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 to 16 hours a day, this is what Hester, Fitzgerald and
the other bail recovery agents at U.S. Fugitive Task Force Inc. do:
Work the phones, their sources and the street looking for people
who have jumped bail.
</P>
<P>
   They have a deep bag of tricks and they are not afraid to use
all of them. They will go anywhere, including funerals and
weddings, and talk to anyone who knows their target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a girlfriend who hates you, I'll find you,''
says Buck Buchanan, co-founder of U.S. Fugitive. ``If you've got a
mother who loves you, I'll find you.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Buchanan was coordinating a plan to capture Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin during a March 17 prayer service for the homeless
he was to lead. Al-Amin, the 1960s black militant formerly known as
H. Rap Brown, had failed to appear in court on several charges and
would have cost a bondsman $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and other agents were going to pose as homeless people
at the prayer service and grab Al-Amin. But the night before
Buchanan was to enact the plan two sheriff's deputies who tried to
serve Al-Amin a warrant were gunned down, one dying hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's prey quickly became the subject of a massive
interstate manhunt by federal, state and local law enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan says the shooting demonstrates the danger bounty
hunters run across sometimes. But, he adds, he doesn't teach his
agents to be cops or cowboys. Bounty hunters are private citizens
with the power to arrest, and he tries to instill in his agents a
mantra for their craft:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get dead. Don't get sued. Try to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, Buck Buchanan is in the company's
headquarters, located in the basement of co-founder Dan Sipes'
Gillsville, Ga., home. Buchanan is puffing a big cigar, drinking a
diet Mountain Dew and waxing philosophical about his job. He
realizes that many consider his line of work _ hunting human beings
for profit _ reprehensible. To those people, he is just a ``scumbag
bounty hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old ex-Marine with the receding crew cut sees it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some who give the bounty hunting industry a bad
name. But Buchanan said his firm follows all the rules and he sees
his job as a public service: getting lawbreakers off the street
without having the taxpayers foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're really doing something good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fugitive agents, like most bounty hunters, get hired and
paid by the companies that bail people out of jail and are in
danger of losing hundreds or thousands of dollars because the
defendant didn't show up for court. The pay for the bounty hunter
is usually 10 percent to 15 percent of the bond amount.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters _ or bail recovery agents, in more modern
parlance _ have wide latitude in how they can pursue their prey. By
signing an agreement with a bail bondsmen, defendants have given up
some of their rights if they miss court dates and a judge orders
them rearrested.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty hunters' powers go relatively unchecked and
unsupervised. That lack of supervision has at times caused
problems, with unscrupulous bounty hunters thinking they are above
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like extrajudicial. They are not ruled by police.
Nothing applies to them,'' said Don Geary, a metro Atlanta
prosecutor, who has prosecuted three bounty hunters. ``They could
take someone, throw them in the trunk and drive with them 200 miles
in the trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges that bounty hunters have recklessly fired their guns in
the street or broken down the door of a wrong home have led to
changes across the country, in efforts to rein in the ``cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Some bounty hunters want to find a ``skip'' quickly so they can
get paid and move on to the next suspect. But it can take days to
track down somebody. U.S. Fugitive agents have traveled across the
country looking for ``skips.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan believes in the ``low and slow'' approach _ staying
invisible and waiting for the fugitive to reveal himself. Maybe
he'll use a credit card. Maybe he'll try to buy a car or rent an
apartment. Or maybe he'll call his mom or order a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with mailing lists being sold and the frequent
requirement of Social Security numbers, phone numbers and driver's
licenses for identification, it's nearly impossible to hide for
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy just doesn't exist,'' Buchanan said. ``If you're
breathing, there's no way to stay private.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan once placed an obituary in a newspaper announcing the
death of a bail jumper's mother. When the man called home to find
out of if it were true, Buchanan traced the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   He has posed as a radio disc jockey handing out free tickets to
an Eagles concert and even passed himself off as a lawyer trying to
organize a class-action lawsuit against bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Once a suspect is captured, Buchanan said, he will treat him
with respect. He may even stop and buy him a six-pack of beer or
give him a couple of smokes during a long car ride. But if they
give him trouble, ``they can ride in the trunk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Buchanan will never apologize for snatching people
off the street and putting them back in jail. ``He made a deal
(with the bail bondsman), and he broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick meeting with Buchanan and Sipes at a Waffle House
near Atlanta, Hester and Fitzgerald are ready to make some grabs.
Each has a gun strapped to his side and a badge that reads ``bail
recovery agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hester said he doesn't like to pull his gun, but sometimes he
will. So far, he hasn't had to fire his weapon in his year as a
bounty hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun speaks for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tuesday night would be spent knocking on doors and
gathering small pieces of information about some bail jumpers. The
only pickup they'll make is Martin Johnson, but it won't be easy to
find him.
</P>
<P>
   The first place they head is the home of Johnson's sister, who
co-signed the bail bond agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hester heads to the front door and Fitzgerald runs around back,
where he is met by Johnson's brother-in-law. They walk into the
house, a small, tidy home with religious trinkets, a drum set and
comfortable sofas. A young girl walks around and stares warily at
the strangers. Hester waves; the girl waves back.
</P>
<P>
   The brother-in-law says Johnson does not live there; he just got
an apartment, but his relative does not know exactly where.
</P>
<P>
   Hester says he is just trying to help Johnson work out his legal
problems. He explains that since Johnson's sister co-signed the
bond, she will be responsible for the $2,800 bond if her brother
isn't found. Hester stresses this many times.
</P>
<P>
   The sister's husband seems very concerned: They don't have that
kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be arrested, will he?'' the man asks. Hester lies and
says ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hester says he feels bad sometimes when he has to lie,
``but I think in God's eyes I'll be forgiven for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald adds: ``That's not a rich man back there. We're
fixing on saving him $2,800.''
</P>
<P>
   They find Johnson's apartment complex and start winding through
the many buildings and parking lots looking for his cars: a red
sport-utility vehicle and a green Altima.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, Fitzgerald grabs his cellular phone and
dials up a utility company. He identifies himself as Martin
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't received my bill and I want to make sure you have
the right address,'' he says into the phone. The operator asks for
his Social Security number for verification: Fitzgerald has
Johnson's number. She asks for Johnson's phone number: Fitzgerald
has it. She verifies the address and apartment number.
</P>
<P>
   At the apartment, Fitzgerald and Hester encounter Johnson's
wife, who says there must be a mistake. Hester goes through the
same routine: He's here to work this out. He never mentions an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The woman says her husband will be home around 9 p.m. They leave
a phone number and say good night. They back their truck into a
nearby space and wait for Johnson to come home.
</P>
<P>
   The simple battery charge is cause for concern. ``This guy, he's
a fighter,'' Hester said. They decide to grab him in his car
instead of letting him get to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to be in the position of having to get rough or
bust down a door. When they do have to force a door open, they make
sure a police officer is there as a witness. But still, they don't
like doing it. Lots of people have guns these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know what's behind the closed door,'' Hester
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half-hour cars pull in and Hester and Fitzgerald
scope out each one carefully. The red SUV is in the lot, so they
are looking for the green Altima.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald smokes a couple of cigarettes. Hester chews tobacco
and spits into an empty bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one has potential,'' Fitzgerald says, watching a car make
its way through the complex. It's a green Altima.
</P>
<P>
   Hester starts the ignition on the Jeep, turns on the brights and
pulls forward. Johnson will later tell his captors that he recently
saw a television show about bounty hunters on a cable channel. They
all share a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to consider this interactive TV,'' Fitzgerald says.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:30 a.m., Buchanan is back in the office. He's going
through some new files a bail bondsman gave them earlier. U.S.
Fugitive closed out several files Tuesday. Some they picked up;
others were already in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Sipes says, U.S. Fugitive found more than 700 bail
jumpers. This year, it already has more than 450 files.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan freely admits he doesn't have many talents: He's not a
gifted athlete or a great dancer, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even tell particularly good jokes,'' he adds. ``But
I'll find you and put you in jail. That's what I do.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For baseball fans, hope is supposed to spring
eternal each year as the groundskeepers groom the outfield grass
and comb the base paths for the home opener. But here in Kansas
City, as in Pittsburgh, Montreal, Minneapolis and many other
smaller cities with major-league teams, that perennial optimism has
withered over the last decade in the face of a growing gap between
rich and poor franchises.
</P>
<P>
   As Kansas City prepares for its first home game on Friday, no
longer do most fans here even dream that the once-mighty Royals
will make it to the World Series. Expectations have sunk so low
that even diehard optimists say they would be happy if the Royals
win as many games as they lose this season. Last year the team lost
97 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we can be competitive,'' complained Joe
O'Keefe, 34, a lifelong Royals' fan, who was watching the season
opener on television at Tanners Sports Bar in a Kansas City suburb
earlier this week. ``They are more of a circus act than a baseball
team. You go out there for the carnival atmosphere. You don't go
out there to watch competitive baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The cynicism of fans like O'Keefe does not bode well for
baseball. There is a growing consensus among team owners, fans and
experts on the game that the disparity between high-revenue teams
and those in small markets threatens the sport's future popularity.
Last year, all eight teams that made the playoffs ranked among the
top 10 payrolls in the game. Some owners are asking how baseball
can sustain the interest of fans and attract new devotees if only a
handful of lucrative teams have a realistic chance to make the
playoffs each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For teams like Kansas City, we need to change the economic
landscape of the game,'' said Bud Selig, the commissioner of
baseball, who once owned another small-market team, the Milwaukee
Brewers. ``The evidence is very clear that we do have a disparity
problem. We are going to crack it, because it's essential to the
growth of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the owners voted unanimously to give Selig broader
powers to redistribute the leagues' wealth to less affluent teams;
he has appointed a panel to explore ways to do that, but so far he
has not offered concrete proposals. Baseball officials say the
limited revenue-sharing schemes, including a luxury tax on
high-payroll teams, put in place in 1995 have so far failed to
provide enough extra money to make low-revenue teams more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been haves and have-nots in baseball. Teams in
big cities have always had a natural advantage, because they have a
greater population from which to draw people to games and because
their local television and radio broadcasting rights are more
valuable. In recent years, some medium-sized cities, like Cleveland
and Baltimore, have built new ballparks with luxury amenities that
have given their teams an economic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between rich and poor franchises has grown
significantly since the strike of 1994 as players' salaries have
skyrocketed, and it has become harder for small-market teams to
hold on to their stars, baseball experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is no one really knows what level of inequality is
acceptable,'' Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor
who writes about sports, said. ``You do want the Yankees and the
Dodgers to win a little more. But you have to have a threshold of
happiness all around. You don't want to have year after year
domination by high-revenue teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem is that baseball teams do not share
local broadcast revenues, which vary widely from town to town. In
1998, for instance, the New York Yankees, with a market of more
than 6.8 million households with televisions, received more than
$53 million for local broadcast rights. There are about 802,000
households with televisions in the Kansas City metropolitan area,
and the Royals received only $7 million in broadcast revenues in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ballplayers' salaries have risen dramatically.
In 1990, the average team payroll was $17 million, and the highest
payroll was about three times larger than the smallest. Last year,
the average payroll had increased to $48 million, and the highest
payroll was six times the size of the smallest. The Yankees spent
$88 million on players' salaries last year, or more than five times
the $16 million the Royals spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two players on the Yankees are the whole Royals' payroll,''
Mark J. Davis, a season-ticket holder, said. ``What does that tell
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in line outside Kauffman Stadium Thursday to buy
advance tickets, several fans said they still come to the ballpark
for the sunshine or to teach their children about the game. But the
idea of a winning a pennant seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here just to show my son what baseball is like, for
something to do, to learn the game and to see the other team's
stars,'' said Jason Stahl, a 29-year-old salesman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some in Kansas City say the team's problems flow from bad trades
and poor management. The Royals have not had an owner since Ewing
Kauffman died in 1993, and some critics say the charitable trust
Kauffman set up to oversee the team and search for a new owner has
been rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   But most Royals fans blame the changing economics of baseball.
``We come out of spring training, we know that we are not going to
be there in the end,'' said Charles Graham, a 30-year-old fan. ``We
don't have the money and the players to be there in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That frustration boiled up in a protest last May, when more than
5,200 fans, organized by Kevin Kietzman, a sports talk show host,
walked out of a Royals-Yankees game in a noisy protest. They wore
T-shirts saying ``Share the Wealth'' and Yankees caps with dollar
bills pasted to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming plain to everyone in Kansas City that the
economics have changed,'' David Judy, a season ticket holder, said.
``Now someone would have to be able to lose $50 million a year to
be a competitive team.''
</P>
<P>
   The stark reality is that teams like Kansas City, which will
spend about $25 million on players this year, can only afford top
athletes early in their careers, before their salaries go out of
reach. Players are now eligible to go to an arbitrator in salary
disputes after three years in the majors, and they become free
agents after six. Since arbitrators peg salaries to those of the
highest paid players, big-market teams set the price for top
players. After three years, the salaries of talented young players
often jump dramatically, and after six they are usually snapped up
by the richer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge in Kansas City, quite candidly, is to
keep the players we have now, because their salaries just mushroom,
they explode,'' the Royals' general manager, Herk Robinson, said.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance a low-revenue team has of winning a pennant is
to somehow cobble together a group of immensely talented rookies
and make it to the playoffs before they become too expensive. John
Schuerholz, a former Royals' general manager who now holds the same
position with the Atlanta Braves, said even that trick is nearly
impossible under the current salary system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might get one year where they can compete and even get
the division or a wild-card spot, but to sustain that is
impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while lightning does strike for small-market teams; in
recent years, the San Diego Padres and the Florida Marlins reached
the World Series. But in each case, the teams' owners sold off many
of their high-priced players the following year because they were
unwilling to sustain the huge losses necessary to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   All this has had a demoralizing effect on fans. Though the
Royals have a core of good young hitters like Johnny Damon,
Jermaine Dye and Carlos Beltran, it is unclear how long the team
can retain them. Last year, only four Royals made more than $1
million. This year, eight players will cross that threshold. With
total revenues of about $50 million, the Royals would have to
consider letting some of the young stars go if there was another
jump in salaries, team officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everyone in Kansas City is saying that as soon as
these young kids get a little experience, they will be gone, they
won't be here,'' said Steve Brentano, a fan and the owner of a
string of sports bars. ``This is like a training camp.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gabe Duff, a 23-year-old sheet-metal worker, said the revolving
door of players wears on fan loyalty. ``We have a lot of good
talent come through here,'' Duff said. ``I got tired of players
coming in and going off to the big-time teams, and you would hear
about them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Royals' fans are more excited this year than they have
been in a while. Many people are hopeful that David Glass, a former
Walmart chief executive who is on the verge of acquiring the
Royals, will be able to lead a charge among low revenue teams to
somehow level the playing field. Glass' $96 million bid for the
Royals has been accepted by the team's board and is expected to be
ratified by the owners later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Glass is no stranger to the team, having served as the chairman
of the board that has managed the Royals since Kauffman's death.
Glass has been a strong proponent of sharing revenues among
major-league teams, and Royals' fans believe he has a powerful ally
in Selig.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Glass said he is confident Selig will do something
to redistribute the wealth. ``Baseball in general has recognized
that the competitive balance has been eroded over the last few
years, and I think there is a consensus among the owners that it
needs to be restored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without more revenue sharing, Glass said, teams like the Royals
risk becoming permanent losers, little more than sparring partners
for big-market juggernauts. ``If nothing changes, we will have a
caste system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' second-class status is a bitter pill for older fans
who remember the team's glory days in the late 1970s and early
1980s. Those Royals, lead by George Brett, the Hall-of-Fame third
baseman, were annual contenders, and they often fought the Yankees
down to the last out. The Royals won the American League pennant in
1980 and the World Series in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffman, a billionaire drug manufacturer who looked on the
team as a civic duty, was willing in those days to absorb a loss to
win a pennant. ``We will never have an owner like Kauffman,'' said
Lee Bussinger, a longtime fan and member of Royal Lancers, a
booster group. ``His pockets were deep enough to bring the players
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kauffman were alive, however, it is doubtful he would be
able to contribute the large sums necessary to make the Royals
competitive in today's baseball economy. ``In the days when
Kauffman was alive, he could chip in $2 or $3 million and put our
payroll on a par with the best,'' Robinson, the general manager,
said. ``When you have clubs with payrolls at $80 million or $90
million, it doesn't make a bit of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Royals' fans point to the National Football League and ask
why baseball cannot adopt a similar revenue-sharing strategy. In
the NFL, the network television contract is huge, worth more than
$2.2 billion a year, with each team getting an equal amount: $59
million a year. Since the league also has a salary cap, even small
markets like Green Bay, Nashville, and Jacksonville can field
successful franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kansas City Chiefs have been playoff contenders for
a decades. They led the NFL in attendance last year at Arrowhead
Stadium, a few hundred yards from Kauffman Stadium, where the
beleaguered Royals struggled to attract 1.5 million fans last year.
In the 1980s, the team regularly attracted at least 2.2 million
fans a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparity in the league is outrageous and the owners have
to come along and realize they have to go to something like the NFL
has,'' Jim Bayliff, a 25-year-old watchmaker, said as he watched
the Blue Jays trounce the Royals on television earlier this week.
``I believe the small market teams are going to be butchered up and
gone.''

GATES APPEARS IN TV AD TOUTING MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: No byline. Story was shorted) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates is on videotape again. And the antitrust case against
his company is again the backdrop. But this time he is taking his
case directly to the people.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. began a television advertising campaign
Thursday featuring Gates, its chairman, pointing to Microsoft's
record of innovation and determination to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second commercial does not directly mention the case
brought by the Justice Department and 19 states, in which a federal
judge this week found Microsoft to have violated antitrust laws
through predatory behavior. But Greg Shaw, a company spokesman,
said that ``as Microsoft is figuring in the news and in public
discussion, we thought it was a good time for our founder to get
out and tell people what the company is about.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not Gates' first video appearance in connection with the
case: excerpts from a Gates deposition taped over more than 20
hours were presented by the government at the antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercial is the first time Gates has been used on
television in his own company's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He tells viewers, ``Twenty-five years ago my friends and I
started with nothing but an idea: that we could harness the power
of the PC to improve people's lives.'' He does not refer directly
to the antitrust case, but says, ``Our goal at Microsoft is to keep
innovating,'' adding, ``The best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the campaign, which began running on network news
programs Thursday night, was taped ``within the last several
weeks'' and would continue for about a week.

LINK OF VACCINATIONS AND AUTISM EXPLORED AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday,
Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform
committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department
of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial
study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after arguments among witnesses and sparring
between leaders of the House Government Reform Committee, in which
the hearing was held. The hearing was called by Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., whose granddaughter has autism, and who believes
she may have got it from a vaccine _ even though current research
has not found any connection between getting vaccines for measles,
mumps and rubella, and the onset of the brain disorder, autism.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking minority leader on
the committee, prodded witnesses and complained to Burton that the
hearing was unfairly stacked to show a connection. He said that
while getting the science right was important, in this case getting
parents to mistrust vaccines would certainly lead to deaths from
diseases society has mostly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream medical organizations and leaders in the field of
immunization agree that there is no convincing evidence for the
theory that the vaccine called MMR _ measles, mumps and rubella _
causes autism, a brain disorder characterized by an inability to
socialize and a tendency to engage in constantly repeated actions
or comments.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause
some cases of autism is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and
University College Medical School in London. He said he took his
cue from parents whose experience of autism seemed to be different
than the usual. The disease is suspected in most cases of being
genetic, and it appears gradually in the first two years of life as
a failure to speak, the beginning of repetitive motions, and a
withdrawal from social interaction. But the parents Wakefield dealt
with said it came on rather suddenly, over a period of months, and
often just after vaccination with the triple vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The signature symptoms, he reports, are bowel pain, inflammation
and erratic bowel habits, in children who also begin to show the
usual mental symptoms of autism. Wakefield has published studies on
a dozen such cases, and will soon publish reports on another 60. He
said there is some suggestive laboratory work, as well, but the
chief message he said was: ``Here is something we need to study.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side, apart from the skepticism of most of the
medical community, is Dr. Brent Taylor, a senior colleague of
Wakefield at the same London Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has done the largest and best-controlled study to date on
the subject, of 498 autistic children in London. He found no
relation between the children's vaccination dates and the onset of
their disease. The disease is usually diagnosed when retarded
development shows up in the first two years of life; vaccination
usually is done at about 16 months of age; Parents and doctors
noticing the two coming together could be coincidental, he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that whatever the case with most autism, ``We owe it
to our children and grandchildren to ensure we're being diligent in
looking for causes of autism. We can't stick our heads in the sand
and ignore the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the parents who told their stories, and who became
teary-eyed along with most in the packed hearing room was Shelly
Reynolds of Baton Rouge. She said her son Liam was the normal
bubbly child who would sing `itsy bitsy spider,' and chime in with
Eieio on `Old McDonald.' But within days of his vaccination, she
said, he became either unruly or spaced-out, and lost his ability
to speak and interact.
</P>
<P>
   She told the committee that you cannot miss such sudden awful
and sudden changes if you are a parent. ``Parents like me are
relying on you to demand that the pharmaceutical companies retrace
their steps once again, and the public health community look at the
possibility that these things might not be a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the whole question, and making it more urgent at
the same time, is the dramatic rise in the reporting of autism in
several countries, including the United States. In the 1960s,
various estimates suggested there were about one to four cases of
autism for every 10,000 children. By the 1990s, the numbers had
shot up more than four-fold to 12 per 10,000 in England, and
two-to-five fold in different studies in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether the increase is due to increased
reporting of the disease, which has become much better known in
recent years, especially after the film `Rain Man' about an
autistic man.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to exchanges of scientific details for two
hours, Waxman read the language of a proposed letter to the
secretary of Health and Human Services asking for an impartial
study of the question; Burton agreed to co-sign it, but added that
he will continue to dog the issue with further hearings until
better answers are forthcoming.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: ARMY BASE BOMBED
</P>
<P>
   A bomb exploded inside a British army base near Londonderry,
demolishing a guardhouse wall but causing no casualties. It was the
third attack on security forces in two months, all attributed to
republican groups at odds with the Irish Republic Army. Mitchel
McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, and a
member of the Assembly suspended in February, said, ``There is a
very clear correlation between political failure and the activities
of these groups because they sustain themselves by that failure.''

   RUSSIA: EUROPEAN WARNING
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, has voted to start
suspension proceedings against Russia unless it calls a cease-fire
or starts talks with rebel leaders in Chechnya by May. No country
has ever been suspended from the 41-nation consultative body, and
the Russian delegation walked out after the vote. Officials said in
private it was unlikely member countries would take up the
recommendation. But the vote was intended to put pressure on
President-elect Vladimir Putin.

   AUSTRIA: APOLOGY OVER EX-NAZIS
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats, in opposition after decades in power,
apologized for providing a political haven to former Nazis after
World War II. The party's new leader, Alfred Gusenbauer, said it
must be ``deeply ashamed'' of the way it welcomed ex-Nazis to its
ranks. Several served in the cabinets of the former Social
Democatic chancellor, Bruno Kreisky; others joined the rightist
Freedom Party now led by Joerg Haider.

<P>
   GERMANY: RACISM CHARGE
</P>
<P>
   The campaign slogan of a leading Christian Democrat, Juergen
Ruettgers, has been criticized as racist by a European Union
watchdog committee. Ruettgers has been campaigning in North
Rhine-Westphalia with the slogan ``Children not Indians'' _ a
derisive reference to a proposal that skilled Indians should be
allowed to fill jobs in Internet-related industries. ``German
politicians should have learned more than others from history,''
the European Monitoring Center on Racism said.

<P>
   Parliament approved an amendment to the Constitution requiring
Britain, the former colonial power, to compensate white landowners
for any property seized by the government. The vote was rejected by
Britain, which said one state could not impose constitutional
obligations on another. The clause, which was included in a draft
charter rejected by voters in February, allows the government to
take white-owned land without paying for it.

<P>
   UGANDA: CULT LEADER WARRANTS
</P>
<P>
   The police issued warrants for the arrest of six leaders of a
doomsday cult that the authorities say killed at least 924 of its
members. It is not known if any of them are still alive after a
church fire in Kanungu, southwest Uganda, on March 17, in which as
many as 530 members died. Among those wanted are Joseph Kibwetere,
leader of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments,
and Credonia Mwerinde, who claimed to have had visions of the
Virgin Mary.

 &HT;    Hewitt outlines his philosophy for Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New Georgia Tech basketball coach Paul Hewitt wasted
little time getting his program going. The former Siena College
coach, introduced to the media Thursday afternoon, immediately hit
the road recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who in three seasons at Siena resurrected the program at
the small Franciscan school in upstate New York, is setting his
sights high at Tech. He is expected to make a strong run at Darius
Rice, the Jackson, Miss., forward who is the nation's top unsigned
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Although NCAA rules forbid coaches from commenting on specific
recruits before they sign, Hewitt said he is seeking impact
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find someone who can come in and help the program,
we'll go after them,'' said Hewitt, who was 66-27 at Siena. ``And
you can find quality players for Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior-college players might be considered, as long as they have
strong academic backgrounds. ``That'll be a bonus if I do find
one,'' Hewitt said. ``They're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The period allowed for contact with recruits ends Sunday, and
the monthlong signing period begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is getting in front of people,'' said Hewitt,
who replaces Bobby Cremins, Tech's coach for 19 seasons. ``I hope
to do that tonight. If I can get into somebody's house ... this is
a great product _ Georgia Tech, the city of Atlanta, the
opportunity to play in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only goal for players is that they are going to end up with
an option on how to live their lives, a degree and basketball, if
that's what they want to do. I'm not going to shy away from kids
whose goal is to play basketball for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt received a five-year contract worth $400,000 annually,
with an additional $100,000 yearly from camps, speaking engagements
and shoe and apparel contracts. He will meet with current players
individually, including point guard Tony Akins, who has considered
transferring, and center Alvin Jones, who might enter the NBA
Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to stay,'' Hewitt said. ``But I don't think it's
healthy to convince them to stay. You enjoy the most success when
kids want to be where they are. If they do stay, they'll be better
off for it. If they want to leave, I'll help them the best that I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Akins said his initial impressions are positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy seems like the type of coach I'd like to play for,''
Akins said. ``His style is up-tempo, shoot a lot of threes. Right
now, I want to meet with him first.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players are looking forward to Hewitt's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants everybody to be able to shoot when open,'' guard
Shaun Fein said. ``I'm excited to get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hewitt cautioned that playing a running, pressing
defense is not all fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals is to get them into the best shape of their
lives to play this style,'' he said. ``The system is important, but
the thing that has made us successful is our efforts in the area of
player development. If you play the style we play, you've got to
teach people how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Final Four, I had a chance to hear (former coach) Pete
Newell speak. He said he thinks the game today is overcoached and
undertaught. I think if you watch us play you will see a team that
is not overcoached but is very well taught.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pressing, running style with multiple substitutions is
in vogue now, it has been around for decades. Hewitt said he played
in such a system in high school on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hewitt will bring along one member of his Siena staff
and also consider current Tech assistants. Mark Price has continued
to work with players since the season ended, and Willie Reese kept
the recruiting fires burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' said Reese, who, like Price, played for
Cremins. ``Because I grew up three miles from here, I've never left
Atlanta, and Georgia Tech is in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins, who announced Feb. 18 that he would not return for
another season, could not be reached for comment. But longtime Tech
basketball supporters said Cremins would embrace Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who fell in love with Georgia Tech basketball did so
because they fell in love with Bobby Cremins,'' supporter Bill
Gannon said. ``Paul Hewitt is the kind of man Bobby Cremins would
want to follow in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech President Dr. Wayne Clough said the athletics board
approved Hewitt's hiring unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a winner, and we look for that in our coaching
staff,'' Clough said. ``But at the same time, we look for someone
who appreciates the challenging academic culture at Georgia Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletics director Dave Braine said he was made aware of Hewitt
through a mutual friend who is an NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing in a good guy here,'' Braine said. ``In a
couple of years, (people) will realize we made an excellent
choice.''

NOVARTIS SEEKS CURB ON SALE OF GENERIC CYCLOSPORINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc., facing competition for
cyclosporine, its largest selling drug, has asked health officials
in several states to limit the sale of generic versions claiming
they are not interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclosporine is the leading medication for organ transplant
recipients with estimated U.S. sales last year of $550 million.
Novartis' patents on the drug have expired and two small companies
have developed less expensive generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   One firm, Eon Labs Manufacturing Inc. of Laurelton, NY, recieved
US Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year and
plans to begin marketing its drug later this month. The FDA
maintains Eon's generic version is bioequivalent and could be used
as a replacement for the Novartis drug.
</P>
<P>
   A second company, Sangstat Medical Corp. of Fremont Calif. is
expected to receive a similar FDA endorsement in the next few
months and has teamed up with Abbott Laboratories to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Novartis asked the state's Department of Public
Health to put its brand name drug, called Neoral, on the
``Exemption List'' of interchangeable drugs _ a move that would
require pharmacists throughout Massachausetts to only sell Neoral
unless physicians wrote prescriptions that specified the generic
versions.
</P>
<P>
   If the generics prevail over Novartis, transplant patients would
automatically receive the lower priced versions of cyclosporine,
which would reduce Neoral's revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, generics take 25 to 40 percent of a brand name's
drug's revenue in the first two years of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis insists there are scientific differences between its
drug and the generics. It cites Eon's FDA data over how their
medication with food results in a slightly different interaction
compared to patients using Neoral.
</P>
<P>
   Eon and Sangstat officials maintain Novartis' concerns have less
to do with medical issues and more with competitive fears and loss
of market share for a very profitable drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Novartis is looking to protect its cyclosporine franchise
which means charging patients close $5,000 a year for their drug,
while we plan to charge at least 20 percent less,'' said Frank J.
Della Fera, Eon's vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But some physicans and pharmacists maintain there could be
differences between the two drugs, noting that a slight variation
in dosage could negatively impact transplant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very high to switch patients who have taken
Neoral for many years to a generic, that we don't know much
about,'' said Dr. Fred Gordon, medical director of liver
transplantation at Leahy Clinic in Burlington, Mass. ``Having a
mandatory substitution without physicans knowing how well the
generic is absorbed in the patient's system could prove difficult.
Maybe over time that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are no drugs on the Massachusetts ``Exemption
List,'' said Grant Carrow, director of the drug control program of
the Massachusetts Department of Health. He said a discussion and
possible decision on Novartis request, with input from the generic
firms, is scheduled for May 9th by the Drug Formulary Commission,
an eight-person independent group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the generic and brand name drugs are
therapeutically the same and they do not pose any potential risk to
the patient's health,'' explained Carrow.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, which has made similar appeals in Texas, Virginia and
North Carolina, is following in the footsteps of duPont
Pharmaceuticals Inc. which tried unsuccessfully to halt the sales
of a generic equivalent to its drug Coumadin in Massachusetts
nearly five years ago.

`JESUS' SON': GOOFY AND STRUNG OUT BUT CHARMING ALL THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son,'' Alison Maclean's scruffy, likable new film
adapted from a book of linked short stories by Denis Johnson,
follows the adventures of a young man known only by a nickname that
can't be printed in this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He acquires this sobriquet _ the initials are F.H. _ because of
his almost miraculous propensity to screw things up, to bring bad
luck on himself and those around him.
</P>
<P>
   But as incarnated first in Johnson's dreamy, neo-beatnik prose
and now in Billy Crudup's transcendent goofing, F.H. retains a
curious aura of innocence. He's like Candide strung out on every
drug he can find, or an itinerant holy man hitchhiking across the
Midwest in wet, filthy hipster hand-me-downs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of ``Jesus' Son,'' which is being shown
Friday and Saturday as part of the New Directors/New Films series
at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, is watching a filmmaker
take risks and discover new resources of style. True to her source,
Maclean tells the young man's story in a looping, absent-minded
manner, skittering ahead and then scrambling backward to fill in
forgotten details.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to string together a series of self-contained
vignettes could have resulted in meandering tedium, but she manages
to find a loose, improvisatory rhythm that matches Johnson's
discursive riffing, and that gives her scenes a keen edge of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Her use of Johnson's own words in the voice-over narration works
less well. Some of his breathless beatnik invocations of the beauty
of the universe lose their innocence on the journey from page to
soundtrack and come across as more fussy than inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The film is fragmentary and episodic, but its first two
sections, set mostly in the brown wintriness of Iowa in 1971,
achieve a tattered narrative unity, thanks to the hero's on-again,
off-again obsession with a doomy, passionate young woman named
Michelle (Samantha Morton).
</P>
<P>
   As their relationship ambles along on its inevitable course from
stoner comedy to junkie tragedy, our hero encounters a succession
of memorably messed-up characters, including Wayne (Denis Leary),
who sucks spilled booze out of a cocktail napkin and smashes the
walls of his own house to find copper wire to sell for scrap, and
Georgie (Jack Black), a hospital orderly who is either a gifted
healer or a dangerous psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Georgie figures in the film's most memorable sequence, a set
piece shot in the hallucinatory fluorescence of a late-night
hospital. A man wanders in off the street with a hunting knife
sticking out of his eye. ``Patient complains of a knife in his
eye,'' the intake nurse dutifully reports, and later she asks the
man, who was stabbed by his wife, if he wants the hospital staff to
call the police. ``Only if I die,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of surrealist deadpan humor, visual and verbal,
pervades ``Jesus' Son.'' The movie may remind you, in style and
subject, of Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' which similarly
imagined the early 1970s as the golden age of American junkiedom,
and was suffused with a rough, dreamy masculine lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant's film featured William S. Burroughs as its household
saint of pharmacological enlightenment. For her part, Maclean trots
out Dennis Hopper, once the Lord Byron of the drug culture and now
its Ancient Mariner, for a cameo as a scary guy our young friend
meets in rehab.
</P>
<P>
   As it follows F.H. into recovery, the film loses momentum. The
last section is devoted to his new life, post-Michelle, in Arizona.
He has a job at a treatment center for disturbed and disabled
patients, a new love (Holly Hunter) and a voyeuristic devotion to a
Mennonite housewife.
</P>
<P>
   But these details, bereft of the desperate energy of need that
had propelled the rest of the movie, feel small and anecdotal. It's
not that ``Jesus' Son'' romanticizes drug use; on the contrary, it
rubs our faces in the tawdry emptiness of an addict's days. But if
drugs wreck _ and sometimes take _ the lives of F.H. and his misfit
tribe, they also make them interesting, vivid and oddly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   These words also apply to Crudup and Morton, whose chemistry (so
to speak) keeps the film from nodding off into feckless hustler
attitude. Crudup plays a lost, irresponsible and stupid young man
with discipline and intelligence, using every muscle in his face to
suggest the unreachable emotion and the accidental goodness of his
character.
</P>
<P>
   His F.H. is authentically creepy and unexpectedly charming. If
you saw him on the street, you wouldn't know whether to cross to
the other side, give him a quarter or take him home with you.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, recently nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of the
mute laundress in Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' is just as
fierce, sweet and angry here, and without much more to say. She
inspires her errant knight to fantasies of rescue and saves this
movie from its own self-destructive impulses. &QL;

 &HT;    Carter vies for title of Next Jordan
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There might never be another Michael Jordan. But just for today,
just for argument's sake, let's say there will be. If such a player
were to exist, wouldn't his career path look like this?
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the star of his college team. He wasn't the first
player drafted, or even the fourth. He isn't based in the United
States. He has been allowed to play his way into being the Next
Jordan, as opposed to having it thrust on him by the NBA's
star-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in sum, Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, Michael Jordan wasn't regarded as the first
Michael Jordan when he arrived in Chicago. He was the guy drafted
behind Sam Bowie. Jordan had Nike behind him, yes, but Nike then
shouldn't be confused with Nike now. Michael Jordan became Michael
Jordan by playing basketball better than anyone else who ever
lived. Carter, who will face the Hawks tonight in Philips Arena,
might or might not be the best player to come along since, but he
has things going for him that other heirs apparent did not.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill came prepackaged and was too circumspect to fit
inside the shrink wrap. Kobe Bryant landed in L.A., where hype is
bought and sold by the case. They were the Next Jordans only
because someone decided they should be, not because they actually
mirrored the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Carter isn't a dead ringer, but he's the closest thing yet. He
has what basketball men call ``the explosion,'' which in laymen's
terms is the capacity to make you leap from your seat and shout,
``Whoo-weeeeeee!!!!'' He has the body and the vertical leap, and he
seems to have the timing.
</P>
<P>
   He was rookie of the year in strike-blighted 1999, meaning that
his reputation had a chance to grow by word of mouth. In his
ballyhooed first game on NBC, Carter stacked 51 points on
Philadelphia. That was a Jordanian move _ surmounting the
insurmountable. He followed that with a 3-pointer at the buzzer to
beat Boston, followed that with a last-second dunk to beat Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   He has done it without playing for a team in L.A. or New York
or, worse yet, Chicago. True, Carter did emerge from North
Carolina, same as Jordan, but he was always the secondary Tar Heel.
Antawn Jamison, who was drafted one spot ahead of Carter and then
swapped for him, was the consensus college player of the year.
Carter landed in Toronto, where overstuffed American egos go to
die, and managed to transcend the daunting border.
</P>
<P>
   For all Next Jordans, the first test is credibility. Can you
really imagine this person working half the wonders Michael
wrought? With Carter, maybe you can. That advances him to the next
developmental phase, which is the backlash. Orlando coach Doc
Rivers rails that refs have taken to rooting for Carter. Indiana's
Jalen Rose played tough against Carter on NBC last Sunday and said
afterward that the Pacers ``didn't want to be part of anybody's
sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month Carter has dumped his agent and has had to
shoot more to get his points. His rickety Raptors have lost eight
of nine games and are being booed at home. We forget how long it
took Jordan to make the Bulls a champion _ remember, Chicago lost
that Sunday in Boston Garden when he scored 63 points _ and how
much criticism he ultimately overrode. Ten years from now, maybe
we'll have forgotten Vince Carter's shakedown spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. The NBA is already littered with Next Jordans who
were unmasked as simply very good players. What's different about
Vince Carter is that the mask hasn't yet slipped.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, Aaron Talsky was doing so well in the stock market
that he gave up his Beverly Hills law practice to spend his days
buying and selling stocks of the new economy from his home near
Laguna Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When the frenzy for Internet and biotechnology stocks continued
into this year, Talsky, 35, worked out a strategy for even fatter
profits. He bought shares on margin, borrowing against the stock he
already owned to purchase even more in what seemed to him a one-way
street to bull-market riches.
</P>
<P>
   But the enormous technology selloff that culminated Tuesday
brought the first blush of fear to the young investor. Faced with
the prospect of having to put up more money in his brokerage
accounts to meet margin calls _ a brokerage firm requirement when
the value of stocks falls too far _ Talsky sold shares into the
market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my money just dripping away,'' Talsky said in a
telephone interview Wednesday, noting that it was the first time he
had suffered huge losses. ``I saw balances moving in the wrong
direction, and the speed with which it was happening was
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's selloff, in which the Nasdaq composite plummeted
nearly 14 percent in just hours, has served as an unwelcome
reminder of the perils of such borrowing, particularly when
brokerage firms tell investors to come up with additional cash.
Talsky, at least, is now vowing to ease up on credit.
</P>
<P>
   But many market observers point to the rise in such borrowing
and worry that Americans have gone to troubling lengths to reap
bigger and bigger rewards in a bull market that seems to have an
infinite number of legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at history, leverage is often a toppler of robust
markets; it magnifies the upside and the downside,'' said Steven
Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``That's why
the investment community is very concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the stock market has climbed in recent years, so has
margin debt, to a record $265 billion in February, from about $152
billion at the end of 1998, according to the New York Stock
Exchange. Margin debt now accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the
Big Board's total market value, also a record.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, borrowing was a high-risk practice left to
professional money managers. Much of the borrowing now, though, is
being done by a new breed of investors who are addicted to the
market and who have learned to manage their own money and trade
online through the likes of Etrade and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
according to industry professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a significant increase in customers using margin,
and we think it's indicative of the entire market,'' said Heather
Fondo, a spokeswoman at Etrade, one of the largest online brokerage
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said that margin calls on Tuesday ran to three times
their usual level. Datek Online, another online firm, said Tuesday
was one of the five heaviest days there for margin calls. The
well-established Wall Street firms, meanwhile, said they did not
see a significant increase.
</P>
<P>
   Many brokerage firms have tightened their lending policies.
Though the Federal Reserve sets margin requirements _ initially an
investor can borrow no more than 50 percent of a stock's purchase
price _ the firms may set more stringent rules, even creating lists
of technology stocks for higher requirements. The New York Stock
Exchange, which also sets rules for its members, has asked
securities firms for more information about their lending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has pushed for an increase in the
initial amount required of investors for margin buying. Though he
has expressed reluctance to raise the requirement, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he would consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania, said that although margin calls
were a factor in Tuesday's rout, they were probably not the primary
cause, because institutions were heavy sellers. But he said the
explosion of online investing and the decline in commissions had
exacerbated market swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest factor is the collapse of trading costs,'' he
said. ``That's why people are in and out, in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors find buying on margin so irresistible because the
stock market has been a clear path to riches in the last decade.
And in the last year or two, a craving for technology stocks has
created multibillion-dollar companies almost overnight, giving rise
to the the dot.com mania.
</P>
<P>
   The technological revolution that is minting billionaires in
their 30s is entwined with a frenzied stock market that is turning
former insurance salesmen into self-styled stock experts.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are lacking, but anecdotal evidence suggests that a
growing number of people are devoting more time to playing the
stock market. Everyone seems to have a story about a friend,
neighbor, cousin or former colleague who is trading stocks from his
or her bedroom, retired at 48, glued to the Web, researching stocks
and talking about price-to-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become incredibly prevalent,'' said Charles Pradilla, the
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen in New York. ``I live in
Brooklyn Heights, and my butcher is playing the stock market. He
stopped cutting veal chops and started day trading.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a market of such high expectations and unprecedented returns,
it is only natural that people would begin borrowing to buy into
the frenzy. Though this week's action was unnerving, it is too
early to conclude that such borrowing will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Silverman, a 74-year-old retired stereo salesman in Boca
Raton, Fla., said his portfolio value jumped early this year and
then crashed early this week, nearly forcing him into a margin call
on the $300,000 he has borrowed to buy stock. But the market picked
up, averting the dreaded request for additional money in his
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very nervous,'' said Silverman. ``I got to the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he began actively trading a year ago, he said, ``If I'm
not on the golf course, I'm playing the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his activity is with what he calls his fun money. ``I'm
not that worried,'' he said, ``because I've got a lot of income
coming from commercial real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Having noticed that every selloff in the last few years has been
followed by a stunningly fast bounce back, investors may see little
reason to step aside. Michael Stummer, a day trader in suburban
Chicago, said he was watching intently when the market turned down
_ ``for the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Nasdaq composite had dropped 574 points and had begun
to recover Tuesday afternoon, Stummer said he jumped into the
market. ``I bought a stock at $71 and sold it at $87 an hour
later,'' he said. ``I was screaming and yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Stummer said he made $50,000 in just hours, his best day ever,
although he said his partners did not fare as well, largely because
they had money tied up in losing stocks and could not muster cash
to jump in on the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders often borrow to buy stocks, but most of them close
out their positions daily. The real leaders in the long-term
borrowing game appear to be active online investors _ people like
Aaron Talsky.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years as a lawyer, Talsky, who also taught corporate
finance at the University of California at Irvine, was drawn to the
Wall Street boom and the high-tech revolution. He had heard stories
about people trading their own accounts full time, and was reading
daily about Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. He decided he simply had
to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably never be a time when things are this
good,'' he said. ``Not only is there a historic opportunity that
wasn't available five years ago, but I can sit on the beach, I can
sit in my bedroom and have the same access as the investment
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has no boss, all is not easy. ``I probably work three
times as hard now,'' he said. ``There's always more information
than you can handle. I get up at 6 a.m. and read market briefing,
commentaries, look at upgrades, downgrades, and then turn on
CNBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming serious about trading, he has bought
biotechnology stocks like Maxigen and Protein Design Labs along
with Internet stocks like Ariba. He watched them climb and climb
and climb until about two weeks ago, when his portfolio faltered.
He recalls sitting in an Indian restaurant in Mission Viejo after
the market closed one day and sensing an impending disaster. Still,
he didn't sell. But in the next few days, the market buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Talsky said he is still doing extremely well after huge runups
last year, but the psychological impact of seeing giant gains
disappear in an instant is jarring. One stock fell to $70 from $300
a share, he said. ``But how can you complain when the stock was at
$20 three months ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he will temper his borrowing, but not give up on
the market game. This week's selloff is just a reminder of what he
has known all along: the more risk you take, the crueler the market
can become.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market,'' he said, ``if you're going to run with the
bulls, you're going to get trampled every once in a while.

LONG MARCH ENDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA,   BUT LITTLE TIME LEFT TO REMOVE
FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ By his own estimate, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
of Charleston had walked nearly 275,000 steps when he turned the
corner onto Main Street Thursday morning and finally saw the
Confederate battle flag that he and hundreds of others had been
marching since Sunday to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Since setting out from Charleston, 120 miles away, he had
endured death threats, roadside obscenities, wet clothes and
blisters so painful that they needed medical attention. For all
that, there was only a slim hope that the state Legislature would
vote to remove the flag from atop the Statehouse dome before the
end of the year's session.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor seemed energized by the sight of the object of his
derision, and there was a new force in his steps as he finished the
last few blocks of his protest march and stood under the dome to
speak to a crowd that had grown to nearly 2,000, about two-thirds
of it white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every religious denomination, every business organization,
every civil rights organization, college boards of trustees and
presidents and athletic directors, and average citizens, rank and
file, have said, remove the Confederate battle flag,'' Riley told
the crowd. ``And our Legislature, with only a few more days left in
the legislative session, hasn't even begun to debate the bill. They
are out of step with the people of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a Democrat, chose the long march, with its evocation of
civil rights struggle and Gandhian protest, to demonstrate the
widespread frustration with the presence of the flag in a position
of sovereignty. The mayor, a South Carolina institution who has
been popular since taking office in 1975, had hoped to draw
attention by marching with civic leaders and well-known football
coaches. He attracted nearly 600 marchers on the first day and
close to 1,000 on the last leg Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty faced by his cause seemed to be illustrated
by the 300 or so counter-demonstrators who waved large Confederate
banners on the north steps of the Capitol while Riley, Gov. Jim
Hodges, and others spoke on the south steps. Some of the pro-flag
speakers called their opponents ``scalawags'' and urged them to
leave the state. The legislative supporters of the flag have
blocked most efforts at a compromise, like moving it to a statue of
a Confederate general near the rear of the Capitol, or putting it
in a glass case on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the deadline for new legislation will pass at the
end of this month without even a vote on moving the flag. The
Legislature raised the banner in 1962 during the centennial of the
Civil War and kept it up as a gesture of defiance to the civil
rights movement; now only the Legislature can remove it. But
several strongly pro-flag legislators have used every parliamentary
procedure at their disposal to block the compromise bills, and now
there are only nine working days left in this year's session to get
a bill onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did make some progress on the issue Thursday, voting
to put a compromise bill at the top of the agenda, meaning it could
be debated and voted upon next week, then sent to the House. But
legislators said they did not know if there were enough votes to
stop a filibuster, should one of the opponents of compromise begin
one.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue is not resolved this session, the statewide tourism
boycott imposed by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People in January could continue for another year, with
potentially serious economic consequences. Tourism officials told
the governor on Wednesday that the state was losing hundreds of
conventions and countless vacation trips because of the NAACP
boycott and the growing image of the state as intolerant. Business
leaders, who have been in the forefront of the anti-flag effort,
have said another year of the boycott could be ruinous. Even the
Columbia police chief, Charles Austin, said Thursday that he hoped
a compromise would be reached soon, because he was worried about
public safety in the city if the marches continued.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, a Democrat who favors a compromise, has not said whether
he would call a special session if the Legislature does not act.
But he accepted the palmetto-tree state flag that Riley carried
with him from Charleston, and said he hoped that the passionate
feelings demonstrated by the march would change a few votes inside.
``Anytime a legislator looks out the window and sees this kind of
crowd, it has the potential to change their mind,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday, before he took off his cracked sneakers
and prepared for a rest, Riley, 57, listed what he said were the
hateful uses of the Confederate battle flag over the years, like
its use as a symbol of the Dixiecrat Party that split from the
Democrats in 1948 over civil rights. (A statue of the Dixiecrat
leader, Sen. Strom Thurmond, stood near the Capitol with its back
toward the rally.)
</P>
<P>
   But the matter was more immediate to Gail Jones, a black woman
who walked every step of the march alongside the mayor. As the
manager of a Circle K convenience store a few blocks from the
Statehouse on Main Street, she has to see the Confederate battle
flag every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of having to lower my eyes every time I go to
work,'' she said. ``I just don't want to see it anymore, and that's
why I marched.''

`RATCATCHER': INTIMATE LOOK AT BOY NAVIGATING A FETID GLASGOW
LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ratcatcher,'' the brilliant directorial debut of
Lynne Ramsay, is a gorgeous blend of beauty and squalor, packed
with imagery that will play over and over in your head for weeks.
It begins with a boy named Ryan spinning while wrapped in his
mother's curtains, the cream-colored lace covering his face like a
shroud, and the scene shifts from slow motion to real time as his
mother angrily pulls him out of the fabric. It's one of the many
deft pieces of foreshadowing that Ramsay allows to seep through the
film, the story of 12-year-old James (William Eadie) during a few
weeks of his life in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes place while a garbage strike in Glasgow leaves
the streets lined with festering piles of refuse. ``Somebody's
chucked out a perfectly good dog,'' notes a teen-age boy as he
inspects an animal's carcass, while rats of all sizes _ and the
filmmaker uses them for several purposes _ dart through the fetid
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   James has a knack for trouble. He accidentally drowns a friend _
the boy seen playing in the curtains at the start _ and his pale,
inscrutable face has a furrow of guilt etched between the eyes for
the rest of the film. His sorrow is sealed when the boy's mother
gives James her dead son's shoes. Ramsay, who also wrote the
script, is wholly consumed with filmmaking fever, and her
touchstones are evident: ``Ratcatcher'' could be ``The 400 Blows''
as directed by Ken Loach. Yet she brings something wholly original
to the film.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ratcatcher'' flirts with misery, and its palette is
principally a series of glum earth tones with an occasional vivid
splash of color, the immensely talented Ramsay provides an intimacy
that is completely mesmerizing. Rarely has physical wretchedness
been rendered with such delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Her actors have an awe-inspiring openness to the camera that
gives the movie a magnetic realism; with the exception of Eadie,
the characters have nothing to hide, and trained actors are seldom
so exposed. But it's a warped realism because each detail is in
place. The treacherous muddy bog of a canal where Ryan drowned,
near the squalid housing project in which James lives with his
parents and two sisters, keeps drawing him back. Like any other
boy, he is fixated on mystery and danger.
</P>
<P>
   The power of ``Ratcatcher'' comes from its hushed lyricism and
Ramsay's talent for conveying emotional complexity. Despite the
setting, it is sweet and soulful, with a confident lightness of
touch that allows for pinpoint shifts of mood. Perhaps the reason
Ramsay uses children as her protagonists is for their fleetness of
expression; they move from one state to another very quickly.
(Their ease brings to mind a line from Yeats' ``Sailing to
Byzantium'': ``That is no country for old men.'')
</P>
<P>
   One of the best scenes involves James' relationship with
Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), the kind of girl who used to be
described as easy. It's not what he desires of her, and at one
point they play in the tub, scrubbing each other's infected scalps.
Afterward, they sit in front of the television set, wrapped in
towels while eating sandwiches, like the most innocent married
couple in the world. Rachel Portman's score, one of her best, is so
spare it's barely there, yet it registers powerfully. (Her works
include ``The Cider House Rules.'') The sound design is specific
and minimal, adding to the feeling that the picture is wrapped in a
constant dreaminess, like that lace curtain at the beginning.
(There are also several other transitions from slow motion to
normal speed to deepen that facet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratcatcher,'' which is being shown Friday night and Sunday as
part of the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern
Art, isn't all nightmare, either. James keeps visiting a new
housing development _ a place the family longs for _ and he sits
silently, happily, in an empty new tub. As he plays in a vast field
behind the uninhabited home, he is seen through a window with
bright blue skies and warm yellow grass in a big black frame. The
sequence is proof of Ramsay's bewitching eye and imagination, and
``Ratcatcher'' is the most lovely debut film in a long time. &QL;

 By ADAM NAGOUREY with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's response to the shooting
last month of an unarmed black man by a New York City police
officerh has resulted in his lowest job approval ratings in seven
years in office, jolting his campaign for the U.S. Senate while
catapulting Hillary Rodham Clinton into the lead for the first time
in a year, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was completed on Wednesday night, found that
Giuliani's attempt to discredit the dead man, Patrick M. Dorismond,
has raised concerns about the mayor's temperament and
qualifications, while voters' perceptions of Clinton have improved.
The first lady now enjoys a 49-to-41 percent lead over Giuliani;
when undecided voters were pressed to state their leaning, Clinton
moves a full 10 points ahead of Giuliani, 52 to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, Giuliani is now tied with Clinton upstate, where he
is drawing just 44 percent of the vote, significantly less than
what a successful Republican statewide candidate customarily draws
north of New York City's suburbs. Clinton has been campaigning
regularly there, while Giuliani has been criticized by Republicans
for spending little time north of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He still commands a lead in the immediate suburbs. But in New
York City, where Giuliani's popularity was seen as a serious threat
to Clinton's Democratic base, Clinton is now defeating Giuliani by
nearly three-to-one, the Times/CBS News Poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, whose record as a crime-fighter has lifted him to two
victories in New York City and positioned him as a formidable
Republican challenger to Clinton statewide, has even suffered a
steep decline in the way voters, statewide and in New York City,
judge his actions on his signature issue: Crime reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The number of New York City residents who disapprove of his
handling of crime has jumped almost 30 points since fall, to 50
percent in this latest poll, and a majority believe that Giuliani's
law-enforcement policies have contributed to an increase in police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings among voters have spilled over from the mayor to the
New York City Police Department as well. New York City residents
believe that the police are more likely to use deadly force against
black suspects than white, and that brutality against minorities is
widespread. Nearly two-thirds of people in New York City said the
Police Department was doing only a fair or poor job, with the level
of dismay particularly high among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tension over police-community relations in the city has
heightened in the last six weeks, since the acquittals of four
officers in the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and then the
shooting of Dorismond, an unarmed man killed by an undercover
officer, last month. In the case of Dorismond, more than half of
voters statewide said the shooting would not affect their vote, but
one-third _ including 15 percent of the Republicans _ said they
were less inclined to vote for Giuliani because of how he handled
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News Poll was conducted Saturday through
Wednesday, with 1,573 respondents statewide. The margin of sampling
error for all registered voters statewide is 3 percentage points;
for New York City resident, is plus or minus 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the poll results Thursday night on WCBS-radio,
Giuliani said: ``My reaction is the same to all polls. That is,
they are momentary things.'' Then, alluding to the Dorismond
shooting, Giuliani said the polls ``are things that reflect
sometimes coverage of a particular situation. I think when all the
facts or known and everything is out there, things will return to a
much different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, attributed Clinton's gains in the
poll to her efforts to distinguish herself from Giuliani on issues,
though he acknowledged that Giuliani's difficulties in recent weeks
had undercut his campaign. ``The spotlight has been on his lack of
leadership in New York City,'' Penn said, ``and in fact now I think
the fundamental rationale for his campaign is evaporating because
if the people in New York City don't think he's done a good job as
mayor, how is he going to run as that as the major reason for being
the Senate?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The election is seven months and dozens of polls away, as the
mayor's aides noted on Thursday, and Giuliani enjoys a large
fund-raising edge over Clinton. The advantage of that money became
clear on Thursday morning, as Giuliani began a statewide series of
television advertisements. It was an early start for an advertising
campaign which suggests both the prosperity and the level of
concern in Giuliani's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even given the buffers of time and money, the Times/CBS
News Poll included a number of reasons for worry on the part of
Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By large numbers, voters believed that Giuliani inflamed the
situation over the Dorismond shooting and strongly disapproved of
Giuliani's decision to release Dorismond's confidential police
record. New York City residents have a decidedly negative view of
Giuliani's handling of race relations, and more than three-quarters
of the respondents in New York City described the shooting as
unjustified, Giuliani's arguments notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the immediate moment of the Dorismond shooting, events
over the past few weeks have appeared to reinforce the arguments
Clinton has offered against the mayor's candidacy. That is the kind
of shift political analysts look for in polls, since it suggests a
change in voters' attitudes that tend to be more consequential than
the back-and-forth of the weekly horserace.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of voters do not believe that Giuliani
cares about the ``needs and problems of people like yourself,'' a
measure on which Clinton continues to score highly. About 35
percent of respondents said that Giuliani was trying to divide
people, as Clinton has repeatedly charged, compared to 40 percent
who said that the mayor was seeking to bring people together.
Two-thirds of the voters said Clinton was trying to bring people
together.
</P>
<P>
   By an overwhelming margin, respondents said compromise was a key
attribute for a senator, and Clinton was seen as the more adept
compromiser of the two.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Giuliani's standing with black voters, which has
never been strong, is weaker than ever; the number of New York City
black voters who said they approved of Giuliani's job rating was so
low as to be virtually unmeasurable. That could prove to be a
meaningful finding, particularly if it turns out, as some Democrats
now believe is possible, that Giuliani's presence on the ballot
might encourage the kind of sizable turn-out in black neighborhoods
that has rarely been seen in New York elections.

DUCKS MAINTAIN THEIR FOCUS

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Mighty Ducks were all but blown out of
the Western Conference playoff race in the Windy City on Wednesday
night when they lost 5-2 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But early Thursday afternoon they dutifully went through their
practice paces at the Gaylord Entertainment Center and then
insisted their playoff hopes aren't dead _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have hope, no matter how slim it is,'' said Ducks
goalie Guy Hebert. ``We win (tonight versus Nashville) and then
hope something good happens. It would be a great situation to go
into the last game against L.A. (at The Pond on Sunday) with a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting for 80 games and sometimes they say it
takes 82 to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to be the case, the Ducks first need to complete a
four- game season sweep of the Predators and have Vancouver defeat
Edmonton later in the evening. If that happens, Anaheim would then
need Calgary to beat the Oilers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That would extend hope, or prolong the agony, into Sunday, when
the Ducks must beat the Kings and then have the Sharks defeat or
tie the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly need some help, but we have to take the approach
(to tonight's game), that nothing but our best effort is
acceptable,'' said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg. ``There is no
sense moping around now, there is no sense moping around anytime in
this league.''
</P>
<P>
   __ In retrospect: Hebert wasn't moping, but the Anaheim goalie,
who refused to talk to the media after Wednesday's game, openly
admitted Thursday that his evening in Chicago was hardly his finest
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an excuse, but I had a hard time picking up three
shots,'' he said referring to the three long shots that Chicago
scored on, including a floater by Jean-Yves Leroux that put Chicago
ahead 3-2 just 38 seconds after Paul Kariya had scored on a
breakaway to tie the game at 9:40.
</P>
<P>
   ``That killed us,'' said Hebert. ``Nobody felt worse than I did
at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Vote of confidence: While Hartsburg made no effort to defend
Hebert on Wednesday, the Anaheim coach gave his No. 1 goalie a vote
of confidence on Thursday when asked if he considered starting
backup Dominic Roussel against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy is going to play,'' Hartsburg said without hesitation.
``He has to get the job done. Guy is capable of winning a game for
us. I'm sure he would like to have a couple of those (Wednesday's
goals) back, but it's over and done and he has to rebound for us.''

COMMENTARY: ELIAN AND THE PANDERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Visiting Colombia today is a very clarifying
act. This is a country where things that we value and take for
granted in our own society _ the safety of our children, the right
to speak one's mind freely, respect for the rule of law _ are
threatened every day. Being here you are reminded not only of how
much you cherish these things as an American. You are reminded of
the sheer political courage it takes to fight for them in a country
where speaking truth can cost you your life or get your kids
kidnapped with the snap of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore doubly clarifying, and doubly disturbing, to be
in Colombia during the Elian Gonzalez case in Miami. It was
sickening _ there's no other word for it _ to see Vice President Al
Gore, someone I actually respected, intervening in this case. He
intervened in a way that was not only wholly inappropriate for a
vice president, but he did so in a way that attempted to fiddle
with U.S. law, by introducing a legal ruse designed to give Elian
U.S. residency status _ status that would never be granted in such
a way in any other case. And for what? In order to chase a few
cheap votes by right-wing Cubans in Florida _ who are so consumed
with hatred for Fidel Castro that they couldn't care less about the
U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore has decided that he no longer wants to function as vice
president, that he no longer wants to stand up for basic
principles, then would he please donate his salary to the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights or some other group that does have the
will and the courage to defend the rule of law in the United States
and abroad. And while we're asking, what is one to think of Alex
Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, who suggested he wouldn't
use the county's police to assist federal officials if they came
for Elian? Penelas signaled that his allegiance was to anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans, not to the laws of this land.
</P>
<P>
   I understand politics and pandering. But there are limits. Thank
God, the United States is still a long way from the lawlessness of
Colombia. But if you want to know what happens, in the extreme,
when people cheapen the rule of law and political movements let any
means justify any ends, well, visit Colombia _ a country where the
honest judges, journalists and politicians, and there still are
plenty here, cannot walk the streets without fear of being abducted
or killed by drug lords, vigilantes or Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the random chaos here that impresses me. It is the
courage, the raw courage, of those who have chosen to stay and
fight for the rule of law and freedom of speech. I speak in
particular about the journalists of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   I speak of Enrique Santos Calderon, the editor of Bogota's
biggest paper, El Tiempo, who picked me up for dinner in his
bulletproof jeep, followed by a car full of his machine-gun-toting
guards _ whose presence is essential for him to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   I speak of Maria Jimena, a columnist for El Espectador, whose
sister was murdered while filming a documentary, and who now gets
threatening e-mails from guerrillas or vigilantes any time she
writes critically about either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have any arguments to stay here,'' she remarked.
``The only argument is that it's important _ freedom of expression
has always been important here. We know we have a very important
place in this country. But it is very scary because more and more
[the journalists) here have become the targets of the worst
violence facing this country ... I have stopped reading my
e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Pombo, the editor of Cambio, insists that journalists
are not heroes here. Anyone who stays to try to improve Colombia,
or to just live here, is. ``Don't write that being a journalist
here is dangerous. Half the journalists are killed here not for
being journalists but for just being here. Everybody is killed in
Colombia in the line of living, not just in the line of work ... We
don't want you to come save us, but we need your help so we can
help ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what dinner conversation with good people sounds like in
a society whose politicians, years ago, became complacent about the
rule of law, where they sold themselves cheap to the highest
bidders and where political factions became so polarized and
consumed with hatred of each other that they would not let any law,
any norm, constrain their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it ends. The Elian Gonzalez case is how it starts.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SENATE-POLL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of New York state is
based on telephone interviews conducted April 1 to 5 with 1,573
adults throughout the state. Of those, 1,207 said they were
registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a
computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For
each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits,
thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within
each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be
the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region of the
state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, questions about voting preferences and other
aspects of the 2000 election for U.S. senator are based on the
responses of 1,032 ``usual voters.'' Usual voters are those who say
they are registered and voted in 1998 or 1996, further weighted so
that those who reside in New York City make up 31 percent of the
entire state, which is the city's typical share of total ballots
cast on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all adult residents of New York state. For smaller subgroups the
potential sampling error is larger. As an example, for residents of
New York City it is plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for
instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

BUSH GOING AFTER CALIFORNIA VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ On his first trip to California since the
Republican primary almost a month ago, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
could not have made his priorities clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, headed
straight from the airport here to a nearby elementary school, where
he chatted extensively with local educators about the importance of
their mission. He could not dawdle too long, however, because he
was due at another school later on.
</P>
<P>
   At the first stop, Bush placed Jaime Escalante, the Latino
teacher whose work with poor children in southern California
inspired the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' in the seat beside his
own. And he looked ahead to a speech on Friday morning before the
National Hispanic Women's Conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   By simultaneously reaching out to Latinos and emphasizing an
issue, education, that casts him in a relatively moderate light,
Bush was pursuing the two courses of action that many political
analysts say are most vital to any hope he nurtures of winning
California in November.
</P>
<P>
   And he was signaling, at least for now, that his bid for the
nation's richest electoral prize, a state that President Clinton
won handily in both of his races and that Democrats have
increasingly begun to dominate, was earnest and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a rumor moving around the press in California
that, somehow, I wasn't going to compete,'' Bush told reporters
shortly before he left the Charles E. Mack Elementary School here,
alluding to news reports that his campaign had been prepared to
close its political office here, then reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wishful thinking on the part of Al Gore,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Any Republican, at this early stage of a presidential contest,
would say likewise. But Bush and his advisers insist that
California's 54 electoral votes are within their grasp. They point
to the fact that in the March 7 primary, Bush trailed Vice
President Gore by a modest six percentage points, 34 percent to 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And they note that the two leading Republicans in that contest,
Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, had a combined total of more
than 50 percent of the popular vote, while Gore and his Democratic
opponent, Bill Bradley, together netted under 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good indication that I've got a chance to win
this state,'' Bush said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But many political analysts disagreed, saying that Gore is as
likely to siphon off McCain's support as Bush is, and they placed
long odds on a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely,'' said Jack Pitney, a professor of government
and politics at Claremont McKenna College in Southern California,
noting that the vast majority of people now holding statewide
office in California are Democrats. ``But it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, California is for Bush what Florida is for Gore: a
long shot worth a commitment of time and money if only to compel
the opposition to invest a hefty portion of its own finite
resources in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his advisers said they were doing more than making
a noble show in the state. Bush noted that his two-day trip to
California is not connected to any fund-raising events and is a
purely political endeavor. One of his senior advisers added that
Bush would be back twice in May and twice in June.
</P>
<P>
   The state's special allure is explained by many political
analysts' electoral arithmetic, which figures that while Bush does
not need to carry California to win the general election, a victory
by him here would almost certainly doom Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Bush and in subsequent conversations with
his advisers, several aspects of his campaign's strategy for making
that possible became clear. Bush hopes that his sustained focus on
education will appeal to the state's independent voters and others
in the center of the political spectrum; that the inclusive
language in his oratory will draw Latinos to his side; that his
support for free trade will please both agricultural workers and
technology concerns, and that his call for legislation to curtail
lawsuits will draw support in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But several political analysts said there are just as many
losing cards in Bush's deck: notably, his positions and record on
gun control, the environment and abortion, issues on which
Californians tend to be more liberal than Bush.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed a Texas law that allows people with proper training
and certification to carry concealed handguns. He leads a state
that is, by some measures, the most polluted in the country. And he
supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion in most
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of voters after they cast ballots in the California
primary showed that 65 percent of them believed that abortion
should be mostly or always legal. Asked about abortion here
Thursday, Bush suggested that he might actually be better
positioned than Gore and might challenge the vice president as too
extreme on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sign a ban on partial-birth abortion and my opponent will
not,'' Bush said. ``I look forward to hearing why, and I think a
lot of people in California will look forward to hearing why.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that Bush's ability to soften his
conservative edges could be decisive, and Bush seems to have taken
that into account.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his first education address, in which he unveiled
proposals that he said were designed to help the neediest students,
at the meeting of a Hispanic business association in Los Angeles in
September.
</P>
<P>
   For a speech last month on the need for people of different
races and religions to respect one another, Bush appeared at the
Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that he finds his voice in compassionate
conservatism and has a message of tolerance and inclusion, which is
no different from the way he's governed Texas, he can put together
a winning campaign,'' said Steven Merksamer, a Republican
strategist here.
</P>
<P>
   The specific challenge within that overarching one, political
analysts said, was to grab more than 30 percent of the growing
Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won re-election in Texas in 1998 with nearly half of the
Latino vote. But outrage among many Latinos in California over the
harsh language with which Republicans promoted Proposition 187,
which was designed to deny public services to illegal immigrants,
could hurt Bush, political analysts said. He acknowledged that
Thursday, showing in manner and language how badly he wanted to
heal the rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican,'' Bush said at a news conference here.
``There are those who say, `No tiene corazon.' He doesn't have a
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's what a campaign's about,'' he added, meaning the
changing of inaccurate perceptions.

DRESDNER AND DEUTSCHE BANK SEEN VULNERABLE AFTER COLLAPSE OF DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The turmoil in German banking intensified
Thursday, as the chairman of Dresdner Bank resigned because of the
failed merger deal with Deutsche Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the Dresdner executive, Bernhard Walter, came
a day after he canceled plans for a $29 billion merger with
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, which would have created the
biggest banking combination in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But far from ensuring Dresdner's independence, Walter's moves
seemed to strengthen a conviction among industry executives that
Dresdner, the No. 3 bank in Germany, had become a takeover target
for rivals across Europe and possibly even the United States. ``I
think it's open season,'' said a German investment banker. ``It is
painfully obvious that the bank cannot stay independent.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Dresdner Bank that now looks vulnerable. Deutsche
Bank, the larger of the would-be partners, has come under withering
criticism from analysts, the German media and some political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Boersen Zeitung, Germany's stock market newspaper, skewered the
failed merger as a ``Disaster Among Equals.'' The tabloid Bild
carried the headline: ``Megaslap in the Face for Money Bosses.
Whole World Laughs.'' And Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
chimed in, observing that ``I've seen more mature performances in
the corporate sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, German attitudes toward mergers and hostile takeovers
seemed to have crossed a boundary. Suddenly, anything seems
possible and the only consensus view is that things will not stay
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Deutsche Bank, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, acknowledged
at a news conference in Frankfurt on Thursday that his own company
was not immune from hostile takeover attempts. ``It's something
that naturally runs through your mind,'' Breuer remarked, though he
added that a hostile takeover would not be practical.
</P>
<P>
   Yet beyond bungling a deal it had heralded a month ago, Deutsche
Bank is again burdened with a retail branch network that barely
makes money. The combination with Dresdner was supposed to solve
that problem in two ways. First, Deutsche and Dresdner would have
merged their branches and eliminated overlapping ones. Second, they
would have spun off the combined system into a company controlled
by the German insurer Allianz AG.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal imploded Wednesday, when Walter and Dresdner
refused demands by Deutsche Bank to shut down most of the
investment banking arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his resignation, Walter again blamed Deutsche for
the merger's collapse and said an extraordinary opportunity had
been wasted.
</P>
<P>
   And although Dresdner Bank said that its board had unanimously
decided to break off merger talks, Walter seemed to be a target of
wrath within the bank and possibly at Allianz, Dresdner's biggest
shareholder. Allianz executives, though publicly quiet, have let it
be known that they would welcome new takeover bids for Dresdner.
Among the banking companies rumored to have an interest are
Citigroup and Chase Manhattan of the United States, ABN Amro and
ING of the Netherlands, Banque Nationale de Paris and the
British-based HSBC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Had the intended merger succeeded, the combined assets of
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank would have totaled $1.2 trillion,
second in size to the Mizuho Financial Group _ the announced merger
of Fuji Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, with $1.3 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   There were sporadic calls Thursday for Breuer to quit at
Deutsche Bank. But Breuer, looking disappointed but still
unruffled, said he saw ``no reason to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   But the merger fiasco was an acute embarrassment for Breuer, who
has sought to push Deutsche Bank into the elite ranks of global
powerhouses. In failing to anticipate the problems in his own
merger, Breuer raised questions about Deutsche's credibility as an
adviser on other mergers and acquisitions, one of the lucrative
areas of investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer's image was not helped by his contradictory assertions
immediately after announcing the merger March 9. He insisted then
that Dresdner's investment banking business was ``a jewel'' that
would neither be sold nor shut down. But a few days later, Breuer
reversed himself and said that all options were open. As it
happened, Deutsche Bank pushed hard for an outright sale of
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and then, as a fallback position, argued
for a ``partial integration'' that would have shut down most of it.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, Breuer said he had not known
what would be necessary because he could not see the details of
Dresdner's structure until after the two banks had announced formal
merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   But he also shed light on a potentially fatal flaw in the way he
approached the issues. Preoccupied about preserving secrecy, Breuer
said he refused to ask for advice from many people within his own
company who knew something about Dresdner Bank's inner workings.
``Once you start asking questions, there are suspicions and that is
when the rumor mill gets started,'' Breuer said. ``We wanted to
limit this to a very small circle of people.''

FORD TO SELL GASOLINE-ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN 2003 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday that it would begin
selling a small sport utility vehicle in 2003 using both gasoline
and electric propulsion for better gas mileage. General Motors and
DaimlerChrysler are working on similar sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Escape, which is a little smaller than a Ford Explorer
and a little larger than a Honda CR-V, will go on sale this autumn
with only gasoline engines available. The optional hybrid engine
will be offered on Escapes built three years later at a slightly
higher price, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Escape has a carlike underbody, instead of the
heavy, pickup-truck-like underbody of Ford's other sport utilities,
it gets 23 miles to the gallon in the city and 28 miles to the
gallon on the highway with a four-cylinder gasoline engine. Ford
said that equipping the vehicle with the hybrid engine would
increase its fuel efficiency to almost 40 miles a gallon in the
city and on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   In the hybrid models, the gasoline engine and the vehicle's own
braking will charge the electric motor, which will not require
separate charging. In the Escape and other hybrid automobiles, the
gasoline engine shuts off when the vehicle stops; once the driver
touches the accelerator, an electric motor powered by batteries
gets the vehicle moving again while the gasoline engine turns back
on.
</P>
<P>
   Honda has just started selling the Honda Insight, a tiny coupe
with a gasoline-electric engine that gets up to 70 miles per gallon
on the highway. This summer Toyota will start selling its Prius, a
hybrid that is similar to a Toyota Corolla but which gets about 50
miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that they had been working on hybrid
technology for years and that their timetable had not been affected
by the Japanese offerings or the recent rise in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler introduced a prototype of a hybrid Dodge Durango
last autumn that would, the company said, get an average of 18.6
miles per gallon in city and highway driving, compared with 15.5
miles per gallon for the current model with a gasoline-only engine.
GM has been collaborating with Toyota to develop a car-based sport
utility vehicle the size of a Subaru Forester that would also carry
a hybrid engine. GM and DaimlerChrysler have not yet announced
plans for mass production.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives from GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler joined Vice
President Al Gore at a news conference in Washington last week on
improving fuel economy. William Powers, Ford's vice president for
research, said in an interview that the company did not mention its
plans in Washington because ``we had agreed months ago with our
partners we wouldn't upstage each other.'' A Gore aide said that
was true.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has long sought tighter fuel-economy regulations. The
industry supports President Clinton's recent proposal for a $3,000
tax credit for electric and hybrid propulsion automobiles, which
would roughly offset for consumers the extra cost of the hybrid
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid Ford Escape will be built on the same assembly line
in Claycomo, Mo., that will build the regular Ford Escape, Ford
said. The hybrid will use many components from Visteon Automotive
Systems, a giant auto parts subsidiary that Ford's board is
expected to spin off at its board meeting next Thursday, probably
by ordering that Visteon shares be distributed to Ford
shareholders.

<P>
   Just about everyone but the banking industry seems to be
irritated by ATM fees. Especially infuriating to many consumers is
the double whammy: paying a fee to both your bank and another bank
when you use the second bank's automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   The fees _ $1.50 to $3 or more a transaction _ may not seem like
much individually, but they can add up to hundreds of dollars a
year, depending on where and how often ATMs are used.
</P>
<P>
   If you are irked enough, though, and don't want the
inconvenience of limiting yourself to your bank's ATMs, there are
some new ways to avoid the fees.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative is Internet banking. Many cyberbanks _ like
X.com, First Internet Bank and CompuBank _ will refund a limited
amount of other banks' ATM charges, usually about $6 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no question that Web banking can often mean lower
fees and higher interest rates, it can also be ragged around the
edges. Some of the Web sites are cluttered and difficult to
navigate. Procedures can be confusing, and it can take longer,
sometimes much longer, to open an account than at a regular bank.
The elderly, especially, may not be comfortable with the online
approach.
</P>
<P>
   And many Web-only banks, of course, have no ATM networks. That
means that their customers must use the fee-charging cash machines
of regular banks _ so that $6 allowance can vanish quickly. If
consumers do their online banking with a traditional bank, they
have access to its ATM network but are unlikely to get the low fees
and high interest rates available at many Internet-only banks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another way to avoid ATM fees is to replace a checking account
with a particular type of asset management account at a brokerage
firm. Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab, for instance, give holders
of such accounts unlimited refunds on all ATM charges, whatever the
source. The catch at Merrill Lynch is that the account requires a
$250,000 balance; Schwab's requires $100,000, or 12
commission-generating stock trades a year. In both cases, the
balances can be maintained with any blend of assets, including
stocks, bonds and cash.
</P>
<P>
   A few conventional banks also reimburse ATM fees, though there
can be sizable trade-offs. One you might consider is USAA Federal
Savings Bank of San Antonio. The bank, a subsidiary of USAA, the
big insurer that caters to military personnel, welcomes all
consumers and credits an account with up to $1.50 each time another
bank charges for using an ATM, up to $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   USAA, whose military background makes it accustomed to dealing
with far-flung clients, also offers checking accounts with no fees
and no minimum balances. It also offers overdraft protection, loans
and credit cards (800 531-2265).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, making deposits by mail with a distant institution
takes time. But if your paycheck or retirement check is deposited
electronically, it can go into an out-of-state bank account as
quickly as it goes into one at a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may worry that local merchants won't accept checks
from an out-of-state bank. But several supermarket managers at
chains in northern New Jersey said this was not a problem if
customers had check-cashing cards issued by the store. Merrill
Lynch and Charles Schwab use banks in Pennsylvania and Ohio,
respectively, for their asset management accounts; representatives
of both firms said check acceptance had not been an issue with
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   And if a merchant won't take such a check, a customer can always
get the cash from an ATM or use a debit or credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Although USAA has been offering its program for five years, the
notion of ATM refunds is not exactly catching fire among
conventional banks. So it pays to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Hilltop Community Bank in Summit, N.J., which has only one
office and one ATM, will refund from $1.50 to $10 a month of ATM
fees, depending on the account balance. To get the full $10,
customers must maintain a balance of at least $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is credit unions, if you have access to one.
But be careful: some are following banks to the ATM jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe you've decided that using only ATMs operated
by your bank and carrying extra cash isn't such a bad idea after
all.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Remley, 68, a writer and historian who lives in Silver
City, N.M., does just that. He banks at Ambank, a small, locally
owned bank that has only two ATMs, both in Silver City. When he
travels, which he says is not often, he uses his Visa card for
purchases or takes along enough cash to avoid charges for tapping
another bank's machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would hate those ATM fees,'' he said, ``if I
actually ever paid any.''

Poland) (ART ADV: A photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. A graphic is

   TAR HEEL, N.C. _ In the coastal plains here, where tobacco once
ruled, sit hundreds of corporate hog farms, punctuated by giant
lagoons filled with manure. Just off Route 87, not far from the
Cape Fear River, is the world's largest meatpacking plant, a
structure so colossal that its waste-water treatment plant could
serve a midsize city.
</P>
<P>
   The farms and the plant, which can kill 7 million hogs a year,
belong to Smithfield Foods, the world's largest hog producer and
pork processor _ and the company at the center of a fierce debate
over the rise of big agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   By aggressively acquiring its larger rivals over the last two
years and using precision genetics, huge hog farms and giant
meatpacking plants to control every stage of production, Smithfield
has ballooned into a $5 billion company that accounts for nearly a
quarter of the nation's pork.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, it has come under intense scrutiny from
regulators who say that agricultural giants may wield too much
control over the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   After Smithfield announced in September that it would acquire
Murphy Family Farms, the nation's largest hog producer, the
Agriculture Department called the company ``absurdly big,'' and
asked the Justice Department's antitrust division to review the
deal. More recently, the attorney general in Iowa, a big pork
producer, challenged the merger in state court, arguing that
Smithfield is trying to skirt a state law that forbids a
meatpacking company from operating hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   There are also growing concerns that the company's hog waste
could pose dangers to local water supplies, and that giant hog
operations could cripple small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we have this 800-pound gorilla in the pork
industry,'' said Betsy Freese, the livestock editor at Successful
Farming magazine in Des Moines, Iowa. ``The troubling part for a
lot of farmers is if the packer owns production, where are you
going to sell your pigs?''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Smithfield executives say the company has been
unfairly maligned and has been a pioneer in developing a more
systematic approach and healthier meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in the pork industry is what Perdue and Tyson did
in the poultry business,'' said Joseph W. Luter III, chairman and
chief executive of Smithfield, which is based in Smithfield, Va.
``Vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products
with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control
the process from the farm to the packing plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Luter says the company is responding to market forces. As
supermarket chains, food-service companies and fast-food outlets
sell more pork, they demand more consistency and higher quality.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield is also adapting to a trend that began in the
Southeast _ creating factory-size hog farms by using contract
farmers, who put up the capital to build special barns and provide
the labor to raise pigs to company specifications.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the market dominated by small Midwestern farmers,
who raise hogs and sell them to meatpackers. Four companies now
account for nearly 30 percent of the nation's hog supply, and four
big meatpackers slaughter about 60 percent of the nation's pork.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture, some experts say, is merely mimicking the larger
economy. ``This is what has evolved out of the marketplace,'' said
John Lawrence, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University
in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   In Smithfield's ``birth to bacon'' approach, everything is
calculated: genetics, artificial insemination, barns with automated
feeding systems and computers that monitor temperature and
ventilation. A special feed, executives say, creates pork as lean
as chicken in a brand the company is taking national: Smithfield's
Lean Generation Pork.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield has one of the world's largest meatpacking plants, a
973,000-square-foot facility here in Tar Heel, about 20 miles east
of Fayetteville. The plant relies on a ``disassembly line,'' which
has its roots in the 19th century, but the system is aided by new
technologies, like laser-equipped cutting machines.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Tar Heel plant _ which can process up to
32,000 hogs a day _ is an efficient killing machine. Squealing hogs
funnel into an area where they are electrocuted, stabbed in the
jugular, then tied, lifted and carried on a winding journey through
the plant. They are dunked in scalding water, their hair is
removed, they are run through a fiery furnace (to burn off residual
hair), then disemboweled and sliced by an army of young, often
immigrant, laborers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the plant, which is chilled, teams of
workers cut hog meat into smaller pieces. Wearing frocks, rubber
boots and ear plugs, they stand shoulder to shoulder, dipping
knives in hot water and then making quick cuts in meat passing
rapidly on a conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Smithfield's five plants can handle up to 19 million
hogs a year, turning out more than 5 billion pounds of pork.
</P>
<P>
   Luter, a tart-tongued 60-year-old Virginian who runs the company
from his Park Avenue apartment in New York City and his home in
Aspen, Colo., took over a small meatpacking company his father
founded in 1936 and made it into one of the world's largest food
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that the fat profits were in raising and processing
hogs, Smithfield joined forces with three North Carolina producers
to form Circle Four Farms. The four companies, which pioneered the
use of giant confinement barns that can hold up to 5,000 pigs,
agreed to use similar genetics and feed and send all hogs to
Smithfield packing plants.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has moved into Western states but has had less
impact in the Midwest because of anti-corporate farming laws. As a
result, hog production has boomed in the South and West but is in
sharp decline in the Midwest. Chicago is no longer ``hog butcher to
the world.'' Iowa, despite its plentiful grain, is about to lose to
North Carolina its title as the biggest hog state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our farmers are doing pigs because they were looking
for an alternative to tobacco,'' said Walter Cherry, executive
director of the North Carolina Pork Council, in Raleigh.
``Twenty-five years ago, we just didn't have pigs. Now, we're doing
$2 billion in pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Smithfield has acquired most of its Circle Four
partners, including the nation's two largest hog producers,
Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms. It also bought Schneider,
Canada's largest processor, and North Side Foods, maker of
McDonald's breakfast sausages. Smithfield just said it would
acquire a big Iowa processing plant from Farmland Industries, a
huge cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked as the nation's No. 7 pork producer in 1997, Smithfield
is now No. 1; a year ago, it also became the biggest hog processor
and even sells a large array of branded products like Gwaltney's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Smithfield's share price has fallen recently, Luter says
the company, which made a profit of $94 million on its $3.7 billion
in sales last year, will produce stronger and less volatile growth.
Smithfield's stock closed unchanged on Thursday, at $22.75, up from
its 52-week low of $14.875 in February, but well below its 52-week
high of $34.0625 last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts agree that the outlook for Smithfield is
bright. ``I'm a big believer,'' said David C. Nelson at Credit
Suisse First Boston, who insists the shares are undervalued. ``They
generated the best return of any food company in the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's drive, however, could be upset by a thicket of
legal and political challenges. Regulators are considering new
measures to cover corporate hog farms. Battles have broken out in
Colorado, Missouri and Iowa. In North Carolina, there is a
moratorium on building new corporate hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   Putrid smells and contaminated waste water have led to federal
fines and a public relations fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh won a Pulitzer Prize for
a series detailing hog waste problems tied to Murphy Family Farms.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Environmental Protection Agency fined
Smithfield $12.6 million after its processing plants violated the
Clean Water Act by discharging pollutants into the Pagan River. The
pollutants eventually reached the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Park Avenue apartment, Luter acknowledged
some lapses, but blamed politicians and environmentalists for
distorting the company's environmental record and ignoring the
benefits of big agriculture. He said the company was spending
millions of dollars on food safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA unjustly fined the company, Luter said, and ignored its
efforts to comply with state laws. ``I'm still outraged,'' he said
of the fines. ``Much of it came from agricultural runoff. Did it
have any major impact on the river? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Luter also scoffs at the idea of dangerous industry
concentration. The poultry and beef industries are much more
concentrated, he said, pointing to a different culprit in recent
low hog prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not concentration; it's too many hogs,'' he said. ``It
was just too profitable for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   With low prices pinching farmers in the Midwest, Congress has
responded by trying to put limits on big mergers and restraints on
companies like Smithfield.
</P>
<P>
   One idea is to give the Agriculture Department the power to
enforce anti-competitive laws, particularly in meatpacking; members
of Congress also plan to introduce legislation to prevent packers
from owning the hogs they slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was outraged when Luter
issued a press release saying Smithfield would keep consolidating.
``There's always been some consolidation,'' Grassley said in an
interview. ``But the aggressive pursuit of mega-corporate
agriculture that Smithfield is making will ruin the family farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is also concerned that consolidation
could give meatpackers too much power over prices. ``Farmers don't
like the fact that they're selling to so few buyers,'' said Keith
Collins, the agency's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Attorney General Thomas J. Miller filed suit against
Smithfield in January, trying to block its merger with Murphy.
Because Smithfield has a meatpacking plant in Sioux City, Miller
said the acquisition of Murphy, which produces hogs in Iowa, would
violate the state's corporate farming laws, which forbid a company
to control farm production and processing.
</P>
<P>
   The state also accused Smithfield of engaging in a sham
transaction after it agreed to sell Murphy's hog farms to Randall
D. Stoecker, a Murphy employee, for $79 million. Stoecker borrowed
the $79 million from Murphy and created Stoecker Farms, and the
state says Smithfield still controls the hog production.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state judge appointed a special investigator to
study the case. Luter said he expected a settlement soon.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic opposition growing, Smithfield has acquired big
companies in Canada, France and Poland. ``The current hostility
from interest groups in this country has made other parts of the
world look good to us,'' Luter said.
</P>
<P>
   At home, many small farmers are fighting back against the
perceived Goliath by joining cooperatives. Many are offering
fatter, better-tasting meat that appeals to fine restaurants and
other niche markets. They are raising hogs that are free of
antibiotics and selling organic pork, at a premium. And legislators
are standing behind them. But Luter insists American agriculture is
forever changed, and global markets, not legislators, are charting
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the small farmers have been disappearing
for 100 years,'' Luter said. ``If you want to protect the small
farmer, you are going to do it on the back of the American
consumer.''

GROUPS SUE PHILADELPHIA OVER LIMITS ON PROTESTS AT REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A coalition of more than 50 protest groups filed
suit in federal court on Thursday charging that this city's new
restrictions on public assembly during the Republican presidential
convention this summer will stifle dissent and violate the free
speech rights of all but the conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has created a system under which the Republican
National Committee stands astride every public forum in
Philadelphia,'' the coalition, which includes the NAACP and the
National Organization for Women, contended in a complaint filed in
Federal District Court by the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The city has passed an ``Omnibus Special Events Permit'' law
that in effect gives Republican officials priority to monopolize
prime public gathering places for convention parties and
gatherings. In addition, city officials have rejected the protest
coalition's permit request for a march and rally through the heart
of the city on July 30, the eve of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the planned rally, known as Unity 2000, said they had
sought a legal, peaceful demonstration and did not want to be
driven to the civil disobedience that some other groups were
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to go away and we are not going to remain
silent,'' declared Michael Morrill, director of Unity 2000, who
estimated that tens of thousands of demonstrators were planning to
come here during the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the court upholds the right of the protesters to march,
Morrill said, ``I really fear what could happen during the
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the special law passed for the convention, the city would
restrict protesters to demonstrating in a 40-by-190-foot zone
several hundred feet from the convention center, within sight,
police promise, of delegates arriving by bus at a neighboring
parking area. Fifty minutes would be allotted to each group of up
to 1,500 people chosen under a lottery system. Beyond that zone,
Republican officials would have priority in using the city's major
public areas, including Dilworth Plaza, Love Park and a half dozen
other outdoor venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No city has ever tried to deed over to one political party the
totality of its expressive places,'' Stefan Presser, legal director
of the ACLU, said at a news conference. In his filing, Presser
cited earlier protest litigation in 1987, during the bicentennial
celebration of the Constitution, when city officials were enjoined
by a federal judge against excessive interference with rightful
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the convention, city officials have been
mindful of the street protests against the World Trade Organization
that veered into vandalism last November in downtown Seattle. But
they say that the squares and parks here might be opened to protest
groups should Republican officials exercise their refusal rights by
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, coalition officials insisted that the refusal was
unlikely and that any decision close to the convention opening
would effectively scuttle their plans for mass protest. The member
groups' causes include labor, the environment, human rights, AIDS,
global economics and women's rights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the city's current mix of pride and caution about the
convention and all the attention it will bring, The Philadelphia
Inquirer has editorialized that the plan for the ``locked-down look
of Center City'' may seem ``a bit like Chicago'' in 1968 when
anti-war protesters and police clashed violently in the streets.
``The city that is liberty's birthplace ought to be as open to
protest as possible,'' the newspaper advised.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, has vowed to accommodate all
visitors fairly and peaceably. While police have been closely
studying the lessons of Seattle and preparing large-scale crowd
control measures, Kenneth Trujillo, the city solicitor, has
emphasized that protest permits are decided on the basis of traffic
and safety considerations, not on the politics of the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city does not have any intention of infringing on
anybody's constitutional rights,'' Trujillo declared.
</P>
<P>
   But the suit contends that the city is intent on avoiding
controversy and polishing its image by limiting mass protest and
has ``in effect authorized a single, preferred ideology'' in behalf
of the Republican conventioneers. The 1996 Republican convention
also had a restricted protest zone in San Diego, where
demonstrators sued to have it placed closer to the convention hall.
Presser argued that Philadelphia had gone beyond this precedent in
controlling prime gathering places beyond the convention to
``prevent all demonstrations.'' Plans for the Democratic convention
in Los Angeles also include a restricted protest zone near the
convention headquarters. But party officials said that so far there
had been no constitutional challenge and that other major city
venues were available for groups seeking to rally.

 MOSCOW GIVES IKEA A FROSTY WELCOME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9)

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Serice   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Agreed. It wasn't such a good idea for Ikea, the
Swedish furniture retailer, to try to open its advertising campaign
in the Moscow Metro for its first Russian store with a picture of a
bed and the slogan, ``Every 10th European was made in one of our
beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Stenberg, the Ikea marketing manager for Russia,
acknowledged the error. ``The sensitivities of Russians are higher
than we are used to,'' he said. The Metro management declared the
slogan in bad taste and, Stenberg added, ``said we couldn't prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities killed the ad campaign. But now Ikea has a more
serious problem: the City of Moscow is blocking construction of an
overpass the company was building to ease the flow of traffic into
its new store.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow roadblock is a reminder of the worst aspects of doing
business in Russia, where laws and bureaucrats can be arbitrary,
rules can change quickly and corruption is always a problem. And
the city's refusal to relent is a negative signal for other foreign
investors, especially given Ikea's painstaking two and a half year
effort to bring its low-cost yet stylish furniture and housewares
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea seemed to have gotten most everything right. It even
managed to convince the Russian government to change the way custom
duties were calculated on furniture, switching from weight to the
value of the furniture itself. The weight method would have made
duties on Ikea furniture so high that it would be impossible to
sell at the company's low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000-square-foot store just outside Moscow's city limits
in Khimki opened to a crowd of more than 37,000 on March 22.
Stenberg said that about 30 percent of the 265,000 people who
visited the store in its first two weeks made purchases. And he
said that they were not the Russian rich, but average consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were looking out at the parking lot we were seeing
many more Ladas and Zhigulis'' _ workhorses of Russia's automotive
fleet _ ``than Mercedes and BMWs,'' he said. And only about 3
percent of all the purchases were made with credit cards, another
sign, he said, that the store was attracting average consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea is a welcome relief for such Russians. They usually
encounter only top-of-the-line prices in the new, dazzling shopping
malls that have popped up in Moscow to offer foreign-made products.
And those malls have mostly been empty since the financial crisis
that followed the devaluation of the ruble and the government's
default on its debt in August of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Ikea store and the general plight of the
average Russian consumer have made it hard for the company to
understand why the City of Moscow is refusing to let it complete
the overpass. The traffic jam caused by cars turning off the main
highway on opening day backed up traffic for three miles by noon
and continues to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The city stopped Ikea from finishing its $4.5 million overpass
when it was two pillars short of completion, although the overpass
is outside Moscow city limits. The third and fourth pillar must go
on the Leningradskoye Shosse _ the main highway to the airport _
and the city has some control over construction there. Moscow says
that Ikea needs the city's approval before constructing anything
there that would block the view of a famous World War II monument.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moscow's objections to the overpass have been portrayed
in some of the city's newspapers as revenge for Ikea's decision to
locate its store three miles outside of the city limits, depriving
the city of substantial revenues. City officials could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg, who said ``It's very sad if it is revenge,'' added
that Ikea's choice reflected the company's dedication to keeping
its costs down.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term lease on land in Moscow, he said, would have been
too expensive. Ikea even offered to clean up an old industrial area
in the city in exchange for a cheaper lease, Stenberg said, but
``Moscow showed no flexibility at all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prices for a lease in the Moscow region outside of the city
``were much lower and continue to be much lower,'' he said, though
Ikea, which is a private company, would not provide specific
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea, based in Copenhagen for tax reasons, has 153 stores and is
adding 10 to 15 a year. As it expands its global reach, it is has
run into problems in various spots around the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has, for instance, created a small firestorm in Westchester
County, N.Y., with its effort to build a store in New Rochelle, a
project that would require the demolition of homes. In response to
the threat of increased traffic coming through neighboring towns,
the Town Council of Mamaroneck is set to vote this week on a
proposal to require Mamaroneck's approval for large-scale stores
and malls in nearby towns. A resident of Larchmont has founded
Wrain, Westchester Residents Against Ikea Now.
</P>
<P>
   But the Moscow problem is the kind that could be a more chilling
signal to foreign investors, especially given the general
difficulties even successful companies have had locating in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economy is recovering. The country's gross national
product rose 3 percent last year and is poised to gain as much or
more this year. That means Russian consumers could have more to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws, regulations and consistency needed to make doing
business easier is still absent, and it will be some time before it
is clear how much Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, will
change the system.
</P>
<P>
   So a glitch like Ikea's problem with Moscow could deter some
foreign companies from expanding in Russia. Yet this is the kind of
investment that is needed to give the Russian economy a long-term
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Moscow's unhappiness with Ikea was detailed in an
article in the newspaper Kommersant, a business daily, which said
it had obtained minutes of a March meeting of city hall officials.
The minutes, according to a translation of the article, say that
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's press secretary was assigned to organize the
publication of relevant critical material concerning ``illegal
activity of Ikea'' in city newspapers. Though the article did not
specify what the alleged illegal activity refers to, Ikea assumes
it is the building of the overpass without Moscow's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here is what is the law?,'' Stenberg said. ``We
have a document from the region, telling us to build, and we are
getting a decree from the city not to build. However we turn, we
are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Ikea's only negotiating point is to say _ as it
has _ that it still wants to build a store in the City of Moscow,
at the right price. But it has already leased a second site, of 131
acres, southwest of Moscow. Stenberg said that although Ikea had
approached the city ``in various ways'' about the overpass, it had
not yet been able to arrange a meeting with Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   If the overpass remains unfinished it would stand, Stenberg
said, ``as another monument to a failure to come to terms with a
major foreign investment in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The monument whose view Moscow says it is protecting is the spot
at which the German advance on Moscow was stopped in 1941. In
English, it is called the Tank Trap. Perhaps the unfinished
overpass could be called the Business Trap.

U.N. GETS A NEW PROPOSAL FOR IRAQ ARMS INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The blueprint for a new, tightly structured
arms inspection agency for Iraq was sent to the Security Council
Thursday, moving the chief inspector, Hans Blix, closer to the
moment of truth with President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Once the plan has been approved by the council, possibly next
week, the next step will be a visit to Iraq to re-establish an
inspection center in Baghdad. The new team will begin drawing up a
list of questions Iraq must answer before sanctions that have been
in place for nearly a decade can be suspended and finally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   So far Iraq has sent the United Nations mixed, though largely
negative, signals about its intentions toward the new panel, called
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The plan circulated Thursday takes account of the uncertainty,
saying that ``it may be neither practical nor prudent to move to
immediate full recruitment.'' A two-step hiring timetable was
suggested, with only a core of staff members to be appointed
initially.
</P>
<P>
   In his blueprint for the commission, Blix, a former Swedish
foreign minister and director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, appears to have assuaged some of the concerns of
arms control experts. Many had expected the panel, known by its
acronym, UNMOVIC, to be substantially weaker than its predecessor,
the U.N.Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Blix left the door open to former inspectors who want to reapply
_ although except in certain circumstances they will have to work
for the United Nations, not their national governments as in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous work will have given them valuable experience and
knowledge that could usefully be passed on to new UNMOVIC staff who
come on board,'' Blix wrote in his plan. ``A combination of renewal
and continuity would minimize the loss of momentum and knowledge
which has inevitably occurred through the long absence of
inspection and monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arms inspections in Iraq since December 1998,
when inspectors were withdrawn just ahead of American and British
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Iraqis have permitted only a routine visit from
the International Atomic Energy Agency for monitoring equipment
under the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, an issue not
related to the inspections imposed on Iraq in 1991 after the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq meets the requirements to destroy all prohibited
nuclear, biological and chemical arms as well as long-range
missiles, sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in August
1990 will not be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In his organizational plan, Blix made clear that he would deal
directly with the Security Council, and would also preside over the
international ``college of commissioners'' to be set up to advise
him. There had been fears among disarmament experts that
governments would use the college to exert pressure on the
inspection system, and they may still try. But the blueprint does
not give them much latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it give the U.N. Secretariat a prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, Blix emphasized, retains all of Unscom's powers
to designate inspection sites, conduct interviews, take samples and
photographs, and use aerial surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Blix proposed four operational divisions that at least on paper
appear well insulated from political pressures _ planning and
operations, analysis and assessment, information (archiving) and
technical support and training.
</P>
<P>
   Planning and operations will oversee the monitoring center in
Baghdad, which will be responsible for operating both a long-term
monitoring program and organizing short-term inspection visits. In
the past, some visiting inspectors were viewed as unsupervised
loose cannons, increasing tensions with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   All inspectors and monitors will now get ``cultural'' training,
according to the plan, which says, ``The cultural programs will
stress the importance of understanding national sensitivities and
the proper handling of adversarial situations.''

WHY AN INDEX ISN'T A MIRROR OF THE MARKET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many investors may think that they are protected from stormy
markets by investing in a large-stock index fund. They couldn't be
more wrong.
</P>
<P>
   With the major market indexes lurching to the precipice and
back, it is more important than ever that investors understand the
limitations of index investing today. Although index funds provide
an inexpensive way for investors to mirror the performance of broad
market indexes like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the strategy has
become increasingly risky in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way these funds are put together, they are much
less diversified than they used to be, making it important for
investors to take a more active role in broadening their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``By dint of their popularity, we can't ignore indexes,'' said
Anthony Maramarco, portfolio manager at the Babson Value fund in
Cambridge, Mass. ``But we also should realize that the widely
publicized indexes haven't for some time delivered on their claim
of being a truly representative measure of stock market
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of soaring performance, investing on auto pilot has
gone into a stall. Funds that try to reproduce the action of the
S&AMP;P 500, by far the most popular of the index funds, were up only
2.13 percent, on average, in the first quarter. That is a far cry
from the gains of 20 percent and more that investors in these funds
have grown accustomed to seeing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With returns on index funds so low, it is not that surprising
that the flood of money into them has slowed significantly. Lipper
Inc. estimates that $2.6 billion went into S&AMP;P 500 index funds in
January, less than half the $6 billion during the corresponding
month of 1999. And February saw an even greater falloff in cash
flows: just $300 million, compared with $4.4 billion in the month a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these mutual funds remain home to a huge chunk of
investor assets. More than $228 billion was in S&AMP;P 500 index funds
as of the end of February, Lipper said. Although investors are
putting fresh money elsewhere _ mostly into technology stock funds
_ they still have plenty of their eggs in the index fund basket.
</P>
<P>
   As gains in the major indexes have slowed, or reversed, many
money managers have been finding the S&AMP;P 500 an easy benchmark to
beat. According to Morningstar Inc., nearly two-thirds of
diversified mutual funds investing in United States stocks are
outperforming S&AMP;P 500 index funds this year. That is quite a
turnabout. Three years ago, only 11 percent of mutual fund managers
beat the index.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes it a very good time to reassess the index fund
phenomenon. Index funds have much going for them, but they have
downsides as well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest problem is the idea that an investment in an
S&AMP;P 500 index fund is an investment in the broadly diversified
overall market. Because of the way most stock indexes are
constructed, funds that mimic them have heavier weightings in some
sectors than in others. This makes them much riskier than a more
diversified portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what some investors still seem to think, the S&AMP;P 500
does not comprise equally weighted holdings of America's 500
largest stocks. It is weighted according to the stocks' market
capitalizations. So, as stocks rise in price, their impact on the
index's behavior rises as well. Similarly, as a stock falls on hard
times, its contribution to the S&AMP;P 500's performance dwindles, too.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 index funds are less diversified today than ever. Last
year, only 31 stocks accounted for all the S&AMP;P 500's 21 percent
gain. By contrast, in 1995, 341 stocks were responsible for the
index's 37.6 percent climb. Put in a slightly different way, as of
March 1, the 10 largest holdings represented 25 percent of the
total market value of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have become a much larger part of the index.
They account for roughly one-third of its value, up from 9 percent
just 10 years ago. That big leap owes to the fact that the S&AMP;P 500,
as an index weighted by market capitalization, can become dominated
by stocks that have seen big jumps in their values.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced technology stocks are now the tail wagging the index
fund dog. Sure, the S&AMP;P 500 index remained quite stable during the
technology rout early last week. But that was in large part because
big value stocks rose sharply during the technology sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that making a big bet on technology may not be what
many index funds investors had in mind when they poured their
retirement dollars into funds that are supposed to mirror the
market. These, after all, are among the most volatile stocks
trading today.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 is not the only index in which relatively few issues
hold sway. Many investors have been turning to total stock market
index funds, which reflect the action in the Wilshire 5000 index,
for greater diversification. But, it turns out, these funds do not
necessarily provide it. According to statisticians at the Dow
Theory Forecasts newsletter, the 10 largest holdings in the
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund represent 19 percent of its
assets. And in any case, the Wilshire 5000's correlation to the S&AMP;P
500 is remarkably close.
</P>
<P>
   As particular stocks rise in price and constitute a larger
portion of an index, there is another problem for investors who add
to their fund holdings. They are essentially buying greater
proportions of companies that have already risen significantly and
reducing their exposure to stocks that have declined. In other
words, they are buying high and selling low.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, that has meant paying outlandish prices for
stocks that were among the most beloved. According to Maramarco of
Babson Value, investors who bought an S&AMP;P 500 index fund in March
were paying a median trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 42 for the
top 20 stocks in the index, compared with a median of 29 for the
overall index.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Leuthold Group, a market research firm in
Minneapolis, have studied some of the most popular stock indexes
and found some surprising discrepancies between what the indexes
are and what they are assumed to be.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the S&AMP;P Mid-Cap 400 index, which purports to be
representative of companies in the middle tier of stock market
capitalization, has a sizable proportion _ 16 percent _ of its
value in what many people consider to be large-cap stocks, those
with capitalizations of about $8 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, about one-tenth of the companies in the index
qualify as small companies, with market caps of less than $1.2
billion and more than $550 million. As a result, only
three-quarters of the index is made up of midsize companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another oddity is the S&AMP;P Small-Cap 600 index, in which 15
percent of the companies are in fact mid-tier. Almost one-third of
the index is made up of stocks with market values of $250 million
or less _ microcap companies by most measures. That means that just
77 percent of the companies in the small-cap index are truly small
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Russell 2000, the most popular proxy for
small-stock performance, is reconstituted only once a year, it can
contain large numbers of stocks that have increased in price, and
therefore, no longer qualify as small.
</P>
<P>
   A result of all this is that fans of index funds who want a
truly diversified portfolio must do a lot more work today to
achieve it. No longer is it enough to buy a fund that mimics the
S&AMP;P 500 and forget about it. Such an investment puts most investors
too squarely in the growth and large-company sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the only way to balance out is to find a value manager
and a small-cap manager,'' said Mike Schurmann, an analyst at the
Leuthold Group. ``Microsoft has a huge weighting on any
capitalization-weighted index it is in, as do the likes of Cisco
and Oracle. It's not just the fact that they're large-cap
companies; it's the fact that they've grown so quickly into being
the largest caps.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other kinds of index funds, of course. Alternatives
for investors looking to diversify include funds that mirror the
performance of the Russell 1000, an index of the country's 1,000
largest companies. While it has historically tracked the S&AMP;P
closely, so far this year it is greatly outperforming. Charles
Schwab's Small Cap Index fund is a low-cost offering that tracks a
proprietary index that includes the second-largest 1,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors looking for value stocks can choose from small- or
large-company index funds. The Vanguard Value Index fund tracks the
roughly 400 relatively cheap issues in the S&AMP;P/Barra Value index,
while the Vanguard Small Capitalization Value index fund tracks the
S&AMP;P Small-Cap 600/Barra Value index. All these funds have low
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dimensional Fund Advisors of Santa Monica, Calif., runs a
variety of passively managed funds that are rigorously based on
market capitalizations and value and growth styles, rather than the
often subjective opinions of experts who create indexes. They are,
however, aimed at institutions and financial advisers.

ILLINOIS' CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE PARISHIONERS TO OPPOSE RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 3rd from last graf to change `those' to `church members') 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic bishops of Illinois have issued a pastoral
letter calling on the 3.7 million parishioners in their state to
oppose all forms of racist behavior, including the use of bigoted
language and racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, focused on bias against African-Americans, was
posted on the Archdiocese of Chicago's Internet site
(www.archdiocese-chgo.org) on Tuesday, the 32nd anniversary of the
assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and is being
mailed this week to parishes in the state's six dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter _ asking Catholics to pray for an end to racism,
avoid investing in companies with racist policies and back public
officials committed to racial healing _ is not the first time that
American bishops have spoken out on the issue. In 1979, the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement
describing racism as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois bishops said that although ``some progress'' had
been made since then, no one should be lulled into believing racism
is no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the case,'' the bishops wrote in the letter,
titled ``Moving Beyond Racism: Learning to see with the Eyes of
Christ.'' They added, ``Events continue to remind us that racism
thrives.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they cited hate speech on the Internet; the 1998
murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man chained to a pickup truck and
dragged to death in Texas, and the torture of Abner Louima, a
Haitian immigrant, in a New York police station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is so blatantly racist,'' the bishops wrote, ``that
it can shock and therefore move us to ask again how to confront
more effectively the sin of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anita Baird, executive assistant to Cardinal Francis
George, the archbishop of Chicago, said in a telephone interview
that the letter originated in a 1994 request by church members
working with black Catholic parishioners in the Illinois dioceses
that the bishops as a group speak out against racism and economic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She said the process was interrupted by the death of Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, George's predecessor as archbishop, in November
1996. Later, the bishops decided to release the letter in 2000,
which the church has proclaimed a Jubilee Year, a period that
emphasizes themes of conversion and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping every member of the parishes will have the
opportunity to read it and have the opportunity to discuss it,''
Sister Baird said.

BERTELSMANN RECORD UNIT AND KEY LABEL PRESIDENT ARE AT ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For virtually the last decade, the music industry titan Clive
Davis has been a regular on the circuit of international gatherings
of music executives organized by BMG Entertainment, the parent
company of his record label, Arista Records.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of an intensifying corporate dispute and the
likely departure of Davis, Arista's longtime president, he is not
planning to participate in a two-day meeting next week of BMG
executives from around the world. The meeting was organized to
coincide with the taping of a prime-time concert Monday celebrating
Arista's 25-year anniversary. The concert is to feature
performances by the label's artists, including Aretha Franklin,
Whitney Houston and Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Davis and BMG have been extraordinarily
awkward since news articles first leaked out late last year that
BMG, a unit of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, wanted to
anoint a younger successor to the 66-year-old Davis as his contract
neared its expiration date at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard-trained lawyer, Davis has made a long and storied
career of nurturing and guiding artists from Janis Joplin and Barry
Manilow to Sarah McLachlan. Earlier this year he won a Grammy award
for producing Santana's No. 1 album, ``Supernatural,'' which has
shipped 16 million copies. And the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
recently paid tribute to Davis' producing skills, inducting him
into the nonperformer category.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, said that Davis is still
involved in serious, continuing discussions with BMG. Strauss
Zelnick, the president of BMG, declined to comment on the
discussions about Davis' future with the company.
</P>
<P>
   A record executive with long ties to Arista said, however, that
those discussions were undermined earlier this week because BMG
started preparing to announce the appointment of a successor to
Davis, Antonio Reid of LaFace Records, which is the home of
recording artists like Toni Braxton, TLC and Usher.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move now would have allowed BMG to introduce Reid at the
big gathering of its recording executives next week. They are
convening in Beverly Hills for a series of presentations, dinners
and performances of new artists in the BMG fold. Over the years
BMG's worldwide music meetings _ as they call them _ have been held
in a variety of countries, but this year the event was arranged for
Los Angeles to accommodate dozens of executives who plan to attend
the Arista concert.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executive close to the developments this week,
Davis was outraged that the announcement of his successor could
have been scheduled so close to the anniversary celebration,
prompting BMG to delay the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Arista, independently of BMG, issued a news release
promoting its recent sales records _ ``an impressive $425 million
in gross revenues in the United States, which makes gross revenues
for the last nine months higher than any full year in the company's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   BMG, which had revenues of $4.7 billion in its last fiscal year,
owns more than 200 record labels in 53 countries, with Arista being
one of its largest and most prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Through his spokesman, Davis declined to comment on whether he
expressed anger over an announcement about Reid's appointment. But
Rubenstein said that Davis had ``made no statements directly or
indirectly about any announcement and it hasn't been on the table
in discussions with BMG.'' He said that the version of events that
had Davis upset about the planned announcement was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Another aide said that Davis still could attend the BMG music
gathering if one of his records is completed in time to present to
the executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the record executive with ties to Arista, Davis is
involved in discussions with all the major record labels about
creating a new music venture, particularly Universal Music Group
and Sony Music. He said Davis is seeking to strike an agreement
that would give him nearly $300 million in financing along with
some artists from the label that he strikes an alliance with.

HURTING THE ONE YOU LOVE: CRASH TESTS AND U.S. CUSTOMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Conn.)   By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All cars imported into the United States for use by Americans on
public roads must comply with the crash-safety standards of the
Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act, the bumper-protection
standards of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act,
and the pollution-control standards under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although most developed countries now have pollution and safety
standards that differ from those in the United States only by
matters of degrees, foreign manufacturers still must certify that
all the cars they export to this country comply with American
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign cars, however, don't have to comply _ the most
common exemption is for cars more than 25 years old. Racing cars
and experimental cars that use new technology don't have to comply,
either, but can run only on tracks or on short demonstration trips.
A foreign national may also bring a personal car that does not meet
the standards here, for no more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, a car not on the Department of Transportation's
certified list would normally have to pass at least three crash
tests _ one each from the front and rear at 30 miles per hour, and
the more severe side impact at 33 mph. In effect, it would require
a potential importer to destroy at least three cars before one
could be approved. Then the car would have to be fitted with a
speedometer that reads in miles per hour, properly sealed
headlights, correct pollution equipment, damage-resistant bumpers
and other parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we usually tell people is that trying to retrofit a car
to our standards will probably be more expensive than a car is
worth,'' said Janice Mosher, a Customs Service spokeswoman. ``Make
no mistake, it is an ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department is also concerned about people who
attempt to circumvent all import regulations by smuggling cars into
the country. Sneaking a car past a customs inspector might seem
like a job for Penn and Teller, but it's much easier with the
Smart, which will be on sale legally in 11 European countries by
the end of the year: Department officials say they think a number
of Smarts have been shipped into the United States _ most likely
piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-assembled or piecemeal, the companies behind the Smart
aren't encouraging gray-market imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any importation of these cars has nothing to do with
Mercedes-Benz or DaimlerChrysler,'' said Jim Resnick, a spokesman
for Mercedes-Benz USA. Designed as a venture between Swatch and
Mercedes Benz, the Smart is now wholly owned by DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons why DaimlerChrysler and other
foreign manufacturers would not want a noncertified product to be
used in this country. The Smart was designed for the tight
maneuvering and limited parking of European cities _ and the lower
bumper heights of European cars; it probably wouldn't fare well in
an encounter with a New York taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   There are no factory-authorized service centers for the Smart,
which could create warranty disputes. And DaimlerChrysler could
face a product-liability lawsuit if anyone was injured or killed in
an accident involving a Smart.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, it may be possible to buy and drive a Smart
legally. The Department of Transportation has a list of approved
retrofitters who can _ for a price _ bring almost any foreign car
into compliance with American regulations (see
www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import).
</P>
<P>
   ``Each and every car has its own nuances,'' said David
Castelhano, president of U.S. Conformance, a government-approved
``importer,'' as the retrofitters are called, in Jupiter, Fla. What
makes it prohibitively expensive to retrofit a Smart Car, he said,
are such uniquely American twists as an on-board pollution
diagnostics system. ``Those systems are extremely expensive to
install,'' Castelhano said. To help combat theft, the government
requires that the vehicle-identification number be engraved in 14
places. ``The code of federal regulations is about as thick as your
wrist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Fritz, president of Amerispec, a company in
Ridgefield, Conn., has retrofitted a McLaren F1, an exotic British
sports car with 627 horsepower and a top speed in excess of 200
miles an hour. He recently said that a businessman approached him
with a plan to import and retrofit thousands of Smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over in Europe a few months ago to take a good look at
the car,'' Fritz said. ``If a car is relatively small like this,
the pollutants are not that big a factor This has a high-tech
engine and is very close to meeting the U.S. specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The car has air bags and has passed European crash tests, he
said, but Europe does not have side-impact tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart will need numerous small modifications to pass United
States standards, Fritz said, none of which are too difficult in
themselves. ``The problem is not making it too expensive in the
process,'' he said. ``It sells for $12,500 for a really nice one.
But you can't spend another $10,000 to make it legal and expect to
sell many of them.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Carter vies for title of Next Jordan
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There might never be another Michael Jordan. But just
for today, just for argument's sake, let's say there will be. If
such a player were to exist, wouldn't his career path look like
this?
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the star of his college team. He wasn't the first
player drafted, or even the fourth. He isn't based in the United
States. He has been allowed to play his way into being the Next
Jordan, as opposed to having it thrust on him by the NBA's
star-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in sum, Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, Michael Jordan wasn't regarded as the first
Michael Jordan when he arrived in Chicago. He was the guy drafted
behind Sam Bowie. Jordan had Nike behind him, yes, but Nike then
shouldn't be confused with Nike now. Michael Jordan became Michael
Jordan by playing basketball better than anyone else who ever
lived. Carter, who will face the Hawks tonight in Philips Arena,
might or might not be the best player to come along since, but he
has things going for him that other heirs apparent did not.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill came prepackaged and was too circumspect to fit
inside the shrink wrap. Kobe Bryant landed in L.A., where hype is
bought and sold by the case. They were the Next Jordans only
because someone decided they should be, not because they actually
mirrored the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Carter isn't a dead ringer, but he's the closest thing yet. He
has what basketball men call ``the explosion,'' which in laymen's
terms is the capacity to make you leap from your seat and shout,
``Whoo-weeeeeee!!!!'' He has the body and the vertical leap, and he
seems to have the timing.
</P>
<P>
   He was rookie of the year in strike-blighted 1999, meaning that
his reputation had a chance to grow by word of mouth. In his
ballyhooed first game on NBC, Carter stacked 51 points on Pheonix.
That was a Jordanian move _ surmounting the insurmountable. He
followed that with a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat Boston,
followed that with a last-second dunk to beat Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He has done it without playing for a team in L.A. or New York
or, worse yet, Chicago. True, Carter did emerge from North
Carolina, same as Jordan, but he was always the secondary Tar Heel.
Antawn Jamison, who was drafted one spot ahead of Carter and then
swapped for him, was the consensus college player of the year.
Carter landed in Toronto, where overstuffed American egos go to
die, and managed to transcend the daunting border.
</P>
<P>
   For all Next Jordans, the first test is credibility. Can you
really imagine this person working half the wonders Michael
wrought? With Carter, maybe you can. That advances him to the next
developmental phase, which is the backlash. Orlando coach Doc
Rivers rails that refs have taken to rooting for Carter. Indiana's
Jalen Rose played tough against Carter on NBC last Sunday and said
afterward that the Pacers ``didn't want to be part of anybody's
sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month Carter has dumped his agent and has had to
shoot more to get his points. His rickety Raptors have lost eight
of nine games and are being booed at home. We forget how long it
took Jordan to make the Bulls a champion _ remember, Chicago lost
that Sunday in Boston Garden when he scored 63 points _ and how
much criticism he ultimately overrode. Ten years from now, maybe
we'll have forgotten Vince Carter's shakedown spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. The NBA is already littered with Next Jordans who
were unmasked as simply very good players. What's different about
Vince Carter is that the mask hasn't yet slipped.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dr. J. Craig Venter told a congressional committee
Thursday that his company, the Celera Corp., had finished analyzing
all necessary pieces of human DNA and would assemble the whole
human genome within three to six weeks, far earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the human genome will be a milestone in the
history of science and medicine. The genome's 3 billion letters of
DNA, encoding the 80,000 or so genes needed to make and operate a
human being, are expected to provide the basis for a new generation
of medical treatments that will attack disease at the level of
genes and cells.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, which jumped into a race with a publicly financed
consortium of academic centers 22 months ago, now seems likely to
achieve a clear victory. Though Venter's claims have been
challenged in the past, his successful completion last month of a
pilot project, the fruit fly genome, demonstrated that his approach
works and seems at least for the moment to have silenced critics.
</P>
<P>
   No one challenged his forecast Thursday, which he made in the
presence of the president's science adviser, Dr. Neal Lane, and a
leading genome sequencer in the public consortium, Dr. Robert H.
Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium laid much of the technical and
computational basis for decoding the human genome, and made its DNA
sequences freely available to researchers in public databases. It
intends by the end of June to complete a ``rough draft'' of the
human genome, a set of DNA fragments that will contain about 90
percent of all human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Although assembling this material could take until 2003, the
rough draft will be a significant prize for researchers, since they
will be able to search the genome for genes reasonably well even
though it is in pieces. Celera is making use of the consortium's
public data in completing its own genome sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, as they have entered the endgame of
the human genome race, Celera and the consortium have engaged in a
series of combative public announcements, interlaced with private
talks about collaboration. There is a strong logic for a joint
effort because the two sides are pursuing different but
complementary strategies to decoding the genome.
</P>
<P>
   First Celera disclosed its fruit fly results, proving the
effectiveness of its whole genome shotgun strategy. Then Dr.
Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project of the National
Institutes of Health, announced the June date for the consortium's
rough draft.
</P>
<P>
   Venter responded with Thursday's announcement. He added that he
was switching his 300 sequencing machines to analysis of the mouse
genome, knowledge of which will help researchers interpret what
human genes do.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The genome decoded by Celera belongs to a man, so it has both X
and Y chromosomes (women have two X chromosomes). The man has not
been named, but his identify will become largely immaterial as
individual variations in DNA, called SNPs or ``snips,'' are
gathered by Celera and others. The public consortium's genome is
drawn from a mosaic of different individuals.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Venter said that after the human genome was assembled, he would
convene a conference of outside experts to annotate it, meaning to
identify where the genes lie on the DNA and what they do.
Annotation is achieved with computer programs that analyze the DNA
sequence, pinpoint the components of genes, and guess their
biological role from comparison with known genes of other species
that are already in the databases.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of the human genome codes for genes, and the
methods for identifying them are far from perfect. Once the
annotation experts have finished their task, sometime later this
year, Celera will make its human genome sequence freely available
to researchers, Venter said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has a record of technical and managerial successes in
sequencing genomes, first of bacteria and now of animals, despite
assertions by critics that he would never succeed and whose
skepticism seems a necessary psychological spur to his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Celera said that at a meeting last Friday with
officials of the National Institutes of Health, Venter proposed
that both sides publish their findings jointly, as was done with
the fruit fly genome sequence, to which the public consortium
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Draft language of an unpublished Celera-consortium agreement
states that their goals ``are, in fact, complementary'' and that
the two sides are agreed on patent policy for the human genome
(essentially that genes should be patentable only after their roles
have been identified in detail, not on the basis of their sequence
alone).
</P>
<P>
   But Venter's testimony Thursday, before the energy and
environment subcommittee of the House Committee on Science,
included a sharp attack on the quality of the consortium's work and
criticism of the ``rough draft'' plan that Collins announced last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Venter described the consortium's human genome data as ``an
unordered collection of over 500,000 fragments'' that is ``nowhere
close to being done,'' as Collins had been quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago it was reported that Dr. Collins had said Celera
would produce the Mad Magazine version of the human genome,''
Venter said in his written testimony Thursday. ``From its
formation, Celera's goal has been to produce a high-quality human
genome sequence that will stand the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Celera said officials of the national
institutes who saw the testimony earlier this week cited it as a
``deal breaker'' and cut off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason for the breakdown, these sources say, was
not the testimony but a disagreement over acceptable standards for
completing the human genome sequence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The definition is in question because unlike bacteria, in which
every letter of the genome can be sequenced, animal genomes have
large regions of DNA that cannot be decoded by present methods.
Fortunately, the regions contain few genes. But even the regions
relatively abundant in genes have gaps whose decoding will have to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Celera argues that in a finished genome the coding regions
should be substantially complete and the order of all the fragments
on the chromosomes should be known. By this definition, Celera's
fruit fly and presumably human sequences would pass as complete,
but the institutes' ``rough draft'' would not. The many fragments
in its draft can be assigned approximate positions on the
chromosomes but cannot yet be placed in correct relative order.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scientists in both camps told the subcommittee Thursday
that they agreed on the standards the Patent and Trademark Office
should adopt for the patenting of genes. They criticized the
approach followed by two other genomic companies, Incyte
Pharmaceuticals and Human Genome Sciences, which they contended
were downloading the public consortium's genome data every night
and filing patent applications for any genes they found.
</P>
<P>
   Genes should not be patentable until a clear description of
their role and utility can be given, the two sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said Celera's business plan was to offer subscriptions to
its genomic data for pharmaceutical companies and universities. He
said the fee for universities would be set very low, at $5,000 to
$15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Venter said several universities had
told him they feared their grants would be cut if they subscribed
to Celera's database because it was viewed as competitive to
Genbank, the database run by the institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he would look into the accusations and ``ensure that
all of our agencies are abiding by their rules and guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took place against the recovery leg of a dramatic
seesaw in Celera's stock price. Three weeks ago, Celera's stock
price was halved, in a $30 billion rout of the biotechnology
industry, after an announcement by President Clinton and Britain's
prime minister, Tony Blair, that had been orchestrated by the
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was viewed, at least by Venter, as a criticism
of Celera and was misinterpreted by others as meaning the White
House opposed granting patents on the human genome. The White House
said at the time, and Clinton reiterated on Wednesday, that no
change in patent policy was intended.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of PE Celera Genomics rose 23.9 percent in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange Thursday, closing at $140, a rise of $27.
On Wednesday, the stock rose 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other biotechnology stocks, including Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Genome Therapeutics,
were also sharply higher Thursday as investors saw Celera's
announcement as a sign that the industry was progressing faster
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq biotechnology index surged 4.9 percent, helping the
overall Nasdaq market recover from its selloff earlier in the week
by another 2.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The business fallout of the Clinton-Blair announcement served to
politicize Thursday's hearings, with Republican members asking
questions critical of the consortium and Democrats seeking to bring
out the public benefit of the consortium's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if publication of the human genome sequence would allow
hostile governments to devise biological weapons or target specific
populations, Venter said that ``the genome will not provide the
ability for targeting any ethnic groups'' and that any dangerous
knowledge was more likely to lie in the genomes of pathogenic
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asked in relation to decoding
the human genome sequence: ``Does this mean we can alter the race
of people? Can we design who inhabits this earth?'' Venter said it
would take a century simply to understand what each human gene
does, and that no attempt to alter the human germ line should be
made until then, if ever.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A day that began with hopes for a compromise sparked by
the dramatic arrival of Elian Gonzalez's father in the U.S. ended
with another tense stand-off as the Miami relatives of the
6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor refused to meet federal demands
to turn the boy over voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has made the decision that they will . . .
change custody to the father even though the government has never
even spoken to the boy or had the boy evaluated by psychologists,''
said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the Miami family. ``What
the government has decided is a very dangerous thing for this
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials made no immediate comment after
their five days of talks with the family's lawyers broke down with
no agreement. They have insisted, however, that Elian will be
placed in his father's custody, with or without the help of the
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   News of the impasse sent a stir through a crowd of about 100
protestors gathered outside the Little Havana home where Elian has
been living with his Miami relatives. Late in the day, a convoy of
dump trucks descended on the neighborhood, blocking some streets,
while about 50 women and children formed a human chain in front of
the house, vowing not to let federal officials take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said they purposefully excluded men from the
group to avoid any angry confrontations near the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sit on the ground and they will have to drag me out,''
vowed Doris Salazar, 51, who joined the protest earlier in the day.
``People in this country don't understand that he's not going back
to his father. He's going back to (Cuban President) Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But any attempt to take Elian from the home likely won't come
immediately. With federal officials reluctant to confront the
protestors, the stage seemed set for further legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said that without the family's
cooperation, they would probably send a letter very soon informing
the family that they plan to transfer Elian to his father. A second
letter would then tell the family when and where they should
deliver the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyers might respond by asking the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to block the action until their lawsuit
over the case is resolved. The court is scheduled to hear arguments
in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the day, one of the Miami family's attorneys held
out hopes for a different scenario _ letting the family meet
without the boy, or lawyers _ to try to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the lawyers and the government to walk away and
let the family sit down and discuss what is in Elian's best
interests,'' said Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for the Miami
family. ``We're hoping that (Elian's father) Juan Miguel will agree
to do this at any location.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business at such a meeting would be to
heal the wounds from the increasingly heated rhetoric the two sides
of the family have exchanged in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Castro announced that Juan Miguel Gonzalez might
soon come to the United States, lawyers for the family aired
accusations that he had abused Elian in telephone conversations by
telling him his mother was still alive and waiting for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother drowned with 10 other people after the boat they
were using to flee Cuba sank. The boy was one of only a few
survivors, and was rescued Thanksgiving Day off the For Lauderdale
coast.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in Washington early Thursday, Elian's father also
blasted the Miami relatives, saying they have paraded his son
before the media and subjected him to a long television interview
without the father's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his personality
already weakened by the terrible trauma,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez remained in the Washington, D.C. area Thursday, staying
at the home of a top Cuban diplomat. He planned to meet Friday with
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, Commissioner
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami talks broke down when immigration officials refused to
budge on the family's demands, insisting that the only option is to
turn the boy over. The family's main demands were that Elian be
evaluated by a team of psychologists who would decide what is best
for him, and that the boy's father promise he would not take Elian
back to Cuba before the court appeal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he would remain in this country until the
appeal is heard, but federal officials say there is no legal
obligation that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the family introduced a psychologist to the media
gathered outside their home, saying he had examined Elian and found
the boy fears being reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is not to yank him away from the
stability and security'' he now has with the Miami family, said
Mitch Spiro, a Broward County psychologist who said he is donating
his time to the family.
</P>
<P>
   To do so might cause ``irreversible emotional damage,'' Spiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments echoed one of the family's main concerns, that
Elian has found a replacement for his mother in his cousin,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has cared for the boy since he was
rescued. To take him from her would further traumatize Elian, they
believe.
</P>
<P>
   The family also seemed outraged that federal officials would not
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not even promise not to come to try to take the boy
in the middle of the night,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The comment seemed sure to stir an even more determined vigil
among Miami's exiles.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said the words were a sign of the family's
increasing desperation _ and narrowing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only leverage the family has is political pressure,''
Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami immigration attorney, told reporters.
``All the chips are in INS's hands.''

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Energy Department said Thursday that gasoline would
cost a good deal less this summer than what had been forecast just
a month ago, though the typical household was still expected to
spend $170 more to fuel up the family car than last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prices should peak this month at $1.52 a gallon for regular
unleaded gasoline, roughly what it averaged in March, before
falling to $1.39 by September. The average for the summer should be
$1.46, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical agency for the department.
</P>
<P>
   That may offer little relief to drivers, who can still expect to
pay about 25 percent more this summer than last year. But the
outlook is far better than last month's, when forecasters predicted
average prices of $1.56 for the summer, with peak months reaching
$1.80.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast, though, carries an important caveat; the
agency said that to meet the projection, the nation's refineries
would have to operate at close to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Any major disruptions, which might include hurricanes,
explosions and extended maintenance shutdowns, could cause prices
to spike above the new predictions. The agency noted that refinery
problems early last year in California contributed to a spring jump
in gasoline prices there at a time when oil prices were far lower
than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also predicted that the price of imported crude oil
delivered to domestic refiners, which averaged $26.75 a barrel in
February and March, would drop to $23.50 by the end of this year,
and to $21.50 by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The lowered forecast may take some steam out of efforts in
Congress to suspend 4.3 cents of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal
gasoline tax. That proposal, by Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, has not come to a vote. But in a nonbinding resolution
Thursday, senators signaled in a 66-34 vote that they lean against
lowering the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The government's sharply revised forecast was attributable to
the decision last week by OPEC member nations to raise their oil
output, said Dave Costello, an economist at the agency, and to the
market's surprisingly strong reaction to the increase.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel's production increase ``wasn't that much different
from what we had kind of been assuming,'' Costello said. But crude
prices fell by perhaps $1 a barrel more than what had been
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast ``doesn't mean that all concerns are out the
window or anything like that,'' he said. ``It means the situation
has brightened up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline supplies have been helped, Costello added, because with
falling oil prices, refiners have enjoyed a wider spread between
what they pay for oil and the price they can sell gasoline, in
contrast to thin margins earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, wholesale gasoline prices have dropped lately, in
part because of recent upward revisions in estimates of the
nation's gasoline inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The revised estimates suggest that stocks of gasoline, while
still quite low, have not fallen to the severe levels previously
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin J. Lindemer, a senior director at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said that the government's
assumption that domestic refineries can run at 96.8 percent of
capacity this summer is attainable, barring major disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   He also attributed part of the recent decline in prices, and the
hope for further declines, to psychological factors. ``We've taken
the heat out of the market,'' Lindemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new forecast still predicts the highest summer
gasoline prices ever, the agency noted that the situation is not as
severe when inflation-adjusted numbers are used. The average 1981
summer price of $1.35 per gallon, for example, translates to $2.52
today.
</P>
<P>
   That is not much solace, though, to motorists paying extra to
fuel their car. Lauren Merritt, a senior at Booker T. Washington
High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, said she
spends at least $30 a week on gasoline commuting from Kaufman
County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If they materialize, Merritt said, lower prices will help a bit.
But prices will remain high, crimping her efforts to save for
college. ``I can't spend as much as I want to on other things
because I have to budget for gas,'' she said.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A day that began with hopes for a compromise sparked by
the dramatic arrival of Elian Gonzalez's father in the U.S. ended
with another tense stand-off as the Miami relatives of the
6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor refused to meet federal demands
to turn the boy over voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has made the decision that they will . . .
change custody to the father even though the government has never
even spoken to the boy or had the boy evaluated by psychologists,''
said Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, an attorney for the Miami family. ``What
the government has decided is a very dangerous thing for this
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials made no immediate comment after
their five days of talks with the family's lawyers broke down with
no agreement. They have insisted, however, that Elian will be
placed in his father's custody, with or without the help of the
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   News of the impasse sent a stir through a crowd of about 100
protestors gathered outside the Little Havana home where Elian has
been living with his Miami relatives. Late in the day, a convoy of
dump trucks descended on the neighborhood, blocking some streets,
while about 50 women and children formed a human chain in front of
the house, vowing not to let federal officials take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said they purposefully excluded men from the
group to avoid any angry confrontations near the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sit on the ground and they will have to drag me out,''
vowed Doris Salazar, 51, who joined the protest earlier in the day.
``People in this country don't understand that he's not going back
to his father. He's going back to (Cuban President) Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But any attempt to take Elian from the home likely won't come
immediately. With federal officials reluctant to confront the
protestors, the stage seemed set for further legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said that without the family's
cooperation, they would probably send a letter very soon informing
the family that they plan to transfer Elian to his father. A second
letter would then tell the family when and where they should
deliver the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyers might respond by asking the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to block the action until their lawsuit
over the case is resolved. The court is scheduled to hear arguments
in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the day, one of the Miami family's attorneys held
out hopes for a different scenario _ letting the family meet
without the boy, or lawyers _ to try to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the lawyers and the government to walk away and
let the family sit down and discuss what is in Elian's best
interests,'' said Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for the Miami
family. ``We're hoping that (Elian's father) Juan Miguel will agree
to do this at any location.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business at such a meeting would be to
heal the wounds from the increasingly heated rhetoric the two sides
of the family have exchanged in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Castro announced that Juan Miguel Gonzalez might
soon come to the United States, lawyers for the family aired
accusations that he had abused Elian in telephone conversations by
telling him his mother was still alive and waiting for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother drowned with 10 other people after the boat they
were using to flee Cuba sank. The boy was one of only a few
survivors, and was rescued Thanksgiving Day off the For Lauderdale
coast.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in Washington early Thursday, Elian's father also
blasted the Miami relatives, saying they have paraded his son
before the media and subjected him to a long television interview
without the father's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures aimed at influencing his personality
already weakened by the terrible trauma,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez remained in the Washington, D.C. area Thursday, staying
at the home of a top Cuban diplomat. He planned to meet Friday with
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, Commissioner
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami talks broke down when immigration officials refused to
budge on the family's demands, insisting that the only option is to
turn the boy over. The family's main demands were that Elian be
evaluated by a team of psychologists who would decide what is best
for him, and that the boy's father promise he would not take Elian
back to Cuba before the court appeal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said he would remain in this country until the
appeal is heard, but federal officials say there is no legal
obligation that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the family introduced a psychologist to the media
gathered outside their home, saying he had examined Elian and found
the boy fears being reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is not to yank him away from the
stability and security'' he now has with the Miami family, said
Mitch Spiro, a Broward County psychologist who said he is donating
his time to the family.
</P>
<P>
   To do so might cause ``irreversible emotional damage,'' Spiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments echoed one of the family's main concerns, that
Elian has found a replacement for his mother in his cousin,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has cared for the boy since he was
rescued. To take him from her would further traumatize Elian, they
believe.
</P>
<P>
   The family also seemed outraged that federal officials would not
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not even promise not to come to try to take the boy
in the middle of the night,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The comment seemed sure to stir an even more determined vigil
among Miami's exiles.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said the words were a sign of the family's
increasing desperation _ and narrowing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only leverage the family has is political pressure,''
Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami immigration attorney, told reporters.
``All the chips are in INS's hands.''

`BURN THE FLOOR': INTERNATIONAL CROP OF PELVIS-SWIVELING BALLROOM
DANCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In case you haven't noticed, ballroom dancing is
back, and ``Burn the Floor,'' which opened a two-night stint at
Radio City Music Hall on Wednesday, is the latest entry to
capitalize on the current craze.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers are downright terrific, an international crop
recruited from amateur and professional championship dance
competitions. Look past the show's brassy facade, with its
rock-show production values and attitude (mock ecstasy is the usual
facial expression), and there is some complex footwork in what is
essentially a suite of deliberately souped-up social dances. The
pelvis-swiveling finale is led by Australians, backed up by a
conglomerate of Slavs and Scandinavians, and should give Ricky
Martin a run for his Yankee dollar.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, sturdy little companies like American Ballroom
Theater, seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and elsewhere in the
1980s, look somewhat tame. Yet that troupe and more recent ventures
did pioneering work in theatricalizing ballroom dances onstage.
``Burn the Floor'' is bigger and louder but not better: It fails to
make a virtue of the disco-drive energy that is its signature.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is performed at the same punchy level, subtlety
goes out the exit door, and sameness sets in. Even the six Gingers
in frumpy blond wigs, part of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers
number, have the rhythmic bounce of the frug rather than a class
act.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony van Laast, once seen in the United States as a modern
dancer in London Contemporary Dance Theater, is now in show
business as a successful choreographer. As director and
choreographer of ``Burn the Floor'' he breaks free of ballroom
conventions and plunges the dancers into ensemble patterns that
have nothing to do with social-dance partnering.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an admirable attempt to extend the idioms of current
ballroom dancing into a spectator sport; if only it didn't
sometimes look like a bad television special. More wit, less woe
was needed in a Latin number: bikers in leather jackets engaged in
homemade flamenco amid cape-swirling as Jason Gilkison and Bojan
Fesel dueled over Peta Roby, wearing cute little bull's horns.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast in ``Urban Heat'' was decked out in chains,
slinking sexily to techno rock with a Latin beat or staying close
to the floor, all the better to climb out of an implied sewer. The
first two numbers, however, kept closer to set forms and were more
successful. ``Club Scene'' was high-voltage disco-derived dance.
``Fantasy Waltz,'' had the elegant Damon Sugden and Rebecca Walker
surrounded by masked couples with a theme of neo-romantic mystery
mercifully kept at a minimum. Best of all was the extended
jitterbug number in which the dancers could let loose. The title
said it all: ``Jump Jive and Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonita Bryg's sassy costumes, sometimes scanty, had a good
tongue-in-cheek Madonna touch, and touch was within reach as the
dancers occasionally gyrated in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Van Laast's lengthy list of associates include Gilkison
(artistic director and choreographer), Lindsey Hiller-Tate
(ballroom consultant and associate choreographer) and Nichola
Traherne (assistant director and assistant choreographer).

 This article was reported by DOUGLAS FRANTZ, RALPH BLUMENTHAL and
CAROL VOGEL and was written by Frantz.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors in the federal antitrust investigation of
Sotheby's and Christie's have evidence that a scheme to limit
competition by fixing commissions charged to buyers and sellers was
set in motion not by subordinates, but by the chairmen of the
world's auction giants at the time, according to people involved in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, A. Alfred Taubman of Sotheby's and Sir Anthony
Tennant of Christie's, discussed the arrangement in person and then
instructed their chief executives to meet to carry out the scheme,
according to the accounts from the people involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sotheby's and Taubman have acknowledged privately
that Taubman met with Tennant in the early to mid-1990s, but would
not specify more precisely when. But the lawyers contended that the
conversations were innocent and had nothing to do with a
conspiracy. Christie's lawyers and Tennant declined to comment, but
people involved in the case say he also maintains that the
conversations were innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   The information _ including memorandums describing aspects of
the arrangement _ was turned over to prosecutors several months ago
by lawyers for Christie's, who had obtained the material from
Christopher M. Davidge days after he resigned as Christie's chief
executive, according to people involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the case said that Diana D. Brooks, the
former chief executive of Sotheby's, has let prosecutors know that
with immunity she could support some of Davidge's assertions about
the scheme's origins and could say she met with him on instructions
from Taubman.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two houses _ Sotheby's, based in New York, and
Christie's, with headquarters in London _ control about 95 percent
of a $4 billion worldwide auction market. The allegation that a
conspiracy was devised at the very top of the venerable auction
houses raises the stakes in the investigation, which has already
roiled the world of art collectors. Until now attention had focused
on Davidge, who abruptly resigned from Christie's on Dec. 24, and
Brooks, who stepped down at Sotheby's on Feb. 21, the same day
Taubman resigned as Sotheby's chairman. He remains the majority
shareholder but gave up his seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Davidge acknowledged to prosecutors that he and Brooks met
secretly many times over three years in New York and London to work
out the details of the collusion and exchange information,
according to the people involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Davidge and Christie's have been granted conditional amnesty
from prosecution by the government for turning over evidence first.
Sotheby's and Brooks are engaged in a high-stakes battle to win
leniency from prosecutors, who are insisting that Brooks and
Taubman each plead guilty to a felony, which could leave them open
to prison terms and big fines, according to people involved in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged with wrongdoing, and prosecutors are
still evaluating the evidence provided by Davidge, who would have
something to gain by implicating higher ups, as would Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant has denied any involvement in the scheme and
characterized conversations he had with Taubman as innocent in
interviews with Christie's lawyers, according to one person
involved in the talks. A woman who answered the telephone Thursday
in his London office said he would have no comment on the
allegations, which were recounted to her.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman yesterday denied any wrongdoing and referred calls to
his lawyer, Scott W. Muller. `` Taubman has always acted openly and
aboveboard in everything he did related to Sotheby's,'' Muller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' lawyer, Stephen E. Kaufman, said he would have no
comment on the investigation. William Joseph Linklater, who
represents Davidge, also declined to comment, as did lawyers for
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Steven A. Reiss, a lawyer for Sotheby's, also would not comment.
``We haven't commented in three years, and we're not going to start
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into possible collusion within the secretive
auction world began three years ago, but it was thought to be
dormant until a few months ago. That is when the Justice
Department's antitrust office in New York received a cache of
memorandums and notes of meetings written by Davidge to Tennant as
well as a letter from Tennant to Davidge, according to those
involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with providing the documents, Christie's agreed to
cooperate with the federal investigation. In exchange for its help,
the company was granted a form of leniency called conditional
amnesty, with the provision that its cooperation be complete and
truthful. Christie's general counsel, Jo Backer Laird, disclosed
the cooperation agreement Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Under antitrust law, the first participant in a cartel to agree
to cooperate with the government can receive leniency, including
reduced fines and the likelihood that no criminal charges will be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disclosure that Christie's was cooperating, there have
been numerous civil suits against both houses from art buyers and
sellers and from Sotheby's shareholders. Christie's is privately
held.
</P>
<P>
   Published accounts have said that prosecutors were investigating
whether the houses cooperated in establishing identical commission
charges for buyers in 1992 and sellers in 1995. The houses
exchanged confidential lists of top-drawer customers who were not
to be charged a commission. There also have been accounts that
Davidge and Brooks met secretly several times to work out details
of the collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in recent days with people involved in the
investigation have provided new details of the case being built by
prosecutors, and they help to piece together a clearer picture of
the events leading up to the decision by Christie's to cooperate.
None of those interviewed would be identified because the
investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Davidge, 54, who started at Christie's as a summer employee at
the age of 16, has told prosecutors that he got involved in the
conspiracy on orders from his boss, Tennant, and that it began
shortly after Tennant met with Sotheby's Taubman, according to
those involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be learned what was said by Taubman and Tennant at
the meeting, and lawyers have argued that any conversations between
the men had nothing to do with a conspiracy. It is also unclear
when the two first met or how often they talked. Tennant did not
join Christie's as chairman until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant, a former chairman at Guinness PLC, was brought into
Christie's at a time when there were fears the auction house would
become the target of a hostile takeover. He remained chairman until
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman, 75, earned a fortune developing shopping malls in the
United States. He bought a majority stake in Sotheby's in 1983 and
has been credited with revamping the auction house by transforming
it into a retail enterprise with vastly expanded services. Though
he resigned as chairman in February at the urging of fellow board
members after word of the federal investigation broke, Taubman
remains the controlling shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 49, has a background in banking and worked closely with
Taubman after he promoted her to president of Sotheby's America in
1987 and then to worldwide chief executive in 1994. Until the
scandal broke earlier this year, she was widely regarded as the
most powerful woman in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win leniency, Brooks has contended that she
began meeting with Davidge on instructions from Taubman, according
to those involved in the inquiry. Brooks said that she reported
orally to Taubman on the the meetings and that to her knowledge no
one else at the company was aware of the collusion, according to
those involved in the inquiry. It is unknown whether anyone else at
Christie's was aware of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sotheby's have been trying to negotiate a settlement
with the Justice Department for several weeks. People familiar with
those talks said the government's antitrust lawyers in New York
have insisted that Taubman and Brooks plead guilty to at least one
felony each and that the auction house pay a huge fine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prosecutors want Sotheby's to admit that the
collusion began with a 1992 decision by both auction houses to set
identical commission structures for buyers, and continued with the
1995 agreement on sellers' commissions, according to those involved
in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, at a time when the art market was in the doldrums,
Sotheby's announced an increase in the commission paid by buyers at
auction. Seven weeks later Christie's followed with an identical
commission structure. In 1995 Christie's announced it was changing
the fee charged to sellers, and Sotheby's followed suit within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Taubman and Brooks were described as objecting
strenuously to any criminal charges, and the auction house is
resisting admitting that the anti-competitive action stretched back
to 1992. An admission of collusion in 1992 could significantly
expand the company's exposure to civil damage awards because there
are many more buyers than sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sotheby's have argued that the conspiracy could not
have stretched back to 1992 because Tennant did not join Christie's
until 1993, according to a lawyer familiar with the talks. But
prosecutors still suspect that the actions may have been linked.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence in the hands of prosecutors, according to
those familiar with the investigation, is the batch of documents
provided by Davidge. The documents are said to contain instructions
to him from Tennant regarding the collusion and detailed written
accounts by Davidge back to Tennant after his meetings with Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   According to those familiar with the investigation, Brooks
learned in January that Christie's lawyers had turned over
incriminating records to the Justice Department. Lawyers for Brooks
approached prosecutors with an offer to cooperate in exchange for
leniency.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were told by prosecutors that Christie's had
already reached an agreement, according to people involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She missed out by a week,'' said one of those involved in the
case. ``They beat her to the door.''

RIVAL TRAINER BLASTS BAFFERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Finally, one of the targets of leading
American thoroughbred trainer Bob Baffert's shotgun wit fired back
in public.
</P>
<P>
   It happened Thursday morning at the post-position draw ceremony
for Saturday's $1 million Santa Anita Derby. Baffert, trainer of
Captain Steve, sat at one end of the dais. Jenine Sahadi, trainer
of The Deputy, and Chris McCarron, that colt's jockey, sat at the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' Baffert said to McCarron, with no apparent
provocation, as reporters and horsemen listened, ``who's training
The Deputy, you or Jenine?''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi glared back at Baffert as McCarron answered a question
from ceremony emcee Kurt Hoover. Then, when Hoover asked Sahadi
what pre-race instructions she would give to McCarron, she looked
in Baffert's general direction and said: ``I won't give him
instructions. Thank God my horse has class, because there's a lot
of people who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi dropped the microphone on the table with a thud, got up
and exited stage right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Baffert said softly.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at her barn, Sahadi blasted Baffert, whose antics have
helped to make him horse racing's most distinctive personality as
he recorded Kentucky Derby victories with Silver Charm (1997) and
Real Quiet (1998) and three consecutive Eclipse Awards as the
nation's outstanding trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in sitting up there and getting degraded by
the guy,'' Sahadi said. ``He does that s--- all the time. He did it
with Sonny Hine. He's done it with everybody he's ever come in
contact with. I don't know why. I don't understand his mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he never knew (Hall of Fame trainer) Charlie
Whittingham. If he did, he'd have gone to his barn and learned how
to win with a little bit of class. . . . All I know is that as
successful as he's been, he will never be in the league with some
of these other guys. You just don't behave like that. What is he, 6
years old, for Christ's sake?''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had to apologize a few years ago after referring to
Hine, trainer of 1998 Horse of the Year Skip Away, as ``Elmer
Fudd'' because of the way he looked and talked. Baffert hadn't
realized that Hine's face was partially paralyzed by Bell's Palsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant to say he looks like Mr. Magoo,'' Baffert said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert often hogs the spotlight at press conferences and public
events, talking over others and accepting cell-phone calls at the
dais. Usually, everybody else sits there and puts up with it. This
time, Sahadi didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had hit a sore spot with Sahadi, the 37-year-old Los
Angeles native who took out her trainer's license in 1993, set a
national record for earnings by a woman trainer in 1995 and is the
only woman to saddle Breeders' Cup winners. Sahadi has faced
insinuations that she owes her success to her family, which is
prominent in California racing, to former boyfriend Julio Canani, a
Breeders' Cup-winning trainer, and to her husband, Ben Cecil, also
a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked a subject that is very sensitive to me, that I am so
sick of hearing about, I'm nauseous about it,'' Sahadi said. ``I
think I've tried to be OK with it for the last seven years, but it
gets to be a bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a perfectly great day and now it's completely ruined.
Because of one guy. Because he took the biggest shot he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought Baffert has it in for her, Sahadi said:
``He has it in for everybody. He has the biggest ego of anybody
I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi charged that reporters have ignored fellow horsemen's
complaints about Baffert's behavior: ``People have (criticized
him), but nobody's interested in hearing about it because he's got
all the best horses. He's ruling the roost right now. You don't
think half the backside doesn't think it, for Christ's sake?''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he was ``joking'' and complained, ``People have no
sense of humor around this place.'' He later told Brad Free of the
Daily Racing Form that Sahadi hates him ``because of Kramer''
(Baffert's nickname for his friend Canani).
</P>
<P>
   He isn't giving himself enough credit. Sahadi hates Baffert
because of Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   __ The draw: If any of the six 3-year-olds entered in the 1-mile
Santa Anita Derby was helped or hurt by the post-position draw, it
was the lone filly Surfside, who will start from the extreme
inside. She and jockey Pat Day will have to use her early speed to
establish position.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Surfside is the third consecutive filly to draw post 1
for the Santa Anita Derby. Sharp Cat led most of the race and
finished sixth behind Free House in 1997. Honest Lady stalked the
pace and finished seventh behind General Challenge in 1999. Neither
went on to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Although Surfside has won four races in a row, she will go back
on Lasix and will wear blinkers for the first time to help her
``focus,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: General Challenge, last year's Santa Anita Derby
winner, is assigned 123 pounds, 11 more than any of his opponents
in Sunday's San Bernardino Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the horses who chased General Challenge in the March 4
Santa Anita Handicap, Budroyale (second) and Cat Thief (sixth),
meet Sunday in Arkansas in the Oaklawn Handicap.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has not seen his son
Elian since the third week of November when the boy and his mother
departed Cuba on a small and rickety boat for a new life in the
United States, set foot on U.S. soil here Thursday and told a crowd
of reporters that ``I hope very soon to embrace my son.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped off a small chartered plane that brought him from
Havana, Gonzalez announced somberly that he had come with his new
wife and 6-month-old son to take Elian back to Cuba. ``This is
Elian's true family, and we love him very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they would move quickly to
transfer custody of the boy to his father. But they acknowledged
that it could take several days to accomplish that, depending on
the degree of resistance from the Miami relatives who have been
caring for Elian since he was rescued off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials expect to take a series of
steps over the next few days to obtain physical control of the boy,
who has been living with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   They raised the possibility that they would obtain a court order
demanding that Elian be taken to a federal building and surrendered
on a particular day next week; the Miami relatives could then face
criminal contempt charges if they failed to turn over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have been deeply reluctant to discuss what they
consider the worst of their options: sending U.S. marshals into the
home in Little Havana to get the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Thursday's activity in Miami and in Washington involved
efforts that ultimately failed to forge an agreement among the
government, the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez on how to
go about arranging a transfer. Gonzalez has told U.S, officials
that he is opposed to going to Miami to retrieve Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said talks with lawyers for the Miami
relatives broke down Thursday afternoon because the relatives were
unwilling even to discuss how to turn the boy over to authorities
and ultimately his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly disappointed that the attorneys for the Miami
relatives continue to insist on discussing whether to transfer
Elian instead of how to transfer him to his father,'' the Justice
Department said in a statement. ``We will now take steps to move
that process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a lawyer
for the Miami relatives, said talks had ended primarily because the
government declined to promise not to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will not guarantee that they will not try to
take Elian away in the middle of the night,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving early in the morning on a private jet chartered
by the United Council of Churches, Gonzalez read a prepared
statement before being whisked away to the Bethesda, Md., home of
Cuba's chief diplomat in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez plans to live there with his new wife, Nercy Carmenate
Castillo, a baby boy, Hianny, and Elian until the situation is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said they were waiving diplomatic immunity from
the residence in Maryland. They were doing so, they explained, to
prevent the Miami relatives from asserting that they were refusing
to surrender Elian on the grounds that he was going to a diplomatic
residence that was considered to be Cuban territory.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother died along with 10 others when their boat sank
during a Thanksgiving crossing from Cuba. Besides Elian, two other
people survived and have been granted asylum and are now living in
Florida, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement at Dulles International Airport in suburban
Virginia, Gonzalez said: ``Witnessing the disappearance of his
mother and miraculously surviving a shipwreck is more than enough
suffering for a 5-year-old. On top of this, he was put in the
temporary custody of some distant relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, he said he grieved for the 137
days he had been separated from his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am waiting very impatiently for my son to be returned to me
as soon as possible, and I would like to return to Cuba with him
immediately,'' he said in the statement that accused U.S.
politicians and much of Miami's Cuban community of exploiting the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an agonizing experience to see my son subjected to
cruel psychological pressures intended to influence his character,
already weakened by the terrible trauma he suffered,'' he said.
``Even worse, Elian has been put on display in public rallies and
by the media, with the intention of gaining political advantage
from this tragedy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez also thanked the majority of the U.S. people who he
said were overwhelmingly supportive of his being reunited with his
son. He spoke as a group of Cuban-American demonstrators who had
gathered at the airport shouted, in both Spanish and English,
``Welcome to Freedom,'' and urged him to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials who have been struggling to
resolve the stalemate expressed relief at Gonzalez's arrival. They
made it clear that they believed that his presence in the United
States had altered the situation dramatically in favor of their
efforts to transfer custody of the boy from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with a fundamentally different situation now
that Elian's father has come to the United States,'' Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters. ``We are in a position
to bring them together in a way that we could not even consider
yesterday, and I think we need to do that as quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an interview with CBS News, said
Gonzalez's arrival should be ``a big help'' in resolving the case.
Acknowledging the bitter feelings among many Cuban-Americans about
the Cuban president, Clinton said there were some in Florida who
``are just against anybody going back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think there are a lot of people who have genuine
questions about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his lawyer, Gregory Craig, are to meet on Friday
morning with Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, the
commissioner of immigration. It appeared that Gonzalez had agreed
with immigration officials that if he was given custody of his son,
he would not try to return home to Cuba until after a federal
appeals court had ruled on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gonzalez noted that he might have to remain in
the United States for two months. The court is to hear arguments on
the case during the week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the time he is expected to spend here, Gonzalez also
pleaded for the United States to approve visas for several other
Cubans, including classmates of Elian. So far the State Department
has granted visas only to three others besides Gonzalez, his wife
and child.
</P>
<P>
   One senior official said that while there was not as yet a firm
plan to take custody of Elian, the meeting between Gonzalez and
Reno would be followed by a letter revoking the Miami family's
custody.
</P>
<P>
   If the family still resists surrendering the boy, the official
said, the government may seek a court order to bolster its
standing. Eventually, the family would be ordered to take Elian to
a federal building or some other site outside of Little Havana, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in Miami were alarmed that in his statement,
Gonzalez described Fidel Castro as ``a friend or brother, advising
me, and supporting me during these days of pain and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said:
``Lazaro was almost in tears, because he felt that that is not his
nephew. He felt that was not the person he knows.''

EASING NATIONAL SECURITY RULES, ISRAEL IMPROVES ITS HUMAN RIGHTS
RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 1st graf to include `and Palestinians) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Justice Minister Yossi Beilin calls it a ``quiet
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Israel has earned a regular place on the
blacklists of many human and civil rights organizations by invoking
national security to explain practices that were considered
exclusionary, discriminatory and coercive toward Israeli Arabs and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But since Israel's right-wing government was replaced last
summer by a broad coalition including several leftists and human
rights advocates, crucial policy changes have been made that
together with a spate of High Court decisions, point toward a sea
change.
</P>
<P>
   The torture of Palestinian suspects has been banned. The
practice of stripping Palestinians of their residency rights in
East Jerusalem has all but ended. In a landmark ruling, the equal
right of Arabs to land allocated by the state has been affirmed.
And for the first time in Israel's history, land long considered
part of a Jewish town was taken away and returned to the Arab
village from which it was expropriated decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Palestinian administrative detainees, those
imprisoned without charges, has plummeted to 9 from 66 last April
and hundreds in previous years. On Wednesday, Israel released one
of 16 remaining Lebanese who are being held, in contravention of
international law, as ``bargaining chips'' for captured Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is almost a stealth liberalization process, an
incremental phenomenon rather than a declared program. Committed to
peace, Israel is dropping several policies that it justified by its
near perpetual state of armed conflict with its neighbors. As it
undergoes normalization, many say, Israel is slowly letting down
its guard, losing its fear and relinquishing a sense of itself as a
special nation living under such special circumstances that it
cannot be judged by the norms applied to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``During war, democracy can be more restricted,'' said Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident and human
rights champion. ``But we are not at war. We are engaged in a peace
process, and we are trying to live a more normal life. That means
dealing with questions we have avoided answering for years. That
means removing inequality in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of normalization is incremental, and it involves the
shedding of deep-seated anxieties and ingrained habits. Some
Israeli Arab lawmakers, critics of Israel's settlement policies and
Palestinian leaders say that Israel still has a long way to go.
They point to continued abuses by border police officers, to the
continued expropriation of Arab land, to habitual discrimination in
education, employment and housing.
</P>
<P>
   But Beilin, who like Sharansky is a leading catalyst of the
change, said the process was an evolution. He is working to
eliminate the underlying legal justification for Israel's
self-definition as a special-case society.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry is preparing the groundwork to end by this
summer a 52-year-old legal state of emergency, which has given the
Israeli cabinet the power to supersede the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said he thinks that it has taken Israelis many years to
internalize the peace process. ``And then it began to happen,'' he
said. ``And we said to ourselves, `We are approaching peace, and we
still have a legal system that acts as if it were in a state of
war. And it justifies things that are no longer, if they ever were,
justifiable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli Arab leaders say mainstream Israelis see as
groundbreaking some events that appear to them to be token or
trivial _ like the recent employment of four Arab flight attendants
by El Al, or the crowning last year of the first Arab woman as Miss
Israel. Enough rage is still bubbling in their communities to have
fueled a strident Land Day protest last week, after which an
elderly woman died and her fellow villagers instantly asserted _
despite the hospital's denial _ that her death was caused by
exposure to the Israeli troops' tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   But other changes, even unofficial ones, are undeniably
fundamental, changes that reflect a relaxation of Israel's
eternally security-conscious attitudes toward territory and the use
of force.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of illegal homes of Arabs in East Jerusalem and
the West Bank, for instance, has declined sharply since Prime
Minister Ehud Barak took office in July, according to statistics
kept by the Btselem human rights organization. In East Jerusalem,
all the demolitions since November were done by the municipality,
which is run by a right-wing mayor, and none by the national
government, which also has the authority.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an official policy change, which could provoke
intense political debate, but a quiet change in practice _ like a
recent freeze in the authorization of new settlement construction
and in the paving of ``bypass roads'' that connect settlements to
Israel, circumventing Palestinian towns. Settler leaders say none
of the 60 or 70 construction permits requested recently were
authorized, although construction authorized by Benjamin Netanyahu
when he was prime minister has not been frozen, infuriating the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation began under Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated prime
minister, and went into abeyance during the anti-liberal tenure of
Netanyahu, experts say. It began picking up steam again when the
election of Prime Minister Barak, who reinvigorated the peace
effort, emboldened the High Court and even politicians who served
in the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the High Court stunned Israel by handing down a
decision to outlaw brutal methods used by Israeli security agents
during the interrogation of Palestinian suspects. Since then,
Amnesty International experts say, while there are reports of
isolated cases and some evidence that the use of solitary
confinement has increased, the systematic use of torture has indeed
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, in the ensuing political debate, when right-wing
lawmakers proposed circumventing the court with legislation
permitting the use of torture, several centrist legislators
publicly revealed a new sensitivity to Israel's image. Ophir
Pines-Paz, who heads the One Israel faction, brought to the
Parliament floor a briefcase filled with letters from around the
world urging Israel not to ``go backward.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the High Court is supposedly above the political fray, its
rulings, and the timing of their release, appear to be affected by
the political climate, many say. Legal experts think the court had
sidestepped an overarching ruling on the torture issue for years.
Chief Justice Aharon Barak had written in 1997 that it was a
``grave mistake'' to view human rights issues in times of war and
emergency as similar to those in times of peace. That was the
prevailing attitude of the court for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the torture decision revealed a fundamental
evolution of Israel from ``a defense state to a much more open and
internally dynamic society,'' as Yaron Ezrahi, a political
scientist, said. ``The Israeli society,'' he continued, ``is in a
process of demobilization, reflecting its sense of security,
militarily and economically. The fact that it is willing to give up
its practice of using these torture methods indicates that security
is no longer invoked as the be all and the end all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased, of course. Several right-wing lawmakers
think that such thinking is just denial, and that recent court
decisions and new policies will be self-defeating for Israel.
``Israel is still fighting for its very existence as a state and
for the very existence of its people against the possibility of a
new Jewish holocaust,'' said Yuval Steinitz, a lawmaker from the
opposition Likud Party. ``If anyone here thinks different, he
deludes himself.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers oppose Beilin's move to end the state of
emergency for that reason _ because the state of emergency, they
say, is a chronic one.
</P>
<P>
   But Beilin, supported by many others here, disagrees, arguing
that ``we shouldn't be screaming `fire' every day.'' In the case of
a genuine emergency, the government always retains the power to
declare one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A panoply of laws, from those regulating the permitted uses of
baking powder to those permitting administrative detention, are
technically emergency provisions. Striking workers are ordered back
to work, as happened with lifeguards last year, under a legal
mechanism designed for quick governmental response during actual
war. When tens of thousands of Russian immigrants poured into
Israel, the government used the emergency regulations to circumvent
planning boards and building procedures and slap up inexpensive and
often shoddily constructed housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about being a real democracy, this is a
basic flaw in the structure,'' said Anat Scolnicov, a civil rights
lawyer. ``The executive branch has the constant power to overtake
and overturn the legislative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're running a country on the premise that, technically,
anything goes.''

   Other recent decisions, or new practices, show that security is
not the sacred cow it once was here. In the last few years, the
identity of the security chiefs, always top secret, has become
public, and the recent process of nominating a new General Security
Services director was even publicly debated. The Justice Ministry
is seeking to create open government oversight of security agency's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Several army decisions, formerly sacrosanct, have been
overturned by the courts and the government in the last few months.
Facing unrelenting pressure from environmentalists, Prime Minister
Barak, who is also the defense minister, recently overrode an army
plan to build a base in the Shaked Forest. It was the first time
that a popular revolt interfered with the army's construction
plans. And the High Court recently ordered the army to return some
Palestinian cave dwellers to their homes; they had been evicted
from what was termed a firing range, even though it was not in use.
</P>
<P>
   After the High Court decision on torture, the ground shifted
again when, despite right-wing protests, Israeli Arab lawmakers
were appointed to security-sensitive government positions. Then
Sharansky halted the Israeli practice of stripping Palestinians in
East Jerusalem of their residency if they had moved the center of
their life elsewhere for seven years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that the phenomenon, which human rights group
had called a ``silent deportation'' and Palestinians considered
``ethnic cleansing,'' has essentially ended. Fifty-five
Palestinians lost their residency rights last June, the month
before Prime Minister Barak took office, and only three in
December, the last month for which statistics are available.
Additionally, Sharansky recently decided to make his policy
retroactive and return residency rights to some of the thousands
who lost them.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky has surprised many here, because he is a hard-liner on
the peace effort. But he explains his positions as consistent. He
does not trust peacemaking with undemocratic partners who do not
respect human rights, he said, and he is determined to raise
Israel's standards of democracy as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical decision, Sharansky returned to Kfar Kassem,
an Arab village, some land that had been confiscated ``for security
reasons'' in the 1950s. This involved taking the land, which is
zoned for an industrial park, away from the Jewish town of Rosh
Ha'ayin.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, in addition to being the first of its kind,
reverberated here because of the history of the village. Israeli
border guards massacred 49 Arab villagers in Kfar Kassem in 1956,
and this year, for the first time, in another sign of the changes,
the massacre is included in the Israeli history curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here see it as an anti-Zionist move,'' Sharansky
said. ``I think we can no longer justify those lands being
confiscated for security reasons. It's a rather safe area. And this
village deserves an industrial park, the jobs and the tax benefits,
as much as Rosh Ha'ayin. If you want to have a stable, normal,
democratic Zionist society, you have to give minimal rights, at the
least.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a watershed legal decision, the High Court ruled
that a Jewish community on state land may not exclude Arab
residents. Speaking to the heart of Israel's complicated definition
as a Jewish, democratic state, the court said the country's
identity as a refuge for Jews cannot be used as a basis for
discriminating against any of its citizens. It cited the the U.S.
Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation
decision, saying separate but equal is a policy that inherently
hurts the minority.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dan Yakir, legal adviser to the Association for Civil Rights in
Israel, said that in an informal hearing two years ago, Chief
Justice Barak fretted about the ``unforeseen ramifications'' of a
such a decision. The justice urged the parties to settle the matter
among themselves, to find a way to allow the plaintiffs, an Arab
family, to moved into the Jewish community of Katzir.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Yakir said, the judge added, ``Imagine if
Brown vs. the Board of Ed had been solved by mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mediation failed, and with one of the justices presiding in
the case slated to retire this spring, the court was forced to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the change of government eased the way for such a
decision, because it was clear that at least the government would
not attack the court,'' Yakir said. ``Also, that the change in
government reflected a growing tolerance in society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another change in government, back to the right, could once
again slow the process. Or, in the volatile Middle East, anything
that once again raises the anxiety level in Israel _ a spate of
fatal terrorism or a border war _ could retard it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But most here, both those opposed and supportive, think that
there is a kind of inexorable evolution taking place, a willful, if
in some cases tentative, hike toward normalization.

 SPORTS COLUMN: McENROE EXPECTS NO SURPRISES AGAINST CZECH By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There were no heads of state surrounded by
armed guards here Thursday at the Davis Cup draw, only the
presidents of various tennis federations. Following the
African-inspired first-round intrigue in Zimbabwe two months ago,
it's back to more basic cup business, a conventional competition
that is likely to be as inspiring as a Lakers home date against the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, John McEnroe watched his share of blowouts
from a courtside seat in the Great Western Forum. He'll have the
same view Friday of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, tennis' Magic
and Kareem, when they face the Czech Republic's Jiri Novak and
Slava Dosedel in the opening singles of the cup quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird things happen in Davis Cup,'' McEnroe said. ``That said,
I expect to win every match. If I start seeing naked guys dancing,
I'll start worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendly fans in Zimbabwe, where Chris Woodruff saved
McEnroe's captain's debut in the decisive singles match in early
February, were far more clothed than the Laker Girls, who have
gyrated downtown to the new Staples Center. McEnroe's point,
embellished as usual, was that he's expecting the weekend to be
devoid of surprises, as scripted as a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad after Zimbabwe, the rousing start to McEnroe's
mission to raise the visibility of Davis Cup here in the States.
Once Sampras returned to co-star with Agassi, there was one chance
for McEnroe to make this weekend more than a basic show of American
might. He could have put himself into Saturday's doubles match,
done what we all know he's dying to do.
</P>
<P>
   By the next round, a semifinal at either Russia or Spain, it
would be too risky, too late. Here, the moon and the stars and the
surface were perfectly aligned _ Sampras and Agassi on board, at
home, on the fast carpet, against a country that will be fortunate
to win one match.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe could have made Friday a happening, the promotional meat
sandwiched between what are likely to be short-work singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how good that would be for team morale,'' said
McEnroe, fighting off his natural impulses with his newly developed
establishment bearings.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone with Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer, the world's No.
1 doubles team, McEnroe said the scenario he had envisioned would
be for him to play with Sampras or Agassi. ``But that would mean
one of them would have to play all three days,'' he said. ``And to
have them believe deep in their hearts that I'm the best player to
play with.''
</P>
<P>
   At 41, he can't possibly be, though in his prime McEnroe was
considered the best doubles player ever, he remains active and in
shape and, as he said, ``You only have half the court to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger and more relevant issue is that Davis Cup is not
about computer points and rankings, and McEnroe became captain
primarily to stir up interest in an event that had practically
fallen off the American sports landscape. ``It's a difficult sell
here in America,'' Agassi admitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a celebrity who is transcendent of his low-rated sport,
McEnroe has been a one-man marketing tour, turning up in the seats
opposite, among others, Jay Leno and Katie Couric. There is always
a window of opportunity for these gabfests, though. Sooner or
later, the angle and material wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe also knows better than anyone that Agassi and Sampras
aren't going to play Davis Cup forever, maybe not even beyond this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras nursed a muscle pull sustained at the Australian
Open, Agassi carried the United States in Zimbabwe, exhausting and
dehydrating himself in the high elevation of Harare. By the end, he
was vomiting into a bucket, and staggering off to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-six hours later, I landed back home and probably felt
worse,'' he said. ``I didn't feel better until two weeks later,
when I was able to hit the ball and move around. It was too long to
go without tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on tour, Agassi paid for his patriotism. He hasn't won a
tournament since Australia and even got blitzed a couple of times
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has recovered, and his recently turned ankle feels
better, too. With Sampras making this trip all the way from his
home in the far Los Angeles suburbs, the story line here is that
McEnroe has the first- and second-ranked players in the world,
along with the No. 1 doubles team. The Czech coach, Jan Kukal,
called the Americans ``the best team ever because Agassi and
Sampras are not only No. 1 and No. 2 but I think they are the best
players that ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe returned the compliment, calling the Czech players
dangerous because they often seem ``lazy, appearing not to give 100
percent.'' Not that we root for McEnroe tantrums, but he may not
even have to get out of his seat this weekend, except to applaud,
the way he used to for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, someone said, Sampras would lose his cool and do some
screaming at the umpire and linesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm real worried about that happening,'' McEnroe said.
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried about anything, and he's not playing either.
Too bad. Kobe and Shaq could have sat courtside for him.

EXCERPTS FROM REMARKS BY ELIAN'S FATHER
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBAN-BOY, CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI, CUBAN-BOY-ENVOY) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the remarks of Juan Miguel Gonzalez
after he arrived Thursday at Dulles International Airport outside
Washington, as translated from the Spanish by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I hope very soon to embrace my son, Elian Gonzalez Brotons, for
the first time in more than four months. My wife and 6-month-old
son are here with me. This is Elian's real family, and we love him
very much.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 137 days, I have been cruelly and unjustly
separated from my son. Never has he needed his father and family,
his friends and school more than during this period of anguish that
began on Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing the disappearance of his mother and miraculously
surviving a shipwreck is more than enough suffering for a
5-year-old. On top of this, he was put in the temporary custody of
some distant relatives
</P>
<P>
   I requested immediately that the American authorities return my
son. It was not until Jan. 5 that the immigration service, in
compliance with international law, recognized the unquestionable
principle of parental rights and, as is customary practice in these
cases, said that the child should return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this decision was not and has never been carried
out, but instead has given way to an interminable and confusing
judicial process. Finally, on March 21, the federal court of the
United States came out in favor of what never should have been put
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an agonizing experience to see my son subjected to
cruel psychological pressures intended to influence his character,
already weakened by the terrible trauma he suffered. Even worse,
Elian has been put on display in public rallies and by the media,
with the intention of gaining political advantage. ...
</P>
<P>
   The telephone calls that I make daily to him from Cuba are
frequently blocked, and when communication is established, I can
clearly hear my child being harassed by adults.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know who the medical doctors and psychologists are that
have been treating my son, nor the treatment or medications that he
is receiving. ...
</P>
<P>
   I am waiting very impatiently for my son to be returned to me as
soon as possible, and I would like to return to Cuba with him
immediately. I have been told that I might have to wait up to two
more months ...
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this new and unjust delay, I have asked the
government of the United States to allow me get help in caring for
my son by bringing here a small group of Elian's classmates, some
professionals _ a teacher, medical doctor, psychologist _ who have
followed this situation minute by minute, and a leader from my
country who has been by my side like a friend or brother, advising
me ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite what I have experienced and suffered since Nov. 22, I am
still confident that the authorities of the United States will not
allow any more harm to come to my son and family, and I ask that
they understand why I should be joined by the children and the
people identified above.

 &HT;    Unfamiliarity breeds early lead for Paulson
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If the goal was to open the leaderboard to more
players and stir up Augusta National with more rough and pinched
fairways, then it's mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   After one windblown, wild round at the 64th Masters, where you
can't tell the old sightlines without a guide dog, here's where
things stand:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dennis Paulson, 37, a former long-driving champion who had
never seen the course in its former set-up and has yet to win a PGA
Tour event, leads by a stroke over Tom Lehman with a 4-under-par
68.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiger Woods, after his highest round of the year (75) and his
first triple-bogey since November, has temporarily stumbled as the
odds-on favorite. Woods, 24, who is seven shots back, trails Jack
Nicklaus, 60, by one stroke and is a shot ahead of 64-year-old Gary
Player and three better than 70-year-old Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sergio Garcia, 20, who never broke par in four rounds last
year as an amateur, is two shots back after a 70.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Stricker, who has tied for 38th and missed two cuts at
the Masters, also opened with a 70.
</P>
<P>
   But when the winds gust near 20 mph, as they did Thursday,
things turn funky at Augusta National. Fortunately, for the field,
the greens were abnormally soft and not quite as swift. Even so, 12
rounds in the 80s _ including such notables as Greg Norman, John
Daly and Corey Pavin _ and a stroke average of 75.579 were
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, whose last victory was the 1998 Nike Huntsville Open,
eagled the third hole and double-bogeyed 11, then righted himself
toward the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe lack of knowledge is better, not knowing how hard this
course can be when the wind is really blowing,'' Paulson said.
``There's no question it was moving and bouncing around, and the
way the trees are set up there, it really messes with your head.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the winds that blew two years ago for two days,
Stewart Cink (75) called this a mere ``zephyr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was tricky,'' Cink said, ``but the course was about
as easy as I've ever seen it. The greens were softer than I'd seen
them in years and not as fast as they usually are.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman seemed ready to spend the night with the first-day lead,
but double-bogeyed the 18th, starting the disaster with a drive
into the trees. He hit a large oak trying to find an opening,
eventually found the green and three-putted from 45 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the round,'' said Lehman, who finished
second to Jose Maria Olazabal in 1994 after holding the 54-hole
lead. ``It was a tremendous score under the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods never made any noise on the leaderboard. He had bogeys at
4 and 5, followed by birdies at 6 and 8, then went downhill. He
bogeyed the 10th, then took 6 on the par-3 12. His 8-iron from 135
yards got caught in the wind and spun back into the water. He
pitched onto the green 12 feet past the hole, ran it 3 feet past
and missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the more difficult days I've seen
here,'' Woods said. ``The wind is swirling and blowing and gusting.
... It was hard out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones, the 1996 U.S. Open champion, got to 5-under,
bogeyed the 11th, then underclubbed at the 12th (9-iron) and rinsed
a ball en route to a double-bogey. Jones (71) was nearly flawless
earlier with five birdies and a bogey on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My round was a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 71 are Rocco Mediate, who double-bogeyed the 13th with a
hooked tee shot lost in the azaleas; BellSouth Classic champion
Phil Mickelson, Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and two-time champion
Bernhard Langer of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting a lot of the same shots I hit last week,''
Mickelson said. ``I drove it well last week and I drove it well
today.'' Defending champion Olazabal opened with a 72 and is tied
for 10th in a group that includes 1997 British Open champion Justin
Leonard, three-time champion Nick Faldo of England and
Gainesville's Tommy Aaron, the 1973 champion. David Duval is tied
for 22nd with a 73, a stroke better than Nick Price and two better
than Sea Island's Davis Love III.

LEE PETTY, 86, RACING FAMILY PATRIARCH, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Petty, a champion stock car racer in the 1950s who was the
father of the sport's greatest driver, Richard Petty, died
Wednesday in Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. Petty, who was
86, had been hospitalized for several weeks after surgery for a
stomach aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty was the trunk of what may have been the
broadest-spreading family tree in American professional sports. His
death came three days after his great-grandson Adam became the
fourth generation of Pettys to compete on stock car racing's top
circuit, the Winston Cup tour.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty grew up on a farm in Level Cross, N.C., during the
Depression and later worked as a mechanic. He started racing
professionally on June 19, 1949, driving a borrowed car, a 1946
Buick Roadmaster, to a 17th-place finish in a race in Charlotte,
N.C. He lost control and flipped the car several times.
</P>
<P>
   He was 35, relatively old to take up racing, but like any really
fast driver, he quickly made up for lost time. He won 54 races on
the Nascar Grand National circuit (what is now known as the Winston
Cup tour) and was a three-time national champion. Petty also won
the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959, in a finish so close that it
took three days to find a photograph proving that he had won.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lee Petty did not receive as much recognition as he was
due, he deserved a fair measure of the blame himself. If he hadn't
raised his son Richard to be such a fine racer, the younger Petty
would never have won 200 races and seven national championships,
both records.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Richard's first victory was delayed when another
driver protested Petty's apparent victory at a North Carolina dirt
track. The race officials sided with the aggrieved driver _ who
happened to be Richard's father _ and awarded him the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have protested even if it was my mother,'' Lee Petty
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Richard Petty had learned a lesson about his father's
competitiveness that day, he also had already learned much from him
about the workings of a race car. Lee Petty, who was voted the
mechanic of the year in 1950 by journalists, did much of the work
on his cars with some help from his sons, Richard and Maurice, his
only children. The three were the core of Petty Enterprises, a
racing team still active on the Winston Cup tour. One of its two
drivers, Kyle Petty _ a winner of eight Winston Cup races _ is
Richard's son and Adam's father.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises operates today from the same location it
always has, next to a modest white frame house in Level Cross where
Richard and Maurice grew up and where Lee Petty lived until his
death with his wife, Elizabeth Toomes Petty. All three survive,
along with 9 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren, and a brother,
Julian.
</P>
<P>
   It was far away from the quiet farm country around Level Cross _
at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla. _ that Lee
Petty reached the apex, as well as the end, of his driving career.
</P>
<P>
   The track opened with the first Daytona 500 on Feb. 22, 1959. As
Petty's Oldsmobile roared to the finish line of the 500-mile race,
the Thunderbird of Johnny Beauchamp pulled alongside; the two cars
seemed to cross the line simultaneously. Reporters on hand
unanimously gave the victory to Petty, but the race officials, led
by William H.G. France, the head of Nascar and owner of the track,
declared Beauchamp the winner. Petty waited three days as France
studied pictures taken by news photographers and fans. Finally, Lee
Petty was ruled the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty said he believed France purposely miscalled
Beauchamp the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``France was a shrewd promoter,'' Richard Petty said. ``He knew
if he created a big controversy, people would talk about his new
speedway for a long time and boost business.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Lee Petty's career would effectively end at
Daytona. On Feb. 24, 1961, during a 100-mile qualifying race, his
Plymouth hurtled over the guard rail at the fourth turn and soared
more than 100 feet through the air before crashing in the parking
lot. Petty's lung was punctured and one leg was badly broken. He
was in the hospital well into June and had two operations on his
left leg. He drove in six races over the next three years before
retiring in 1964 to devote his time to running the team.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Baker, a Nascar champion who once drove for Petty
Enterprises, recalled Lee Petty as a no-nonsense boss. ``He told
you the way things were,'' Baker said, ``and that's the way they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Petty's grandson Kyle once quit driving for him because he
could not cope with his hardheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee Petty drove in an era when drivers were expected to
celebrate as hard as they banged fenders, he preferred to pack up

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Army's top leaders appointed him deputy
inspector general, the personnel file of the general accused of
sexual harassment by the service's highest-ranking woman included
no indication that she had ever complained about his behavior,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has frozen the appointment of the accused officer, Maj.
Gen. Larry Smith, while its inspector general investigates the
charge, by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, that he made an unwanted
sexual advance in her Pentagon office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed her formal complaint only after the Army announced
Smith's appointment last August. But officials familiar with the
investigation said she had complained informally to superiors at
the time the incident is said to have occurred, and believed then
that Smith had been reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   Had an official record of some kind of discipline been placed in
Smith's file, the officials said, the secretary of the Army, Louis
Caldera, and the chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, would not have
approved the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all the elements apparent in his record, there was no
hint of this,'' a senior Pentagon official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Caldera and Shinseki have declined to comment on either the
investigation of Smith or his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure in published reports Thursday that Smith was the
officer against whom Kennedy had filed a complaint and that he had
been appointed to the inspector general's office, which is
responsible for investigating wrongdoing by senior officers, has
created a new embarrassment for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Now the service will soon be faced with a choice of dismissing
her complaint as unfounded or again punishing a senior officer. The
Army's inspector general is said to be winding down the
investigation, overseen by the Pentagon's inspector general, and
could issue a recommendation to the Army's vice chief of staff,
Gen. John Keane, within the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Army official said Thursday that even if the charge was
deemed to be unfounded, it was unlikely that the service would go
ahead with Smith's appointment as deputy inspector general, because
of the highly charged nature of the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be the right thing to do,'' the official said.
``The prudent thing to do would be to find another candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's appointment has prompted questions on Capitol Hill about
whether the Army tolerates sexual harassment and how it handles
misconduct complaints, especially against senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., called for a congressional
investigation of the Army's handling of this and other harassment
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, a R-Maine, who serves on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said it was important for the Army to
demonstrate its commitment to what Pentagon officials maintain is
``zero tolerance'' of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their response, how they handle it,'' Snowe said of Kennedy's
complaint, ``clearly will give us an assessment of whether or not
they're responding to the zero tolerance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, who has filed for retirement in August, also came
under attack, for having filed a formal complaint only last year,
after Smith's appointment, rather than at the time the incident is
alleged to have occurred, some three years earlier. Rep. Steve
Buyer, R-Ind., questioned her motives in filing a complaint so
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they've resolved this, then she's retiring, he's
promoted, and she's not satisfied anymore,'' said Buyer, chairman
of the House Armed Services subcommittee on military personnel.
``It appears to make her look vindictive. It doesn't put her in the
best light. There's something that just doesn't seem right about
her allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's actions immediately after the 1996 encounter she
alleges have become a focus of the inspector general's
investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to those officials, Kennedy chose not to file a formal
complaint against Smith then but instead raised the matter with
superiors, who evidently assured her that it would be dealt with.
The identity of those superiors is not publicly known, however, and
one top Army official said Thursday that it was unclear how senior
were the officers to whom she brought her concerns. The officers
who were then Army chief of staff and vice chief of staff have both
said she did not bring the issue to their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kennedy and Smith have declined to discuss the accusation.
So have Army officials, for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders have considerable discretion in how they deal with
those accused of wrongdoing. In instances not involving
courts-martial, punishment can range from an oral admonishment to a
letter of reprimand that is not put in the accused's personnel file
to a letter that becomes a matter of record.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the officials said, there is no evidence that a
record was made of Kennedy's informal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Kennedy said she had never intended for even her
formal accusation to touch off a public maelstrom, but had simply
wanted to oppose Smith's appointment to so sensitive a position.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Foote, a retired Army brigadier general who served with
Kennedy on a committee that in 1997 investigated sexual harassment
in the military, said, ``I sincerely believe General Kennedy wanted
to handle this in the general officers' channels and not make it a
great harangue, or an embarrassment for the Army.''

MYSTICAL AUGUSTA WINDS WREAK HAVOC WITH FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The wind was unpredictable, the conditions were
unnerving and the leader was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round of the 2000 Masters made everyone pay a price,
with no one in the 95-player field enjoying a bogey-free day. Only
9 of the 95 players finished under par. Tiger Woods had his worst
round of the year, a three-over-par 75 that included his first
triple-bogey since November. Craig Stadler had a quadruple-bogey 9
at No. 15, dumping two balls into the water that knocked him off
the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dennis Paulson, who shot 68 to lead by one stroke, had a
double-bogey at No. 11. Players could forget shooting 65 Thursday.
With the lethal combination of fast greens, tricky winds and
narrower fairways at Augusta National Golf Club this year, many
players took a beating, particularly on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Paulson led by one stroke over Tom Lehman (69)
and by two strokes over Sergio Garcia (70) and Steve Stricker (70).
Six players were tied for fifth place at 71: Steve Jones, Bernhard
Langer, Hal Sutton, Thomas Bjorn, Rocco Mediate and Phil Mickelson.
However, with three rounds remaining _ and potential trouble on
every hole _ the leaders understood the situation. Some interesting
things had happened. But the excitement was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   How did Paulson, a Masters rookie, manage to cope better than
anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe lack of knowledge is better, not knowing how difficult
this course can be when the wind is really blowing,'' said Paulson,
who had a breakthrough year in 1999, finishing second at both the
Buick Classic and the Bell Canadian Open and 27th on the PGA Tour
money list with $1.31 million. ``Sometimes it's better playing
courses with less knowledge, because you'll do things not realizing
how difficult a shot is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paulson had no illusion that it would be easy to stay on
top. ``It's too early to worry about it,'' Paulson said. ``Let me
have the lead on the back nine Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that position, Paulson, who has yet to win a PGA Tour
event, will have to ignore history. No first-round leader has won
the Masters since Ben Crenshaw in 1984, and no Masters rookie has
won since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, a 37-year-old native of San Gabriel, Calif., spent
years shuttling between mini-tours and the Asian Tour. He
contemplated quitting the game before he reached the Nike Tour in
1997, then made the PGA Tour last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, one of Paulson's bigger claims to fame was
winning the National Long Driving Championship in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was back when I weighed 175 and could bench 300,'' he
said. ``Now I weigh 300 and bench 175.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paulson fits the long-hitting profile of many players who
have done well at Augusta. And Thursday, he did a lot of things
well. After making a nervous bogey at No. 1, Paulson jump-started
his day with an eagle at the par-5 No. 2. Paulson then gained
control of his emotions, making birdies at No. 7, No. 8 and No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his second shot into the water at No. 11, leading to his
double-bogey, the regrouped to make birdies on No. 13 and No. 14 to
reach four under again. Then he made par on the final four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday would be another test. But Thursday, Paulson passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the first-round lead is something I'll always be able
to say,'' Paulson said. ``But unless I play well the next three
days, who's going to care?''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was even more solid than Paulson, but after no bogeys
through 17 holes, Lehman double-bogeyed No. 18 to lose the lead.
With birdies at No. 1, No. 2, No. 7, No. 8 and No. 16, Lehman
reached No. 18 at five under par. But his final tee shot went well
right into the trees, hitting a trunk and bounding even farther
right under the trees. He was forced to punch out from under the
trees. Then, after reaching the green, he missed a six-foot putt
that would have saved his bogey.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the way Lehman wanted to end the day. But with a
victory already this year at the Phoenix Open, Lehman is playing
his most consistent golf since 1996, when he won the British Open
and was the PGA Tour's player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let one blip on the radar screen bother me,''
Lehman said of his double-bogey. ``I feel good about the round. It
was a tremendous score under the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   How confusing was the wind? Mickelson, who played with Lee
Westwood (77) and Lee Janzen (76), described this scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing on the green watching Lee putt, and his pants
just started bristling back and forth from the wind,'' Mickelson
said. ``I'm standing 15 feet away and I didn't feel a thing. The
wind is howling five yards away from me and I didn't feel a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of mystical wind we have here at Augusta
National. It created angst for players. When shots were in the air,
many players held their breath, watching nervously to see what
would happen. Jones was cruising along at five under par until he
reached the par-four 11th, the start of the famous three-hole
stretch known as Amen Corner. He bogeyed No. 11, when he failed to
get up and down from right of the green, then his tee shot at the
par-three No. 12 was hit by a gust of wind and plopped into Rae's
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   After Jones finally made a 15-foot putt at No. 12 to save
double-bogey, he looked toward the sky in thanks. He was not the
first player to look toward heaven at Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some well-struck shots are being rewarded, but poor shots are
double-bogeys or even worse,'' Mickelson said. ``I thought it was a
fair test. But very difficult.''

<P>
   PARIS _ It seems that ABC may be shamed out of airing Leonardo
DiCaprio's interview with President Clinton on global warming,
apparently because it didn't live up to some notional idea of what
an interview with the president should be. ``We did not send him to
interview the president,'' David Westin, the president of ABC News,
said of DiCaprio in a press release. ``No one is that stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, a decision not to air it might seem like a
triumph of journalistic ethics. But I think it's at least worth
asking if it's not a triumph of the idea that politics should be
dull.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that the journalism police are so upset with the idea
of a movie star interviewing a politician? The real question isn't
whether it violates some abstract notion of journalistic propriety
but whether it serves the public interest. Look around at politics
today. More than half of Americans are not sufficiently engaged
that they bother to vote. Clearly, the problem is not that politics
is too entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Do the journalists who are lamenting the breakdown of news and
entertainment really worry that viewers will not know the
difference between an actor with softball questions and a
professional journalist with hardball ones? Does anyone really
think the audience is going to mistake Leonardo DiCaprio for Wolf
Blitzer?
</P>
<P>
   Not only is interest in politics tepid, but the public's opinion
of journalists is also at an all-time low. Perhaps it's because
viewers are weary of being condescended to. Why can't we just admit
that politics exists alongside other cultural forces, like movies,
music and sports? For instance, few watched the presidential
debates in 1996, because the World Series was on TV at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting to keep the distinction between news and entertainment
is, after all, pretty self-serving for journalists. Cable TV and
the Internet have encroached on the turf of network reporters; they
don't need Hollywood getting in on the act, too. It's like any
cartel in action: the star of ``Titanic'' is as welcome here as a
new oil producer would be in OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth pointing out that journalists seem concerned
about only one side of the wall between journalism and
entertainment. You don't see many turning down offers to appear in
Hollywood movies. (Nor do you hear Leonardo DiCaprio complaining
that journalists have no business being in movies.)
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the deeper concern isn't that DiCaprio would
flop as a presidential interviewer, but that he'd succeed all too
well. (After all, his failure would only buttress the case of his
critics.) The real threat is that he might get something
interesting, that the president would respond differently to an
interviewer for whom he did not feel profound contempt. Maybe we'd
learn something new _ even if it wasn't about Clinton's 73-point
plan to save the environment. And that would be a disaster for the
journalism cartel.
</P>
<P>
   I first interviewed Bill Clinton in 1992 when I was a
24-year-old reporter for MTV. I got many strange looks and several
shoves out of the way before getting an audience with
then-candidate Clinton. Our conversation was quite different than
the one he would have had with Sam Donaldson. Our coverage did not
replace the traditional election reporting, nor was that our goal.
</P>
<P>
   But I think we helped show young voters something about Clinton
that otherwise they might not have seen, and a dialogue between
political leaders and a younger generation began. It wasn't all
frivolous _ we talked a lot about the earned income tax credit, for
heaven's sake _ but some of it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxers or briefs?'' was a question an MTV audience member
asked the president in our town hall forum in 1994. Of course, Sam
Donaldson would never have asked that question. But viewers,
witnessing Clinton's ability to roll with the punches, to take the
question in the joking spirit it was asked, learned a lot more
about their president than his choice in underwear.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, getting anything fresh out of a
politician's mouth is a victory for journalism and for voters.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOLF'S BIG 3 TOGETHER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ From tee to green for all 18 holes, the applause
of thousands serenaded the Big Three as if on a sound track, as if
it were the 1960s and each was trying to win another Masters.
Instead of each just trying to beat the other two.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three _ that's how they were known when Jack Nicklaus,
Arnold Palmer and Gary Player were dominating the PGA Tour and the
major championships. And with the wind swirling across Augusta
National in Thursday's sunny first round of the 64th Masters, the
Big Three were out there in a rare threesome. Together again.
</P>
<P>
   As friendly as their round was, each was hoping to shoot a
better score than his other two longtime rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always do,'' Palmer agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader in this mini-Masters is Nicklaus with a
two-over-par 74, one stroke better than Tiger Woods and only six
strokes behind the leader, Dennis Paulson. Player had a 76 and
Palmer a 78, two strokes better than Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, each of the Big Three knows he's not going to win
another green jacket. Not at their ages _ Nicklaus is 60, Player
64, Palmer 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't have paired the three of us together,'' Nicklaus
said of their rare appearance in a threesome, ``if they thought any
of us had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But give all those official green jackets credit for marquee
thinking. And after being welcomed to the first tee with
appreciative applause, the Big Three were observed laughing. Asked
later what had prompted the laughs, Palmer said: ``I think we were
talking about how old we were. I really don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you don't remember,'' Player said, smiling,
prompting another laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Player talked about how ``memories are the cushions of life''
and cited as a ``special moment the way the people received us.''
So did Palmer, but Nicklaus, always the competitor, was annoyed at
having bogeyed the 16th and 17th holes after having strung together
15 consecutive pars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay much attention to that nostalgia stuff,'' Nicklaus
said after hitting balls on the range after his round. ``It was
very nice, the gallery was very nice, but I'm a funny duck. I come
here to play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 60, even a year after hip-replacement surgery. But
that's Jack Nicklaus. That's why his 18 major pro championships put
him on a pedestal as the best golfer in history. And most of those
majors were won in tournaments in which Palmer and Player competed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold and Gary,'' the Golden Bear said, ``are the two best
friends I've had on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In their ``Big Three'' television series in the '60s, they were
always together on the course. And in recent years on the Senior
PGA Tour, they were occasionally in the same threesome. In their
best years as touring pros, they were never grouped together in a
threesome for the first two rounds of a tournament; it would have
clogged the flow of the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often two of the three would fall together with
similar scores among the leaders on a weekend. Not that they liked
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just playing against the golf course,'' Nicklaus
often said of those occasions, ``we'd be playing against each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first two rounds, the Augusta National green jackets
reunited the Big Three with a total of 13 Masters' victories _ a
record 6 for Nicklaus, 4 for Palmer, 3 for Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought at the end of the century,'' said Will Nicholson,
chairman of the Masters' competition committee, ``that we'd put
three of the greatest players on the golf course together.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost any other sport, the champions of 35 years ago could
not compete on equal terms with today's best. But in golf, skill
endures. No matter what the age, golfers of any age post real
scores in real tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   And the Masters, where a winner can tee off every year for as
long as he wishes, is the only major golf tournament where the Big
Three could form a threesome at their ages.
</P>
<P>
   Considering their Masters' accomplishments, they deserved to be
on display here as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus is now a remarkable 53 under par for his 153 rounds in
his 41 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Player is only 107 over par for 146 rounds in his 43 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, whose scores have declined in recent years, is 280 over
par for 142 rounds in his 46 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Friday's second round the Big Three will be together
again. &QL;

   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Nawaz Sharif, ousted as Pakistan's prime
minister in a military coup in October, was convicted Thursday of
hijacking a commercial airliner, sentenced to life imprisonment
rather than death and ordered to forfeit all his personal property.
</P>
<P>
   Standing along with six co-defendants, who were each acquitted,
the balding, doughy Sharif barely blinked when the judgment was
read. A shriek from his daughter Maryam broke the silence. ``Have
fear of God!'' she cried. Her mother, Kulsoom Nawaz, attempting
stoicism, quieted her and other relatives who had begun to wail.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, 52, was then quickly led away. His family and followers,
many clutching copies of the Koran, tried to chase after him,
shouting, ``Long live Nawaz Sharif!''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's crime was not an ordinary hijacking, at least as most
of the world understands the term. No weapon was used. Sharif was
not even aboard the aircraft. His crime was to issue orders, which
he later rescinded, telling the airport's ground control to refuse
permission for landing to a Karachi-bound airliner, sending it out
of the country. The plane, according to the pilot, then found
itself low on fuel, and the lives of everyone on board were
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 198 people on the plane was Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who
came to power that day in a coup. Hours earlier the prime minister
had fired the general as army chief of staff, while he was out of
the country. In reprisal, army officers began the coup. Once the
general was back safely on the ground, he took control and named
himself Pakistan's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rahmat Hussain Jaffri took these unusual circumstances
into account in sparing Sharif death by hanging and meting out the
lesser penalty of two concurrent life terms _ one for hijacking,
another for terrorism. In Pakistan, a life sentence is defined as
25 years, though there is the chance of an early release for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's attorneys immediately said they would appeal, insisting
that too much weight had been given to the testimony of Aminullah
Chaudhry, the former head of the civil aviation authority and the
man who claimed to have received Sharif's orders to waylay the jet.
Chaudhry, at one time a defendant, won release by becoming a state
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He purchased his freedom with the neck of another person,''
said a defense lawyer, Manzoor Ahmed Malik.
</P>
<P>
   In a 157-page decision distributed Thursday, the judge wrote
that the hijacking ``was committed at the spur of the moment and in
heat of passion'' after Sharif ``came to know that his authority
was eroded by some few army soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, the judge said, fell within the confines of
Pakistan's penal code, which has an elastic definition of
hijacking, assessing guilt to ``whoever unlawfully, by the use or
show of force or by threats of any kind, seizes or exercises
control of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was heard in Pakistan's anti-terrorism court, a venue
for heinous crimes and speedy trials that had been instituted by
Sharif himself. Indeed, he had wanted to ban any appellate process,
though other lawmakers deemed that draconian. As it stands, an
appeal from the anti-terrorism court must be filed within seven
working days. A higher court then has a month to decide. A further
appeal can be made to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors too have a right to appeal, and chief public
prosecutor Raja Qureshi said he objected to the acquittals given
the six other defendants, among them Sharif's brother Shahbaz, who
had been chief minister of the state of Punjab. The government had
asked that Nawaz Sharif receive the death penalty, and Qureshi said
he may well request the higher court to consider the harsher
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the military government seemed pleased with
Thursday's events. Javed Jabbar, a special adviser to Musharraf,
lingered at the courthouse. He wryly and triumphantly said: ``This
was an extraordinarily bizarre situation _ a first in the history
of the world _ where a national leader had decided to become the
country's chief air traffic controller as well. It was a symbolic
expression of Nawaz Sharif's attempt to ruin Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharif case has been an intensely watched political soap
opera. Pakistan is a nation of 150 million people, a developing
nuclear arsenal and a nearly bankrupt economy. It has spent half
its 52 years under military rule _ and half under inept and corrupt
elected officials. Musharraf is but the latest army officer to
overthrow the government only to then claim his intent is to make
Pakistan safe for democracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharif and Musharraf offered competing stories that raised the
question of which came first: the coup or the hijacking?
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court, Sharif explained that he and the
general had been at odds since last summer, after the prime
minister withdrew Pakistani-backed forces from a series of violent
battles with the Indian military in the mountains of Kashmir. He
said he ``had reliable secret information'' that an army coup was
in the works and he tried to head it off by replacing Musharraf
with someone more loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The general has told a far different story, calling Sharif a
corrupt and incompetent leader. He said his officers had reacted
spontaneously to save him and the other airline passengers from
death, taking over the air traffic control tower ``when
circumstances were created which would have forced our plane either
to land in India or crash.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was court testimony that Sharif had ordered the
aircraft diverted, witnesses also suggested that he had changed his
mind when repeatedly told of the plane's fuel problems. He then
decided the airliner could land within Pakistan, but only to be
refueled before leaving the country with everyone still aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge could not bear the pressure of this case,'' Sharif's
wife told reporters a few hours after the sentencing. ``He could
not rule against the army.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there have been international concerns about whether the
trial would be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's criminal justice system has a reputation for shoddy
investigations, concocted evidence and outlandish perjury. Many a
trial, veteran observers say, often follows a formula where the
prosecution fabricates a phony case, the defense manufactures a
bogus rebuttal and then the judge decides in favor of the side
offering the bigger bribe.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers and participants, including Sharif and his
attorneys, said they thought the trial was conducted judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the judge cannot be questioned,'' said Malik,
the defense attorney. ``I congratulate the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's verdict there was little in the way of public
protest. The Pakistan Muslim League, Sharif's party, is badly
fractured, with some members wanting to cozy up to the army and
others wanting to ally themselves with long-time opponents. Kulsoom
Nawaz, a political neophyte, has been the most outspoken defender
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to the verdict, all of Sharif's property is to be
confiscated. Additionally, the judge added various fines. One is
for about $40,000 to be divided among the 198 people who were on
the hijacked plane, including Musharraf.

Clinton show the first lady is leading the New York mayor by eight

of his handling of the March shooting by undercover police of

Giuliani, right, explained his reasoning for the controversial
release of Dorismond's police record following the shooting.

NETWORKS CEDE COVERAGE OF POLITICAL CONVENTIONS TO CABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   To cover the national political conventions in Los Angeles and
Philadelphia this summer, CNN has so many programs planned, so many
correspondents and anchors preparing to parachute in, that the
cable network asked for not one but four skybooths in each
convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be on the air with more coverage from the conventions
than the hours the conventions are in session,'' said Rick Kaplan,
the president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But at ABC News, once a source for hours and hours of convention
coverage, the debate is not how lavishly to swarm over the
gatherings, but how thriftily; among the ideas is one that would
put Peter Jennings in a ``virtual skybooth,'' a studio outside the
convention hall that would be cheaper than a booth inside. ``We're
not going to cover this convention the way we have in the past,''
said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC
News. ``You have to be living on Mars to not know we're living in a
new era of fiscal reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial political conventions have traditionally served
as a kind of national show-and-tell for the broadcast network news
divisions, an opportunity for news stars to roam the convention
floors for immense blocks of prime time and impress viewers with
the breadth and depth of their political reportage. But now, the
approach to the proceedings is merely one more example of the
radical shift in election coverage on television. CNN and its cable
competitors _ C-Span, MSNBC and Fox News Channel _ have usurped the
role of the old broadcast networks as the dominant source for the
nation's political news.
</P>
<P>
   In the competitive primary season that has drawn to a close,
evidence was abundant that the broadcast networks _ particularly
CBS and ABC, which do not own cable news outlets _ had been muscled
out of their once pre-eminent positions. For one thing, of the more
than 20 televised debates involving the Democratic and Republican
candidates for president, all but two were on cable.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News, whose election coverage was once considered the most
thorough and informed on television, broadcast not a single debate,
and its principal anchor, Dan Rather, participated in none, an
outcome Rather says he regrets. ``We have a public responsibility
beyond delivering stockholder value,'' he said in an interview.
``In some ways, we have abrogated that civic trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rather's counterparts at NBC and ABC, Tom Brokaw and
Jennings, each moderated forums, Jennings was placed in the awkward
position of presiding over one that was not shown nationally on his
own network, ABC, but on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   And on each election night of the primary campaign, from the
Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, the cable channels offered
chatter into the wee hours, while the networks were confined to
brief interruptions of regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   The erosion of political coverage on broadcast networks has been
occurring for several elections. Some in the news business describe
as a watershed the decision by ABC's ``Nightline'' to depart the
1996 Republican convention on the second night because of a dearth
of real news. This year, with the maturing of two four-year-old
news channels, MSNBC and Fox, that now compete with CNN, the shift
to cable has solidified. ``Cable is the political conduit of the
air,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press. ``If you don't have that cable coming
into your house, you're getting a whole heck of a lot less
information about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut's organization reported recently that besides the
Internet, cable television is the only segment of the political
media that is attracting a growing news audience. In fact, Pew
found that for the first time, viewers named cable more often as a
major outlet for political coverage than either network or local
news.
</P>
<P>
   The migration of political news to the narrowcasting culture of
cable reflects the growing compartmentalization of news-viewing
habits:there is ESPN for sports addicts, E! for movie fans, CNBC
for the business world. That trend and escalating costs _ by one
news executive's estimate, the networks each spent a minimum of $5
million for each of the two 1996 conventions _ have compelled the
broadcast networks to think smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is throwing fewer people at it,'' said Al
Ortiz, executive producer of the ``CBS Evening News.'' He added,
however, that the commitment to political stories remains intense.
``For someone who is looking to watch 30 minutes of evening news
and absorb the political news of the day, ABC and NBC and CBS are
going at it every bit as hard as they ever did,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are going at it more tactically, much like national
candidates with limited resources who pick a few strategic states.
Burstein noted, for example, that ABC News was the only network,
cable or broadcast, that had an off-air reporter following every
candidate in the primary race as far back as the fall. ``We sent
quite a few people into Iowa and New Hampshire; that was totally
justified,'' Burstein said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News regularly dispatches many of its best-known
correspondents to the various politically oriented shows on MSNBC.
And all of the networks point to their Web sites as alternative
vehicles for their in-depth reporting. There is even talk of
``Internet alleys,'' with booths for various dot-com news sites, on
the convention floors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the broadcast networks remain powerful news magnets,
and viewership on their cable brethren remains meager by
comparison: on March 7, when primary results were reported from 16
states, including New York and California, about 2.3 million
households were tuned to the three all-news cable channels between
8 p.m. and 11 p.m., a much smaller audience than the 10 million or
so viewers for any of the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS or NBC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet politics has become a veritable drive-by event on the
nightly news. The Alliance for Better Campaigns, a media watchdog
group based in Washington, says that during the heat of the primary
season, the three broadcast networks each devoted an average of 36
seconds a night to the actual words of the presidential candidates
on the newscasts and news magazine programs. Altogether during that
time, the networks devoted nearly four to five minutes a night to
campaign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow and measure Americans' responses to the
electoral process say that cable's emphasis on politics means that
democracy is playing out more and more before a paying audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard about the digital divide; there is a coaxial
divide as well,'' Kohut said. About 7 in 10 American households are
cable subscribers, while about 98 percent own televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Cable news officials say that they are filling a void left by
the networks. ``We want to be the ones who own this story; we want
to be the network of record for campaign 2000,'' said Sid
Bedingfield, executive vice president of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   No network has a stronger claim. Between Jan. 19 and Feb. 1,
when it was on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire for the first
caucuses and primary of the season, CNN produced 144 programs on
politics, ranging from half-hour punditcasts like ``The Capital
Gang,'' to the hourlong ``Inside Politics,'' a daily program hosted
by Bernard Shaw and Judy Woodruff that is consumed voraciously by
political die-hards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show for junkies,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, director of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. ``There is no parallel;
nobody else does a program like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis that the all-news channels have placed on politics
appears to have boxed the networks into a corner. Facing declining
audiences for the evening news, the networks also confront the
possibility that the cable channels will use the credibility they
acquired in the primary season to poach on network viewers when the
general election campaign gets the nation's full attention in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be a little bit of a trend of fewer people
watching politics on broadcast because they're being trained to
watch this on cable,'' said Erik Sorenson, vice president and
general manager of MSNBC. ``It may be that it becomes a safer bet
to stay with MS or CNN. You're just not sure if the broadcast
channel is going to cover it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventions by tradition ring in the political high season
for the news media. But because the gatherings seldom generate
breaking news anymore, the broadcast networks say that abandoning
the wall-to-wall coverage they provided in the 1960s and 1970s is
no loss to anyone except those deeply invested in the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   And those viewers most likely will be glued to cable. The cable
networks will be all politics, all the time during the conventions.
``We'll probably have 90 percent of our shows devoted to them,''
said John Moody, vice president for news of the Fox News Channel.
``For us, it's a big commitment in terms of budget and manpower.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the networks say they will have substantial presences for
the Democratic gathering in Los Angeles and the Republicans' in
Philadelphia, and all are also looking for ways to keep costs down.
ABC is considering its virtual booth, the broadcast-and-cable news
hybrid formed by NBC and MSNBC will provide tag-team coverage, and
CBS is currently debating how much coverage it will offer in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime-time decisions still haven't been made, but it's a
pretty safe bet that we will be carrying the nominating process and
the acceptance speeches,'' said Ortiz of CBS. CNN and MSNBC are
planning a series of town hall meetings on various national issues
leading up to the conventions, and all the cable channels say they
will fill the convention days with hours of reports and talkfests
off the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast news executives wonder, however, who exactly their
cable rivals are chattering at all day long. ``From our point of
view, it matters much more the quality of what's being done than
the number of hours on the air,'' said David Westin, the president
of ABC News. ``A lot of what I have seen on cable is perfectly
respectable coverage. But what you get is a good deal of
conventional wisdom and things that have been reported elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for convention veterans like Rather, there is a certain
nostalgia for a bygone era in politics on the air. ``I have a
passion for politics,'' he said. ``I still love going to
conventions. And I loved covering them when things were actually
decided there.''

   DEMOCRATS OUTPACE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, which regularly bemoans the
financial superiority of Republicans, announced Thursday that it
had outraised the Republican National Committee in the first three
months of 2000 and ended the period with more money in the bank.
From Jan. 1 to March 31, the committee reported, more than $26
million flowed into the party's coffers and, it said, $22 million
was still on hand as of April 1. The Republican National Committee
reported, by contrast, that it had raised $24 million over the same
span and had $18 million on deposit as of April 1. Both parties are
fattening their soft-money accounts with big, loosely regulated
contributions from corporations, unions, interest groups and
wealthy individuals, the aim being to pay for campaigns on behalf
of their presumed nominees in the months preceeding the summer
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are wonderful figures,'' said Edward G. Rendell, general
chairman of the Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican chairman, was equally ebullient,
despite the second-place finish. ``There's never been such
excitement in the Republican ranks,'' Nicholson said.

   CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RAISES MILLIONS
</P>
<P>
   Though last year was his first in office, Gov. Gray Davis of
California nevertheless embarked on an early, relentless
fund-raising campaign for re-election, pulling in a record $13.2
million. Raising so much money so soon made him an easy target for
reformers seeking to change California's no-holds-barred campaign
laws. But if the criticism bothers Davis, he is not showing it. In
fact, he has just expanded his fund raising, starting an aggressive
telephone solicitation campaign that warns of ``strong right-wing
opposition'' to his re-election three years hence. Telemarketing
campaigns are relative rarities for major candidates in California,
especially candidates for governor. So does Davis have something
more in mind than running again for governor, maybe a federal
office? No, he insists. All he is trying to do, he says, is amass a
fund for 2002 big enough to ward off any other well-financed
hopeful.

   QUESTIONS OF RUNNING MATES
</P>
<P>
   With speculation steadily spreading about possible running mates
for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, Gore announced
Thursday that he had picked Warren Christopher, the former
secretary of state, to oversee his selection process. No big
surprise there _ it was Christopher who oversaw the process back in
1992 when Bill Clinton chose Gore as his No. 2. Gore has been asked
many times about names on his short list, but he has yet to drop
one. And in any event, he has been telling friends, he believes he
has a bit of leeway in the process, because Bush will have to pick
first.

   THE RACE IN TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Democratic party tried for months to recruit a
strong candidate to take on Sen. Bill Frist, a Republican, this
fall. But the big names, such as Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of Memphis
and former Public Service Commissioner Sara Kyle, rejected all
pleas to run, even those from prominent Democrats like former Sen.
James Sasser. So when the final filing deadline for jumping into
the race passed at noon Thursday, the party was left with a
relative unknown, Jeff Clark, a former state party treasurer, as
its leading contender. The Tennessee Democratic chairman, Doug
Horne, said Frist's huge personal wealth scared off many potential
challengers.

 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, Lawrence J. Wilker, said Thursday that he would
leave his post at the end of the year and, following the path of
many other executives these days, would join a new Internet
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Wilker's announcement came a week after Nathan Leventhal said he
would leave his job as president of Lincoln Center in New York,
which creates the unusual circumstance of the nation's two leading
performing arts centers recruiting chief operating officers at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a coincidence,'' Wilker said about the two resignations.
``We are not worn down. Nat and I are ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's job has a salary of $525,000 a year and Wilker's
$325,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I've got one more adventure in me,'' said Wilker, 56.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, which plans to present drama, dance, music and
other performing arts over the Internet, has not yet been named. In
it, Wilker will join Lou Reda, the major producer of television
programs for the A&AMP;E and History Channel cable operations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his departure from a bricks-and-mortar arts center
for one made up of electrons marked a trend, Wilker said: ``I don't
think so. My whole life has been devoted to making the arts more
available. I see this as the next logical step: putting a stage
into everyone's living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the Kennedy Center, Wilker presided over the
creation of Playhouse Square Center in Cleveland and before that
was director of properties (theaters and real estate) for the
Shubert Organization.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Johnson, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, said the
search for Wilker's successor would begin immediately. He praised
Wilker's accomplishments in improving the center's finances while
overseeing an expansion of its performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he leaves in December, he will have been here almost 10
years,'' Johnson said. ``It is a demanding job, with 3,300
performances a year. There are six or seven stages operating in an
evening when everything is full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret, but understand, Larry's decision,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   During Wilker's tenure, the National Symphony Orchestra, which
is now part of the Kennedy Center, hired Leonard Slatkin as its
music director, and it seems to have resolved its differences with
the Washington Opera, which is not part of the center but performs
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center also eliminated its $7 million debt and began
a $170 million renovation.

GOVERNMENT'S BUYBACKS LEAVING FEWER TREASURIES TO GO AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A specter haunts mutual funds that invest primarily in federal
government debt: the Great Bond Buyback.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, the Treasury announced plans to buy back and
retire up to $30 billion in outstanding Treasury debt by the end of
the year; some $2 billion worth has already been bought.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, demand for Treasury notes and bonds has already
surged. Institutional investors have bid long-maturity prices up
and yields down _ no bad thing for investors holding Treasuries
directly or through funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, according to Ryan Labs, the benchmark
30-year bond posted a total return of 9.06 percent _ a big
improvement from a loss of 14.78 percent for all of 1999. Rising
prices pushed the yield on the long bond down to 5.48 percent
during a time when short-term rates were rising.
</P>
<P>
   Impending scarcity is the reason. In the Treasury buyback, the
prime targets are notes and bonds with maturities of 10 years or
longer, especially those maturing from 2015 to 2025, according to
Gerald Lucas, senior government strategist at Merrill Lynch. Those
bonds were slightly cheaper than others when the buyback began; by
buying them, the Treasury intends to keep the overall maturity of
its outstanding debt between 5.5 and 6 years, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill thinks the $30 billion is only the beginning. The firm's
analysts see potential for buybacks of up to $200 billion in the
next three to four years, with a wider range of maturities affected
in future years, beginning with the five-year note, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   New Treasuries will still be issued at the same time, but in
smaller numbers. Merrill expects the volume of new 30-year bonds to
fall to $15 billion this year, half the total in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting the shrinking supply of longer-term Treasury
bonds to bring cataclysmic changes, but there will be important
effects for investors holding or interested in domestic taxable
bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Just about all such funds will feel the impact, because so much
of the nation's overall fixed-income market is made up of
Treasuries, said David Schroeder, a fixed-income manager at
American Century Investments. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond
index, a general benchmark for United States bond funds, has a 32
percent allocation for Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   General bond fund managers who believe Treasuries will
outperform other taxable bonds, like corporates and mortgage-backed
securities, will give even more weight to Treasuries than the index
suggests, while those who think the opposite will underweight
Treasuries. The optimists did better last quarter: while the
aggregate index was gaining just 2.21 percent, the Treasury portion
of the index was up 3.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, long-term government bond funds will be affected most
by the buyback. Generally, government bond funds are required by
charter to keep at least 65 percent of assets in government
securities, a category that, in addition to Treasuries, includes
bonds issued by quasigovernmental agencies like Fannie Mae and the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
</P>
<P>
   These bonds have long been regarded as implicitly guaranteed by
the Treasury; though some proposals have been floated to scale back
the implied guarantee for some agencies, no change is expected
soon. As the supply of true Treasuries dries up or becomes
unattractively expensive, most of these funds can easily buy
so-called agencies instead.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for a small subset of the group, Treasury funds, whose
charters generally require that at least 65 percent of assets be in
true Treasuries alone. Some funds have even stricter limits: T.
Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term must keep 85 percent of assets
in Treasury bonds and the balance in either Treasuries or
securities issued by Ginnie Mae, the only one of the agencies whose
bonds are explicitly guaranteed by the government, according to Dan
Shackelford, a senior portfolio manager in taxable bond funds at T.
Rowe Price. By contrast, Dreyfus U.S. Treasury Long Term can invest
up to 35 percent of assets in any of the agency bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Inc. tracks only 16 long-term Treasury funds, with
combined assets of $2.7 billion at the end of February.

<P>
   Are they endangered by the buyback? Probably not. ``You have to
put that $30 billion in the context of all the issues
outstanding,'' said Robert Auwaerter, head of taxable fixed-income
funds at the Vanguard Group. All told, some $3.2 trillion in
marketable Treasury securities are outstanding, and one-seventh of
them _ $455 billion worth _ have maturities of 15 years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Treasuries grow scarcer and more expensive, the funds
that now must stick closest to them may ask shareholders to approve
charter amendments to give them more flexibility. None have done so
yet, but at least one fund company, American Century, is
considering the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we are thinking about, more on the back burner
than the front burner,'' Schroeder said. ``I feel we have some time
to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stick with the narrowly focused Treasury funds may
continue to find the Treasury buyback plan to their liking, but the
recent run-up is not attracting new money to Treasuries; quite the
opposite, in fact. In the first month of the year, $200 million in
assets flowed out of all Treasury funds, leaving $2.8 billion in
assets, and $1.5 billion flowed out of United States government
funds, leaving $27.7 billion in assets, according to the Financial
Research Corp., which tracks mutual fund cash flows. The company's
figures for all of 1999 show $215 million flowing out of Treasury
funds and $2.3 billion out of government funds.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury bond's great advantage, safety, is not much on
investors' minds these days, riveted as they are by all the
excitement in stocks. ``People are not willing to pay up for a
risk-free asset, because there's so much going on everywhere
else,'' said Shackelford at T. Rowe Price. But when the climate
changes, he added, ``it will have its day in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's buyback plans, meanwhile, at least offer the
prospect that Treasury bond funds will post stronger capital gains
than funds invested in agencies or long-term corporate bonds. And
Lucas at Merrill Lynch is confident that even an aggressive buyback
program will not extinguish the market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he foresees the Treasury converting some of its $2.5
trillion of nonmarketable debt _ IOUs issued to entities like the
Social Security and federal retirement trust funds _ into tradeable
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Most government trust funds ``aren't actively managed,'' he
said. ``They are restricted to nonmarketable Treasuries,'' he
added. ``They hold them until they mature and then roll them
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Converting some of the trust funds' holdings to tradeable
securities would give the funds the flexibility to diversify into
other investments while satisfying investors' demand for
Treasuries, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a chance that the Treasury's buyback plans will
change radically after the November election installs a new
president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The current buyback program is an outgrowth of a growing budget
surplus that the Congressional Budget Office expects to reach $1.9
trillion in 2010. New leaders may have other ideas for that
surplus.

IN SOME ANNUITIES, `FREE MONEY' WITH AN CATCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free money!
</P>
<P>
   That's the pitch being used by more than a dozen insurance
companies in a new campaign to sell variable annuities, those
complicated hybrids of mutual funds and insurance policies that are
widely criticized as having high fees and enticing, but often
unneeded features.
</P>
<P>
   Put $100,000 into one of their variable annuities and these
companies will hand over a so-called bonus of 3 percent or 4
percent of the investment _ that is, $3,000 or $4,000 cash. A few
companies offer 5 percent. It sounds great, and the response from
customers has been explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at one company paying a bounty _ G.E. Life and Annuity _
nearly tripled last year. Even companies that say they find such
bonus annuities unsavory are starting to offer them to keep from
losing business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money is not really free; it comes with lots of
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, long-term investors are very likely to pay back the
``bonus'' in higher fees _ and then some _ over the life of their
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no free money,'' said Jon A. Boscia, the chief
executive of the Lincoln National Corp., a leading variable annuity
company that has been losing market share to companies that provide
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is paying a bonus of 3 or 4 percent and they're
paying a sales commission of 3 to 8 percent, that money has to come
from somewhere,'' Boscia said. ``And it gets built into the prices
and fees inside the variable annuity contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In a business that has shown itself hardly averse to high-priced
financial products, some brokerage houses are refusing to sell the
new products. And executives at companies that are losing money to
the new catnip have complained to federal securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
dispatched scores of investigators across the country in recent
weeks to comb through the sales records of brokers, bankers,
financial planners and career insurance agents _ the sellers of
variable annuities _ and to interview customers who have signed up
for the bonuses. And officials of the National Association of
Securities Dealers say they are looking into the matter as well.
</P>
<P>
   Paul F. Roye, the director of the SEC's Division of Investment
Management, says the agency suspects that sales representatives are
not telling customers how the bonus variable annuities really work
and may thus be violating disclosure requirements. After all,
critics say, why would people be rushing to invest in bonus
variable annuities if they were being told: We're going to give you
some money upfront, but you'll pay us back much more?
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the states, New York does not permit the sale of
bonus annuities. But Kevin Rampe, the general counsel for the New
York State Department of Insurance, said the state is working on
guidelines that would permit their sale. ``We want to make sure
that customers aren't misled on the true cost of the bonuses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the higher costs, Manulife Financial, which had
an increase in variable annuity sales of more than 40 percent last
year, charges an average annual fee of 2.63 percent of assets for
its product with a 5 percent bonus, according to the Variable
Annuity Research &AMP; Data Service, a research firm in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Golden American, a subsidiary of ING of the Netherlands, which
saw its variable annuity sales rise 35 percent last year, charges
an average of 2.53 percent for an annuity with the same 5 percent
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, two leading companies that do not offer bonuses,
Lincoln National and Hartford Life, charge just under 2 percent.
And companies that they do not pay sales commissions charge even
less: Fidelity Investments, for example, charges an average of 1.42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The higher fees hit investors directly. ``Over time, the higher
fees more than offset the bonus,'' said Merry Mosbacher, who is in
charge of insurance sales at Edward Jones &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm
that refuses to sell bonus variable annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example of the math: Over 20 years, a $100,000
investment returning 10 percent annually in a Lincoln National
variable annuity with an annual fee of 1.98 percent would grow to
$467,870.90. But $100,000 plus the $5,000 bonus in the Manulife
variable annuity with an annual fee of 2.63 percent would yield
$435,402.52, or more than $32,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to charging fees that sometimes run more than 20
percent higher than the industry average, bonus variable annuities
often require investors to tie up their money for nine years,
versus seven years for most other variable annuities. Those who
take their money out sooner must pay a penalty of up to 8.5
percent, which is 1.5 percentage points higher than that imposed by
most other variable annuities. Under federal law, there is also a
10 percent penalty imposed on anyone who withdraws money before
reaching the age of 59{.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are concerned that sales representatives are
pushing these investments to people who are nearing retirement and
may need to spend the money in their variable annuities long before
the penalty period is over. Such a transaction, Roye said, would
probably be in violation of S.E.C. standards of suitability and
could result in fines and other penalties for a sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, Roye said, are obliged to talk through the
ramifications of an investment with clients. ``A broker could say
to a customer, `This new bonus product makes sense if you're
willing to stay in it for the next eight or nine years,''' Roye
said. ```But if you want to get out in two years it doesn't make
sense.' If that discussion never took place, or the client didn't
understand, then maybe there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   American Skandia, the company that first offered bonus variable
annuities four years ago, charges roughly the same 2.58 percent fee
on several variable annuities _ with or without the bonus,
according to Variable Annuity Research. The company, like some of
its rivals, has not cut its profits to offer the bonus, but instead
has scaled back benefits and sales commissions and increased the
penalties for early withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Wade A. Dokken, the chief executive of American Skandia, said
that to focus on lower fees was flawed logic. He pointed out that
among the nearly 50 separate funds that his variable annuity
customers can invest in are some of the best performers in the
industry. What is most important, he says, is not the size of the
annual fees, but the overall earnings of an investment. ``I'd much
rather have a return of 20 percent after you subtract our fees,''
he said, ``than a return of 15 percent from an investment with
lower fees. It's the total return that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, returns are never guaranteed, while the fees are a
constant. The funds of several of American Skandia's variable
annuities are run by managers from white-hot companies like the
Janus Capital Corp. and Fred Alger Management, which have turned in
hot returns in large part because of big bets on the volatile
technology sector. But should those funds cool down, the annual
fees would take on greater significance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some funds without bonuses and with lower fees have
been doing well, too. Conseco, for example, had a return of 42.83
percent last year with a nonbonus variable annuity with annual
charges of 1.74 percent, compared with a return of 33.95 percent
for American Skandia's bonus variable annuity, according to
Variable Annuity Research.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say bonus variable annuities were designed to entice
customers away from other companies. The idea was to pay a bonus
that would equal _ or at least partially counter _ the almost
universal penalties for early withdrawal. Indeed, Michelle A.
Giordano, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, estimated that at
least half of the bonuses that were given out last year went to
customers who switched from one company to another.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force, experts say, is increased sales commissions.
By moving an old customer into a new variable annuity offered by a
different company, a sales representative earns a second commission
which, of course, is easier than going out and finding a new
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products are ripe for abuse,'' said Elliott M. Server,
who is in charge of variable annuity sales at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, another company that has refused to offer the bonus
products.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the sales pitch for existing customers is that they
can shift to a variable annuity with modern features _ say, for
example, one that locks in market gains as a hedge against future
declines for the benefit of the investor's heirs. The old way,
exemplified by American Skandia's bonus variable annuity, is to
guarantee only that an investor's heirs get back at least as much
as was put into the investment.
</P>
<P>
   But many variable annuities now step up the guaranteed amount at
a fixed percentage or as the market value of the investment rises.
Investors pay extra for these features, and financial experts say
they are probably not needed, because long-term stock investments
have historically gained at least 10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all this: One way or another, customers pay for
everything they get in a variable annuity. ``There's only one place
to get the money to do everything we do with these products,'' said
Norse Blazzard, a lawyer who pioneered variable annuities in the
mid-1960s and is a foe of the new bonus versions. ``And that's from
the customer.''

   Most mutual fund investors opened the new century with smart
gains, though well below the double-digit returns posted in the
final quarter of 1999. Those who generally steered clear of the
giants in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index often outperformed
in a stock market led by technology and smaller issues.
</P>
<P>
   That was the winning approach for the five professional money
managers who built hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New
York Times. All five beat the S&AMP;P 500, which gained 2 percent
during the first quarter, and one beat the average of 6.5 percent
for diversified domestic equity funds tracked by Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme among the five managers was unease about &UR;  &LR; the
market's recent violent swings. In response to that uncertainty,
all looked to diversified portfolios and long-term perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were a boon to Jack A. Brill, vice president
of Natural Investment Services in San Diego. His portfolio of
``socially responsible'' funds was the leader for the quarter, with
a gain of 6.6 percent, aided by stakes in Citizens Emerging Growth,
up 23.07 percent, and Calvert New Visions, up 18.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Brill is dropping Ariel Appreciation, a
small- to mid-cap value fund. A sliver of the freed assets will be
added to Citizens Emerging Growth; the remainder, representing 4
percent of the overall portfolio, will go to Calvert New Visions, a
small growth fund he added in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``During these turbulent times, it is more important for
investors to be well diversified,'' he said. ``Market timing
becomes much more difficult. Taking a long-term perspective is
crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   The next-strongest portfolio last quarter was the one chosen by
Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of
Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass. Kobren said his company was
staying ``cautiously optimistic'' about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuations remain at historically high levels for certain
areas of the market,'' he said. ``However, the economy remains in
very good shape, and corporate profits are growing. And when you
eliminate the technology sector, stocks are much more reasonably
priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the short-term volatility in the market ``is
unnerving,'' he added ``investors are well-advised to maintain a
diversified portfolio and not get unduly concerned about the wide
daily swings we've been experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobren's portfolio, which contains only funds from Fidelity
Investments, gained 5.95 percent for the quarter. He rode the hot
technology sector with stakes in Fidelity Aggressive Growth, up
14.42 percent, and Fidelity Small Cap Stock, up 12.59 percent. For
the second quarter, he is shifting 5 percent of the portfolio out
of Aggressive Growth, reducing it to 15 percent, and into Fidelity
Value, raising that fund's weighting to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With a cumulative portfolio gain of 215.62 percent since the
contest began in July 1993, Kobren has almost caught up with the
longtime leader, Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund
Investor in Irvington, N.Y., and whose cumulative return is 221.77
percent. Since the start, the five portfolios have returned an
average of 181.64 percent, compared with 281.49 percent for the
Vanguard 500 Index fund, which tracks the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each
quarter by Lipper Inc., the research firm in Summit, N.J. The
figures exclude sales charges and transaction costs _ as well as
taxes, because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The five managers may choose from among all funds open to new
investors, and may shift money each quarter. The portfolios are
meant to grow until July 2013, some 20 years after the competition
began.
</P>
<P>
   Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, posted the third-best return for the quarter _ 4.86
percent, buoyed by a large stake in MAS Mid Cap Growth, which was
up 13.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnel, who took Susan Dziubinski's place in the contest &UR;  &LR; in
January and has overhauled the portfolio, is making no changes for
the coming quarter. ``I should at least be able to stick with them
for three months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnel is sanguine about the market: ``We've watched a big rally
in the Dow, and Nasdaq stocks are getting barbecued, but so what?
The average value fund is still in the red for the year, and the
average growth fund has double-digit gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
also plans no changes to his broadly diversified portfolio, despite
placing fourth during the first quarter with a gain of 4.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip-flop in leaders and laggards continues, just as one
would expect with a diversified portfolio in a turbulent market,''
Evensky said. ``Because no one can predict what market to be in,
the game plan continues to be managing risk as well as return.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs's portfolio trailed the pack for the quarter, gaining
just 4.62 percent. Despite an impressive showing by T. Rowe Price
Science and Technology, up 11.57 percent, his return was pulled
down by stakes in Marisco Focus, up just 0.21 percent, and Strong
Asia-Pacific, up 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Jacobs is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take something off the table,'' he said.
``Speculation is rampant, investors are complacent and many
valuations in the new economy are far too high. The risk-reward
relationship for equities isn't nearly as favorable as it was in
the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is redirecting 15 percent of his portfolio out
of three stock funds, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, Marsico
Focus and Janus Olympus, and into a new position in Vanguard Money
Market Prime. But he is standing pat with his Europe and Asia
funds.

 &HT;    Gore touts importance of 2000 election in Florida
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore ate a late dinner at
the home of attorney Robert Montgomery, telling guests who paid
$10,000 each that this presidential election is one of the most
important in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke for about 20 minutes, giving his stock campaign
speech and breaking no new ground. He criticized Texas Gov. George
W. Bush for supporting school vouchers, a large federal tax cut and
plans to allow some privatization of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the 65 dinner guests to become intensely involved
in the election because of the stark differences between
Republicans and Democrats. ``How hard are we willing to fight for
what we believe in?'' asked Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that a Bush administration would dramatically change
the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court. And he said that Bush would
be no friend of the environment, accusing the Texas governor of
having the worst environmental record in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore praised Israel and pledged his unwavering support,
one foreign policy issue he did not comment on was the fate of
Elian Gonzalez, 6. Gore has said in recent days that whether the
child should go back to his father should be decided by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore heads for the gymnasium at Old School Square in
Delray Beach where he will talk to about 150 voters about his plans
for Medicare and making it easier and cheaper to buy prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues are particularly important to South Florida's
retirees who worry about the increasing cost of health care. If
Gore has any chance of taking the Sunshine State away from Bush, he
will need to build a strong base of support in Palm Beach and
Broward counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also will tell Democrats about a new plan to allow them to
read the party platform on Internet site Speakout.Com. Voters will
also be able to recommend changes to the platform which will be
approved at the July Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tentatively scheduled to return to West Palm Beach on
Monday for another dinner raising money for the Democratic National
Committee.

INVESTING IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD: NO SURE BET FOR GROWING WINNERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thinking about investing in a hometown mutual fund, one that
focuses on shares of local companies?
</P>
<P>
   If you live in San Jose or Seattle, you can find something. But
if you're in Chattanooga or Buffalo or just about anyplace else in
the country, don't even bother looking.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of great mutual fund ideas, the regional mutual
fund possibly won't rate more than a footnote. Parochialism, it
turns out, is a selling point that cuts little ice with many
investors, because arbitrarily restricting investments to companies
in just one area can hamper returns _ or magnify trouble, as
investors in Pacific Northwest-centered funds found out when
Microsoft melted down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the thousands of mutual fund portfolios tracked by
Morningstar Inc., just 34 are United States regional funds, and
only 13 of those had enough combined assets _ more than $30 million
_ to qualify for The New York Times's mutual funds tables as of
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 34 invest in small and midsize companies, generally
growth stocks not widely followed on Wall Street. Assets have grown
from $1.15 billion at the end of 1995 to $4.57 billion on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   As for returns, just 6 out of 34 outperformed the 25.73 percent
average annual gain of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index over the
last three calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The regional funds take a geographical approach to following
Peter Lynch's advice about investing in what you know. Their
managers believe they know companies in their own backyards better
than out-of-town analysts do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a consumer of the products and knowing people that work
at local companies is important,'' said Bill Whitlow, manager of
the $163.8 million Safeco Northwest fund in Seattle, whose largest
holding should be easy to guess: Microsoft. The fund gained 54.2
percent last year, and 13.54 percent in the first quarter of 2000,
but gave back more than half that gain last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whitlow said he was a regular at Starbucks and a frequent flier
on Alaska Airlines, and boasted that he could see the headquarters
of Amazon.com from his office window. His fund has positions in all
three stocks in a portfolio limited to companies based in five
states: Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who believe that a regional fund gives them a pure
basket of home-baked goods may be surprised to learn that many
regional fund managers eye companies outside their borders.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules allow funds calling
themselves regional to invest as much as 35 percent of assets
outside their geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   That wiggle room allows Safeco Northwest to branch into stocks
like Intel. Though Intel's semiconductor operations in
Hillsborough, Ore., near Portland, make the company the state's
largest private employer, its headquarters are in Santa Clara,
Calif. Another stake outside the region is Kroger, the supermarket
chain based in Cincinnati, which the fund found itself owning after
Kroger acquired the Oregon-based Fred Meyer chain last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have that flexibility,'' Whitlow said. ``The
whole point of it is so I can maintain a diversified portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The local heroes that turned in the strongest performances of
the last five years were driven, naturally enough, by strong
regional economies. But regional economic performance can swing
sharply down as well as up: Safeco Northwest had an anemic 3.5
percent return in 1998 because its home turf was hit harder than
other areas by Asian economic turmoil. And recent weeks have made
clear the risk inherent in the best performers' heavy reliance on
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad B. Herrmann, lead manager of the $2.93 billion Franklin
California Growth fund, which has its pick of 1,400 publicly traded
companies in California, believes strongly in the home-court
advantage. ``We're a drive down the road to Silicon Valley, so we
do have a leg up,'' said Herrmann, a native of Darien, Conn. ``It
has an appeal to the pride of people who live and work in the state
of California.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann points out that, standing alone, California would rank
as the world's eighth-largest economy and its fourth-largest stock
market. But though state spirit might be the motive to invest in
many regional funds, Franklin California Growth, the top-performing
regional fund over the last three years with an annualized return
of 46.3 percent, attracts fewer than half of its shareholders from
California.
</P>
<P>
   That offers proof that a regional fund can attract
out-of-territory investors, but is also a sign that few investors
consider supporting their local economy a top priority, at least
when it comes to choosing mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Edward S. Rosenbaum, director of research at Lipper Inc., said
funds like Franklin California Growth wind up being sector funds in
disguise, overweighted in technology stocks; by contrast, the
region around Minneapolis yields a much more varied portfolio for
the four funds that concentrate on that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any specialized fund, whether by geography or sector,
it's a step away from diversification,'' he said. ``That makes it
less appropriate for a substantial portion of your financial nest
egg. But it can be a way to engage in the economic life of that
region.'' (Of course, many investors already get all the exposure
they need to their home region's economic vicissitudes simply by
living and working there, and might be better served by a fund that
invests anywhere (italics)but(end italics) their region, just as
many financial planners advise against putting retirement savings
in the stock of one's employer, to avoid an overconcentration of
risk.)
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1991, the California Growth fund roughly tracks an
index of the state's 250 largest companies ranked by market
capitalization, and is rebalanced each quarter. Two-thirds of its
assets are in networking and semiconductor companies, digital
hardware makers and biotechnology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at where market flows might be going, so we can
acknowledge where money is shifting,'' Herrmann said by telephone
from the headquarters of Franklin Templeton in San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   California Growth was an early investor in Netscape and Yahoo
but trimmed its stakes in quarterly rebalancings after they soared
to high valuations. As of last week, Internet service companies
made up about 12.5 percent of the fund's 150 stocks, up from 6.5
percent in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   These days Herrmann likes JDS Uniphase, the optical-networking
products maker based in San Jose; Versata, a software and service
provider in Oakland; and Vitria Technology, an e-business concern
in Sunnyvale. Other holdings include Applied Micro Circuits, a San
Diego maker of integrated circuits for telecommunications
applications, and Applied Materials of Santa Clara, a supplier of
chip-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the regional funds make sense from an investment
perspective, they are certainly suited to one purpose: They give
the sales forces at regional brokerage firms and investment banks a
product to pitch to local customers that fund giants like Fidelity
and Vanguard do not offer. Critics say that makes them pure
marketing gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of silly,'' said Russel Kinnel, director of fund
analysis at Morningstar. ``Generally, it doesn't really make sense
to limit an investment to an artificial border. Why settle?''

JUDGE STRIKES DOWN RULE LIMITING PROTESTERS ON NEW YORK'S CITY HALL
STEPS  
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan Thursday struck down a
city regulation governing the number of protesters allowed on the
steps of City Hall, ruling that the city had unfairly restricted
access to a favored spot for everything from demonstrations to news
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the City Hall steps has become one of the
symbolic battles of the Giuliani administration, with the mayor
arguing that increased security is needed and opponents claiming
that they have been barred from the city's quintessential public
space.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the importance that the spot holds for public
debate in the city, both sides reacted to the decision by taking to
the steps for rival news conferences. Officials of the New York
Civil Liberties Union celebrated their victory, while city lawyers
vowed to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, his third regarding protests in front of
City Hall, Judge Harold Baer Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan focused on decisions by the city to allow certain
gatherings, such as a Yankees' victory celebration, while denying
others. The regulation allowed city officials to practice
``discrimination in deciding which ideas it will celebrate and
which it may marginalize, circumscribe, and restrict,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The city regulation required groups to obtain permits before
assembling in front of City Hall and limits the number of
participants to 50 on the building steps and 150 in the front
plaza. City officials said the rules were a reflection of valid
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Housing Works, the AIDS services organization that
sued the city over the restrictions, said city officials imposed
the limits before they ever raised security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wanted to make it difficult for people to get
exposure for publicly criticizing his administration,'' said
Charles King, co-executive director of Housing Works, which was
represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Baer's ruling, which took effect immediately, is the most recent
in a series of free-speech battles involving the Giuliani
administration. Last week, the number of cases prompted an
appellate judge to complain that the city's ``relentless onslaught
of First Amendment litigation'' threatened to burden the court with
duties that belong to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Baer found in his decision that the city could take reasonable
measures to ensure the security of City Hall _ such as the use of
magnetic detectors at the entrance to City Hall plaza _ without
imposing the restrictions found in the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge acknowledged that the city had the right to regulate
the timing, manner and location of demonstrations or news
conferences near City Hall. But, quoting judicial precedents, he
wrote, ``The government has no power to restrict such activity
because of its message.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in 1998 after city officials refused to
allow Housing Works, an AIDS service organization, to hold a large
press conference on the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Baer has issued two preliminary orders involving the
number of participants allowed at Housing Works news conferences.
The city appealed one of the orders, which a federal appeals court
modified but let stand.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Thursday, Baer compared the 1999 Yankees' World
Series victory celebration to Housing Works' planned World AIDS Day
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has decided that only certain events deserve
commemoration, and thus any World AIDS Day event would presumably
be limited to 50 people on the steps of City Hall,'' he wrote. ``It
is hard for this court to imagine that a celebration of the
Yankees' victory is inherently a governmental activity and worthy
of City Hall sponsorship while the commemoration of World AIDS Day
is relegated to an event with no more than 50 or 150
participants.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city said Baer had misinterpreted the definition
of traditional activities.

MAYOR BROWN HIT PAY DIRT ON 8 IPOS: THE QUESTION IS HOW DID HE  
 GET IN ON SO MANY GOOD DEALS 
 &HT;       BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown says he participated in eight
red-hot stock offerings late last year because he had an
arrangement with brokerage Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to pick up
any ``IPO remnants.''
<P>
   If so, the mayor enjoys a highly unusual relationship with his
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, there are no ``remnants'' left over from
much-sought-after initial public offerings of technology and
Internet stocks. Moreover, it is rare, indeed, for an individual
investor to get a taste of such action, let alone to participate in
numerous IPOs during a single four-week period.
</P>
<P>
   ``An individual investor who gets in on a lot of IPOs, that just
doesn't happen,'' said Les Childress of Childress Investment
Research in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are institutions that can't even get in the door on
IPOs,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's investments came to light after the mayor filed a
financial disclosure statement with the city Ethics Commission on
Monday. Because financial reporting laws stipulate only that
investments be listed in broad ranges, the exact amount of the
mayor's investments is between him, his accountant and, eventually,
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent news reports, including one in The Chronicle, stated
Brown's portfolio was worth as much as $1 million and quoted his
press secretary as saying that he had amassed this fortune
day-trading in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Brown's earnings were considerably less, but
the fact remains that Brown enjoyed considerable luck on the IPO
market.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal about participating in so many IPOs.
Nor is there any evidence that Brown has performed favors for
companies in which he holds stock.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the mayor's office denied yesterday that any
connection exists between the mayor's trades with Morgan Stanley
and Brown's 1997 selection of the brokerage to sell $100 million in
bonds to finance a proposed new stadium for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: How did he get in on so many new
share offerings?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Pillette, a San Francisco investment manager, said that
individual investors generally participate in popular IPOs only if
they are preferred clients for an underwriting brokerage and
generate substantial fees from transactions.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Traded With Charles Schwab
</P>
<P>
   In Brown's case, though, he told reporters on Wednesday that
while he maintained an account with Morgan Stanley, he had started
trading online with Charles Schwab because the commissions are
lower.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in other words, a casual customer at best for Morgan
Stanley, which served as lead underwriter for each of the eight
IPOs Brown participated in last year between early November and
December.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the mayor was able to purchase 400 shares of
United Parcel Service on November 9 for $20,000, according to
records released by his office. UPS' stock jumped more than 30
percent in value on its first trading day.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Brown was given the chance to buy 100 shares of
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Charter Communications for $19 a
share. That stock climbed nearly 20 percent in its market debut.
</P>
<P>
   And about a week later, the mayor scored 100 shares of
Hewlett-Packard spin-off Agilent Technologies for $3,000. Agilent
surged roughly 40 percent on its first day.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; No `Remnant' With Popular IPO
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street financial analyst who asked that his name be
withheld because ``I don't want to be calling the mayor a liar''
observed that there is no such thing as a ``remnant'' for a popular
IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a remnant, that means nobody else wanted the shares,''
the analyst said. ``The reason a stock goes up on its first day is
because there are many people who want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he gets most of his stock tips from reading
newspapers and comparing notes with friends. ``It's a lot of fun,''
he said, ``but it drives you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible explanation for his IPO activities may be that
the mayor has a pal at Morgan Stanley who is funneling shares his
way.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Brownie Point Theory
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that somebody there is trying to win some brownie
points with the mayor,'' said Alexander Paris, a market analyst at
Barrington Research in Chicago. ``Maybe this person is looking at
(managing) the city's pension fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley did not return calls on the matter yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative explanation would be that the IPO companies
instructed the underwriter to make shares available to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who could do this must be really
well-connected,'' said Richard Del Monte, who heads the Del Monte
Group, a financial planning firm in Danville. ``Someone has to be
giving him help.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Brown declined to further discuss his stock trading.
His press secretary said the mayor was ``too busy running the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   One financial analyst who asked to remain anonymous said it is
increasingly common for IPO companies to curry favor with VIPs by
having their underwriter make shares available before trading
commences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's payola,'' the analyst said. ``There's a lot of payola
going on with IPOs. They dole these things out as favors.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; No Connection to IPO Staffs
</P>
<P>
   Brown's press secretary, Kandace Bender, said the mayor has no
relationship, either business or social, with any employees of
companies in which he holds stock.
</P>
<P>
   One New York investment manager who has handled funds for public
figures said Brown misstepped by placing himself in a position
where there is even an appearance of ethical impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have a blind trust,'' the investment manager said.
``He should have someone manage his money for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed Morgan Stanley didn't tell him this,'' the
investment manager added.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from IPOs, Brown purchased stakes in at least eight other
tech outfits between October 14 and December 9, records show. These
include a $32,000 investment in America Online, a $71,111 stake in
eToys and an $85,380 investment in software-maker Veritas.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 17 publicly listed companies in which the mayor said
he holds stock are based in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Stocks Bought While Campaigning
</P>
<P>
   Most of these stock transactions, by the way, were made as Brown
was embroiled in a surprisingly competitive mayoral election and
subsequent runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined yesterday to further discuss his stock trading.
But he said on Wednesday that he buys and sells shares just about
every day, although never while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at work,'' Brown said. ``I'm the mayor at work. I do
this before work. And I have a good friend who is a nut on a
computer. And she's constantly pounding me.''
</P>
<P>
   Angered over news reports that he had made a killing in the
stock market _ reports that wildly exaggerated both the size and
performance of his portfolio _ the mayor volunteered on Tuesday to
show his full stock holdings to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, his press secretary, later said Brown actually meant
that he would reveal only the number of shares he bought in each of
the companies listed in his 1999 report to the city Ethics
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that between October and December of last year, he
invested about $275,000 into the market. He placed his total
earnings at $11,000 _ a mere 4.4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, rose about 28
percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made only 4 percent?'' asked Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany in New York. ``That's pretty poor
performance for what was a big period for tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor needs to get a stock picker on his staff.''

Mommas let your babies like baseball 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For any parents with a secret long-range goal of taking early
retirement and living prosperously off their kids, there was a
clip-and-save item in yesterday's sports section.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball salaries now average just under $2 million
a year. That's the average. Almost half the players also earn $1
million or more per season. Paychecks are mushrooming. That average
salary has doubled in eight years, and at the current rate, it will
double again long before 2010. The $20 million-a-season ballplayer
is coming soon. And it won't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, you are now watching little Hector crawling around
on the floor, a mere toddler. The old American tradition was to
dream the right kind of dreams and provide the right kind of early
guidance for Hector. If all went well, he could grow up to become a
doctor, lawyer or dot.com geek.
</P>
<P>
   But when you combine everything _ the money, the glory, the
first-class travel, the working conditions, and with the strongest
union in the world providing protection _ there is no better way of
life than a major-league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks owns the local baseball team. Hicks owns almost
everything else, too. He is big, big business. But baseball?
Nothing in the business world, testifies Tom, compares to the
amount of money it takes to cover payroll expense for a mere 25
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the best part _ I've never known a player yet who
didn't get rich, then immediately provide a financial care package
for dear mom and dear dad.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all this sounds appealing, including the possibility of
early retirement, you are probably thinking it's a tad early for
little Hector, still in his diapers, to be exposed to the game of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says Chuck McMichael. Chuck knows, too. Chuck's job is to
find ballplayers, and as the Rangers' director of scouting, he
looks from the high school level on up. In 16 or 17 years, he wants
Hector to be on his short list of prospects, which is the very
first step on the road to baseball riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can also start right from the cradle,'' McMichael
said yesterday. ``In my opinion, baseball lost a couple of
generations of fans to the other sports, and those fans are the
parents of today. We need parents who will put the miniature bat,
ball and glove right there in the cradle with the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one, two, three years old, have them throwing the ball,
swinging a bat, whatever. Even encourage them to throw left-handed.
And when they start swinging a little bat, dad or mom might also
show them how to switch-hit. You never know, that could come in
handy later on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes McMichael a darn good scout. He won't leave
even a pacifier unturned in his search for the player of today, or
tomorrow. Granted, the odds are rather staggering on Hector
eventually cashing in off baseball. There are only 750 major-league
jobs in the world, and players from the Latin America countries own
nearly 25 percent of those. That percentage grows each season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 years, we've all seen a dynamic change in the
quantity and the quality of players available for the domestic
amateur draft,'' McMichael said. ``It's a direction our game has
gone, and we've got to change that direction, which to some degree
gets back to the parents becoming baseball fans again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s and '60s, a kid would grow up dreaming about being
a major- league player. Now he might be dreaming more about playing
in the NFL, the NBA, hockey, and so on. Or he might be dreaming
about getting an academic scholarship to a big college, and there's
nothing wrong with that. But the young children of today are
smarter than ever _ they know by elementary school what is out
there in the world, and what's available to them later on. The
choices are many, but in baseball, we often aren't among the
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why McMichael stresses parental recruitment by the
game. ``The baseball players of today in America are as good as
they've ever been, but there are just fewer of them at all levels,
starting in Little League,'' he said. ``If a country like the
Dominican Republic was involved in our amateur draft, only
California would have more players drafted. That's how much things
have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the talent search goes on and on as baseball prepares for
the annual amateur draft in June. Yesterday, McMichael was on the
road, traveling to a small town in western Pennsylvania to scout a
high school pitcher. If that particular kid eventually makes the
big leagues, and becomes a success, the formula would have gone
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``God-given athletic ability, an instinct for the game itself,
and maybe most of all, an unbending desire to reach a goal,''
McMichael said. ``Along the way, the distractions will have been
many, not only from the other sports but from so many outside
influences, some of them good, but some not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward for the successful is the best and most lucrative
work in America. And also, of course, the thrill of buying that
palatial beach home where the parents can immediately retire.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's never too soon for little Hector to be
throwing the ball and swinging the bat. Just remember Chuck's
scouting tip for toddlers _ throw left-handed and swing from both
sides. Even in diapers, there's nothing wrong with gaining the
early edge.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's response to the shooting
last month of an unarmed black man by a New York City police
officer has resulted in his lowest job approval ratings in seven
years in office, jolting his campaign for the U.S. Senate while
catapulting Hillary Rodham Clinton into the lead for the first time
in a year, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was completed on Wednesday night, found that
Giuliani's attempt to discredit the dead man, Patrick M. Dorismond,
has raised concerns about the mayor's temperament and
qualifications, while voters' perceptions of Clinton have improved.
The first lady now enjoys a 49-to-41 percent lead over Giuliani;
when undecided voters were pressed to state their leaning, Clinton
moves a full 10 points ahead of Giuliani, 52 to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, Giuliani is now tied with Clinton upstate, where he
is drawing just 44 percent of the vote, significantly less than
what a successful Republican statewide candidate customarily draws
north of New York City's suburbs. Clinton has been campaigning
regularly there, while Giuliani has been criticized by Republicans
for spending little time north of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He still commands a lead in the immediate suburbs. But in New
York City, where Giuliani's popularity was seen as a serious threat
to Clinton's Democratic base, Clinton is now defeating Giuliani by
nearly three-to-one, the Times/CBS News Poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, whose record as a crime-fighter has lifted him to two
victories in New York City and positioned him as a formidable
Republican challenger to Clinton statewide, has even suffered a
steep decline in the way voters, statewide and in New York City,
judge his actions on his signature issue: Crime reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The number of New York City residents who disapprove of his
handling of crime has jumped almost 30 points since fall, to 50
percent in this latest poll, and a majority believe that Giuliani's
law-enforcement policies have contributed to an increase in police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings among voters have spilled over from the mayor to the
New York City Police Department as well. New York City residents
believe that the police are more likely to use deadly force against
black suspects than white, and that brutality against minorities is
widespread. Nearly two-thirds of people in New York City said the
Police Department was doing only a fair or poor job, with the level
of dismay particularly high among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tension over police-community relations in the city has
heightened in the last six weeks, since the acquittals of four
officers in the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and then the
shooting of Dorismond, an unarmed man killed by an undercover
officer, last month. In the case of Dorismond, more than half of
voters statewide said the shooting would not affect their vote, but
one-third _ including 15 percent of the Republicans _ said they
were less inclined to vote for Giuliani because of how he handled
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News Poll was conducted Saturday through
Wednesday, with 1,573 respondents statewide. The margin of sampling
error for all registered voters statewide is 3 percentage points;
for New York City resident, is plus or minus 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the poll results Thursday night on WCBS-radio,
Giuliani said: ``My reaction is the same to all polls. That is,
they are momentary things.'' Then, alluding to the Dorismond
shooting, Giuliani said the polls ``are things that reflect
sometimes coverage of a particular situation. I think when all the
facts or known and everything is out there, things will return to a
much different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, attributed Clinton's gains in the
poll to her efforts to distinguish herself from Giuliani on issues,
though he acknowledged that Giuliani's difficulties in recent weeks
had undercut his campaign. ``The spotlight has been on his lack of
leadership in New York City,'' Penn said, ``and in fact now I think
the fundamental rationale for his campaign is evaporating because
if the people in New York City don't think he's done a good job as
mayor, how is he going to run as that as the major reason for being
the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The election is seven months and dozens of polls away, as the
mayor's aides noted on Thursday, and Giuliani enjoys a large
fund-raising edge over Clinton. The advantage of that money became
clear on Thursday morning, as Giuliani began a statewide series of
television advertisements. It was an early start for an advertising
campaign which suggests both the prosperity and the level of
concern in Giuliani's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even given the buffers of time and money, the Times/CBS
News Poll included a number of reasons for worry on the part of
Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By large numbers, voters believed that Giuliani inflamed the
situation over the Dorismond shooting and strongly disapproved of
Giuliani's decision to release Dorismond's confidential police
record. New York City residents have a decidedly negative view of
Giuliani's handling of race relations, and more than three-quarters
of the respondents in New York City described the shooting as
unjustified, Giuliani's arguments notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the immediate moment of the Dorismond shooting, events
over the past few weeks have appeared to reinforce the arguments
Clinton has offered against the mayor's candidacy. That is the kind
of shift political analysts look for in polls, since it suggests a
change in voters' attitudes that tend to be more consequential than
the back-and-forth of the weekly horserace.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of voters do not believe that Giuliani
cares about the ``needs and problems of people like yourself,'' a
measure on which Clinton continues to score highly. About 35
percent of respondents said that Giuliani was trying to divide
people, as Clinton has repeatedly charged, compared to 40 percent
who said that the mayor was seeking to bring people together.
Two-thirds of the voters said Clinton was trying to bring people
together.
</P>
<P>
   By an overwhelming margin, respondents said compromise was a key
attribute for a senator, and Clinton was seen as the more adept
compromiser of the two.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Giuliani's standing with black voters, which has
never been strong, is weaker than ever; the number of New York City
black voters who said they approved of Giuliani's job rating was so
low as to be virtually unmeasurable. That could prove to be a
meaningful finding, particularly if it turns out, as some Democrats
now believe is possible, that Giuliani's presence on the ballot
might encourage the kind of sizable turn-out in black neighborhoods
that has rarely been seen in New York elections.

ONLINE WITH A BULLET: BMG TO PUT TOP HITS ON THE INTERNET 
 &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a major strike against online music piracy, BMG Entertainment
Thursday said it would start selling downloadable versions of top
hits from major artists on the Internet this summer.
<P>
   BMG became the first of the world's five biggest record
companies to announce specific plans to use the Internet as a new
way to sell music and head off the threat from widely available
programs such as Napster that allow free distribution of legal and
illegal songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're offering them is an effective alternative to the
existing marketplace, which is largely pirated music,'' said Kevin
Conroy, BMG's senior vice president for marketing and new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering an alternative that works and will build what
we believe will be a very significant market for digital
downloading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy would not disclose prices for the downloadable music. In
the past, BMG has sold singles of its promotional and test
recordings for $1.99 each, with three songs going for $3.49. By
comparison, BMG as well as any major record label typically sells a
CD, which carries a dozen songs, for $15 in a store.
</P>
<P>
   BMG is home to more than 200 labels, such as RCA Records, Arista
Records and Windham Hill, and a stable of popular artists that
includes Christina Aguilera, Santana, Toni Braxton and Lonestar.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said the company would start offering singles from
as-yet-unspecified artists this summer, downloadable through the
Web sites of the individual labels and Web sites of regular
brick-and-mortar retail record stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to quickly expand the number of available
titles and, by the Christmas holiday season, have more full-length
CDs and a ``substantial amount'' of its catalogue &LR;  online.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said other record labels are expected to join BMG in
the world of digital downloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest commitment a big-five record label has
made to downloads, especially in terms of offering their most
popular, most lucrative content,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan, a media
analyst for International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to offer older works or `trial tracks' that
expire, quite another to sell current works by the most popular
artists. Others have made noise, but this is the first I know of
the promise of the most popular content.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the growing popularity of the MP3 audio
compression format to copy and transmit popular songs has seriously
threatened the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs now available legally on the Internet in the
MP3 and other downloadable audio formats are either promotional
tracks from major artists or songs from unknown artists.
</P>
<P>
   But illegal copies of top hits are also freely shared and
traded, a process made even easier with consumer-friendly swapping
programs like Napster, which the record industry has so far been
unable to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders and observers have long said the only
effective way to control so-called digital piracy was for the
record companies _ indeed, the media and entertainment industry as
a whole _ to offer their own selection of legally downloadable top
hits in a way that remained easy and cheap for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have any hope of stanching whatever losses they
perceive are out there, it has to be done by offering a legitimate
alternative,'' said Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications. ``To date, that just hasn't existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry, though, has been slow to respond because
its members have not been able to agree on technology to encode
music to prevent illegal copying and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called backshop digital-rights management technology to
handle this also ensures everyone in the chain, from artist to
retailer, gets their slice of the revenues. It's a tricky procedure
since royalty agreements even for one song can change from country
to country.
</P>
<P>
   Record and technology companies have been discussing those
standards during a yearlong, industrywide effort called the
Strategic Digital Music Initiative (SDMI).
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response to BMG's announcement, but the
other labels have all been taking steps toward offering music
online in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for example, a unit of Sony Corp., which includes
Sony Music, announced plans to start a company called Label Gate
Co. that will sell music over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Part of BMG's announcement takes the work of the SDMI into the
marketplace without waiting for an industry agreement.
</P>
<P>
   BMG has agreed to use digital-rights management tools made by
several competing companies instead of betting on one. BMG struck
deals with IBM, Santa Clara's InterTrust Technologies Corp.,
Microsoft Windows Media Technologies, Digital World Services and
Reciprocal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, BMG picked Liquid Audio Inc. of Redwood City to
make sure those proprietary and now incompatible tools work with
any format.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done is focus on creating a competitive
marketplace and not hand the keys to the kingdom to any one digital
download company,'' said Liquid Audio Vice President Andrea
Flemming.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will determine the winner in a ``sort of bake-off''
once digital downloading starts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``BMG has been preparing for this for awhile,'' Maclachlan said.
``It will be interesting to see if the solutions they came up with
will work without being too cumbersome and confusing to
consumers.''

 NEW YORK: New York elections.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More voters also offered a negative view of Giuliani's record on
education, which Clinton has attacked at almost every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found evidence of a racial divide in New York City
in perceptions of the Police Department. More than two-thirds of
blacks said that brutality against minorities by the Police
Department was widespread, compared with 23 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Times/CBS News Poll, conducted in February, Giuliani
and Clinton were statistically tied. In pulling ahead, Clinton has
gained support from male voters; the number of men backing Giuliani
has dropped to 43 percent from 54 percent. Her standing among women
has not changed; she is leading Giuliani, 52 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll came amid clear indications of concern in Giuliani's
camp about the state of his campaign. Thursday the mayor unveiled a
statewide television commercial that featured him campaigning on
Long Island with John McCain, the Arizona senator whose
unsuccessful campaign for the presidency attracted wide attention
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of advertisement that campaigns hold back until
the heart of the contest. And Giuliani's aides said he would step
up his previously lax campaign schedule.
</P>
<P>
   There were notable findings for Clinton as well. In particular,
there was an increase in the number of people who thought she was
spending more time attacking Giuliani than in explaining what she
would do in the Senate. The finding comes after two weeks in which
Clinton has turned up her attacks on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   For the mayor, the most disturbing news was probably the drop in
his job approval rating in New York City, because his popularity
there has been central to his standing.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest poll, only 32 percent of the New York City
residents approved of the way he is handling his job as mayor. His
previous low point was 42 percent, in a poll conducted by The Times
in March 1999, after the shooting of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani noted Thursday that his poll numbers had rebounded
after the Diallo episode, suggesting that he had time to recover
again. Still, even Giuliani's supporters have said that the mayor's
handling of the Dorismond case was more problematic, and follow-up
interviews with voters questioned in the poll suggested that a
number had been disquieted by Giuliani's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a big fan of Giuliani,'' said Frank Peskio, 57, a
Republican from Ulster County, ``but he's done some things in the
past year that I don't like, especially how he handled the
shootings. Coming up with the guy's criminal record right off the
bat was just totally uncalled for, and he continues to side with
the police all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fulkerson, 42, a Republican from Suffolk County, said
that he had supported Giuliani early on, but was now having second
thoughts. ``The Diallo case, the Dorismond case _ to me he was very
insensitive to those cases. That rubbed me the wrong way.''

BE WARY WHEN FRIENDS, FAMILY, BUSINESS ASSOCIATES OFFER
IPO  SHARES 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Everyone wants to get in on initial public offerings, but unless
you work for the company going public, there are only two ways to
get shares at the offering price. Both can raise ethical questions
if you get them as part of your job or if you're an elected
official.
<P>
   The first way is through a brokerage firm that's in on the deal,
but brokers generally reserve IPO shares for their biggest clients.
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown says he got in on eight IPOs in
four weeks late last year through his broker, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. There's nothing wrong with that, but the purchases raised
eyebrows partly because Brown says he wasn't using Morgan Stanley
much, since discount broker Charles Schwab was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to get IPO shares is to know somebody at the firm
going public who will put you in the ``friends and family''
program. It's the equivalent of getting your name on the list at a
popular nightclub so you don't have to wait in line with the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies going public let some or all of their employees
allocate shares to certain people outside the company. These people
get to buy stock at the initial price. Because most IPOs start
trading at a higher price, this almost guarantees a profit if the
investors sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, these ``directed shares'' went to 10 or 15 people
who were truly friends and family of the company's top executives.
Today, they might include thousands of people ranging from
hairdressers to business associates.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is growing so rapidly that friends-and-family
shares are becoming a new currency in the Bay Area. Some new
employees even negotiate friends-and-family shares as part of their
employment contracts.
</P>
<P>
   One company originally put 100,000 people _ essentially all of
its customers _ on the list, says Jim Creigh, an attorney with
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company was convinced that would be an
administrative nightmare, and pared the list.
</P>
<P>
   When a company offers IPO shares to people in other companies
they do business with, it can look like a gift or bribe. That's why
some companies forbid their employees from taking part in the
programs.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications, parent of Pacific Bell, says ``employees
should not participate in IPOs where the offer comes about because
of SBC's relationship to the company or underwriter,'' says
spokesman Selim Bingol.
</P>
<P>
   SBC worries that such programs ``could raise problems with our
code of conflict and possibly insider trading laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard also have banned employee
participation, if it's work related. When Hewlett Packard spun off
its Agilent subsidiary in an IPO, it didn't even offer a
friends-and-family program.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, however, haven't developed a policy because
until recently, it wasn't an issue. Also, the legal and ethical
questions are anything but clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, IPO shares are not necessarily a gift because they
require an up-front investment and could drop below the offering
price, creating a loss.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they are a gift, it is not illegal to give something
valuable to a person you do business with, as long as the person's
employer knows about it and there are no strings attached, says
Steve Freccero, an attorney with Morison &AMP; Foerster in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   However, offering or accepting IPO shares could in certain cases
violate California's commercial bribery statute.
</P>
<P>
   This law states: ``Any employee who solicits, accepts or agrees
to accept money or anything of value from a person other than his
or her employer ... corruptly and without the knowledge or consent
of the employer, in return for using or agreeing to use his or her
position for the benefit of that other person, and any person who
offers or gives an employee money or anything of value under those
circumstances is guilty of commercial bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   To be convicted under this law, Freccero says, the deal would
have to be made without the employer's consent, and with a quid pro
quo.
</P>
<P>
   If a client or business associate offers you IPO shares, the
easiest way to stay out of trouble is to simply notify your
employer.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of government employees, the laws are even stricter.
Freccero says federal workers ``not only have to avoid conflicts,
they have to avoid the appearance of conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, state and local officials and some employees must
disclose gifts worth more than $50 and are not allowed to accept
gifts from one source totaling more than $300 in one year, although
they can donate such gifts to charity.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is not clear whether stock in an IPO would be
considered a gift. Neither the city nor the state has a rule
regarding IPO shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is called the new economy, and the `new' is in there for
a good reason. It has raised a lot of issues the government hasn't
dealt with before, including this in particular,'' says Marc
Slavin, a spokesman for the San Francisco city attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun to take an
interest in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, you wouldn't get any questions (from the SEC)
about directed share programs,'' says Cori Allen, a partner with
Morrison &AMP; Foerster in Palo Alto. ``But in the last five deals
we've done, we've gotten questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says the SEC is more interested in procedure than who
participates. ``They want to know how people sign up for the
program, how the company decides who participates and they want to
see the literature related to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Creigh says companies need to be careful because, by law, a
stock offering can only be made with a prospectus. His firm advises
companies going public to privately come up with a
friends-and-family list, and then turn it over to the brokerage
firm doing the deal and let the brokers send out the proper
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON DIVERSIFYING FUNDS: On Wednesday, after the market's
violent swing, I encouraged readers to see how diversified their
mutual fund holdings are and to calculate their exposure to
technology, by looking at each fund's largest stock holdings. The
easiest way to get this information on a large number of funds is
by going to www.morningstar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the fund's name or ticker symbol and scroll down to ``Top
5 Holdings.'' Click on ``View additional holdings information'' and
you'll get a list of the top 25 holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Even more useful is the section right above the top 25 holdings,
called sector weightings. This will show what percentage of the
fund is invested in technology, energy, retail and other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the same article, I said that if you are in an S&AMP;P 500 index
fund, you already own a lot of tech stocks, including Intel and
Amazon.com. The latter company is not in the S&AMP;P 500 index.

CRACKERJACK TRAINING: NONPROFIT GROUP HELPS YOUTHS SHARPEN LIFE 
 SKILLS PITCHING SNACKS AT PACIFIC BELL PARK 
 &HT;     BY JENNIE YABROFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Selling ice cream on a cold, miserable windy night at 3Com Park is
a vendor's worst nightmare.
<P>
   Muma Okochi knew he had to come up with an unusual pitch last
year to get the attention of the baseball fans. That's when the
teenager hit upon the idea. ``I got creative, yelling things like
`Get your nice hot ice cream!' It got people's attention, and it
showed me that the job can be what you make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the 18-year-old from Hunters Point was in the
stands at Pacific Bell Park, selling Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   For Okochi, the invaluable work experience as well as the
assistance he got landing an academic scholarship to attend the
University of California at Berkeley this fall has come through the
efforts of a San Francisco nonprofit organization called Juma
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994 by Diane Flannery, the former executive director
of San Francisco's Larkin Street Youth Center, Juma Ventures
provides at-risk youth from low-income neighborhoods with jobs
selling ballpark concessions.
</P>
<P>
   A steady job is just one of many tactics that Juma uses to move
young people out of poverty. The wide-ranging program also includes
an education component, in which students get tutoring and other
help to finishing high school and apply for college.
</P>
<P>
   Juma also offers money-management programs, workplace mentoring
and career development services. In addition, it provides
internships with multimedia and Internet companies to encourage
participants to seek employment beyond food concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just having a job (selling ice cream) won't help these kids
make the transition out of poverty,'' said Kriss Deiglmeier, Juma's
chief operations officer. ``The job is a vehicle for impacting
change in all aspects of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For Okochi, the work opportunity has provided learning skills
that will help him in college and beyond. ``This job teaches you so
much more than working at McDonald's,'' said the youth during
Saturday's Giants exhibition game against the New York Yankees.
Okochi sold more ice cream bars last year than any other
participant in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Juma was born when Larkin Street's Flannery started
looking for business opportunities for high-risk youth who were
ready to join the workforce. The company bought the Chestnut Street
franchise of the Ben and Jerry's chain in 1994 and recruited
at-risk kids by working with schools and community groups in
low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the company began selling ice cream at 3Com Park. When
the Giants moved to their new park, Juma got the concessions
contract from Pac Bell Park to move with them, adding Tully's
coffee to their concessions. The business expanded to include a
Castro Street location in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Juma's stores and ballpark concessions make enough money to
cover their expenses. The organization also receives funding from
grants and private donors to provide additional services. Juma will
employ 110 young people at Pac Bell Park this summer, many of whom
will return to 3Com Park in the fall to work at 49ers games.
</P>
<P>
   Under Juma's program, first-year employees go through nine hours
of preseason training. The youths can choose between working at
booths inside the park or roaming the stands with insulated freezer
packs of ice cream bars.
</P>
<P>
   Tully's vendors wear ``jet packs'' of hot coffee strapped to
their backs and carry packets of cream and sugar. Booth workers
earn a starting wage of $6.50 per hour, while vendors in the stands
earn $6.50 plus commission, sometimes making up to $25 per hour.
Returning employees can take on added responsibility in
assistant-management positions.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Lewis, 17, is starting her fourth year with Juma,
having worked her way from being an ice-cream scooper at the Castro
Street Ben and Jerry's to an assistant supervisor of vendors at Pac
Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Okochi, Lewis comes from a disadvantaged background, and
like Okochi, she is unfailingly positive about her Juma experience,
crediting the company with changing her outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad attitude problem before I started working here,''
she said. ``The program taught me to maintain my composure, and get
along with all types of people. It built my communication skills
and management skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who attends San Francisco City College, interned at a
multimedia production company last year. She hopes to get a degree
in criminology and plans to pursue a law-enforcement career.
</P>
<P>
   Juma has worked with more than 760 youths during its six years
of operation. Deiglmeier estimated that about 20 percent of
participants drop out of the program and pointed out that the
program is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a youth has serious substance-abuse problems, he needs to
get involved with a treatment center. Then after that he might come
work for Juma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Participants) must be motivated to be employed and making
changes in positive directions. They have to be ready to grab hold
of this opportunity and succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting a new job in an untested venue might seem a daunting
prospect, but none of Juma's employees admitted to feeling nervous
before the Yankees game. That upbeat attitude, Deiglmeier said, is
``key to helping young people envision a future.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream stands ran out of every flavor except Cherry
Garcia at the previous evening's game against Milwaukee, but
according to server Edward Johnson, who dropped out of school for
two years before becoming involved with Juma, ``it was no
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who spent his two years out of school caring for his
disabled mother, is back in class at Ella Hill Hutch county
community school. His Juma earnings will go to help his mother,
with additional savings earmarked for the prom. Although he said
selling ice cream is ``a very new experience'' for him, he was
``not nervous at all'' about his new job.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only worries Juma employees own up to are concerns
about rowdiness at the forthcoming opening series with the Dodgers,
who are much hated by Giants fans.
</P>
<P>
   As last Saturday's game neared the final innings and the Yankees
took the lead, Juma workers began closing up shop. Tully's vendors
returned from the stands, unstrapping their jet packs from around
their waists. Ben and Jerry's staff sold a final ice cream bar to a
grateful fan, who said, ``You guys are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of 17-year-old Lana Baltodano's first night as a
Juma employee, and although she looked tired as she took off her
teal Ben and Jerry's visor, she said the evening had gone well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not nearly as hard as I expected,'' she said, adding
that she is looking forward to returning to the park for
regular-season games.

ADVERTISING: UNCONVENTIONAL MADISON AVENUE INITIATIVE WINS POSITIVE
REVIEWS
</HEADLINE>
  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after the start of an unusual collaboration between a
giant agency and seven creative ``hot shops,'' the participants are
giving the experiment generally high marks despite some
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   As the consortium, called the Syndicate, begins its second year,
there are changes in the lineup. Two additional small independent
agencies are joining, one that specializes in campaigns aimed at
black consumers and the other the first member from outside the
United States. As they come aboard, one agency is leaving because
of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Syndicate is indicative of the nontraditional ideas being
entertained by the Madison Avenue behemoths as they scramble to
counter the competition they confront from entrepreneurial
upstarts. At the same time, the mainstream agencies acknowledge
that change is easier to advocate than to carry out; after all,
despite the time and treasure devoted so far to the Syndicate, the
only work produced to date that has been approved to appear
nationally was a single print ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hit ratio wasn't great,'' acknowledged Rick Boyko, chief
creative officer at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather North America in New York, the
unit of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide that helped found the Syndicate
in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But because ``the goal of this is work that pushes in new
directions, tests the boundaries, we always knew that would be an
issue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every member of the Syndicate has been tapped for something
and every Ogilvy North America office has used the Syndicate,''
Boyko said, for clients that included Ford Motor, IBM, Seagram and
Sears, Roebuck, ``so from our point of view this has been
resoundingly positive.''
</P>
<P>
   That also appears to be the predominant perspective among the
smaller Syndicate members, which are being compensated with
retainers and other nonequity investments for granting Ogilvy North
America the benefit of their unconventional creative thinking. The
hot shops also gain access to the more substantial resources of
Ogilvy, owned by the WPP Group, in realms like research and media
services as well as an opportunity to work for far larger clients
than their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been going very well,'' said Marc Kempter, managing
partner at Core in St. Louis, one of the seven original dwarfs
recruited by Snogilvy White. ``We worked on a Ford project with
Ogilvy Detroit for a big chunk of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest frustration for us smaller, independent agencies
has been how much slower things move than we're used to, but Rick
told us to expect that,'' he added. ``The kind of clients Ogilvy
works with want presentation after presentation, while we usually
produce work very quickly for our more entrepreneurially focused
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyko identified Core as one of the busiest Syndicate shops,
along with two other charter members, Hunt Adkins in Minneapolis
and Work in Richmond, Va. The others are: Grant, Scott &AMP; Hurley in
San Francisco; Pyro in Dallas; Vitro Robertson in San Diego; and
Wong Doody in Seattle and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is Wong Doody that is leaving the Syndicate, Boyko said,
because that agency is taking part in a review for a large account,
Safeco, that had been handled by an Ogilvy North America sibling,
Cole &AMP; Weber in Seattle. That conflict and the potential for
others, which could impede Wong Doody's growth, led the agency to
withdraw in a decision that Boyko termed amicable.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Wong, chairman and creative director at Wong Doody, said:
``Cole &AMP; Weber is right down the street, two blocks away, and it
was a problem. But for us it was more that it wasn't right for us
at this stage in our growth. And there was a lot of confusion from
people who asked, `Are you owned by Ogilvy?'''
</P>
<P>
   That has not daunted the two new Syndicate members: Fuse in St.
Louis, the multicultural shop that had worked with Ogilvy North
America before joining the consortium, and Rethink in Vancouver,
British Columbia, the first participant not from this country.
Indeed, it was a print ad by Fuse for a big Ogilvy client, IBM,
that is the only Syndicate work that has actually made it into the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ogilvy is trying to get the best resources to fit a brand,''
said Clifford Franklin, president at Fuse, whose clients include
the St. Louis Cardinals and the Schnuck's supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already starting on a new IBM assignment as well as on
another piece of business,'' he added. ``This has been a great
experience for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That was echoed by Ian Grais, one of three partners who opened
Rethink last fall after leaving Palmer Jarvis DDB in Vancouver,
part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the black and don't need the guaranteed revenue,''
Grais said. ``We see this as the chance to work with Rick and
develop closer ties with small agencies we respect in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a chance at bat in the big leagues,'' he added.
``There's always the hope we can hit it out of the park for a big
national American client.''
</P>
<P>
   Grais continued: ``Both sides are maybe using each other a
little bit, but it seems to make good business sense. If Ogilvy
wants to use our name, that's fine. And if the more aggressive
creative we do pushes Ogilvy clients, we can benefit from that down
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange aspects of the Syndicate may be expanded, Boyko
said, as he is considering a plan by which creative talent from the
smaller agencies ``would spend time here at Ogilvy and vice
versa.''
</P>
<P>
   However Year 2 of the Syndicate turns out, Boyko said, laughing,
one task has already been accomplished: ``We're able to avoid the
`Seven Dwarfs' label, because there are eight of them now.''

U.S. ENERGY FORECASTER CHARTS FLOW OF OIL PRICES

   WASHINGTON _ Dispatched to Florida during the fuel-starved
summer of 1979 to coordinate President Jimmy Carter's re-election
effort there, Jay E. Hakes learned first-hand about the volatile
mix of high gasoline prices and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got down there, the gas lines hit again,'' said Hakes,
an Interior Department appointee at the time. ``Being identified
with the Carter White House, I was the closest target those people
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hakes is deep into another fuel crisis, but this time he is
at the opposite end of the information pipeline. As head of the
federal Energy Information Administration, Hakes is the nation's
chief forecaster of oil prices and supplies, a position that in
recent months has left him dispensing gloomy predictions by the
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last winter has been mainly bad news,'' said Hakes, who
has overseen the agency since the early days of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's decision to boost production did allow Hakes to deliver a
sunnier outlook Thursday as his agency's revised forecast showed
that gas prices will not now hit the unprecedented heights
predicted only last month and instead will average $1.46 per gallon
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more optimistic today,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A quasi-independent branch of the Energy Department, the EIA
pumps out volumes of data on all types of U.S. energy production,
distribution and consumption. Hakes refers to it as the Census
Bureau of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such dry, technical expertise is typically relegated to the
bureaucratic background of the capital. But the dramatic run-up in
fuel prices has made Hakes and the work produced by his 370
employees a hot commodity. One congressman recently hailed the
agency as the Paul Revere of rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Hakes traveled with Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, going ``toe-to-toe'' with
Middle Eastern oil analysts who reportedly came away impressed with
his knowledge of their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   He is regularly cited by administration officials as the last
word in price trends, summoned before House and Senate committees
and sought after by reporters. The agency's Web site recorded
35,000 visits in one day, and calls to a fuel hot line doubled in
February as truckers sought diesel price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in Congress do not believe the Clinton
administration did enough to sound the alarm about the prospect of
soaring petroleum costs. GOP lawmakers have scolded Hakes and
fellow Energy Department officials for being behind the curve.
</P>
<P>
   Hakes and others, however, say the EIA saw the price spike
coming last October, when its winter fuels report predicted sharply
higher fuel prices ahead, particularly for heating oil and propane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not quite get the magnitude of it, but we put out
pretty solid warnings,'' said Hakes, who attributed the price climb
to a combination of OPEC production cuts, increased world demand
and low U.S. oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Hakes, 55, does not have the resume expected of an international
energy guru. He holds a doctorate in political science from Duke
University and was teaching the subject at the University of New
Orleans before getting involved in Carter's 1976 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He first joined the Carter administration in the Agency for
International Development due to his expertise in African political
institutions, but he didn't like the job and shifted to the
Interior Department to work on energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost an accident in a way, but ever since that time I
have been very involved,'' said Hakes, who went on to run the
Florida Energy Office for then-Gov. Bob Graham and headed Graham's
state operations when the governor was elected senator. He took
over the EIA in 1993 and is the longest serving Clinton
administration appointee in the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the EIA in 1977, it was charged with
providing unbiased energy evaluations no matter who occupied the
White House. Hakes demonstrated his independence in 1998 when the
EIA forecast that energy prices would rise substantially if the
United States complied with an international treaty to reduce
global warming. The finding was at odds with both the White House
and environmentalists who argued the analysis was based on flawed
assumptions and did not account for technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   Hakes said he heard grumbling from the administration but faced
no pressure to revise the outlook.

BIG BOARD SUGGESTS ENDING LINKS AMONG EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The torturous process of reorganizing U.S. securities markets
took another turn Thursday when the New York Stock Exchange called
for ending the aging system that provides rudimentary links between
the Big Board, regional exchanges and the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange also declared its opposition to creating a national
``limit-order book'' that would closely link markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board proposes scrapping the two-decade-old
``Intermarket Trading System,'' which it says has become unworkably
complex and is obsolete thanks to proprietary systems that brokers
use to find the best prices across markets.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange's stance was foreshadowed in February when the Big
Board chairman, Richard Grasso, told a Senate Banking Committee
hearing that he was wary of linking to a broader system.
</P>
<P>
   But by so firmly coming out against a central limit-order book,
the exchange appears to be at odds with Goldman Sachs and other big
securities firms, which have called for the Big Board to work more
closely with new electronic networks that match buyers and sellers
directly. A limit-order book is a single system that would allow
traders and investors to buy or sell stock at the best price, no
matter which market is offering that price.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the government requires close links between the new
networks and existing exchanges, trading is likely to fragment
across different markets, and investors will never know whether
they are getting the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the exchange's announcement Thursday, Goldman
said only that ``we are supportive of the New York Stock Exchange's
reinvention initiative. However, we remain strong advocates of a
level playing field that allows every exchange and qualified
trading venue to compete for best execution through a system of
linkages.'' Other large securities companies did not return calls
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a speech Thursday before the Economic Club of
Washington, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, also appeared to take a view that differed from that
offered by the Big Board. ``Upstart electronic markets are
leveraging technology to challenge traditional exchanges, using
computers rather than humans to match buyers and sellers,'' Levitt
said. ``A fast expanding web of connections between customers,
brokers, and markets seems destined to weave our many and diverse
markets into a true National Market System.''
</P>
<P>
   In that environment, Levitt said, ``it would be a profound
mistake _ not to mention a dereliction of our statutory duty _ to
permit the isolation of any significant market from the rest of our
National Market System.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board highlighted several technological improvements
that it said would help keep the exchange the preferred place for
stock trading by executing small trades electronically and by
giving institutional investors more trading information.

BRAZIL PLANS EARLY PAYMENTS TO INTERNATIONAL LENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In perhaps the strongest sign yet that the
Brazilian economy is recovering from last year's currency crisis,
the country's central bank will repay early a large part of a $41.5
billion emergency loan package provided by the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced late Wednesday, would redeem $10.3 billion
of loans due in October to the IMF, the Japanese central bank and
the Bank of International Settlements. Of the $32 billion offered
by these institutions, Brazil had drawn $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After April, Brazil will owe $1.8 billion to the IMF and about
$9.5 billion to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank. These loans, which are considered nonemergency funds, have
lower interest rates and longer maturities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure shows that there is no crisis lurking around the
corner for which these funds could have been allocated,'' said
Octavio de Barros, the chief economist here for Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria. ``Brazil's risk exposure has simply, and
drastically, been reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Confounding most analysts' expectations, the economy of Brazil,
Latin America's largest, displayed surprising resilience after
currency devaluation in January 1999. Helped by strong farm
production and a record $30 billion in foreign direct investment,
the economy eked out nearly a percentage point of growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is only recently that data has begun to suggest that
Brazil is on its strongest economic footing in years. Industrial
production and automobile output are soaring while unemployment is
falling. And inflation has been kept in check by an austere
interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   These indicators, combined with the success of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government in raising taxes and cutting
spending, have again made Brazil an attractive destination for
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is following the example of Mexico, Latin America's
second-largest economy, in repaying funds provided by the U.S.
Treasury to ease the peso crisis of 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improved scenario has allowed the financial team to pay
off its obligations early, which is just prudent financial
management,'' said Paul Bydalek, president of Atlantic Rating, a
Brazilian bank-rating company. ``What remains to be seen is whether
this effort pays off as it did for Mexico.''

A NEW HAMPSHIRE DIVORCE BRINGS LOW ITS HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Add to the casualty list of collateral
destruction by horrible divorces the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court is in extraordinary crisis. It is temporarily hearing
no cases; its internal practices have been investigated, exposed
and criticized by the state attorney general; its very integrity is
under such fire that the chief justice held a news conference this
week to defend it, and its fate may be at the mercy of the
Legislature, which is expected to vote next week on whether to
investigate possible grounds for impeaching one or more justices.
</P>
<P>
   What precipitated all this was Justice W. Stephen Thayer III's
divorce from his wife, Judith, a former chairwoman of the state
Board of Education, a split so bitterly fought that Thayer appealed
it to her husband's territory, the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer resigned last week in a deal that let him avoid
the criminal charge of improperly trying to influence his
colleagues' handling of his case.
</P>
<P>
   The central question now is not criminal but political: whether
the Legislature, where some members are still furious at the court
for a 1997 decision requiring the state to revamp its school
finance system radically, will come down hard on a court that has
otherwise been long respected. Several lawmakers said the call for
a pre-impeachment type of investigation was likely succeed, but
their responses would depend on the facts that came out.
</P>
<P>
   The main trouble with the court, as detailed in two special
reports by Attorney General Philip T. McLaughlin, was this: On Feb.
4, Chief Justice David Brock told Thayer and his colleagues that he
had appointed two new judges to a special panel that was needed to
hear the Thayer vs. Thayer divorce appeal because the Supreme Court
justices had recused themselves. Thayer, along with another
justice, vociferously objected to one of the judges, George
Pappagianis. Brock then tried to hold back the court clerk from
calling Pappagianis to inform him of his new appointment, but the
clerk already had him on the phone, so the appointment stood.
</P>
<P>
   But the trouble went further. When accusations of Thayer's
interference led to an investigation by McLaughlin, he ended up
accusing the justices of a pattern of commenting to other justices
on cases from which they had recused themselves over personal bias
or potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture ``casts a very serious shadow over the
impartiality and fairness of the process for the litigants,'' said
Richard Hesse, interim dean at the Franklin Pierce Law Center here,
``and certainly does leave a shadow over what we profess is the
central proposition of our legal system, and that is a rule of law,
not a rule of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians have been quoting the New Hampshire
Constitution lately: ``It is the right of every citizen to be tried
by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will admit.'' And The
Manchester Union Leader said in an editorial Thursday, ``Even more
than clergy and police, judges need to hold themselves to
unimpeachable standards of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigating the divorce case, McLaughlin developed a
second central accusation. Thayer had recused himself from a case
involving a lawyer-friend and disclosed _ quite belatedly _ that he
had borrowed $50,000 from him. But he told the other justices that
his friend's opponent deserved harsher punishment than the justices
had given him.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, who a court spokesman said was not available Thursday for
comment, contended at his news conference on Monday that Thayer's
inappropriate statements had had no effect and complained that the
attorney general was suggesting ``that a few minutes of aberrant
behavior by a single justice constitutes the ongoing practice and
procedures of this court.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, as he stood flanked by two current and two
retired justices, ``In the collective experience of all the judges
standing here tonight, not one has ever seen any other member of
this court attempt to influence the merits of a decision in which
they were recused.'' Rather, he said, recused judges edited
decisions for things like grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements seem contradicted at several points in the 120
pages of investigative interviews and documents that McLaughlin
released on Wednesday. In particular, an investigator quoted
Justice Sherman Horton as saying that ``another type of comment is
one made by a recused justice who speaks about the result and
offers an opinion about why, as a matter of law, he disagrees with
the result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice Horton went on to say it's probably not right, but
it's done with a purpose to improve the outcome of the case,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also quoted Thayer, who has had no public comments since his
resignation, as saying he was not the only one who made substantive
comments on cases from which he had recused himself.
</P>
<P>
   The report disclosed other highly unjudicious moments. It was
the Supreme Court clerk who set off all the fuss. According to
Brock, when Thayer saw the memorandum that the court clerk, Howard
Zibel, had written to report the ethical lapses, he said, ``If
Zibel files this, it's going to blow up the Supreme Court, and I'm
not going to hang alone.'' Brock also recalled that Thayer said of
the clerk, ``The words `lock and load' come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If Thayer's desperation about the divorce comes through in the
reports, so does his colleagues' empathy. Richard Winters, chairman
of the government department of Dartmouth College, agreed that ``in
some sense the court responded to sentiment when they should have
responded as Solomons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very humanizing story,'' he said, ``but you don't want
to humanize the court in this fashion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Mirski, one of the court's foremost critics in the
Legislature, said that if the report was correct, ``and the judges
did collude, and recused judges participated in the making of
opinions before the court, they're all sort of guilty of
maladminstration, and that's an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire judges are appointed until retirement by the
governor, and can be removed only by the Legislature. Mirski said
justices can also be removed by a less elaborate method known as a
``bill of address,'' under which most anything can be cited as
grounds. Mirski is submitting bills for both impeachment and
address, he said, and the facts that emerge will determine which
fits better.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, which recently issued a new set of rules on
recusals, has promised a full accounting and response to all the
allegations in the attorney general's report. Political speculation
abounds about what might happen if more justices resigned or were
removed and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, got to replace them. In
particular, some ask, would that mean the much-disputed 1997 court
decision, which held that the state could no longer pay for its
schools almost entirely through local property taxes, might be
reconsidered?
</P>
<P>
   Come what may, said Marshall E. Quandt, one lesson is already
clear: ``If you're a judge, be nice to your wife.''

SINGAPORE TELECOM RENEWS EXPANSION EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ A month after losing a bid to buy Hong Kong's
leading telephone operator to an Internet start-up, Singapore
Telecommunications has renewed an effort to become the first
pan-Asian telecommunications company, this time by turning its
attention to neighboring Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   SingTel, as it is known, said Thursday that it was in talks to
buy a stake in Time Engineering, a financially troubled concern
with valuable telecommunications and Internet interests. It is a
unit of Renong, Malaysia's biggest company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Singapore company said no definitive agreement had
been reached, it said it was considering a 14.5 percent stake in
Time Engineering for 649 million ringgit, or $171 million. In
addition SingTel said that it was considering buying 40 percent of
Time dotCom, a spinoff of Time Engineering. The deal is subject to
due diligence, and the companies will try to finalize the deal by
early May.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining access to Malaysia's $3.4 billion
telecommunications market, such a purchase would allow SingTel to
take advantage of a fiber optic network stretching the length of
peninsular Malaysia from Singapore in the south to Thailand in the
north, where SingTel already owns a stake in a large Thai cellular
telephone operator.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Engineering, which is under court protection from
creditors, the deal would help in repaying part of its $1.3 billion
in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, analysts said the purchase would help SingTel
offset the effects of rapid deregulation in its tiny domestic
market by letting it offer more extensive services elsewhere in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by SingTel partly reflects the pressure on
telecommunications companies throughout much of the region, where
deregulation and the convergence of data and traditional voice
communications are forcing them to innovate and expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What telecom companies are running around struggling to figure
out is how to add value when access prices are plummeting,'' said
Joe Sweeney, director of research at the Gartner Group in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Government-controlled and run by the son of Singapore's former
prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, SingTel is one of the nation's 10
largest companies and has a $3.5 billion cash pile.
</P>
<P>
   It had hoped to use some of that money as part of an effort to
buy Cable and Wireless HKT of Hong Kong, but in late February was
thwarted by a rival offer from Pacific Century CyberWorks, a Hong
Kong Internet company run by Richard Li, son of the Hong Kong
multibillionaire Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's offer has become significantly less valuable
since then because of the global rout in technology stocks, which
cut Pacific Century's market capitalization by more than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication that SingTel might renew its effort
to buy Cable and Wireless HKT, however.
</P>
<P>
   SingTel's own stock price has dropped roughly a third this year,
largely because of concerns about the impact of increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Singapore government moved up the full
deregulation of its telecommunications market by two years to April
1, issuing 66 licenses for a variety of services that will compete
with SingTel.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, StarHub, a venture among British
Telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and two
government-linked Singapore companies, marked the end of SingTel's
monopoly with a street festival.
</P>
<P>
   SingTel has been fighting back with advertising and rate cuts.
Company employees have been wearing T-shirts that read ``We Are
Ready,'' with the first letters of each word aligned in red to
spell ``WAR.''

 McCAIN JOINS WITH GIULIANI FOR NEW TV COMMERCIAL  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign began
broadcasting a statewide television commercial Thursday that
starred the mayor's favorite political dance partner, Sen. John
McCain, and emphasized what the commercial said was Giuliani's
tolerance, truthfulness and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani's campaign advisers said the mayor
would campaign upstate at least three days this week and next, and
also appear at an upcoming series of statewide lunches aimed at
shoring up his support among female voters.
</P>
<P>
   The new energy of the Giuliani campaign comes as recent public
opinion polls, including a New York Times/CBS Poll, show the
Republican mayor slipping behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, after Giuliani's denigration of an unarmed black
man shot dead last month by police.
</P>
<P>
   The television commercial, called ``Integrity,'' was made in
less than 24 hours as a hurried attempt, Giuliani's advisers said,
to stanch the erosion of support. Produced by Adam Goodman, the
mayor's media consultant, the commercial is in effect a 30-second
documentary of a campaign bus trip to Long Island that Giuliani and
McCain made Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integrity'' opens with a long shot of the traveling bus, cuts
to footage of the mayor and McCain smiling and talking cheerily to
reporters on the VIP Peter Pan coach, then moves to a town hall
meeting at the American Legion post in Northport. There are shots
of grinning veterans, several town hall participants asking
questions, and McCain and Giuliani heartily shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, they rode a bus _ to spread a message of hope and
humanity to the people of New York,'' the announcer says in the
opening narration.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is seeking to appeal to the same independent and
Democratic voters who made McCain, an Arizona Republican, such a
phenomenon in the presidential primaries, was full of praise and
gratitude yesterday for the senator. Although Giuliani endorsed the
state Republican Party's choice, George W. Bush, in the March 7 New
York primary, the mayor infuriated the party by refusing to engage
in hardball tactics against McCain. Instead, the mayor spoke fondly
and often of the senator. McCain has speedily returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used John McCain in my current campaign commercial because
he offered to be used,'' the mayor said at a news briefing at City
Hall. After McCain lost the New York primary and dropped out of the
presidential race, Giuliani added, the senator has ``repeated to me
over and over since then, `I want to help you _ you're my No. 1
priority.'''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, Giuliani said, is ``not something that I had to
persuade him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not return telephone calls to his office Thursday
seeking comment, but he said on Tuesday that he looked forward to
having Giuliani as a ``soul mate'' in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the commercial, the first that his campaign has
broadcast simultaneously in all major television markets in the
state, ``does not suggest at all that we're not going to campaign
with George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said he expected ``at some point'' to make a
commercial with Bush. But Giuliani, concerned about Bush's embrace
of religious conservatives, kept his distance from the Texas
governor during the New York primary. Bush is now running behind
Vice President Al Gore in opinion polls in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial seeks to emphasize similarities between Giuliani
and McCain. As the camera moves in for a close-up on McCain, a
former prisoner of war in Vietnam, the narrator says one of the two
men is ``an authentic American hero dedicated to integrity and
reform.'' Then, as a shot appears of Giuliani, speaking in his
shirt sleeves, the narrator says the other man is ``an authentic
New York leader, ready to make a difference for an entire state _
and, the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, the media consultant, said Thursday that he expected
McCain to join Giuliani on the campaign trail again soon and that
the point of the commercial was to show ``two true leaders'' who
``through synergy and by symmetry'' offer ``a fresh approach to
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Penn, Clinton's pollster, had a different opinion. ``I
don't think it meets the laugh test,'' he said. ``It runs counter
to everything everyone knows about Giuliani rather than confronting
his problems or the issues. He's pretending they don't exist.''

MOHAWKS GET U.S. APPROVAL FOR CASINO IN CATSKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday approved plans for a
$500 million casino to be operated by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe in
the Catskills area of upstate New York, where local officials,
hotel owners and many residents have long hoped that gambling might
bring an economic revival to the depressed resort area once known
as the Borscht Belt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, 30 acres of land next to the Monticello
Raceway in Sullivan County would be put in trust for the Mohawks
for a casino complex.
</P>
<P>
   The plan must be approved by Gov. George Pataki, but after 30
years of efforts to reverse the fortunes of a rural county where
many hotels are shuttered and one-third of the families earn less
than $26,000 a year, proponents said the federal letter of approval
was a huge step forward.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.8-million-square-foot casino complex, which would be 90
miles from New York City, is expected to draw more than 9 million
visitors a year, fueling jobs and businesses in Sullivan County.
Analysts predict that it will hobble the growth of the casino
market in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has said he's supportive of Indian casinos in
traditional resort areas like the Catskills,'' said Michael McKeon,
a spokesman for Pataki. ``But we want to give ourselves a chance to
look over the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, Pataki has come under sharp attack
from anti-gambling forces in New York, as well as from Donald Trump
and other casino operators in Atlantic City. Union activists have
also been critical, because the Indian casino would not be bound by
labor or civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun starts now,'' said Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the
Sullivan County Legislature. ``We're going to make a final push on
this deal. All the anti-casino activists and Donald Trumps will
come out of the woodwork. Albany will be a battleground. If it's
approved, it will spur development the likes of which have never
been seen in Sullivan County before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is unconstitutional to operate a casino in New York state,
except on the sovereign land of Indians; the Turning Stone casino,
for example, is operated by the Oneida Nation 30 miles east of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years ago, a group of investors and local
business people in Monticello offered to donate 30 acres to the
Mohawks for a casino project.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks, in turn, asked the Interior Department to take the
land in trust for the tribe under a seldom-used provision of
federal law. The trust would establish a tax-free sovereign Indian
territory where one did not previously exist. The Mohawks already
have a small money-losing casino at their tribal home on the
Canadian border near Hogansburg, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Kevin Gover, the assistant secretary for Indian
affairs, sent a letter to Pataki saying that he had determined that
a casino ``would be in the best interest of the tribe and its
members, and would not be detrimental to the surrounding
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that the merits of the project would
lead to its approval,'' said Robert A. Berman, a financier and
local resident who leads the group that plans to build the casino.
``After close examination of the application and years of review,
it's not surprising that the federal government came to a positive
determination. We hope that Governor Pataki will agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement with the Mohawks, Berman's
group would build and operate the casino under a seven-year
management contract giving the tribe 65 percent of the revenue.
That percentage may change as the contract is reviewed by the
National Indian Gaming Commission. The tribe, in turn, would
contribute about $5 million a year to the county.
</P>
<P>
   Berman's partners include Ralph and Joseph Bernstein, developers
based in New York, and Alpha Hospitality, a casino operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in years there's a buzz in Sullivan
County,'' said U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who had
lobbied the Interior Department on behalf of the casino project.
``I'm going to try to persuade the Governor that the state should
stand aside and let it happen. This is the kind of shot in the arm
this area needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a casino in Monticello touched off a land rush
last year, in which politically connected developers spent more
than $40 million snapping up woodland, dilapidated hotels and golf
courses. But little construction followed.

RIGHTS OF GAYS AS PARENTS ARE WIDENED BY NEW JERSEY COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Significantly expanding the parental rights of
gay and lesbian people in New Jersey, the state Supreme Court ruled
Thursday that a lesbian who had helped raise her former partner's
twins deserved visitation rights after the couple's breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates called the decision the clearest ruling yet
that so-called psychological parents should be treated the same as
biological parents in child custody disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another nail in the coffin of the opposition's idea that
we shouldn't be around children,'' said Wendy Berger, president of
the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies not only to gay and lesbian parents but also
to any unmarried couples where one partner is not a biological
parent. ``Our clients and other lesbians and gay men are always
asking for just an equal application of the legal rules,'' said
Ruth E. Harlow, deputy legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund. ``And that's what we got here.''
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a woman who became pregnant by artificial
insemination shortly after beginning a relationship with another
woman. She gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, in 1994. The two
women moved in together and held a commitment ceremony in 1995. But
the following year, the biological mother ended the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous ruling, the court borrowed from a 1995 decision
in Wisconsin that established a four-part test to determine whether
someone had attained the status of a functional or psychological
parent. He or she must have had the consent of the child's legal
parent, lived with the child, taken on responsibility for the
child's care and done so for enough time to forge a parental bond
with the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a third party has been determined to be a psychological
parent to a child,'' Associate Justice Virginia Long wrote in
Thursday's decision, ``he or she stands in parity with the legal
parent.''
</P>
<P>
   The court disregarded a group called Concerned Women for
America, which warned in a friend-of-the-court brief against a
heavy judicial hand favoring the homosexual agenda. The group had
argued that the Legislature was the appropriate forum for the issue
and said the courts were deliberately misconstruing the law to
reach a politically correct result.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures in a few states, such as Connecticut, Hawaii,
Massachusetts and Virginia, have already passed laws allowing
judges to grant custody or visitation rights to people unrelated to
a child if it is in the child's best interest. And courts in
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have granted some
visitation rights to nonbiological parents, said Leslie Cooper, a
lawyer for the lesbian and gay rights project of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Justice Long noted that New Jersey family law
already provided that children should not be cut off from contact
with one parent when the parents' relationship ends. That law
states that the ``word `parent,' when not otherwise described by
the context, means a natural parent or parent by previous
adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Long wrote, ``Although the Legislature may not have
considered the precise case before us, it is hard to imagine what
it could have had in mind in adding the `context' language other
than a situation such as this, in which a person not related to a
child by blood or adoption has stood in a parental role vis-a-vis
the child.''

EDITORIAL: SOCIAL COMBUSTION IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   Reports are only now reaching the United States of serious
unrest in the northeast Chinese mining city of Yangjiazhangzi
almost six weeks ago. An account in The Washington Post this week
described three days of violent rioting over job cuts and
corruption that overwhelmed local police forces and continued until
regular army troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of social upheaval that terrifies the
leadership in Beijing, who well know that protests by disenchanted
citizens could someday escalate again into a serious threat to
Communist rule. Hundreds of economic protests, some of them
violent, have erupted across China in recent years, rarely, if ever
reported in the Chinese news media.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangjiazhangzi events were unusually unruly, but worker and
peasant protests have become increasingly frequent. Market reforms
like the privatization of large state companies produce
unemployment and social dislocation. When this takes place in an
atmosphere of pervasive government corruption, popular anger is
understandable. Unless Beijing enforces higher ethical standards on
local officials, unrest could soon become even more widespread.
State companies are scheduled to lay off more than 10 million
workers before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Anger over alleged corruption seems to have played a major role
in Yangjiazhangzi. Miners, a formidable protest group in many
societies, were already aggrieved over economic issues. A large
state-owned molybdenum mine there stopped issuing paychecks early
last year. Last November, most of the mine was shut down, but some
of its facilities and equipment were apparently transferred to new
private owners alleged to be friends of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   What detonated the violence was the belated announcement of an
extremely modest severance package for the laid-off workers. The
contrast between what looked like an undeserved windfall for the
well connected and the shabby treatment of longtime employees
became even more of an affront when mine authorities refused to
show up at a peaceful protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, Communist leaders in Beijing have seemed
haunted by fears of explosive social unrest. Their answer has
generally been repression, along with strident nationalist
campaigns designed to distract the country's attention from
economic grievances. Instead, Beijing should crack down on the
corruption that has grown worse with the progress of economic
reform. Show trials of a few spectacularly corrupt individuals have
not been enough to discourage others on the take.
</P>
<P>
   Market reforms have benefited China and brightened economic
prospects for many of its workers and peasants. But the current
phase of selling off state factories and mines is creating
hardships for many longtime employees. When they see local party
officials drawing illicit profits from their sacrifices, they are
sure to protest. Beijing should heed the message from
Yangjiazhangzi.  &QL;

JURY DENIES ISUZU DAMAGES IN LAWSUIT AGAINST MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury decided Thursday that Consumer Reports
magazine had not defamed and disparaged Isuzu Motors in an article
that called the Isuzu Trooper unsafe because of a tendency to tip
over during sharp turns.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in U.S. District Court here found that Consumers Union,
which publishes the product review magazine, had made false
statements about the Trooper, a sport utility vehicle. But the jury
ultimately ruled for Consumers Union, saying Isuzu had not proved
that the consumer group had acted with malice.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month trial was watched closely because a verdict
against Consumer Reports would have discouraged the media from
publishing negative reviews. It was also of interest to the auto
industry because the greater tendency of SUVs, as compared with
cars, to roll over has become a public safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed victory in the case. Consumers Union does not
have to pay any of the $242 million in damages that Isuzu had
demanded. But the Japanese automaker got some measure of
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to court asking this jury to find that Isuzu was the
victim of false statements, and the jury so found,'' Christopher C.
Spencer, one of the lawyers representing Isuzu, said after the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda H. Karpatkin, the Consumers Union president, said, ``While
we regret that the jurors did not find every one of the 17
published statements under consideration to be fully accurate,
their verdict generally acknowledges the honesty of our testing and
reporting staff and our belief in our procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports had rated the 1995 and 1996 Isuzu Trooper ``not
acceptable'' in an October 1996 review, saying it had a tendency to
tip over on two wheels in a driving test. The same vehicle was also
sold as the Honda Acura SLX.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu charged Consumers Union with product disparagement and
defamation, arguing that it had essentially rigged the tests to
produce an attention-grabbing story and to further its campaign to
have the federal government mandate safety standards to reduce the
potential of the vehicle to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union maintained that it told the truth and that its
tests were valid. But the group also argued that its statements
were opinion, which cannot be proven true or false and which
deserve protection under the right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Because the judge, Richard A. Paez, had previously ruled that
Isuzu was a public figure, the automaker not only had to show that
the Consumers Union statements were false and that they had damaged
Isuzu. It also had to prove that Consumers Union had acted with
actual malice, meaning that it either knew its statements were
false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that in seven of the eight false statements,
malice could not be proved. In the eighth, in which Consumers Union
had said that the cars should never have been allowed on the road,
the jury found that Consumers Union had spoken with reckless
disregard for the truth. However, it found that Isuzu was not
damaged by that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union, a nonprofit organization, still faces a lawsuit
filed by Suzuki Motor Corp. over a similar article on the tendency
of the Suzuki Samurai to tip over.

SHARES OF BRITISH WEB AUCTION COMPANY LEAP
</HEADLINE>
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of QXL.com, a British Internet company, soared 132
percent Thursday after an analyst for one of the brokerage firms
that underwrote QXL's offering six months ago forecast that the
shares would rise more than tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   QXL.com leaped $29.484375, to $51.984375, in Nasdaq trading,
after trading as high as $117.375. Thomas R. Bock, an analyst for
SG Cowen, released a report saying that QXL.com was set to become
the dominant Internet auction company in Europe and that its price
could reach $330 within 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   The combined volume in London and Nasdaq trading Thursday
slightly exceeded the number of shares in public hands.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the investment opinion could not have been better
for some of the insiders at QXL.com, whose shares had been sliding
for the last month amid a general setback for European Internet
stocks. The lockup period, during which insiders were barred from
selling shares, ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was also the day that a three-for-one split of QXL.com
shares took effect.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday night, Bock said he had
released the report Thursday because ``that is when I got done with
it.'' He said he was unaware of the lockup expiration. ``I took a
fundamental analysis of the company,'' he said. ``Lockup periods
are not something I analyze.''
</P>
<P>
   The shares that trade in New York are depository receipts, equal
to five common shares as traded in London.
</P>
<P>
   QXL.com went public last October when it offered depository
receipts at $5.38 each, adjusted for Thursday's split. The
prospectus for that offering said that insiders would be free to
begin selling part of their holdings ``beginning on the date six
months after'' the shares were admitted to trading on the London
Stock Exchange. They began trading in London on Oct. 7. The lead
underwriter for the offering was Credit Suisse First Boston, with
Cowen one of three co-lead firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bock, who is 28, joined Cowen in February after being part of
the Internet analysis team at PaineWebber. ``He has U.S. Internet
experience and is looking at European Internet properties,'' said
Robert Lewis, a managing director of Cowen and head of its global
technology research group. ``We're thrilled to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bock is based in New York, but is planning to move to London
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lockup provisions are common in initial public offerings,
providing some assurance to buyers that the supply of shares will
be restricted for some period.

NEGOTIATIONS BREAK DOWN IN ELIAN CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Immigration officials on Thursday shut down
negotiations with family attorneys hours after Juan Miguel Gonzalez
of Cuba arrived in the United States and demanded the return of
Elian, his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision to terminate discussions that spanned over
five days, government officials delivered a devastating blow to
efforts by the boy's attorneys who have been embroiled in a custody
battle over the child.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials refused to concede to any demands made by
attorneys involving the transfer of custody of the boy, the Miami
attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wallis, district director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Miami, said U.S. authorities were ``very
disappointed'' at the position taken by Elian's Miami relatives
after talks between the two sides foundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge everyone to put the well being of Elian before all
else in this process,'' Wallis said. ``We will soon provide the
relatives with a letter, setting forth the process for reuniting
Elian with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gonzalez's long-awaited arrival to the United States,
tensions mounted in Miami. By evening, more than 300 people were
protesting in the Little Havana community where Elian is staying
with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. More than 200 people marched
in a raucous but orderly demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant statement shortly after he stepped off the plane
from Havana, Gonzalez _ with his second wife and baby son _ said
the custody battle over Elian has been ``an agonizing experience''
because he has seen him ``submitted to cruel psychological
pressures aimed at influencing his personality already weakened by
the terrible trauma'' of losing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the pressures on the child by his Miami relatives,
Cuban exile leaders, U.S. politicians and the media amount to
harassment and has contributed to tension in Miami's Little Havana,
where Elian has been staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days, my family and I have been alarmed to see
the pressure exacerbated in Miami and dangerous displays that make
us fear for the safety of my son,'' said Gonzalez, referring to
protesters, who earlier this week broke through police barricades
around the home of Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and vowed
not to allow Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's been paraded and exhibited in public rallies and by
the media with a clear intent to obtain political advantage (over
Cuban leader Fidel Castro) from this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly impatient to have him returned to me as soon as
possible and go back to Cuba together immediately,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled that he is willing to remain in the United States if
necessary to allow the case to be settled in court as long as he
can be reunited with his son and be allowed to care for him.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday the arrival of Gonzalez should
be ``a big help'' in resolving the controversial custody case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the rule of law will prevail in this country,''
Clinton told CBS News anchor Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, a member of the relatives' legal
team, angrily denounced the U.S. government, saying the talks had
ended with Immigration and Naturalization officials willing to
discuss only how _ not whether _ to transfer Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys had asked for an independent panel of three
psychologists to determine how Elian would be affected by being
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   More disappointing, the attorneys said, was the government's
refusal to guarantee that the boy will remain in the United States
while his appeals are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that any clear-minded person will realize that these
conversations should never have gotten to this point,''
Garcia-Pedrosa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, the government would not guarantee to us,
even if we made an agreement with them, that the father, Juan
Miguel, would not take the child to Cuba right away, even during
the pendency of an appeal. The government rejected the standard of
the best interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear, however, is how and when the transfer of
custody will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said that reuniting Elian
with his father ``is not only a matter of federal law ... it is
simply the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said Attorney General Janet Reno would likely meet Friday
with Gonzalez to hear ``his concerns.'' He said Reno hopes to
secure a legally binding commitment from him to remain in the
United States until the court appeals process pursued by the Miami
relatives has run its course. A hearing has been scheduled in early
May.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Holder said, every effort will be made to
ensure that father and son are reunited _ if not in Miami or
Washington, then in some other location that both sides agree on.

   The U.S. team is a Dream Team of sorts, featuring the world's
No. 1- and No. 2-ranked singles players in Andre Agassi and Pete
Sampras, and the world's top two doubles players in Alex O'Brien
and Jared Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the second time since tennis rankings began in 1974
that the top singles and doubles players are playing Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's McEnroe, holder of 20 U.S. Davis Cup records,
captain for the first time on American soil. The Americans rallied
to beat host Zimbabwe in February.
</P>
<P>
   When McEnroe says, ``I expect us to win every match, including
doubles,'' he is not playing mind games. It's what he believes and,
perhaps most important, what he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Zimbabwe's more dangerous (than the Czech Republic),''
McEnroe said. ``We are overwhelming favorites, even more so than we
were in our first match. If Sampras and Agassi are playing to their
potential, they should win all of their matches. . . . We're at a
big advantage, playing at home and at a place where we'll get the
most exposure: the Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   How are Sampras and Agassi? They're not 100 percent _ Agassi is
playing on a sprained ankle he suffered last week in Key Biscayne,
Fla., and Sampras arrived exhausted after winning the event. But
Sampras has hit well each day and is ready to take on Jiri Novack
in the first match, at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who faces Slava Dosedel following Sampras-Novack, has
practiced each day with his ankle taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stable, which was all I was hoping for at this point,''
he said. ``It's not great . . . but it's in plenty good enough
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs also are aware of the American prowess. All week,
captain Jan Kukal has said he is preparing his team to play
``probably the best team ever.'' And on paper, the Czechs would
seem heavy underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Novack is ranked 39th in the world. He has lost twice this year
to Agassi and lost in five sets to Sampras four years ago in the
U.S. Open second round.
</P>
<P>
   Dosedel, ranked 48th, lost to Agassi in last year's Australian
Open second round and lost to Sampras in this year's Australian
second round. He's 0-4 lifetime against the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Novack accounted for all three of his country's points in
the first-round victory over Great Britain, and he's 5-1 in Davis
Cup singles matches and 4-0 when teamed with David Rikl in Davis
Cup doubles. Novack and Rikl will play O'Brien and Palmer on
Saturday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, funny things often happen in Davis Cup _ check out Chris
Woodruff beating Zimbabwe or McEnroe's six-hour, 22-minute victory
over Mats Wilander of Sweden in 1982. So the Americans, mindful of
their Goliath-like status, are trying to avoid overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go into any match thinking it's a done deal,''
O'Brien said. ``We have to go out and do a job, and that's win the
match.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want (upsets) to happen here in our back yard,''
Agassi said.

KEEPING A GOOD THING GOING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Every challenge put before the Los Angeles
Lakers has been mowed down in rapid succession, leaving them but
one feat to achieve in the regular season:
</P>
<P>
   Stay focused with nothing left to play for.
</P>
<P>
   At 64-12, the Lakers have clinched the best record in the NBA
and homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs, with six games to
play. ``This makes it easier, actually, if guys can take a
breath,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``We're not going to let up on
our push to stay the top team and keep our winning going. But we
will reduce some guys' minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson now has the luxury of resting his older veterans (Ron
Harper, A.C. Green) and his big-minute stars (Shaquille O'Neal,
Kobe Bryant). But the Lakers want to maintain their intensty, too,
a task that will be made easier by the caliber of opponents: San
Antonio twice, plus Seattle, Sacramento and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get out there and play, you're not thinking about
anything, just thinking about the game, thinking about the the
competition, the moment,'' Bryant said. ``Our intensity comes from
our execution. We have to shift our mindset to that. Just improve
our execution, because playoff time, that's what counts. . . . I
think that's what should be our motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher said several Lakers are banged up and can use the
well-earned rest. Robert Horry, whose sore knees forced him out of
Wednesday's game, is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now realistically, coach can kind of maneuver his
rotation, maneuver certain ways that we play the game, make sure
that everybody's not necessarily rested but at least healthy going
into the playoffs,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' last two victories, at Golden State and Phoenix,
were anything but smooth, requiring huge production from O'Neal (81
points) to offset 40 percent shooting from the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shots just aren't going down,'' Fisher said. ``You start to
feel really weary in the legs about this time. It really gets
mentally tough to just bring it every single night and physically
get yourself going. You could tell we were dragging (Wednesday).
Hopefully, we've got these good quality teams coming and four games
at home, we'll be able to play with a lot more energy and kind of
get things going back in a more positive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   One last note on the homecourt advantage: In the last 20 years,
the team with the best record has gone to the finals 15 times.
Eleven of them won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Milestone watch: If nothing else, the Lakers can continue
their season-long task of rewriting record books.
</P>
<P>
   At 27-1 since the All-Star break, the Lakers need just four wins
in the final six games to record the best post-All-Star winning
percentage (.912) in NBA history. Utah holds the mark, at .886
(31-3) in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 64 wins are already the franchise's best since
1986-87, when the Lakers went 65-17 on the way to the championship.
With a 5-1 record down the stretch, they can tie the 69-win season
posted by the 1971-72 Lakers, who also won the title.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, a sweep of the last six games would extend their
winning streak to 17 and make them only the second team in history
to reach 70 wins. Only Jackson's 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72-10) have
done it.
</P>
<P>
   __ Playoff tickets: Tickets for all Lakers playoff games go on
sale Saturday at 10 a.m. Tickets are available at the Staples
Center box office, with a limit of four per person, per game.
Random priority numbers will be distributed at 8 a.m.
</P>

MCENEROE STILL FIRING VERBAL VOLLEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Boldly predicting a United States Davis Cup
victory over the Czech Republic isn't the only strong opinion John
McEnroe voiced this week. On the occasion of this, his first time
captaining the U.S. team on American soil, McEnroe was outspoken.
Some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   Besides railing against the Cup schedule, in which nations play
four weekends spread out over a calendar year (he thinks the
schedule should be condensed), and praising Pete Sampras for
joining the team, McEnroe said being Davis Cup captain isn't fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun is not the word I would use to describe it, but at the
same time, because I believe in it, I think it's worth it,''
McEnroe said. ``The fun is when (Chris) Woodruff hit that ace on
match point (in Zimbabwe in February). Then there's that moment
when you hug and rally around each other, and there's this joy for
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great moment, then everyone goes their separate
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it pleasant when McEnroe had to call Woodruff and tell
him he won't play in this weekend's quarterfinal. Woodruff
originally wasn't playing in the first round, either, but he filled
in for an injured Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel bad that you have to tell someone who obviously had
the greatest moment of his career, `Thanks a lot, but keep ready,'
'' McEnroe said. ``He's sitting in Tennessee feeling like he's not
part of it. He, in all likelihood, would be the guy I call once
someone couldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   One place McEnroe didn't venture an opinion was to say if this
team, with top-ranked Agassi and No. 2 Sampras is better than the
'92 team featuring Agassi, Sampras . . . and McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer that. I'm captain,'' he said. ``If I
were a player, I'd have a different answer.''

THE METS ARE STRUGGLING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the New York Mets were shut out on Wednesday
night, one San Diego Padres coach noticed, it was obvious they were
not swinging the bat well. Some pitches that should have been
crushed turned into meek outs, and the Padres were hopeful that
trend would continue one more night. A lineup like the Mets', the
coach said, was not likely to struggle for long.
</P>
<P>
   But it is struggling now, and the rest of the team's play isn't
much better.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres beat the Mets Thursday night, 8-5, at Shea Stadium.
The Mets' starting lineup had only three singles, and the team's
batting average now stands at .193. Their No. 1 starter, Mike
Hampton, was not sharp for the second start in a row, failing to
get out of the sixth inning. And the Mets' defense made two errors,
leading to three runs for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego right-hander Matt Clement presented the Mets with
a different look from the finesse starters who befuddled them in
the first two games of this series. But the result was the same.
The Mets could not touch Clement, who was overpowering for six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Manager Bobby Valentine started inserting
pinch-hitters did the Mets' offense begin to stir, and by then the
Padres had a seven-run lead. With two outs in the seventh, Kurt
Abbott and Jay Payton singled, and Melvin Mora was hit by a pitch
to load the bases. The Mets got one run on a bases-loaded walk by
Edgardo Alfonzo, but Mike Piazza flied out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   That made the Mets hitless in their last 24 at-bats with runners
in scoring position. Their last hit in that situation was the grand
slam by Benny Agbayani that won the second game in Tokyo last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was Agbayani who ended the Mets' futility Thursday night,
lining a pinch-hit double that scored Todd Zeile in the eighth.
Todd Pratt, the backup catcher, hit a three-run homer in the ninth
in his first at-bat of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 2-0 in the fifth inning Thursday night, the Mets
started a rally in spite of themselves. With Rey Ordonez on first
and nobody out, Hampton failed on three attempts at a sacrifice
bunt. He ended up blooping a curveball into left field, giving the
top of the Mets' order a chance to drive in Ordonez from third.
</P>
<P>
   But Rickey Henderson grounded to third, and Ordonez was caught
in a rundown for the out. Then Darryl Hamilton grounded to first,
trapping Hampton in a rundown. Alfonzo grounded to short for the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   That was Clement's game: ground balls. He throws a sinking
fastball and a slider with dramatic movement, pitches that draw
frequent comparisons to those of Kevin Brown, the Los Angeles
Dodgers' ace. The assortment gets Clement a lot of ground balls,
and no National League starter averaged more double plays per nine
innings last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had never faced Clement, are the kind of team that
struggles against him: They have only two left-handed hitters in
their lineup, and Clement held right-handers to a .235 average last
year. The Mets had trouble driving anything off him, grounding out
12 times, striking out seven times and flying out just once.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres increased their lead in the sixth inning. Ordonez,
who did not commit an error in his final 100 games last year, made
his second error this season, overthrowing Zeile at first base
after fielding Ruben Rivera's leadoff grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera scored when Bret Boone rapped a single through the right
side of the infield, where Alfonzo, the second baseman, was
shifting to cover second on a hit-and-run. A sacrifice fly by Ed
Sprague brought home the fourth run, and Hampton left after walking
the next hitter. He walked three Thursday night after walking nine
in his first start.
</P>
<P>
   The night turned ugly for the Mets the next inning. With a
runner on second and two outs, Eric Owens lofted a ball to
right-center field that fell between Hamilton and Bell, who both
dived for it. Bell scurried over to get the ball, then overthrew
Alfonzo for an error, allowing Owens to circle the bases.

VENEZUELAN CALLS TUNE IN OPEC'S PRICE TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ For helping to engineer the spectacular
rise in oil prices over the last year, fellow members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have rewarded him
with the group's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ali Rodriguez Araque, Venezuela's minister of energy, faces
the daunting task of stabilizing prices at a level that both
producers and consumers will find acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's sudden emergence as OPEC's public face is just one
sign of the higher profile in international energy affairs that
Venezuela is vigorously seeking. Since President Hugo Chavez took
office 14 months ago, this nation of 23 million people, the largest
exporter of oil outside the Middle East and the leading supplier to
the United States in recent years, has gone from lamb to lion on
oil matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this government, Venezuela has been tremendously
assertive, showing that we have our own identity and our own way of
doing things,'' said Alan J. Viergutz, a former president of the
Venezuelan Oil Chamber, the main industry group here. ``That stands
in complete contrast to the previous government, which if not
anti-OPEC did not believe in OPEC solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries 40 years ago was in large part the work of Venezuela's
oil minister at the time, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso. But throughout
most of the last decade Venezuela's image within the cartel was
that of a quota buster whose lack of discipline contributed to low
prices for producers and earned the resentment of OPEC's other,
mainly Middle Eastern, members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 and 1998, Venezuela's relationship with other members
of OPEC was one of invective, of insults,'' Hector Ciavaldini,
president of the state oil company PDVSA, which also owns the
American-based Citgo oil company, recalled in an interview with the
Venezuelan newsmagazine Primicia. ``It had ruptured.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after being sworn in, Chavez, a populist former army
colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt here in 1992,
castigated Venezuela's previous policy as one of ``inundating the
market with no respect for production quotas, without giving any
importance to the price of a barrel.'' He promised ``a profound
transformation,'' and was as good as his word, immediately cutting
production by 625,000 barrels to 2.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   That set off grumbling here that Chavez was favoring his OPEC
partners over domestic producers, since the cutbacks led to a
recession that is still afflicting the local industry and is likely
to inhibit its ability to increase production now. But the price of
Venezuelan oil has nearly quadrupled, to $28 a barrel at its peak
last month, giving Chavez an economic and political bonanza he has
been quick to exploit both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At Chavez's behest, Rodriguez played a key role in getting
non-OPEC producers like Mexico to adhere to the production cuts
that originally sent the price of oil skyrocketing. Then, at their
meeting in Vienna last week, OPEC oil ministers adopted a
Venezuelan proposal intended to reduce future turmoil in the market
by allowing the price of oil to fluctuate only in a ``band''
between $22 and $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the OPEC presidency has often been seen as a post
of much prestige but little practical power. Rodriguez returned
from Vienna, however, saying that his fellow oil ministers had
granted him the authority to enforce the price band by decreeing
production increases or decreases as he saw fit, without convening
a meeting of the whole group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prices fall below $22, we will cut production by 500,000
barrels a day'' to push prices back up, Rodriguez, who did not
respond to requests for an interview, explained in a television
appearance here this week. ``When prices are above $28 a barrel, we
will increase production.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism Rodriguez proposed has yet to be tested, and in
the same television appearance he said that he thought ``it will be
necessary to have an additional increase in oil production this
year'' because ``prices went down, but less than expected'' after
the Vienna meeting. There are also many skeptics who believe that
the international oil market is simply too unruly for a price band
ever to function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to
micromanage the market,'' said Eduardo Lopez, a Latin American oil
specialist at Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-based consulting
concern. ``OPEC is not a central bank, and though it has found a
new strength, you still have all these countries with a different
agenda, and on top of that you have cheating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first glance, Rodriguez may seem an odd choice to be
overseeing the calibration of supply and demand for a commodity
that is essential to modern global capitalism. He was active in a
Cuban-inspired guerrilla group in the 1960s and is still a member
of a party that is on the far left fringe of Chavez's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, he abandoned armed revolutionary struggle
and, equipped with a law degree earned in 1961, entered
conventional politics. It was after being elected to the lower
house of the Venezuelan Congress in 1983 that his interest in oil
policy blossomed. He gradually rose to chairman of that body's
energy committee and became a member of the National Energy
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali is entirely the contrary of the image or stereotype you
would have of a guerrilla fighter,'' said Viergutz, who is
president of an oil investment company and helped develop the oil
band concept. ``He is a very flexible, prudent and open-minded
person, and though he may have been a Communist, he has come to see
there are other economic systems besides the state-oriented
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to punish
oil producers for driving up gasoline prices, a move interpreted
here as specifically aimed at Venezuela. OPEC's decision in Vienna
to increase output by 1.7 million barrels a day appears to have
headed off an immediate showdown, but even so there are other areas
in which conflict between the United States and Venezuela may be
looming.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the higher profile in world energy policy it has been
seeking, the Chavez government has sought and been granted an OPEC
heads of state meeting, scheduled to be held here in September.
Chavez has a tour of the Mideast scheduled for June, and he is
expected to personally invite two of Washington's most bitter
enemies, the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state oil company, acting on Chavez's orders,
has expressed interest in investing in the Cuban oil industry. If
it does, oil analysts here have pointed out, it will almost
certainly run afoul of United States legislation that calls for
sanctions against foreign companies that make use of American
assets nationalized in Cuba without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela has always been a major oil producer and exporter,''
a foreign oil analyst here said. ``What has changed is that this
government is now prepared to use that weight to become a major
player on the international scene.''

KMPC IS BACK BUT AS A GHOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Afraid of ghosts? Not at One-On-One's all-sports
radio station 1540.
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight at midnight, KCTD-AM will go back to the future
and change its call letters to KMPC, the latest nip and tuck of a
facelift that it hopes will give it a more feel-good acceptance in
what's again becoming a crowded and evolving Los Angeles
sports-radio market.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, Gene Autry's station on 710-AM went by
the KMPC brand, spinning pop music and later country music with
Dick Whittinghill and the Angels, Rams and UCLA games. But one of
the last attempts to save it was a format change to all-sports back
in the mid '90s with such on-air personalities as Joe McDonnell,
Jim Lampley, Brian Golden, Paola Boivin, Todd Christensen and Fred
Wallin.
</P>
<P>
   After bumbling decisions by station management, that version of
KMPC collapsed and was eventually sold off to Disney and the call
letters were ``retired'' when they the format changed to kids
programming.
</P>
<P>
   KCTD has brought them out of retirement, a process as simple as
buying them from the FCC for about five figures, said Nancy Cole,
the vice president and general manager of 1540.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who has 22 years in L.A. radio, including the old KMPC,
says the the name is ``the most recognizable call letters in the
country. It has an incredible sports heritage in Los Angeles. And
the reaction we've had from making this change and bringing back
that name has really been positive.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cole, who came over to run 1540 a year ago, a positive image
keeps with her philosophy of how sports should be presented and how
it'll be successful in this market.
</P>
<P>
   She helped launch all-sports AM-1150 two years ago as the sales
director but became discouraged when the ``guy talk'' sophomoric
approach taken by the show's hosts (read in: she had a tough time
selling it to advertisers) began to drag the format down.
</P>
<P>
   As a single parent rearing two kids in Valencia one of them grew
up to be Campbell Hall's Larry Cole, the Daily News volleyball
player of the year in '98, who went on to UCLA Nancy Cole was a
believer in how sports provided a positive foundation for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about showing Dennis Rodman facing a wall (at a urinal
as in the 1150 billboards and ads for the new morning show) and
thinking that's funny,'' said Cole. ``Why not appeal to a higher
common denominator? If I can help lift sports to a higher standard,
why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``At our station, the sports and the games are the stories, not
so much the personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The One-On-One Sports Radio Network, based in Chicago, owns 1540
as well as stations in New York and Boston. It also broadcasts its
lineup that includes Jay Mariotti, Peter Brown and Joe Chevalier on
more than 425 affiliates.

   ``The criticism that we don't have a local show at least not yet
fails to take into account that because we're a network, we have a
travel budget that a local sports station can't possibly
maintain,'' said Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, 1540 has added the Arena Football League's Avengers
games, continues to act as a spillover station for the Angels and
USC football, is considering airing special events like auto races
and could begin rights-fee negotiations with other teams in the
future. It also increased its local sports reports to three times
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It plans a move from its Burbank offices to Santa Monica by the
end of the year and has been looking into adding a local
sports-talk show. Who would host it? Refer to the list of the usual
suspects.

<P>
   And by the end of 2000, more changes will happen in this market.
In June, Fox Sports Radio Network and Sherman Oaks-based Premier
Radio will be have programming available for 1150's KXTA-AM, but
there's no guarantee that station will stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Most insiders are convinced that KXTA will merge programming
with KLAC-AM 570, creating a Lakers-Dodgers station, and possibly
move over to KFI-AM 640 for its 50,000-watt signal. All are
stations currently owned by the same group, Clear Channel.

   __ More female influence: The first woman driver at the
Indanapolis 500: Janet Guthrie, in 1977. So, if we're adding this
up right, it only took ABC 23 years to put its first female on the
marquee telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gudel, the former anchor and reporter on Prime Ticket
``Press Box'' four years ago, will join the ABC's May 28 event as a
reporter keeping viewers up on the garage areas, hospital, talking
to drivers, owners, mechanics even some celebs. She'll start with
ABC's coverage of the Indy time trials May 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea I was the first female until I read that
yesterday,'' said Gudel, who left L.A. in Oct. '96 after a year and
a half and eventually joined Philadelphia's Comcast Cable Sports
News show in October '97 as the city's first female sports anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe because there are so many women doing sports now, I
didn't think there were any `firsts' anymore. I went through the
same thing when I came here, so when it happens again, I think
everyone else makes more of it than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA grad has a two-year deal with ABC Sports after
impressing them with her sideline reporting during the recent
college football season. That included working the Fiesta Bowl as
well as the Wisconsin-Iowa game, when Ron Dayne broke the NCAA
career rushing record and clinched the Rose Bowl berth for the
Badgers.

   __ A backup plan: If Tiger Woods by some miracle doesn't win
this weekend at Augusta, storyline No. 2 that CBS will pray for
during its 45th straight year of Masters coverage will be gasp a
Greg Norman victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg's performance since he arrived at Augusta in '81 has
played out closer to a Greek tragedy than anything we've seen in
sport,'' said CBS's Jim Nantz, on his 15th Masters telecast, 12th
as the host. ``If he was to ever find a way to win this, it would
be perhaps be the most emotional scene that golf would has ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rides into town this week with a lack of fanfare that's
very healthy. I wouldn't put it past him to be in contention for
the elusive green jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with Sean McDonough finally out of the picture, CBS
has juggled its Masters' hole-coverage assignments again, moving
Bill Macatee into the lineup. Macatee, the USA Network coverage
host Thursday and today, will be at the 14th hole with Verne
Lunquist assigned to the 16th tower that McDonough kept warm since
the ouster of Gary McCord six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And covering his first Masters for the network, Dick Enberg will
do the interviews from Butler Cabin and wrap up the event Sunday
with one of his perceptive essays.
</P>
<P>
   __ Why it works: Every year, someone's going to complain about
the tight restrictions that the Masters committee puts on the
television people, such as no course reporters, no cameras on the
front nine, only four minutes of commercials per hour.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS continues to abide and thrive with these restrictions.
So why don't they try the same format with every PGA telecast?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Based on rights fees), we certainly wouldn't be able to be
competitive and responsible financially with our PGA Tour
relationship if we have only four minutes of commercials every
hour,'' said CBS Sports chief Sean McManus. ``The business model
used with the PGA isn't true here because the quality of the
coverage and the unique nature of this event is the model used
here.'' &QL;

Staples store waiting for the last customers at 10:15 to finally
quit picking over the scotch-tape bin and get the heck out. This is
more brutal than watching a Discovery Channel special when a pack

EDITORIAL: CHARGES OF HARASSMENT BY A GENERAL  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment charges filed by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy,
the U.S. Army's highest ranking woman, against a male general shows
that much more needs to be done to end harassment in the military.
The case is particularly embarrassing to the Army because Kennedy
is one of only three women in the armed services who are three-star
officers, and the accused officer, Maj. Gen. Larry Smith, was
appointed last summer to be the Army's deputy inspector general, a
post that investigates allegations of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have properly put Smith's transfer into that
post on hold as an investigation continues. The case is complicated
by the fact that the alleged unwanted sexual advance occurred in
1996 but Kennedy did not pursue formal action at that time.
Instead, she complained informally to her superiors, perhaps in an
effort to avoid ruining another officer's career. It is unclear how
the situation was handled or resolved. She decided to file a formal
complaint last year when Smith was assigned to the inspector
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is reminiscent of the case involving Maj. Gen. David
Hale, who had also been appointed deputy inspector general when he
was accused of sexual misconduct with the wives of several
subordinate officers. Hale was allowed by the Army to retire
quietly when the complaint first surfaced. But ultimately he was
charged with misconduct, pleaded guilty and was demoted one rank.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough investigation in this case should determine the
merits of the complaint and whether any top officers involved in
Smith's appointment knew of Kennedy's informal accusation. If so,
officials need to determine whether Kennedy _ the only woman among
the Army's 45 three-star generals _ was given an opportunity to
object to Smith's new assignment. Just because an original
complaint was informally handled does not justify ignoring it
completely. The military may need to develop a way to allow
informal complaints to be considered and resolved prior to
promotions or new appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has said that the armed forces
will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment. This latest
episode shows that the Army needs to review how it responds to all
harassment complaints, whether formal or informal.
</P>
<P>
   The Army must show that it is prepared to respond strongly and
appropriately every single time. It must also prove to a skeptical
public that it will respond harshly if there is any evidence that
charges of harassment were improperly ignored.

U.S. PUTS $5 MILLION BOUNTY ON SUSPECTED BOMB PLOTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAM SKOLNIK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government has placed a $5 million bounty on an
Algerian man accused of playing a key role in a plot to smuggle
explosives into Washington state four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials yesterday offered the reward to
anyone providing information leading to the arrest and conviction
of Abdelmajid Dahoumane.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to capture Dahoumane has frustrated federal
prosecutors and law enforcement officials, who consider him an
important link in an alleged plot to bomb U.S. buildings and
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Dahoumane and another Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, were indicted Jan.
20 by a Seattle federal grand jury on charges that they conspired
to commit acts of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is backing its bounty on Dahoumane with an
advertising campaign of posters and fliers printed in French and
English that will be distributed throughout the United States,
Canada, Europe and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Dahoumane is also wanted in Canada for allegedly making bombs
with Ressam, who was arrested by U.S. border agents at Port
Angeles, Wash., after they found explosives and timing devices in
his rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Dahoumane, 33, has lived in Canada, Germany and Algeria. The FBI
got a tip that he was spotted at the Bellingham, Wash., airport
less than a week after Ressam's Dec. 14 arrest, but State and
Justice Department officials said yesterday his current whereabouts
are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Laine, a spokesman for the State Department's Diplomatic
Security Service, which issued the bounty, would not say why
federal authorities chose now to make the offer. ``We worked
closely with the FBI and the Canadian government and law
enforcement, and we believed this was the best time to proceed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go under the assumption'' that Dahoumane is
dangerous, Laine added.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Malkin, spokesman for Seattle-based U.S. attorney Kate
Pflaumer, said offering a multimillion-dollar reward ``is not an
uncommon thing in certain high-profile cases. If it were to lead to
his capture, it would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahoumane is not the first man to have had a $5 million U.S.
government bounty placed on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Diplomatic Security Service has launched reward campaigns
aimed at terrorists in 16 different instances. The bounty is
increased to $7 million in skyjacking cases, the maximum allowed
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Others making the $5 million list include Osama bin Laden,
indicted as the mastermind of the 1998 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. The same bounty was placed on the
Libyan men charged in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the program, Laine said the government has paid
out more than $6 million in reward money since 1995. One notable
success was the case of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef,
arrested in Pakistan off a tip and ultimately convicted in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the alleged bomb plot involving Dahoumane and
Ressam, Montreal resident Mokhtar Haouari and Abdel Ghani Meskini,
both Algerians, were charged in New York in January with providing
support to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents have described the men as being a cell of the
militant Armed Islamic Group. The group, which goes by its French
acronym, GIA, blames the United States for its support of the
ruling regime in Algeria.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ They call him the Cisco Kid, but Francisco Cordova is
hardly a friend to the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cordova took the Astros on a little trip down memory lane _
well, actually it was more like a hijacking _ holding them hostage
while he flirted with a no-hitter in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 10-1
victory Thursday afternoon at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey's one-out double in the eighth inning ended
Cordova's no-hit bid and put to rest any thoughts of deja vu. The
last time the Astros had a no-hitter tossed against them, it was at
the hands of Cordova and reliever Ricardo Rincon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the third-best game he's pitched against
us,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said of Cordova, who held the
Astros to a run on two hits in eight innings. ``That gives you an
idea of how good he's been against us. He's a tough pitcher to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova is 6-2 with a 2.78 ERA in 16 career appearances (11
starts) against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably send a limo every time we're in town,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Groundhog Day feeling didn't end with Cordova's flirtation
with a no-hitter. There was also Chris Holt getting bare-bones run
support in his first start of the season _ which was the case in
far too many of his starts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And who was on the mound for the Astros when Cordova pitched
nine no-hit innings in 1997? You guessed it _ Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to get into that,'' said Holt, who received
the lowest run support among Astros starters in 1999. ``Cordova
pitched a hell of a game, and you have to give him credit. I felt
good; I just threw a couple of bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, he threw pitches in the direction of home
plate, which is about all a pitcher had to do to be victimized by
Pirates right fielder Brian Giles, who was 5-for-5 with four RBIs
and a pair of home runs, both off Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't flip anything up there without him hitting it,''
Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Between Cordova and Giles, the Astros didn't have a chance. They
were fortunate to win the first two games of the series, which
assured them of returning to Houston for tonight's regular-season
opener at Enron Field with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win the first two games, obviously you want that
sweep,'' said Bill Spiers. ``But you have to be happy to take two
out of three against these guys with the pitching they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had three baserunners through two innings on a trio
of walks. But Cordova retired 16 consecutive batters from the third
inning until Meluskey's double off the center-field wall. Meluskey
scored on Tim Bogar's double to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking to myself, `Make him get the ball up,'''
Meluskey said. ``I saw it was up, I swung, and luckily I got the
good part of the bat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova kept the Astros off balance with an assortment of
pitches thrown from a variety of arm angles _ a combination that
made him more difficult to solve than the Elian Gonzalez dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any pitch in any at-bat that was up in the zone
that I could hit hard. He made some good pitches,'' Spiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros right fielder Moises Alou, who brought a career .417
batting average against Cordova into Thursday's game, wasn't
completely awed by the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a good game, but I don't mind facing him,'' Alou
said of Cordova. ``He kept throwing (pitches) away, and we kept
swinging at them. You have to give him credit, but we helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all the help Cordova needed came in the third and
fifth innings, when Giles blasted solo homers off Holt. Giles also
drove in one of the Pirates' two runs in the sixth and had an RBI
triple in a four-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giles had a hell of a series,'' Alou said. ``Everything he
hit, he hit it hard. He can play. The only reason more people don't
know about him is because he plays (in Pittsburgh).''
</P>
<P>
   Giles, who was 8-for-11 in the series, certainly got the Astros'
attention. Cordova, of course, already had it.
