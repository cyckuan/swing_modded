Orioles try to prevent private sale of historic Ripken lineup card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BART JANSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Former Orioles manager Phil Regan gave his
daughter a prized piece of baseball history _ the original lineup
card from Cal Ripken Jr.'s record-breaking game in 1995 _ and she
decided to sell it at auction.
	   Now the Orioles say the card, which is valued at dlrs 35,000,
belongs to them, and they have gone to court to prevent the sale.
	   The team obtained a temporary court order blocking Regan's
daughter from selling the lineup card and a pen used in filling it
out from the night Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive
games played.
	   ``The team's position is that the lineup card and the pen are
the property of the Orioles,'' team general counsel Russell Smouse
said Wednesday. ``They should be enjoyed by everyone in a museum.''
	   Usually, managers fill out one original and three carbon copies
of a lineup card for a major league game.
	   When Ripken played in his 2,131st game on Sept. 6, 1995,
eclipsing Gehrig's record, there was an original and four or five
carbons, American League senior vice president Phyllis Merhige said
Wednesday.
	   ``We had the additional carbons because we knew there was going
to be the demand,'' Merhige said. ``We had them specially made.''
	   Plate umpire Larry Barnett donated his copy three months later
to Bowling Green University, which said it intended to sell it. One
copy is at the Babe Ruth Museum in Baltimore and another is at the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The status of the copy taken
by Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' manager at the time, was not
known, team spokesman Larry Babcock said. It also was unclear if
Ripken got a copy.
	   Regan kept the original, Orioles spokesman John Maroon said,
along with the pen. His daughter decided to sell them through North
Shore Sports, an auction agency near Chicago.
	   A Baltimore man had the highest bid of dlrs 35,000 on Tuesday,
but the company won't transfer possession of the card until after
the court resolves the ownership dispute, North Shore Sports
president Steve Ryan said.
	   WBAL-TV identified the man as Jim Ancel.
	   ``The only reason I really bid on the item was to make sure it
stayed in Baltimore,'' Ancel told the television station.
	   The Orioles, who argue that the team owns the card as they do
any piece of equipment, won a court order in Illinois on Tuesday to
prevent the sale until a full hearing is held. Cook County Circuit
Court Judge Albert Green scheduled a hearing for Dec. 21.
	   Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said he would like the original
displayed at the Babe Ruth Museum. Major league baseball is on the
team's side.
	   ``Baseball's contention is it belongs to the club,'' said Rich
Levin, the spokesman for commissioner Bud Selig.
	   Ripken ended his consecutive game streak in September at 2,632.
	   Ryan said he understood the argument that historic artifacts
belong in museums, but he said even famous paintings are held
privately. He also disputed the club's ownership of the card,
saying managers historically could keep the cards they filled out.
	   Ryan said interest in the card peaked after Tony La Russa,
manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, recently sold the lineup card
for the game in which Mark McGwire hit his record-setting 70th home
run of the season.

Both teams recall spinners for Adelaide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia, reeling from the
bookmaking kickback scandal involving Mark Waugh and Shane Warne,
will be battling to keep the momentum going in the third cricket
test at Adelaide beginning Friday.
	   ``The momentum is definitely with us and we will have to put the
last 48 hours behind us and play some good cricket,'' skipper Mark
Taylor said Thursday.
	   Taylor said the scandal had come at a crucial time and it was
hard to stay focussed in the middle of an important series.
	   Both teams have called up key spinners to make use of another
spinner-friendly Adelaide Oval pitch. Leg spinner Stuart MacGill
and off spinner Robert Croft missed the second test in Perth as
both teams went in with pace.
	   England, down 1-0 in the five-match series, must win to have any
realistic chance of taking home the Ashes.
	   After all-rounder Dominic Cork was ruled out with the flu, team
manager Graham Gooch said off spinner Peter Such will be considered
before the final team is picked.
	   Croft, the senior spinner of the pair, will return at the
expense of batsmen John Crawley or Mark Ramprakash. The in-form
Dean Headley will come in for Cork.
	   After describing the sparsely grassed pitch as ``typical
Adelaide,'' Taylor said his side will also consider playing a
second slow bowler.
	   If that happens, fast bowler Jason Gillespie, who led Australia
to a seven-wicket win with a match haul of seven wickets in Perth,
will carry the drinks while utility bowler Colin Miller retains his
place.
	   Wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who suffered a sprained thigh muscle,
passed a fitness test Thursday and Taylor says Healy will play.
	   Teams:
	   AUSTRALIA (from): Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater, Justin
Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Damien
Fleming, Colin Miller or Jason Gillespie, Stuart MacGill, Glenn
McGrath.
	   ENGLAND (from): Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain,
Alec Stewart (captain), Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley, Graeme Hick,
Robert Croft, Dean Headley, Alex Tudor, Darren Gough, Allan
Mullally and Peter Such.

Perry briefs Japan on suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. policy chief on North Korea met Japanese
defense officials Thursday to discuss persuading the reclusive
Stalinist state to allow the inspection of a suspected nuclear
weapons site.
	   William Perry held an hour-long meeting with Japanese Vice
Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada on the progress of talks in the
United States between Washington and Pyongyang, Japan's Defense
Agency said.
	   North Korea has refused a U.S. demand that it unconditionally
allow inspectors into a suspected underground nuclear site at
Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main
nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   Pyongyang has said it will open up the facility in exchange for
dlrs 300 million in compensation for America's ``false'' accusation
that North Korea is building a nuclear facility. Washington has
turned down the offer.
	   Perry, a former U.S. defense secretary, arrived in Tokyo
Wednesday after stops in South Korea and China to discuss the
ongoing negotiations and listen to views about how Washington
should revise its policy toward the North.
	   Japan has been particularly concerned about a military build-up
in North Korea after Pyongyang launched a missile in late August
that flew over northern Japan. U.S. officials believe the launch
was a test firing of a Taepo Dong-1 ballistic missile.
	   Japanese Defense Minister Hosei Norota reportedly told
Parliament on Wednesday that Japan is nervous about signs North
Korea is building new ballistic missile facilities, but said he
doubts Pyongyang is planning another missile launch soon.
	   Reflecting U.S. concern about North Korea, the Clinton
administration recently named Perry to the newly established post
of policy coordinator for North Korea. Perry was scheduled to leave
Tokyo Thursday evening.

Final hearing in homicide trial of former Mexican president's
</HEADLINE>
brother &QL; 
 &UR; By GLORIA PEREZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ In the last court session of
the highest-profile murder trial in modern Mexican history, the
brother of a former president maintained his innocence and accused
prosecutors of mounting a vendetta against him.
	   The case against Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of
former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has dragged on since he
was arrested in February 1995. Both sides made their final
arguments Wednesday.
	   Normally, the judge would have 30 working days to issue a
decision, but because of the sheer volume of evidence presented _
in 42 bound books _ the decision was expected to take longer.
	   From behind the bars and bulletproof glass of a penitentiary
courtroom, Salinas denied having played any role in the 1994
shooting of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a leader of the ruling
party to which Salinas also belonged.
	   ``Like all men, I believe I have committed errors ... but I must
say that among them (the errors) there exist no crimes,'' Salinas
said in an occasionally teary declaration to the judge.
	   He expressed sympathy for the family of Ruiz Massieu, whose
killing prosecutors say Salinas masterminded. But Salinas says the
charges against him are motivated by political enemies of his
brother.
	   ``It hurts to say that Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu is the
forgotten one here,'' Salinas said. ``He went on to become merely a
pretext for the authorities to make me a scapegoat for their
inability and frustrations.''
	   Salinas said that after 45 months in the Almoloya de Juarez
maximum-security prison 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of Mexico
City, he still had not been told his alleged motive for arranging
the shooting of Ruiz Massieu.
	   Prosecutors, however, say Ruiz Massieu was killed because he was
seen as a threat to the Salinas family's political power. They also
have said there was bad blood stemming from Ruiz Massieu's divorce
from Salinas' sister.
	   Salinas also is currently on trial on charges of illegal
enrichment, which covers alleged bribes, aiding drug smugglers and
misusing public funds. That trial is expected to wind up soon.
	   Prosecutors say Salinas, a mid-level bureaucrat during his
younger brother's presidency, cannot legitimately account for
millions of dollars found in Mexican and foreign banks.

Gambling fever grips Thai teens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai teen-agers are expected to part
with the equivalent of dlrs 56 million betting on the Asian Games,
according to a local poll. Most of the bets will be laid on boxing
and soccer results.
	   Of the 1,140 Bangkok students polled by Assumption University,
some 40 percent said they planned to bet on Asian Games events. A
sizable percentage said they wouldn't place bets because their
money was already tied up in gambling on other tournaments like
English premier league soccer.
	   The poll said around 400,000 Thai teen-agers were regular
gamblers. Gambling fever among youngsters reached fever pitch
during the soccer World Cup last year.
	   According to the Thai Farmers Bank Research Center, Thais young
and old placed nearly dlrs 1 billion in bets during the cup.

Rules rob South Korean of bowling bronze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Cha Mi-jung was denied a
bronze medal in women's bowling because Asian Games rules prevent a
nation sweeping the medals in a single event.
	   Cha placed behind compatriots Lee Ji-yean and Li Mi-young in the
women's final Wednesday night. The medal ceremony was postponed
after Malaysian officials alerted organizers that their
fourth-placed Yap Mun-Yee was entitled to bronze instead of Cha.
The South Koreans disagreed but games organizers ruled in favor of
Malaysia Thursday.
	   South Korea had five competitors in the event but under games
rules only two are allowed to win medals and their names must be
registered by the federation before the start of competition.
	   ``The rule is clear and the Koreans were made aware of it before
the competition started,'' said games organizing committee
spokeswoman Valerie McKenzie. ``It is designed to prevent one
country from dominating the medals in one sport.''
	   McKenzie said the South Koreans had been requested to register
two of their five women bowlers but failed to do so. The top two
finishers were counted.

In blow for Anwar, judge reverses ruling on impeaching witness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with judge disallowing impeachment and
witness startling court with new facts; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's
defense team suffered a setback Thursday when the trial judge
reversed a decision allowing it a chance to prove the prosecution's
main witness lied to the court.
	   Trial Judge Augustine Paul on Wednesday had allowed the defense
to begin impeachment proceedings against the witness. But as the
court assembled Thursday, he said he was changing his mind.
	   The witness is a former employee of Anwar's who alleges the
ex-deputy prime minister repeatedly sodomized him. Defense lawyers
said this week there were glaring inconsistencies in the witness'
story.
	   ``It's meaningless to hold the proceedings to impeach. I
therefore terminate the proceedings to impeach,'' Judge Paul said
on the trial's 24th day.
	   Before he announced his ruling, the judge said the impeachment
move seemed to be based on ``mere speculation.''
	   ``I am afraid I will have to reconsider the decision I have
made.''
	   The witness, Azizan Abu Bakar, took the stand after Paul's
ruling and startled the court by stating that he was not only
sodomized by Anwar, but also by the former deputy prime minister's
adopted brother in 1992.
	   ``I particularly cannot forget one incident,'' Azizan said,
recounting how one night he was first allegedly sodomized by Anwar
and then by Sukma Dermawan.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a 6-month sentence after pleading guilty
to allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar. The other person in
jail for letting Anwar allegedly sodomize him is Munawar Ahmad
Anees, Anwar's 50-year-old speech writer.
	   Azizan's accusations form the core of the 10 charges against
Anwar, who was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2.
	   The sacking led to demands for political reforms and massive
anti-government protests in this normally placid Southeast Asian
capital.
	   Anwar is being tried first on four counts of corruption. He will
face trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and
five for alleged illegal sex acts.
	   Defense attorneys had requested the impeachment this week after
Azizan appeared to contradict himself when he said during
cross-examination that he never had sex with the ousted deputy
prime minister.
	   But Thursday, he testified that he had misunderstood the defense
cross-examiners.
	   ``The acts of sodomy continued to happen while I worked as a
driver for Anwar's wife between early 1992 and May 1992,'' Azizan
said.
	   Anwar's family members, who attend the hearings each day,
groaned loudly and held their heads as Azizan mentioned Sukma. A
court bailiff ordered them to remain silent.
	   Although the defense attorneys did not protest Judge Paul's
ruling they did object to Azizan's testimony about allegedly being
sodomized by Sukma.
	   When the judge overruled the objections, Christopher Fernando, a
senior defense attorney, demanded that the objections at least be
recorded.
	   ``You must have some faith and trust in me. I am sure you can
see my hand moving,'' Judge Paul said. ``I am not drawing
pictures.''

Japanese tourist's killer may escape detection, say police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The killer who beat a Japanese
tourist to death and hid her naked body in a fire alarm closet in a
downtown office building in September may never be caught, police
said Thursday.
	   The police homicide team leader, Det. Sgt. Kevin Baker, said
even the cause of death of Kayo Matsuzawa, 29, could not be
determined because of the decomposed state of the body.
	   Matsuzawa, from Yamagata, northern Japan, had been dead for at
least a week when her body was found on Sept. 22.
	   Baker has refused to say if police believe she was sexually
assaulted, what they think may have been used to kill her or what
the motive may have been.
	   But he said police still believed the killer _ most likely a man
_ had gone to extraordinary lengths to dispose of evidence and
throw police off his trail.
	   Matsuzawa's assailant had stripped her, disposed of her clothing
and backpack, and killed her in a manner that left a forensic
pathologist unable to determine a cause of death.
	   Police had to use dental records from Japan to identify the
body.
	   Matsuzawa arrived in New Zealand late last year for an extended
holiday and was based in Christchurch.
	   She checked into a backpackers' hostel on her arrival in
Auckland on Sept. 11, paying a deposit for a room, where she put
her belongings.
	   Her body was found in a locked closet in a building only a few
hundred meters (yards) from the Queen Street Backpackers hostel.

Homeless man arrested in slaying of British schoolgirl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police in this southern port have
arrested a homeless French man who fits the sketch of a suspect in
the 1996 slaying of a British schoolgirl in a Brittany youth
hostel, officials said Thursday.
	   The man, in his 30s, was arrested Wednesday afternoon after he
fit several characteristic traits of the police sketch, especially
his thick eyebrows and stocky build, said the authorities on
customary anonymity.
	   Police immediately took genetic samples from the suspect and
sent them to the National Police Laboratory. They declined further
comment pending the results, and there was no immediate word on
when that would be completed.
	   The man also had spent time in the Brittany city of Rennes
during his wanderings across France, further raising suspicions,
authorities said.
	   The investigation into the death of 13-year-old Caroline
Dickinson has prompted a widespread search in France and Britain,
including genetic testing of the male residents in Pleine Fougeres,
the Brittany town where she was killed.
	   After a long dry spell of evidence, French investigators
re-intensified their search since October, when a student in the
eastern city of Nancy said a police sketch of the suspect resembled
the man who raped her in 1993.
	   Dickinson was raped and then strangled in a youth hostel in
Pleine Fougeres while on a five-day trip with 39 other youngsters
and five adults from her school.

Waugh and Warne find support in Australian test side

 &UR; ED: Updates with Taylor saying ICC inquiry not practical, other

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Embattled Australian cricketers Wark
Waugh and Shane Warne, who have admitted taking money from an
Indian bookmaker, have the full support of the Australian test
team, captain Mark Taylor said Thursday.
	   On the eve of the third Ashes test against England in Adelaide,
Taylor said he asked all members of the current team at a meeting
on Tuesday whether they had any problems playing with Waugh or
Warne _ all said they did not.
	   ``They have our full and 100 percent support,'' he said.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of Australia's most popular and
highest-paid players, admitted Wednesday to being ``naive and
stupid'' for taking money from an Indian bookmaker during
Australia's 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   The revelation, made worse by an admission by the Australian
Cricket Board (ACB) that it had covered up the affair and asked the
International Cricket Council to do the same, has plunged
Australian cricket into crisis.
	   Taylor said Thursday he was told about the matter immediately
after the 1994 tour, and described the pair as foolish.
	   ``It worried me at the time because they compromised
themselves,'' Taylor
	   said. ``But I knew they hadn't done anything to jeopardize
Australian cricket.
	   ``They did the wrong thing and took a cheap dollar.
	   ``Two guys took a fast buck, nothing more than that and their
records as individuals . . . since 1994 (are) second to none.''
	   The ACB fined Waugh 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400)
and Warne
	   8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for selling
information about weather and pitch conditions to the bookmaker.
	   The revelation shook the cricket world and is almost certain to
force the
	   International Cricket Council to address the subject of illegal
betting in the sport at its meeting next month in Christchurch, New
Zealand.
	   At a media conference Wednesday in Adelaide, Warne and Waugh
each read a statement but refused to answer questions, leaving ACB
chief executive Malcolm Speed to deal with the matter.
	   The ACB kept the matter secret until late Tuesday and Speed
admitted the incident's leaking had damaged Australian cricket's
reputation.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and told Speed they had never bet on cricket.
	   Taylor on Thursday joined in criticism of the ACB, saying it was
mistaken.
	   ``My feelings are exactly the same as they were at the time,
they made a mistake and they've admitted that mistake,'' Taylor
said of the board.
	   But a full-scale investigation by the ICC was not practical.
	   ``It sounds very good (but) I don't know how much it will
achieve,'' he said.
	   Taylor said he is convinced the current Australian team is free
of any links with bookmakers.
	   ``My job as Australian captain is to make the players play to
the best of
	   their ability. I won't let that (be) jeopardized in any way.
	   ``I am completely satisfied that no players have been involved
in any of this since.''
	   He said that after Tuesday's team meeting, each player had gone
up to Waugh and wished him well for the test. Warne is not on the
test team because of injury.
	   Waugh said Wednesday he took money from the Delhi-based
bookmaker to provide information the batsman considered
``mundane.''
	   ``At no stage did I discuss team tactics or lineups,'' Waugh
said.
	   Warne, whose hopes of one day being the Australian cricket
captain will be damaged by the revelations, said he deeply
regretted the contact with the bookmaker who gave him money in
return for answering routine questions about the state of the pitch
and the weather.
	   ``I've had no contact with the bookmaker since and am very
disappointed and sorry for my actions,'' he said.
	   Waugh and Warne's admissions and the ACB's behavior have been
widely condemned by cricket commentators, in newspaper editorials
and by the public generally. (rs/djp)

U.N. celebrates human rights achievements and laments failures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead planned after Annan speech scheduled about 1415 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations is celebrating its
achievements but also lamenting that millions of people around the
world are still denied basic rights and fundamental freedoms.
	   The General Assembly planned to hold a special day-long session
Thursday to mark the anniverary of the most comprehensive and
widely recognized international standard for the protection of
human rights. Reflecting its importance, 115 countries signed up to
speak.
	   At the end of the session, the assembly was expected to adopt a
resolution reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations in
fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small.''
	   A draft resolution also expresses concern ``that human rights
and fundamental freedoms are not fully and universally respected,
and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full
enjoyment of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social
rights.''
	   The assembly was expected to call on the international community
to identify obstacles to achieving human rights for all peoples and
propose ways to overcome them.
	   At the start of the General Assembly session, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was to award Human Rights Prizes to
individuals in the front line struggle against injustice. Mary
Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, will also
speak.
	   Before the session, the secretary-general also planned to give a
video address to a ceremony in Paris marking the anniversary of the
human rights declaration. French President Jacques Chirac was among
the guests scheduled to attend the ceremony.
	   Celebrities Michael Douglas, Wynton Marsalis, Luciano Pavarotti
and Vanessa Redgrave were expected to take part in commemorations
at the United Nations that include an exhibit on child rights, the
world premiere of a documentary on the universal declaration, a
conference on the right to asylum, and an evening recital.
	   Annan and three U.N. Messengers of Peace _ Pavarotti, Douglas
and Italian journalist Anna Cataldi _ were to present newly
designed ``children's passports'' with the text of the universal
declaration printed inside to a group of youngsters. UNESCO plans
to distribute a million of these passports to children worldwide to
promote human rights awareness.
	   International Action for Human Rights, a coalition of
organizations representing human rights issues, was sponsoring a
rally and vigil outside the United Nations featuring prominent
dissident figures including Harry Wu from China, Hafsat Abiola from
Nigeria and Durdak Nyima from Tibet.

 &UR; Court adjourns hearing of lawsuit challenging Anwar's dismissal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The High Court on Thursday
adjourned hearing of a lawsuit filed by jailed politician Anwar
Ibrahim challenging his dismissal from office after his lawyer
argued a different judge should decide the case.
	   Anwar's lawsuit states that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
violated the constitution by not seeking the king's assent before
dismissing him from his post of deputy prime minister on Sept. 2.
	   The case was first slated to be heard by Judge James Foong, but
was transferred by orders of Judge Mohd. Saari Yusoff to his own
court. No reason was offered for the transfer. It will be heard on
Dec. 21.
	   Anwar's lawyer, Karpal Singh, who is also a prominent opposition
member of Parliament, said Judge Mohd. Saari did not have powers to
transfer cases to himself. Only the chief judge of Malaysia was
empowered to do so, he argued.
	   ``In matters like this there must be transparency,'' he said.
	   Anwar, who was arrested on Sept. 20, is being tried separately
by another High Court judge on four counts of abuse of power. He
will be tried later for another charge of corruption and five of
illegal sexual acts.
	   ``In this case the plaintiff is Anwar Ibrahim. His ongoing trial
is a controversial one,'' Karpal told the court.
	   ``No one should have the impression that in Anwar Ibrahim's
case, attempts have been made to deprive him of a hearing before a
judge the case was designated to.''
	   Government lawyers asked for time to prepare arguments, saying
Karpal had not informed them of his move to have the case restored
before the original judge.

Protesters gather in Jakarta on human rights anniversary

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of chanting protesters
marched down Jakarta's main road Thursday to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Student activists also planned rallies to demand an immediate
trial of former President Suharto, who was questioned by state
prosecutors Wednesday about allegations that he corruptly amassed a
fortune during his three decades in power.
	   Hours after the ex-authoritarian leader was quizzed, thousands
of students demonstrated and some threw rocks and clashed with riot
police not far from the home of President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's
successor and one-time protege.
	   Habibie has pledged to hold general elections next year and has
implemented some political reforms, but he lacks credibility among
activists who say he is a stooge of the old regime. They reject his
investigation of Suharto as cosmetic.
	   Gathering on the human rights anniversary, protesters shouting
slogans for an array of causes marched around a major intersection
ringed by five-star hotels to demand swifter democratic change.
Others rallied outside the headquarters of the United Nations.
	   ``For the sake of human rights, we oppose militarism,'' read one
banner.
	   Others read, ``Release political prisoners'' and ``Stop money
politics and violence.''
	   Habibie has released dozens of political prisoners since taking
office in May from Suharto, who was dislodged by riots and protests
against his three-decade rule. But some pro-democracy activists
remain in jail.
	   The protesters included members of a women's human rights group,
supporters of opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and students
from the disputed territory of East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later, unleashing a guerrilla war that persists
today. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian authority
in East Timor and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and
Portugal.
	   East Timor's rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao, is serving a 20-year
sentence in a Jakarta jail for fighting the Indonesian military.

Greg Norman warned to rest injured shoulder after Presidents Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Greg Norman has been
warned by his
	   doctor that he is playing too much golf and may be putting at
risk a full recovery from shoulder surgery earlier this year.
	   Norman said his Dr. Richard Hawkins told him he should take a
break from golf for at least six weeks after the Presidents Cup
this weekend.
	   ``I have spoken to my doctor on an almost weekly basis and he's
very concerned that I've played too much golf to this moment,''
Norman, 43, said.
	   ``I haven't had a day off in over weeks now and he's very
concerned.
	   ``He wants me to sit back and reevaluate things on Sunday
night,'' he said. ``He's like to see me stop playing for six weeks
and just let my shoulder get strong again.''
	   Former world No. 1 Norman had surgery on his shoulder in April
and had an
	   almost eight-month layoff.
	   He has played the Shark Shootout, the Skins competition and last
week's Australian Open since. In the Open, he finished 31st after
shooting a 10-over
	   par 82 in the second round.
	   ``When you play a lot, you don't have a chance of working our
and if you don't work out you're not keeping it as strong as you
would like,'' said Norman.
	   ``The outside's strong but what's happening on the inside is
what you've really got to protect.''
	   Norman is committed by sponsorships to play in a Holden scramble
teams event on Australia's sunshine Coast on Monday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BUSH MEMORIAL: Former American president George Bush took a
break from a busy golfing schedule to visit Thursday a shrine for
Australian soldiers who fell during two world wars.
	   Bush laid a wreath at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance and
visited a crypt in the basement where a statue of father and son in
army uniform symbolizes the two generations of Australians who died
in the successive world wars.
	   ``I can't think of any whose military history bring them closer
together than that of America and Australia and this is a very
somber thing,'' Bush said.
	   Bush, who was the honorary chairman of the Presidents Cup in
1996 and who
	   has traveled to Australia to see the rematch, is scheduled to
play several rounds at different golf courses near where the United
States team will take on the Internationals at Royal Melbourne
starting Friday.
	   He watched Tiger Woods for a short spell during a practice
round, but said he was unlucky in his own game.
	   ``We lost actually, a terrible thing,'' Bush said. ``There will
always be
	   tomorrow.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DRIVER PUTTING: When International team golfer Carlos Franco
wants a confidence boost _ or to attract attention _ he sometimes
resorts to putting a few holes using his driver.
	   During the Australian Open at the tough Royal Adelaide course
last week, Franco left his putter in the bag on three holes. He
finished tied for 7th, including one round of 1-under 71.
	   ``I have often done that when I need to regain confidence in my
putting,'' Franco said.
	   ``Last week I played with a driver for three holes only but the
intention was to get people to know me.''
	   The Presidents Cup is the highest-profile event the 33-year-old
from Asuncion, Paraguay has played. From a country with only three
golf courses, Franco has had 10 top-10 finishes in the 17 starts in
the Japanese Tour.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TV GOLF: By Nick Price's reckoning, he saw golf on television
for the first time at about the same age Tiger Woods began winning
his string of junior amateur championships.
	   ``When I grew up we used to have to wait for a 16-millimeter or
32-millimeter film to come before we saw any recorded golf,'' said
South African-born Price, who plays for Zimbabwe.
	   ``That was 1968, 1970. . . the cigarette companies used to bring
all the films and we used to have them on a showing in our club on
Friday night and Saturday night.
	   ``I didn't even know professional golf existed until I got to be
about 16
	   years old.''
	   His figures are a little shaky _ in 1968 he would have been 12 _
but Price said satellite television has put golf in homes of young
fans around the world.
	   ``Nowadays the kids can switch on the TV at any time and watch
within two
	   seconds of someone holing out a putt in the Masters to win, and
being handed
	   huge checks,'' Price said.
	   ``As a result, golf is going through a boom.''
	   World No. 1 Woods was 16 when he won the first of his three
consecutive junior amateur championships in 1991. (rs/djp)

Rights group, opposition leader slam Cambodia on human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A human rights group and an
opposition politician have slammed Cambodia's dismal human rights
record as government leaders prepare to commemorate Thursday's 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Once bitter enemies Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh were scheduled to deliver speeches Thursday evening at a
United Nations observance of the historic declaration.
	   They were expected to paint an optimistic portrait of an
improving rights situation in Cambodia that will stand in stark
contrast to the gloomy picture Human Rights Watch Asia detailed in
a report this week.
	   ``No progress was made during the year toward ending impunity
for rights violations; officials linked to murders and
`disappearances' remained in office,'' the New York-based group
said.
	   ``Khmer Rouge leaders associated with the 1975-79 massacres of a
million or more Cambodians remained at large even after Pol Pot's
death in April,'' the report added.
	   Those sentiments were echoed by opposition leader Sam Rainsy,
who claimed that actions by the international community had given
Hun Sen's government ``the green light'' to suppress its political
opponents.
	   ``It is deeply ironic to see international representatives
honoring the Universal Declaration at a time when their disregard
for its principles is so apparent,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Rainsy and HRW blasted the international community for its quick
endorsement of Hun Sen's victory in recent elections despite
opposition parties' allegations of voter intimidation and ballot
fraud.
	   Nonetheless, hopes that Cambodia's turmoil may be easing were
raised last month when Hun Sen and Ranariddh ended a 16-month
violent conflict with an agreement to form a coalition government.
	   Hun Sen was named sole prime minister in the deal and the prince
was made president of the National Assembly. Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a bloody coup d'etat in July
1997.
	   Human Rights Watch Asia said little attention has been paid to
human rights in Cambodia since the international community agreed
to fund July's election, eventually won by Hun Sen.
	   Promised investigations into nearly 100 political killings
committed in the wake of the 1997 coup never materialized;
opposition supporters in the military and police were assassinated
in the run-up to the election; and protests against election fraud
were violently suppressed by riot police, the report stated.
	   ``The international response to developments in Cambodia was
characterized by donor weariness with Cambodia's seemingly
never-ending problems, eagerness to sign off on a flawed electoral
process, and acquiescence in Hun Sen's consolidation of power,''
the group stated.

Ignoring fever, Jayasinghe resumes training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ignoring lingering effects of fever and
her doctors' advice to rest longer, Sri Lankan sprinter Susantika
Jayasinghe resumed training Thursday for Asian Games competition.
	   The 23-year-old runner, Sri Lanka's best hope in the 100- and
200-meter races in Bangkok, told her friends that it was becoming
unbearable to stay in her room in the athletes' village.
	   Track and field competition starts Sunday.
	   ``She is not 100 percent fit, but insisted that she must go for
training this morning,'' said a Sri Lankan sports official. ``She
is a very bold person and we only wish she will be able to recover
from her ailment fully before the track and field starts.''
	   Jayasinghe has been looking forward to the Bangkok games to
resume her athletic career after being dogged by drug questions.
	   The 23-year-old sprinter tested positive for Nandralone-19 after
she won the silver in her favorite 200 meters at the Athens track
championships last year. The Sri Lankan Amateur Athletic
Association cleared her in a 2-1 verdict, but the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world governing
body, referred her case to arbitration in November.
	   Jayasinghe says she only took a drug to control her menstrual
cycle. She claimed she was set up by frustrated Sri Lankan sports
officials and government ministers after she resisted their amorous
advances.

Report: Singapore bank to initiate another round of rate cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest bank slashed its prime
lending rate from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Government-linked Development Bank of Singapore has now cut its
lending rate five times in about three months, lowering it by a
total of two percentage points, The Business Times said.
	   The DBS cut is expected to initiate another round of cuts by the
other `big four' banks, whose prime rates now stand at 6 percent,
the paper said.
	   The trend of lower interest rates has been driving the recent
rally in Singapore share prices, particularly bank and finance
stocks.

South Korean fans around? Bring your ear plugs

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When South Korean fans turn out to
support their heroes at the Asian Games, better bring your ear
plugs.
	   Any team with the stamina, lung power and determination of the
Korean fans would seem a sure thing to sweep the golds.
	   During a sixth-inning break to tidy up the grounds in
Wednesday's South Korea-Japan baseball game, Korean fans toting
their own big guitar amplifier drowned out the tunes played over
the stadium loudspeakers. The Koreans still gave the sound system a
run for its money even after it was cranked up to full volume.
	   Koreans had a lot to cheer about, as their team outslugged the
Japanese to win 13-8. Korea had six home runs, Japan four.
	   It probably didn't hurt that Korea's supporters were unceasing
in their work, cheering on every Korean batter to the very end of
the nearly four-hour game. When Korea was ahead, they roared. When
their team was behind, they roared even louder. Their main
cheerleader looked like a man possessed.
	   In addition to the amplifier, the 200 or so Korean fans came
equipped with drums, trumpets, wooden blocks and flags. National
spirit was boosted by the singing of ``Arirang,'' the country's
most famous traditional song.
	   ``Gold medal, for sure!'' said every Korean fan interviewed.
	   The Korean ranks were boosted by a sizable contingent of
students from Bangkok International School.
	   Led by their own cheering squad, they shouted, ``He's our
handsome man,'' in encouragement to the Korean players, and danced
to the Ricky Martin song, ``The Cup of Life.''
	   ``The Korean players are doing extremely well. The players are
confident due to their triumph over China,'' said school principal
Jung Un-gil.
	   ``Because Japan trains its players with advanced technology, our
Korean players must persevere and put in more effort,'' he said,
emphasizing that cheering players from their home country is a form
of patriotism for his students.
	   Asked if antagonism toward Japan, Korea's former colonial ruler
and longtime rival, could account for their feistiness, the Koreans
said no.
	   ``I think that only lower-class people have ill feelings toward
the Japanese,'' said Im Chang-soon, a 35-year-old businessman.
	   Japan's supporters were slow to build up steam. In the early
innings, most in fact were Thai factory workers, dressed in the
gray uniform of the Minebea company, a major Japanese investor in
Thailand.
	   A Minebea spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified, said the
company is a sponsor of the Thai national baseball team, and ``we
come every time we can when there is a baseball game to cheer for
the teams.''
	   But late arrivals boosted the number of Japanese fans, and a
pretty young Japanese woman matched the male Korean cheerleader
shout for shout by the end of the game.

Japan's upset of Kuwait endangers South Korean advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korean coach Huh Jung-moo thought
his squad's latest victory in the Asian Games soccer second round
had clinched a berth in the quarterfinals. He'd better think again.
	   ``I don't care about the next match,'' Huh said in the flush of
a 2-1 squeaker Wednesday over the United Arab Emirates. ``We've
already entered the quarterfinals, so we'll let those who haven't
played yet play next time.''
	   But Huh was basing his calculations on heavily favored Kuwait
beating Japan in the subsequent match. Instead, the Japanese, who
lost 2-0 to the South Koreans in the group opener, upset the
Kuwaitis 2-1.
	   If the young, gritty Japanese side Japan defeats the Emirates,
the group's weakest side, in a do-or-die clash Friday, they will
have a final 2-1 group record.
	   That puts enormous pressure on both sides in the showdown
between South Korea and Kuwait. South Korea needs at least a draw
to guarantee a quarterfinal berth.
	   If Kuwait wins, three sides will have 2-1 records, but only two
can advance. With its 5-0 defeat of the Emirates in their opener,
Kuwait has the edge in the goal differential that would decide a
tie.
	   Japan is more likely to pile on goals against the Emirates than
South Korea against Kuwait and theoretically could overcome the
current South Korean edge of four.
	   But the Korean-Kuwaiti showdown offers a potential goalfest
featuring the top three Asian Games scorers _ Jasem al-Huwaidi and
Farj Laheeb of Kuwait, with eight apiece, and Choi Yong-soo of
South Korea with six.
	   Vichit Kanunsukkasen, assistant secretary-general of the Asian
Games technical committee, said that such ties in the round-robin
phases of play would be decided first by goal differential.
	   If there is no difference, ties would be decided in descending
order by the greater number of goals scored, then the result of the
match between the two teams and, all else failing, by drawing lots.

Russian scientists developing microbes to eat astronauts'
</HEADLINE>
underwear &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russian scientists are developing a cocktail of
bacteria that will eat underpants in an effort to find new ways to
dispose of astronauts' dirty underwear.
	   The project, aimed at long space missions lasting months, such
as a trip to Mars, is reported in this week's issue of New
Scientist, a London-based science magazine.
	   The methane gas given off by the disposal unit could be used to
power the spacecraft, the scientists told the magazine.
	   ``This will be a revolution in the science of biodegradation,''
said Vyacheslav Ilyin, head of the microbial ecology laboratory at
the Institute for Biological and Medical Problems at the Russian
State Research Center.
	   Ilyin could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
	   Onboard washing machines are not exactly a priority, and in the
United States, astronauts are rationed to a gallon and a half of
water a day for a shower. Underwear is changed daily on U.S.
shuttle missions and every three days on space station missions,
NASA said.
	   ``Cosmonauts identify waste as one of the most acute problems
they encounter in space,'' Ilyin was quoted as saying.
	   Aboard Mir, the Russian space station, waste is stored in sealed
containers until a module arrives with fresh supplies. The waste is
then transferred to the module to be burned up when the spacecraft
re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, the magazine said.
	   But the modules only arrive about twice a year, the magazine
said.
	   The search for the most suitable combination of microbes is
expected to take up to a decade, New Scientist said. Researchers
aim to have the device ready by 2017, when Russia hopes to launch
its first crewed interplanetary mission.

Philippine government approves launch of dlrs 2 billion in bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
and the central bank have approved the planned launch of up to dlrs
2 billion worth of U.S. dollar, euro and yen bonds, a finance
official said Thursday.
	   The bond offering, being launched by the Department of Finance,
requires the approval of both the president and the central bank's
policy-making council, the Monetary Board.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu has said the bond offerings
consist of dlrs 500 million in U.S. dollar-denominated global
bonds, dlrs 500 million worth of euro-denominated bonds and between
dlrs 500 million and dlrs 1 billion of yen-denominated bonds.
	   The proceeds of the bond offerings will be used to stimulate
economic growth by increasing spending for critical projects such
as infrastructure and agricultural programs.
	   The government wants the bonds to have a maturity of between
seven and 10 years.
	   The Finance Department has decided to launch the bonds in the
first quarter of 1999, when the appetite among investors in the
international debt market is expected to improve.
	   Goldman Sachs has been assigned to lead manage the dollar bond.
Warburg Dillon Read and JP Morgan have been assigned to co-lead the
euro-denominated bond.
	   The Finance department has yet to assign the launch of the yen
bonds.
	   Espiritu has said that Japan's Export-Import Bank has expressed
interest in investing in up to half the total yen bond issue.

China pledges better human rights as police suppress dissent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect
the rights and freedoms of China's citizens Thursday while police
ransacked dissident homes in a widening clampdown on dissent.
	   Police in poor, overpopulated Sichuan province raided the homes
of at least six dissidents Wednesday, seized photos, writings and
pamphlets and detained some for questioning, New York-based Human
Rights in China reported.
	   Copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
U.N. rights treaties were believed to have been confiscated, the
group said. It added that Sichuan dissidents had planned to mark
the declaration's 50th anniversary Thursday by handing out copies
at schools, factories and mines.
	   One dissident questioned for six hours yesterday, Hu Mingjun,
was on a hunger strike to demand the release of a principal
organizer of a would-be opposition political party, Human Rights in
China said.
	   At least 29 dissidents have been detained or questioned since
China's Communist Party leaders moved last week to crush the China
Democracy Party. Its leading figures remain in jail and appear to
be headed for trial, one of them next week for subversion.
	   President Jiang, who heads the Communist Party, did not mention
the crackdown in a letter sent to a Beijing meeting to commemorate
the Universal Declaration's anniversary. Instead the government-run
Xinhua News Agency quoted him as pledging to strengthen democracy
and the rule of law.
	   ``The Chinese people, together with the international community,
will make their own contribution to a just, equitable, peaceful and
prosperous world,'' Jiang was quoted as saying.
	   In keeping with the party's belief that economic rights
supersede individual political liberties, Jiang called the
communist revolution the ``most significant achievement'' in
improving human rights worldwide.
	   He noted that China has signed 17 international rights treaties,
including the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights
in October.
	   Dissidents in China were energized by the government's
announcement last spring that it planned to sign the covenant,
which supports freedom of assembly. Since the signing, however,
China has tightened rules on setting up groups.
	   While China took part in drafting a U.N. statement for the
Universal Declaration anniversary, ``in practice it continues to
repress advocates for human rights, democracy, labor rights and
religious freedoms,'' Human Rights in China said.
	   ``The Chinese government should recognize that oppression is not
the way. The Chinese people's struggle for democracy and their
rights and interests is the tide of history,'' the group said in a
statement.
	   Human Rights in China said Chinese activists have formed two new
groups: one by laid-off workers from a Beijing factory who are
demanding better compensation, the other by dissidents in southern
Hunan province seeking freedom for labor rights campaigner Zhang
Shanguang. He has been held without charge since July.

Phieu says Vietnam willing to settle human rights differences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu says
Vietnam is willing to settle differences on human-rights issues _
as long as other countries respect its independence and
sovereignty.
	   He added that Vietnam should be selective in adopting outside
values, based on the country's political, economic, cultural and
social conditions. It should prevent ``bad elements'' from abusing
human rights and democracy to interfere in its internal affairs.
	   The U.S. State Department has put Vietnam on its list of
human-rights violators. Vietnam has said it does not belong on the
list, saying that protecting and developing human rights is a
natural function of the socialist system.
	   Phieu made the remarks in a letter, published Thursday in the
party newspaper Nhan Dan, to a national seminar on human rights
held in Hanoi on the 50th anniversary of the World Declaration of
Human Rights.
	   The one-day seminar Wednesday drew senior party and government
officials and representatives of the diplomatic corps. Nhan Dan
reported that some speeches disputed distortions of Vietnam's
human-rights situation by hostile forces. It did not elaborate.

Relatives' prayers seen helping executed mobster achieve better
</HEADLINE>
world &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The ashes of an executed Hong Kong gangster
have been taken from mainland China to a monastery in Kowloon, and
a top Buddhist leader says ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung ``may
be feeling dispirited there because of his non-body status.''
	   The Buddhist reverend urged Cheung's family to seek his
redemption by praying and donating some of his millions in assets,
according to a report Thursday in the South China Morning Post.
	   This would help Cheung ``develop his own intelligence and
kindness'' needed to transmigrate to the next world, the Rev. Hin
Hung told the Post.
	   Cheung, 43, and four henchmen were executed by gunfire Saturday
in Guangzhou, southern China, immediately after a court rejected
their appeals in a sensational gang trial.
	   They were sentenced to death last month for the kidnappings of
two top Hong Kong tycoons, the smuggling of dynamite and guns from
China into Hong Kong, armed robberies of gold stores, and the theft
of 277 tons of steel.
	   The kidnappings, reportedly of Victor Li, son of property
magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of big developer Sun
Hung Kai Properties, allegedly netted 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 210 million), the largest modern-day ransom.
	   Cheung's relatives hold some 160 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 20.5 million) in assets, which were once frozen by Hong Kong
authorities but since have been returned to the family by court
order.
	   The Rev. Wing Sing, managing director of the Hong Kong Buddhist
Association, agreed Cheung's relatives should donate some of the
money to ``reduce the sins of Cheung'' and give him a ``better
chance of samsara,'' or spirital transmigration, the Post reported.
	   Buddhists believe that the 49 days after a person's death are
critical in deciding whether the spirit could be reincarnated or be
left in limbo.
	   Relatives of the dead typically hire priests to pray for the
spirits and burn offerings to the gods. Those who die in accidents
or suicides have the ``non-body status'' and may be left to suffer
in eternal limbo.

Japanese glass companies raided over alleged bid-rigging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission on Thursday raided
several offices of a nationwide glass industry federation suspected
of fixing prices for repair glass used in automobiles.
	   The federation, comprising about 500 medium-and small glass
companies, is suspected of rigging prices on imported glass in
Japan, or restricting the distribution volume of glass on the
market, Kyodo News reported.
	   An official of the federation's Tokyo office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the raid was under way Thursday
afternoon, but refused to provide details. A Fair Trade Commission
official declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.
	   Bid-rigging, known as ``dango,'' is reputedly rife in Japanese
industry. The United States has accused Japanese companies of using
the practice to block American construction firms from competing in
Japan.
	   Under Japanese law, the maximum fine for bid-rigging is 100
million yen (dlrs 847,000).
	   Earlier this year, FTC, Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog, raided
more than 10 companies nationwide suspected of rigging bids for
contracts to build incinerators.

Philips lays off 750 in Singpore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics has fired 750 workers in Singapore as part of a global
restructuring drive, a spokesman for the company said Thursday.
	   Before the layoffs, about 8,000 workers were employed in six
Philips manufacturing plants in Singapore, producing color TVs,
radios and cellular phones.
	   ``The reason for restructuring is that some of the production
load has been relocated to China and Mexico, and the market in Asia
has weakened,'' the spokesman said.
	   Last month, Philips, Europe's largest consumer electronics
group, said it wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002.
	   The cuts come amid a rough season for Philips. The company said
in October that third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38
percent to dlrs 241 million.
	   Though Singapore has been least affected by the regional
economic crisis, the unemployment rate has doubled to 4.5 percent
in recent months. The government has launched a host of measures to
reform the economy and save jobs, but it still refuses to extend
any unemployment benefits.

UNDATED: four games (0-3-1).
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Kings 2, Capitals 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Inglewood, California, Stephane Fiset made 32 saves for his
first victory in more than a month and the Los Angeles Kings
defeated the Washington Capitals to snap a five-game losing streak.
	   Fiset, playing his 300th NHL career game, missed 16 games last
month with separate groin injuries. He hadn't won since Oct. 28
when the Kings beat New Jersey 4-0.
	   For just the second time in 11 games, the Kings led in the first
period and managed to hang on after losing 11 of their previous 12
games. The slump had dropped them into last place in the Western
Conference.
	   Washington has lost seven of nine.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 4, Canucks 4
	   In Anaheim, California, defenseman Bret Hedican's shorthanded
goal with 10:53 left in the third period lifted the Vancouver
Canucks into a tie with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
	   Hedican's score, which came on a 2-on-1 breakaway with center
Mark Messier, completed the Canucks' rally from a 4-2 deficit in
the second period.
	   Vancouver's comeback spoiled the first career multiple-goal game
for Anaheim rookie center Johan Davidsson, who scored twice.
	   The tie gave the Mighty Ducks their best home start ever with a
6-3-3 record and 15 points, topping the previous club record of
7-5-0 and 14 points set in 1995-96.
 &UR; Coyotes 4, Canadiens 2
	   In Phoenix, Jeremy Roenick and Keith Tkachuk each had a goal and
an assist and Mike Sullivan scored a short-handed goal in the
second period as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Rick Tocchet also scored for the Coyotes, whose string of 14
games without a loss ended in Edmonton on Dec. 2. Phoenix is 14-1-3
in its last 18 games.
	   Montreal captain Vincent Damphousse, in uniform despite a sore
back, tightened the game to 2-1 with a goal in the second period.
Jonas Hoglund made it 4-2 in the third, but undefeated Phoenix
backup goalie Jimmy Waite (6-0-2) stopped the Canadiens' other 19
shots.
	   Montreal lost for the 10th time in 13 games.

Taiwan's opposition leader resigns after polls setback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Badly stung in elections, Taiwan's main
opposition party now finds itself facing a power vacuum with the
resignation of its chairman, officials said Thursday.
	   Lin Yi-hsiung turned down pleas that he stay on for the time
being, telling the Democratic Progressive Party's central standing
committee Wednesday he would quit his post to take responsibility
for big defeats the DPP suffered at the polls on Saturday.
	   Lin immediately left the capital for ``meditation,'' his
secretary said Thursday.
	   His departure leaves the DPP rudderless at a time when
politicians are setting up a new legislative leadership and also
making initial preparations for primary elections for next year's
presidential and vice presidential races.
	   Lin resigned following the DPP's loss of Taipei's mayorship to
the governing Nationalist Party, and a worse-than-expected take of
70 seats in the 225-seat national Legislature.
	   The DPP consoled itself with a victory in the other major race
for the mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city.
	   Lin was urged to stay on by major party figures, including two
former chairmen and defeated Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's
top politician. The past two chairmen have both resigned following
electoral defeats, and newspapers speculated Lin may have felt
pressured into abiding by that established practice.
	   It won't be possible for the DPP to find an immediate
replacement.
	   Because the party permits its more than 152,000 members to elect
the chairman by direct vote, it may be more than six weeks before a
new leader is installed. In the meantime, an interim chairman will
be appointed by the 11-member central standing committee.
	   The disappointing election results also led to the resignation
of the party's secretary-general, Chiu Yi-jen, a key strategist.
	   Chen's loss in Taipei, by a 5 percent margin, shocked
supporters, who blamed huge campaign spending by the Nationalists,
whose candidate Ma Ying-jeou won the race. The DPP also lashed out
at what it called a smear campaign launched against Chen.
	   But observers said Chen's decision to cast the election as a
contest between majority native Taiwanese _ a group that includes
Chen _ and Chinese emigrants represented by his Nationalist
opponent may have stirred a backlash among voters.
	   Other commentators interpreted the vote as a rejection of the
DPP's platform of formal and permanent independence from China, a
move Beijing says it would meet with military force.
	   Though DPP leaders have refined that position _ saying they have
no plans to hold a plebiscite to press the issue in the near future
_ voters appeared to have endorsed the Nationalists' stance of
maintaining the status quo of de-facto independence without
provoking China.

Search teams find downed Russian fighter jet in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Search teams found a crashed fighter jet in the
Russian Far East on Thursday, a day after the jet disappeared from
radar screens, a news report said.
	   Search teams found the Su-27 fighter near a lake located north
of the Far Eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6,200
kilometers (3,900 miles) east of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The fate of the jet's pilot was still unknown, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   The Su-27 had been on a test mission after one of its engines
was replaced, and the pilot issued no distress signals before the
crash, ITAR-Tass said, citing local military officials.
	   Russian military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

School teacher rebuked for telling kids there is no Santa Claus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A school teacher has been reprimanded
because she told her students that Santa Claus does not exist,
sending some of the children home in tears.
	   After angry parents complained, local education minister Bill
Stefaniak _ a conservative politician who says he still believes in
Santa _ agreed to take up their case.
	   He spoke to the headmaster at the Isabella Plains primary
school, who told the teacher that she might have made an error of
judgement.
	   But the teachers' union stuck up for the teacher, saying she
should be praised for speaking truthfully.
	   ``This is not as issue about a Christian belief in the
resurrection of Christ,'' Warren Lee, the local branch secretary of
the Australian Education Union said Thursday. ``This is a story
about a commercial fable.''
	   Stefaniak has no regrets. He plans to tell all teachers in the
territory's schools exactly how they should respond to questions
about Father Christmas in future.
	   The teacher in the incident has not been named.
	   ``There are lots of things that should not be discussed in
classrooms.'' Stefaniak said.

Dollar up against yen, Japanese stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar,
bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Thursday
after Japan's finance minister clarified comments about U.S.
foreign exchange policy. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 117.72 yen at mid-afternoon, down 1.06 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
117.82 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 124.10
points, or 0.83 percent, to close the day at 14,807.80. On
Wednesday, the average closed up 123.70 points, or 0.84 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar fell to a five-week low
following reports that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the
United States prefers to keep the dollar in the 110 to 120 yen
range.
	   On Thursday Miyazawa said his comments had been taken out of
context, and the dollar surged back.
	   ``I wasn't talking about rates today,'' Miyazawa told reporters,
explaining that he was referring to the fact that the U.S. did not
want extreme rates.
	   Kyodo News agency had quoted Miyazawa on Wednesday as saying
that he sees nothing ``consistent'' in U.S. currency policy.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell as caution
prevailed ahead of Friday's special quotation for the settlement of
futures and options contracts, analysts said.
	   Investors also took to the sidelines to await the Japanese
central bank's quarterly survey of business sentiment, or tankan,
on Monday, analysts said.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9009.19
points Wednesday, down 18.79.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1139.78.
The TOPIX closed up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 360 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared to 368 million shares
Wednesday. Advances outnumbered declines 616 to 508, while 163 were
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.180 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.110
percent, driving its price down to 105.29 yen from 105.92 yen.

U.N. inspectors return to work at sites in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites on Thursday, a day after a team
was turned back from a branch office of the ruling Baath Party.
	   At least seven four-wheel drive vehicles with the U.N. logo were
seen leaving the Canal Hotel, which serves as the inspectors'
headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said. But she
declined to say whether teams would try to re-enter the Baath Party
site.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 inspectors was turned back when it
tried to enter a party office, a key site of Saddam Hussein's
government. The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the Iraqi
escorts had made a mistake in declaring the site sensitive.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, denounced the move. Richard
Butler, the chief U.N. inspector, called the action ``a blockage.''
	   Iraqi newspapers Thursday carried the official agency report on
the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials _ a sign Iraq may want to move past the dispute.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Cross said. Altogether, the
number is a little less than 200, she said.
	   They are expected to finish this round of work by Monday.
	   Seven teams visited 10 sites on Wednesday, and inspectors used
helicopters in one of the searches outside Baghdad, INA said,
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring
Directorate, which provides escorts to the inspectors.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for overseeing destruction of nuclear weapons, also
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials to
come up with a ``working schedule,'' Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   Surprise inspections could still prove a problem.
	   Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, who has been
a top weapons negotiator, said the escort was wrong in declaring
the Baath Party site sensitive. But he warned that future searches
of such sites must respect what he called ``understandings''
reached earlier.
	   He insisted that in the agreement with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that ended a crisis in February, Iraq agreed to allow
surprise inspections. But he said the United Nations also agreed
``to respect the security, integrity and legitimate concerns of the
Iraqi government.''
	   This, Rashid said, included prior notice in visiting sites the
government considers sensitive.

Armenian Deputy Minister of Defense killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An unknown attacker shot and killed
Armenia's deputy minister of defense on Thursday, a spokesman in
Armenia's Interior Ministry said.
	   The minister, Bagram Khorkhoruni, was killed as he left his
apartment early in the morning, said Interior Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Grigoryan.
	   Officials had no explanation for the killing. An investigation
into the incident was underway.
	   Armenia, an ex-Soviet republic in the Caucasus, has seen a sharp
increase in crime spurred by loosened state controls and chaotic
reform.
	   The small nation is embroiled in conflict with neighboring
Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. The 10-year-old
struggle is stalemated.

One Russian border guard killed, two wounded in North Ossetia clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen opened fired at a Russian
border post in North Ossetia, killing one border guard and wounding
two others, a news report said Thursday.
	   Two groups of attackers drove up to the post in Chmi village on
Wednesday night and shot at the border guards for less than a
minute before speeding away, the Interfax news agency said.
	   A Russian army sergeant was killed on the spot, while two
privates were wounded.
	   An investigation into the incident is underway.
	   North Ossetia, which lies in the mountainous northern Caucasus
near the breakaway region of Chechnya, is the site of frequent
outbursts of violence, mostly the result of ethnic strife.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 1,000 students protested in
Jakarta on Thursday as Indonesia's foreign minister promised that
the military would not use lethal force to control a rising spate
of anti-government demonstrations.
	   Speaking on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, Ali Alatas predicted that student protests would
continue as Indonesia moves toward greater democracy and tries to
fix its shattered economy.
	   ``Everybody has a right to express his views. So demonstrations
will continue, I think, as a feature of our newly emerging
democracy,'' he said.
	   Alatas warned that troops and police would take action to
prevent demonstrations from degenerating into riots.
	   ``Demonstrations are one thing. Riots are another thing,'' the
minister said at a news conference.
	   ``We cannot condone the burning, the sacking, the pillaging and
especially the violence that accompanies riots.''
	   He said some unidentified groups have tried to manipulate
otherwise peaceful student protests to create unrest for their own
political purposes.
	   The security forces were trying hard to prevent violence, he
said.
	   ``We will use acknowledged and recognized anti-riot gear ... but
not lethal weapons,'' he said.
	   On Nov. 13 security personnel opened fire on hundreds of student
protesters who tried to march on the Parliament. Nine protesters
were killed.
	   Outbreaks of riots and lawlessness have increased in recent
months as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years delivers
soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty.
	   As Alatas spoke, police shut down dozens of streets in the
capital of 11 million when students and others staged at least six
protests in various locations. Officers blocked buses carrying 500
students who were heading toward Parliament.
	   Most of the groups called for democratic reform and improved
human rights.
	   Student activists also demanded an immediate trial of former
President Suharto, who was questioned by state prosecutors
Wednesday about allegations that he corruptly amassed a fortune
during his three decades in power.
	   Hours after the ex-authoritarian leader was quizzed, thousands
of students demonstrated and some threw rocks and clashed with riot
police not far from the home of President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's
successor and one-time protege.
	   Habibie has pledged to hold general elections next year and has
implemented some political reforms, but he lacks credibility among
activists, who say he is a stooge of the old regime. They reject
his investigation of Suharto as cosmetic.
	   Gathering on the human rights anniversary, protesters shouting
slogans for an array of causes marched around a major intersection
ringed by five-star hotels to demand swifter democratic change.
	   ``For the sake of human rights, we oppose militarism,'' read one
banner.
	   Others read ``Release political prisoners'' and ``Stop money
politics and violence.''
	   Habibie has released dozens of political prisoners since taking
office in May from Suharto, who was dislodged by riots and protests
against his three-decade rule. But some pro-democracy activists
remain in jail.
	   The protesters included members of a women's human rights group,
supporters of opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and students
from the disputed territory of East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later, unleashing a guerrilla war that persists
today. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian authority
in East Timor and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and
Portugal.
	   East Timor's rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao, is serving a 20-year
sentence in a Jakarta jail for fighting the Indonesian military.

New Zealander takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealander Philip Tataurangi shot a
4-under-par 68 Thursday in strong, blustery winds to take the first-round in
the New Zealand Open golf championship.
	   Tataurangi leads by a stroke over Australian Rodney Pampling at the
Formosa Auckland Country Club course. A further shot back at 2-under par are
New Zealand's Michael Campbell and Australia's Brad King.
	   The pair joined Tataurangi and Pampling as the only players in the field
to return under-par scores on the first day.
	   Starting at the 10th tee, the American-based Tataurangi bogeyed the opener
but birdied the 11th to make the turn in 36.
	   Then he sailed through the front nine with birdies at the first, third,
fourth and eighth.
	   ``I was very happy with that,'' he said. ``If someone had given me 68 at
the start of the day I wouldn't have played.''
	   `Conditions were very difficult. I hit some very good shots in a very
difficult situation and I was quite happy with it.''

After rule changes, non-Latvians line up for citizenship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANASTASIA STYOPINA &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ She speaks Latvian well enough to teach it.
But for years, Olga Polushkina, like thousands of other ethnic
Russians in this Baltic country, couldn't apply for citizenship.
	   With the easing of Latvia's widely criticized naturalization
laws, Polushkina and other ethnic Russians are now streaming to
submit applications.
	   ``I have long waited for this opportunity,'' said Polushkina,
57. ``As soon as it appeared, I decided to submit the
naturalization documents.''
	   The liberalized laws took effect Nov. 10 and within two weeks,
officials said, about 2,000 people applied to be Latvian citizens _
as many as had applied for the entire previous nine months.
	   With citizenship, they'll get practical advantages such as the
right to vote in national elections and will be eligible to hold
jobs _ ranging from airline pilots to judges _ from which they'd
been shut out.
	   But just as important, they may get a sense of stability and
relief from the ethnic tensions that have troubled the country
since it became independent in 1991, when the Soviet Union fell
apart.
	   ``These people want to have a sense of belonging or a sense of
social status that maybe they feel they didn't have without
citizenship,'' said Nils Muznieks of the Latvian Center for Human
Rights and Ethnic Studies, one of the strongest critics of the old
laws.
	   ``More than anything else, citizenship gives them this sense of
psychological security,'' he said.
	   Latvia's ethnic tensions never exploded into violence, but the
country's treatment of ethnic Russians enraged the Kremlin. This
spring, Russia threatened trade sanctions over the issue, and
Latvians worried about aggression by their giant eastern neighbor.
	   Under Latvia's 50 years of Soviet rule, hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Russians moved in, so many that ethnic Latvians feared they
were about to become a minority in their own land. They bitterly
resented the Russians.
	   After independence, ethnic Latvians and those who could trace
their roots to pre-Soviet Latvia were granted citizenship. But the
Russians and other Slavic speakers who had moved in, and their
descendants, were not granted citizenship.
	   They could apply, but the old law's so-called windows system
meant that the older a person was, the longer he'd have to wait to
apply; some would have had to wait into the next century. The
system was seen by many as a clear attempt to punish those who had
been in the first wave of Stalin's drive to Russify Latvia.
	   Amendments that were narrowly approved in a referendum this fall
eliminate the windows system and grant citizenship to children born
of non-citizen parents after independence.
	   Because of the rule changes, around 20,000 ethnic Russians are
expected to become citizens each year, naturalization officials
estimate. That's in comparison with a total of just 10,000
naturalized citizens in the seven years after independence.
	   The new laws do not remove all the hurdles to citizenship.
Applicants must show proficiency in Latvian _ a tough task for many
who lived and worked in all-Russian communities and were not
educated in Latvian.
	   Muiznieks estimated that only 250,000 of 650,000 non-citizens
speak Latvian well enough to pass the test, and speculated many
won't even try to learn.
	   ``Some feel so alienated, they're saying, 'Forget it, you've
made the process so hard in the past, I don't want your darn
citizenship.'''
	   Many young ethnic Russian men also say they don't want
citizenship, because that would mean obligatory service in the
national army.
	   Naturalization Board head Eizenija Aldermane also noted that
some applicants could end up with long waits because the civil
service is capable of handling only about 20,000 applications a
year.
	   Mikhail Matveev, a 54-year-old electrician, said he wants to
avoid any delays for his daughter, so he lined up right away to
file her applications, and said he and his wife would follow suit
soon.
	   ``If a person lives in a state, he should be a citizen,'' he
said.

Zhou wins men's springboard

 &UR; Eds; Will be updated after women's 10-meter platform event &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese diving team leader Xue Li
warned that the squad must major make improvements to challenge for
gold medals at the 2000 Olympics despite continuing its dominance
at the Asian Games Thursday.
	   Zhou Yilin gave China a third gold from three events when he
nailed his final dive to beat compatriot Yu Zhuocheng by less than
four points on the 3-meter springboard.
	   Yu hit the front after five of Thursday's six optional dives
with an inward 3-1/2 somersault with tuck, which scored 84.66
points, but Zhou made up a 2.7-point deficit with the same dive at
the finish.
	   Zhou, the world championship silver medalist, scored 712.02
points, with Yu on 708.12. Thailand's Suchart Pichi claimed his
second bronze after also placing third in the men's platform event.
	   China won three gold medals in diving at the 1996 Olympics but
missed out altogether at the world championships in Perth this
year, and Xue is concerned about its progress despite strong
efforts at the Asian Games.
	   ``Our divers' performances are not impeccable, sometimes even
flawed,'' said Xue. ``If we want to regain our supremacy in the
world, we have to work hard after going home.''
	   Russia's Dmitry Sautin is the undisputed king of men's diving
with victories in both events at the world titles and the 1996
Olympic platform gold medal. Russia won all four golds at the world
championships in Perth.
	   Cai Yuyan was expected to give China a fourth diving gold on the
women's 10-meter platform later Thursday. World championship silver
medalists Guo Jingjing and Tian Liang won the women's 3-meter
springboard and men's 10-meter platform events earlier in the meet.
	   ``Winning these golds means nothing to us, for most of other
Asian countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving and we
Chinese divers mainly compete against ourselves in the games,'' Xue
said. ``But in the world major competitions such as the Olympics or
the world championships, there will be a galaxy of high-echelon
divers. Even a small error can cost you the gold when you compete
against them.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of students protested in
Jakarta on Thursday as Indonesia's foreign minister promised that

Waugh and Warne find support in Australian test side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with comment from Don Bradman, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Embattled Australian cricketers Wark
Waugh and Shane Warne, who have admitted taking money from an
Indian bookmaker, have the full support of the Australian test
team, captain Mark Taylor said Thursday.
	   On the eve of the third Ashes test against England in Adelaide,
Taylor said he asked all members of the current team at a meeting
on Tuesday whether they had any problems playing with Waugh or
Warne _ all said they did not.
	   ``They have our full and 100 percent support,'' he said.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of Australia's most popular and
highest-paid players, admitted Wednesday to being ``naive and
stupid'' for taking money from an Indian bookmaker during
Australia's 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   The revelation, made worse by an admission by the Australian
Cricket Board (ACB) that it had covered up the affair and asked the
International Cricket Council to do the same, has plunged
Australian cricket into crisis.
	   Taylor said Thursday he was told about the matter immediately
after the 1994 tour, and described the pair as foolish.
	   ``It worried me at the time because they compromised
themselves,'' Taylor said. ``But I knew they hadn't done anything
to jeopardize Australian cricket.
	   ``They did the wrong thing and took a cheap dollar.
	   ``Two guys took a fast buck, nothing more than that and their
records as individuals . . . since 1994 (are) second to none.''
	   The ACB fined Waugh 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400)
and Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for selling
information about weather and pitch conditions to the bookmaker.
	   The revelation shook the cricket world and is almost certain to
force the International Cricket Council to address the subject of
illegal betting in the sport at its meeting next month in
Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   Waugh and Warne's admissions and the ACB's behavior were widely
condemned by cricket commentators, in newspaper editorials and by
the public generally.
	   Sir Donald Bradman, Australia's greatest player, indicated his
disappointment when he met Taylor Thursday.
	   ``I think he's a little disappointed,'' Taylor said of Sir
Donald's reaction to the controversy. ``But _ typical Don Bradman _
he didn't make any rash statements.''
	   At a media conference Wednesday in Adelaide, Warne and Waugh
each read a statement but refused to answer questions, leaving ACB
chief executive Malcolm Speed to deal with the matter.
	   The ACB kept the matter secret until late Tuesday and Speed
admitted the incident's leaking had damaged Australian cricket's
reputation.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and told Speed they had never bet on cricket.
	   Taylor joined in criticism of the ACB, saying it was mistaken.
	   ``My feelings are exactly the same as they were at the time,
they made a mistake and they've admitted that mistake,'' Taylor
said of the board.
	   But a full-scale investigation by the ICC was not practical.
	   Taylor said he is convinced the current Australian team is free
of any links with bookmakers.
	   He said that after Tuesday's team meeting, each player had gone
up to Waugh and wished him well for the test. Warne is not on the
test team because of injury.
	   Waugh said Wednesday he took money from the Delhi-based
bookmaker to provide information the batsman considered
``mundane,'' but that he never discussed team tactics or lineups.
	   Warne, whose hopes of one day being the Australian cricket
captain will be damaged by the revelations, said he deeply
regretted the contact with the bookmaker who gave him money in
return for answering routine questions about the state of the pitch
and the weather.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Making his mark in his first major
international competition, China's Yang Wei won gold Thursday in
the men's floor exercises of the Asian Games gymnastics
competition.
	   The 18-year-old newcomer won with a routine that combined
soaring somersaults and breathtaking control. His 9.775 clinched
gold, while Kim Dong-hwa of South Korea took silver with 9.650.
	   China's Li Xiaopeng won bronze with 9.600. Li would have had
silver if he had not stepped out of bounds after a somersault, a
mistake that cost him a 0.1-point penalty.
	   Yang already had won a gold as part of China's men's team and a
silver in the all-around competition.

Bargain-hunting lifts Philippine stocks; index up 2.9 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rebounded Thursday
as bargain-hunters swooped down on oversold issues, propelling the
market to a strong finish, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 52.89 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,822.23, more than enough to recover its 2.6
percent loss Wednesday.
	   ``The market is basically following technicals right now rather
than fundamentals owing to a lack of news to perk up buying
activity,'' said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of
Abacus Securities Corp.
	   The market's recovery buoyed a number of blue-chip stocks.
	   A large block sale of Philippine Commercial International Bank
shares boosted its stock price by 2.3 percent. The shares were
bought by Benpres Holdings, bringing its stake to 30 percent from
17.7 percent.
	   Siao said investors were just waiting for a surge in buying
activity before re-entering the market.
	   ``The outlook, both economic and corporate, is improving
compared to earlier apprehensions, but investors don't want to be
chasing up stock prices,'' he said.
	   The cue to resume purchasing stocks came when the main index hit
1,759 points at mid-session, convincing market players that most
stock prices have reached oversold levels, he added.
	   The rally raised hopes Manila shares may still end the year on a
positive note, traders said. Traditionally, the market posts strong
gains in the last weeks of December as traders square off their
books before ending the year.
	   Blue chip issues tumbled Wednesday after former first lady
Imelda Marcos claimed her family owns many of them, which made
investors wary of taking stakes in the companies, traders said.
	   Further aiding the market's ascent Thursday was the peso's
strong performance against the dollar, traders said.
	   The peso was buoyed by a stronger yen and a general view that
the local currency is headed for a further appreciation, traders
said.
	   At mid-afternoon the dollar averaged 38.646 pesos, down from
Wednesday's average of 38.682 pesos.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites on Thursday, a day after a team
was turned back from a branch office of the ruling Baath Party.
	   At least seven four-wheel drive vehicles with the U.N. logo were
seen leaving the Canal Hotel, which serves as the inspectors'
headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said. But she
declined to say whether teams would try to re-enter the Baath Party
site.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 inspectors was turned back when it
tried to enter a party office, a key site of Saddam Hussein's
government. The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the Iraqi
escorts had made a mistake in declaring the site sensitive.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, denounced the move. Richard
Butler, the chief U.N. inspector, called the action ``a blockage.''
	   Iraqi newspapers Thursday carried the official agency report on
the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials _ a sign Iraq may want to move past the dispute.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Cross said. Altogether, the
number is a little less than 200, she said.
	   They are expected to finish this round of work by Monday.
	   Seven teams visited 10 sites on Wednesday, and inspectors used
helicopters in one of the searches outside Baghdad, INA said,
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring
Directorate, which provides escorts to the inspectors.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for overseeing destruction of nuclear weapons, also
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials to
come up with a ``working schedule,'' Amin was quoted as saying.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   Surprise inspections could still prove a problem.
	   Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, who has been
a top weapons negotiator, said the escort was wrong in declaring
the Baath Party site sensitive. But he warned that future searches
of such sites must respect what he called ``understandings''
reached earlier.
	   He insisted that in the agreement with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that ended a crisis in February, Iraq agreed to allow
surprise inspections. But he said the United Nations also agreed
``to respect the security, integrity and legitimate concerns of the
Iraqi government.''
	   This, Rashid said, included prior notice in visiting sites the
government considers sensitive.

Japanese officials agree to support Osaka's bid for 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top Japanese government officials agreed Thursday
to support a bid by the nation's third-largest city of Osaka to
host the 2008 Olympics, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Cabinet ministers are expected to formally endorse the decision
Friday, paving way for financial support for the city's preparation
for the event.
	   Osaka, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo, will
formally file its candidacy with the International Olympic
Committee in early 2000.
	   Paris, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur have also expressed hopes to
host the 2008 summer games. The host will be decided at an IOC
meeting in Moscow in 2001.
	   Osaka has asked the central government to shoulder about half of
the costs to prepare for the games, following the example of the
Nagano Olympics held in central Japan in February.
	   An estimated 80 billion yen (dlrs 680 million) will be needed to
build an Olympic stadium and a swimming pool if the city wins the
bid, said Osaka City spokesman Yoshimitsu Yorise.

	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.

Yeltsin likely to remain in country residence Thursday.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained at his country
residence outside Moscow on Thursday, taking no part in government
talks to draw up a 1999 budget to handle Russia's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin, who was released from a hospital on Wednesday, has
turned over almost all responsibility for the economy to Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. He has practically disappeared from view
after a string of illnesses.
	   The Kremlin said it had no information about the president's
Thursday plans, but he was expected to stay at the Rus country
residence for as long as necessary to recover fully from pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Wednesday that the
president would receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital'' and
needs a ``convalescence period'' at Rus, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Moscow.
	   Despite his current inactivity, the 67-year-old Yeltsin insists
he is fit to run the country and will serve out his term. But most
Russians have long since given up on him, and believe he cannot
maintain a normal working schedule.
	   The only peep from Yeltsin in recent days was his brief
emergence from the hospital Monday to fire his chief of staff and
several other top aides. The president returned to the hospital
soon after making the announcement.

Malaysia selling off U.S. helicopters for cheaper Russian ones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The cash-strapped Malaysian air
force is selling its two U.S.-made Sikorsky helicopters and
replacing them with cheaper Russian-made ones, Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar was quoted as saying Thursday.
	   The nation's treasury department was arranging for the sale of
the two helicopters, which cost Malaysia 30 million ringgit (dlrs 8
million) each, Syed Hamid was quoted as saying by Bernama news
agency.
	   The defense ministry was keen on replacing the two Black Hawks,
a model widely used by the U.S. armed forces, with Russian-made
MI-17s, he said.
	   Malaysia put off most defense purchases last year because of the
currency crisis that drove down the ringgit nearly 40 percent
against the U.S. dollar, sharply increasing the cost of imports.
	   Defense spending was cut by more than 20 percent, and the
government postponed purchase of new helicopters and ships and
canceled overseas training programs for personnel.
	   This year, the continuing poor economy has forced Malaysia to
pull out of regional military exercises of the Five Power Defense
Arrangement, a 27-year-old pact which includes Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand and Britain.

China gains diving gold, South Korea loses bowling bronze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China won a diving gold Thursday that
it considered not enough, and South Korea had to give up an Asian
Games bowling medal _ because it had too many.
	   The Chinese had three golds from three diving events after Zhou
Yilin came from behind on his last dive to beat compatriot Yu
Zhuocheng by less than four points on the 3-meter springboard.
	   But like the other major teams at these games, China is looking
ahead to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   ``Winning these golds means nothing to us, for most of other
Asian countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving and we
Chinese divers mainly compete against ourselves in the games,''
said Chinese diving team leader Xue Li. ``But in the world major
competitions such as the Olympics or the world championships, there
will be a galaxy of high-echelon divers. Even a small error can
cost you the gold when you compete against them.''
	   She added: ``If we want to regain our supremacy in the world, we
have to work hard after going home.''
	   China won three gold medals in diving at the 1996 Olympics but
missed out altogether at the world championships in Perth this
year.
	   South Korean bowlers swept the top three places in women's
singles Wednesday night, but Malaysia, which had the fourth-place
finisher, objected to giving the Koreans gold, silver and bronze.
	   Under games rules, only two competitors in an event are allowed
to win medals and their names must be registered before the start
of competition.
	   ``The rule is clear and the Koreans were made aware of it before
the competition started,'' said games organizing committee
spokeswoman Valerie McKenzie. ``It is designed to prevent one
country from dominating the medals in one sport.''
	   Overall, China was dominating these games. Early on the fourth
day, it had 27 golds _ and more certain to come in gymnastics _ far
ahead of Japan's 16 and South Korea's 15.
	   Aside from Zhou's diving victory, it had a gold from Zhao
Haijuan, who beat teammate Ma Huizhen by 36.46 seconds for gold in
the women's 25-kilometer time trial cycling race. Zhao won in 35
minutes, 17.55 seconds, averaging 42.50 kph (26.56 mph).
	   Iran's Ghader Mizbani Iranagh cycled down a Thai highway at an
average 47 kph (29 mph) for his gold in the men's 50-kilometer
race, holding off Kazakstanis Dmitriy Fofonov and Pavel Nevdakh.
	   Host Thailand gained its fourth gold of the games when its air
rifle team won its event with 1,769 points to 1,768 for South Korea
and 1,762 for Japan.
	   After a Jordanian weightlifter was expelled from the games early
Thursday for testing positive for a banned diuretic, Asia's top
Olympic official accused weightlifting's governing body of not
doing enough to combat doping.
	   Ayed Khawaldeh, 25, admitted the offense at a meeting between
Olympic Council of Asia officials and the Jordanian team, the OCA
said in a statement. He was the first athlete at these games to
test positive for banned drugs. He had placed seventh in the
56-kilogram division Monday.
	   ``Weightlifting is facing a very big problem with doping in
their sport, and they have a very big war against doping,'' OCA
president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah told The Associated Press. He said
the International Federation for Weightlifting was not doing enough
to educate competitors about drugs.
	   But Jordan's team doctor, Mohammad Abu-Ain, said he hoped
Khawaldeh would escape with a caution. He said Khawaldeh had not
known that the drug, which he took in Turkey while preparing for
the games, was banned and he was not trying to cheat.

Official church in China denies reports of mass arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's state-sponsored Protestant church on
Thursday denied reports that about 140 Christians were arrested in
two raids on underground church meetings.
	   The denial contradicted earlier statements to The Associated
Press by a local police official and a prison warden that Chinese
Christians in Henan were arrested and imprisoned in late October
and early November.
	   The China Christian Council, the umbrella organization
overseeing the government-sanctioned Protestant churches, said in a
statement that it was told by provincial officials that only five
Europeans _ three from Finland, one from Switzerland and one from
Sweden _ were detained in Henan and held for two days.
	   ``There were no arrests or imprisonments apart from this,'' the
statement said, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   The five Europeans were taken into custody on Nov. 9 and
released after they confessed to violating Chinese law on ``alien
religious activity,'' it added.
	   Under Chinese laws, foreigners may worship in state-sanctioned
churches but cannot engage in missionary work. Authorities control
the churches by requiring them to register with the government and
monitoring their activities.
	   Reports by Human Rights Watch of New York last month said the
arrests occurred in Wugang and Nanyang cities in Henan, where
underground church leaders from around the country were meeting.
The underground churches reject government controls.
	   A local police official in Wugang said by telephone last month
that police tried to disperse Chinese Christians who were gathering
illegally and arrested some of them.
	   Also last month, a prison official confirmed a report that 70
Christians were imprisoned.
	   Han Wenzao, president of the China Christian Council, denied
there is religious persecution in China but acknowledged that
abuses occur.
	   ``Because our country is so vast, one cannot expect government
policies to be consistently implemented everywhere and all of the
time, and this includes the policy of religious freedom,'' Xinhua
quoted Han as saying Wednesday in Harare, Zimbabwe, where he was
attending a World Council of Churches meeting.
	   He added that his organization receives reports of violations
from its congregations and asks government officials to investigate
and right any wrongs.
	   China has more than 12 million Protestants in 13,000 churches
and 35,000 Christian home meetings in rural areas, Han said.
	   The estimate does not include members of the underground
churches. The size of the underground churches is not known, but
supporters outside China give estimates that range up to 10 times
the size of the official church.

Daewoo, Samsung workers protest swap deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ About 1,000 Daewoo Electronics Co.
workers rallied Thursday to protest the planned takeover of their
company by the rival Samsung conglomerate.
	   In a deal struck earlier this week, Daewoo Electronics is to be
swapped by its parent conglomerate for the auto-making subsidiary
of the Samsung group, which also owns the nation's largest
electronics company.
	   Workers of both firms fear the deal will lead to mass layoffs.
	   ``This is a bad deal,'' said Rhee Yo-chan, a protest leader.
``If Daewoo Electronics is merged into Samsung Electronics, mainly
our people will be fired. This is unfair.''
	   The protesters, many of them union activists from the home
appliance maker's five plants, occupied the lobby of the Daewoo
headquarters building in central Seoul.
	   They wore headbands and waved pickets demanding that the
government and conglomerates nullify the swap. ``Guarantee our
livelihood!'' one picket said.
	   Also Thursday, 6,000 workers at Samsung Motors Inc. walked off
their jobs, declaring an indefinite work stoppage to protest the
swap.
	   Operations at the company's two plants had already been hampered
by workers' rallies for the past two days. The company produces
120,000 passenger cars and small trucks a year.
	   On Monday, President Kim Dae-jung and the nation's top five
conglomerates struck an industrial reform package in which the
Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK groups are to spin off half of
their 264 subsidiaries.
	   Kim said the reforms will help the bloated conglomerates slim
down, cut debts and restore foreign confidence in the battered
Korean economy.
	   But labor unions said the deals would drive thousands of workers
out of their jobs while allowing the conglomerates to keep their
wealth despite mismanagement.
	   The Samsung-Daewoo swap was the centerpiece of Monday's
corporate restructuring plans.

`It's pretty awesome' _ astronauts prepare to enter space station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Astronauts scheduled to open hatches at 1:46 p.m. EST and
enter Unity at 2:16 p.m. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ With most of their outside work
done, Endeavour's astronauts prepared to go inside the
international space station for the first time today to turn on the
lights and prepare the outpost for future assembly crews.
	   ``I think this is a very significant and almost momentous
event,'' NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, said of the first
in-orbit sojourn into the belly of the fledgling outpost 250 miles
above Earth.
	   Just before 2 p.m. EST, the crew of five American astronauts and
one Russian were to begin opening a series of hatches that connect
shuttle Endeavour with the two-part, seven-story space station.
	   Using flashlights to guide them, they were to float one by one
into the first piece of the outpost, the American-made Unity
module. The 36-foot cylindrical chamber will be pitch black, so the
astronauts' first official act is to flip on the lights.
	   ``It'll be kind of this momentous, `Zing! The lights come on,'''
Castle said.
	   The astronauts will share the moment with the world: They will
have a camera that should provide everyone back on Earth with the
first look inside the space station since it's been in orbit.
	   ``This is our goal _ building a space station and setting the
pace for the future. It's extremely challenging, but it's also
extremely rewarding,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said today.
``When you get to look out the window and see Zarya and Unity
joined together, and knowing that you get to go inside ... it's
pretty awesome.''
	   Once inside, there's plenty of work to be done.
	   Cabana and astronaut Jerry Ross will wire up a communications
system inside Unity. The others will continue on into the
Russian-built Zarya control module, where cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev
will replace a charging component on a faulty battery.
	   Other duties include transferring tools from the shuttle to the
space station for later use. The astronauts will even leave behind
clothes for the first permanent station crew, scheduled to arrive
in January 2000.
	   The work will continue through Friday, when the astronauts will
exit the space station and close the hatches to get ready for
Tuesday's return to Earth.
	   On Wednesday, in preparation for their journey inside the
station, Ross and astronaut James Newman ventured out on a
seven-hour spacewalk and attached two 100-pound antennas to the
outside of Unity.
	   The antennas are part of the communications system to be wired
up today. Once activated, the system will provide a direct,
virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and
Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to
rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations.
	   In a tense and meticulously planned operation, Newman also pried
open a stuck antenna on Zarya. After several pokes with a 10-foot
pole, the 4-foot strip antenna shot out.
	   ``There it goes! It's gone!'' Ross shouted.
	   ``You got it deployed. All right,'' Mission Control radioed up.
	   Other spacewalking chores completed by Ross and Newman included
erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity
and covering three of four protruding pins on the chamber with
thermal blankets.
	   Unfortunately for Ross, the thermal cover for the fourth pin got
loose and floated away; he lost two tools during Monday's
spacewalk. ``I don't believe this,'' he groaned.
	   It was the second time this week that Ross and Newman floated
out to work on the 35-ton station taking shape in the shuttle's
cargo bay. During a 7{-hour spacewalk on Monday, they connected
electrical and data cables to Unity, enabling it to be powered up.
	   One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission. On
Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out
a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna.

Hong Kong airport cuts retail rent by 30 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One of the many troubles at Hong Kong's new
airport has been slow sales at its stores and restaurants, and
officials responded Thursday to the retailers' dilemma by slashing
rent 30 percent.
	   ``We have to be realistic and take account of the current
economic situation in Hong Kong and Asia,'' said Billy Lam, chief
executive of the Airport Authority.
	   The rent reduction will be backdated to July, when the U.S. dlrs
20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport opened amid humiliating computer
glitches that affected passenger flights and cargo shipments.
	   Lam said the Airport Authority had agreed to cut rent for two
years because the numbers of expected visitors and spending are
down amid Asia's financial crisis.
	   In the first nine months this year, tourist spending slumped
28.8 percent to 39.4 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.0
billion) compared with the same period in 1997.
	   Tourist arrivals have also dropped 12.2 percent to 6.95 million.
	   The Hong Kong dollar, which is linked to the U.S. dollar, is the
only convertible regional currency not to have been devalued during
the financial turmoil, making Hong Kong a much more expensive
destination for Asian tourists who have seen their own currencies
plummeting by as much as 70 percent.
	   Retailers at the airport have been pressuring the Airport
Authority to share the burden of the economic slowdown as sales at
the outlets fell well below expectations.
	   They are paying a minimum rent plus a percentage of profits for
the retail space. The rents are highly inflated because the bidding
for the retail space was conducted in 1996 _ when property prices
were soaring before Hong Kong started sliding into recession.
	   Chris Donnolley, an airport spokesman, would not say how much
revenue the Airport Authority will lose by cutting rent.
	   He said local media reports citing a figure of 2 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 256 million) over two years couldn't be
confirmed.
	   The airport has 66 businesses that run 131 outlets in the
passenger terminal building. Many airlines, suffering from
dwindling number of passengers, are also urging the authority to
reduce landing charges to help them stay afloat.
	   Singapore also announced recently it will cut rents by 15
percent on offices, shops and warehouses at its Changi Airport next
year.

Australians stunned, outraged, disillusioned with cricket scandal

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The prime minister suddenly appeared on
nationwide television, standing somberly in front of an Australian
flag, to say ``something that's going to deeply disturb
Australians.''
	   Though John Howard's demeanor was solemn enough for an
announcement of the death of the Queen, he spoke of something far
deeper and more dear to Aussies than Her Majesty -- the scandal
engulfing Australian cricket.
	   Newspapers, broadcasters and Australians in the street were
incandescent with rage Thursday that top cricketers Shane Warne and
Mark Waugh took money from an Indian bookie in 1994 for weather and
playing field tips.
	   The aspect that enraged most people even more though, was that
the Australian Cricket Board kept the matter secret until this week
-- a case of Cricket-gate.
	   ``The Australian Cricket Board is guilty of hypocrisy in its
attitude to cricket's gambling problem. The board has pressed for
an inquiry into allegations of match-fixing in Pakistan while
engaging in a concerted cover-up of its own betting scandal,'' The
Australian national newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``Australia Mourns as the Game Falls from its Pedestal,'' cried
the Sydney Morning Herald's headline Thursday.
	   Cricket is deeply ingrained in Australia's consciousness, with
the nation
	   measuring itself against Britain, the mother country, on the
cricket green.
	   The Ashes tour, the big confrontation between Britain and
Australia, is now on, and the third match in the series begins
Friday in Adelaide.
	   The Australian team has bested Britain for years, but this
scandal turned
	   two of the top Aussie players from ``heroes into zeros
overnight'' in the eyes of most people, the Australian Broadcasting
Corp. said.
	   ``I would imagine that, given the great passion that Australians
have for
	   cricket, there's an intense feeling of disappointment about the
whole issue,'' said Howard, the prime minister.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb
	   Australians,'' he said, with considerable understatement.
	   The Australian's headline read: ``The Bookie Scandal -- 11,000
Dollars: Price of Disgrace,'' referring to the Australian dollar
payments the bookie gave Warne and Waugh during the 1994 tour of
Sri Lanka.
	   Both players admitted they were ``naive and stupid'' at a news
conference
	   Wednesday, then denied they had ever taken a bribe or thrown a
match and walked out without answering questions from reporters.
	   ``Ashamed -- And So You Bloody Well Should Be!'' read the
headline in the
	   tabloid Daily Telegraph of Sydney on Thursday. Its editorial was
headlined, ``Wounding the soul of a nation.''
	   In the nation's Parliament, opposition senators said they could
consider staging an inquiry next year if they were dissatisfied
with the Australian Cricket Board's handling of the Mark
Waugh/Shane Warne saga.
	   ``If there's still an inadequate response, it may be appropriate
for the Parliament to have a look at it,'' Australian Democrats
sports spokesman Andrew Bartlett said.
	   ``Unfortunately, one skeleton's been found, what else is
there?'' he asked.
	   ``I believe this may be cricket's biggest crisis since 1817,''
wrote Matthew Engel, editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack,
considered the ``Bible'' of cricket, in an essay in the Herald.
	   ``This calls into question the whole morality of the game, the
concept of
	   what is and is not cricket,'' Engel wrote.
	   ``So what happened in 1817? The same thing. Cricket rose to
prominence in
	   England in the 18th century as a gambling game. Eventually, the
betting overwhelmed the sport. Corruption took over,'' he said.
Bookies were banned -- until 1973.
	   Two weeks before Christmas, most Australians seem to feel they
same way they did after they learned, at some age, that Santa Claus
was a hoax -- disillusioned, enraged, ashamed at their own
gullibility.
	   They will go on to celebrate Christmas, and they will keep on
attending cricket matches, but only with a sense of innocence lost.

Palestinian ex-fighters to be out in force for Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 17 with Netanyahu repeating Israeli demand for
formal PNC vote &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It's not exactly the kind of
company President Bill Clinton normally keeps.
	   In the Gaza Strip, the welcome mat is out not only for the
American leader, but for hundreds of now-aging veterans of the era
when Palestinians pressed their cause the world over by hijacking
airliners, shooting up airports and staging guerrilla raids.
	   The centerpiece of Clinton's visit to Gaza on Monday is a
meeting of the Palestine National Council, a nearly 600-member
parliament-in-exile, which along with other Palestinian groups is
to reaffirm in his presence that the Palestinians have renounced
the goal of destroying Israel.
	   Like much else connected with the visit _ and the Wye River
land-for-security accord Clinton is coming here to promote _ the
Gaza gathering is viewed very differently by the two sides.
	   Palestinians consider the ex-fighters attending the session to
be heroes of a national struggle that they hope will culminate in
Palestinian statehood.
	   Israelis, though, are finding it hard to stomach the prospect of
Clinton's visit bringing together what they regard as a notorious
who's who of terrorism, a rogues' gallery responsible for taking
hundreds of innocent lives.
	   ``It's certainly not a group or body that we value, to say the
least,'' government spokesman Moshe Fogel said of the Palestine
National Council.
	   Some former guerrillas are boycotting the meeting to express
their continuing opposition to any peace with Israel.
	   ``What will happen in Gaza does not represent the real will of
the Palestinian people,'' said PNC member Leila Khaled, a onetime
Palestinian commando who hijacked airliners in 1969 and 1970.
	   Those expected to attend include Mohammed Abbas, who oversaw the
1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in which an elderly
American passenger was shot dead in his wheelchair, and Mohammed
Oudeh, implicated by Israeli and American intelligence experts in
planning the botched hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics
that left 11 Israeli athletes dead.
	   Using its security veto over who enters Gaza, Israel has banned
some ex-fighters now living abroad, including members of the
radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
from attending the session.
	   But Israel cannot keep too many PNC members away or it will
defeat the main purpose of the meeting, which it itself insisted
upon: amending the Palestinian national charter to nullify clauses
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel and the Palestinians disagree sharply over how that
should be accomplished.
	   The Palestinians say they already renounced the offending
clauses in a 1996 meeting of the PNC and in a subsequent letter
from Arafat to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
	   Reflecting that, official Palestinian invitations to the
gathering merely ask those attending to listen to a speech by
Clinton in support of the peace accords.
	   Palestinian leaders have said the abandonment of a call to arms
against Israel will be affirmed by acclamation, not by an actual
vote. But Israel wants a formal tally, and warns that without one,
the peace accord is off.
	   ``They have to vote _ and I stress to vote,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel radio on Thursday. ``If there is no
vote ... Israel will not implement its part (of the Wye accords).''
	   Whatever distaste Israel feels about the session is amply
reciprocated by some of the former Palestinian fighters who plan to
attend.
	   Oudeh, who is better known by his nom de guerre of Abu Daoud,
singles out Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, whom many
Palestinians blame for the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen.
	   ``Who is he to talk about us having blood on our hands?'' he
said.
	   Some of those who will be rubbing elbows with Clinton at the
Gaza gathering have distanced themselves from past acts of
violence.
	   Abbas, who oversaw the Achille Lauro hijacking, has said
publicly for several years now that the operation was a mistake.
	   Other PNC members remain defiant, insisting their bloody tactics
were a legitimate means of bringing the Palestinian plight to the
world's attention.
	   Leila Khaled, now a 54-year-old women's activist and mother of
two children, said in a telephone interview from Amman, Jordan,
that she had no regrets about her hijacker past.
	   Oudeh, 61 and a lawyer in the West Bank town of Ramallah, was
never charged in the Munich massacre and does not acknowledge
direct involvement in it. But he says attacks like it ultimately
led to peace negotiations with Israel.
	   ``It was a field of struggle,'' he said. ``Maybe we fought too
much, but we suffered too much too. Now we've come halfway across
the bridge. It's time the Israelis did too.''

Gymnast unsure of future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Moceanu &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Gymnast Dominique Moceanu believes her father
stalked her. Police believe he may have tried to arrange the murder
of her friends. And his attorney mocked her choice of friends and
fed sexual innuendo to the media.
	   That's the story that has a judge convinced that Moceanu's
father _ not any friends she has or may have _ is the current
threat in the young Olympian's life.
	   On Wednesday, state District Judge John D. Montgomery ordered
Dumitru Moceanu to stay away from his daughter for a full year. The
ruling sent Miss Moceanu immediately into tears of relief and
sorrow, while a smirking Dumitru Moceanu sat stunned in his chair.
	   ``I was sad, it was a sad day,'' Moceanu told The Associated
Press late Wednesday as she prepared to fly to New York to make the
rounds at morning news shows.
	   ``I love my mother and sister and deep down, my dad,'' she said.
``Maybe in a year he'll change.''
	   Being declared a legal adult on Oct. 28 so she could force her
parents to answer questions about her finances, hardly made life
easier for the 17-year-old gymnast.
	   Even before the ink was dry on the agreement, Moceanu began
haranguing his daughter about her decision to leave her home and
the couple's 70,000 square foot (6,300-square-meter) gym north of
Houston.
	   Suspicious that his daughter was being influenced by others,
Moceanu focused specifically on her coach, Luminita Miscenco, and
32-year-old married contractor Brian Huggins, who once worked at
the gym.
	   ``I told Brian not to be around her,'' Dumitru Moceanu testified
Wednesday.
	   When the Olympian filed suit against her parents in mid-October,
her father reacted by filing a false kidnapping charge against
Huggins. Miss Moceanu, Huggins and his wife Marcy have fiercely
rejected any notion of a sexual relationship.
	   Despite the denials, the parents' attorney, Katherine Scardino,
has fueled the rumor mill.
	   ``It doesn't pass the smell test,'' she said with a sniff after
failing to block Miss Moceanu's request for a permanent protective
order against her clients.
	   According to Moceanu, the attacks on her social life are just
part of her father's scheme to drive his daughter back home. Once
her emancipation was granted, the athlete's father turned to verbal
threats and told her during the few calls she would take from him
that he had a private investigator tailing her every move.
	   Moceanu testified she noticed at least on four occasions her
father's car parked outside her school. Two of those times she saw
her father sitting in the car, waiting and watching her.
	   ``I don't see nothing wrong with that,'' her father told the
court.
	   Then on Nov. 13, three homicide detectives came to her new
apartment with news her father had asked a private investigator to
arrange the murders of Huggins and Miscenco.
	   ``He's put a contract on these two people's lives,'' Miss
Moceanu told The AP.
	   Moceanu testified she and Huggins so feared for their safety
that they left Houston for 10 days, including a brief Caribbean
stop, while police investigated alleged threats by her father.
Huggins' wife and child left for Michigan.
	   When asked Wednesday whether her father was capable of such a
thing, Moceanu said, ``At this point, anything's capable.''
	   Her father rejected the allegations in contradicting testimony.
He admitted he asked _ but did not pay _ a private investigator to
find out his daughter's address. He did not tell his daughter, as
alleged, that he had the investigator take photographs of her
outings.
	   But when questioned about the murder-for-hire plot, Moceanu
invoked his constitutional right to not offer self-incriminating
testimony.
	   ``He was lying, unfortunately,'' his daughter said. ``I have no
reason to lie.''
	   For now, Moceanu says she's relieved that the judge saw a
pattern of controlling behavior that earned her slaps across the
face when she gained weight, or as in one case before the 1996
Olympic Summer Games, was caught with candy.
	   After Judge Montgomery ordered Moceanu to remain at least 500
feet (150 meters) away from his daughter and to communicate with
her only in writing or through an attorney, both he and his wife
Camelia refused comment.
	   Scardino described the couple as ``devastated'' at the ruling.
	   While nothing in the four hours of testimony during the hearing
led Judge Montgomery to believe Moceanu's father intentionally set
out to harm his daughter, he found the Romanian native's actions
qualified as abuse under Texas law.
	   ``I do find family violence ... has occurred,'' the judge
explained. ``And it is likely to occur in the future.

Netanyahu won't pullback troops even if pressed by Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Thursday he will not hand over more West Bank land unless the
Palestinians meet a list of demands, and that even U.S. President
Bill Clinton will not be able to change his mind.
	   ``It is Israel which determines issues linked to its future,''
Netanyahu said when asked whether he was willing to engage in a
showdown with Clinton over whether the Palestinians have fulfilled
their obligations under the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu has complained that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has violated the agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners,
in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The Israeli leader has accused Arafat of organizing the
widespread stone-throwing protests that have swept the West Bank in
recent days and of inciting against Israel over prisoner releases.
	   The Palestinians have said Netanyahu has broken a promise to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activity, but the
Israeli leader said he never made such a commitment. Most of the
250 Palestinian prisoners freed so for have been criminals.
	   With the dispute over the prisoners still unresolved, the next
argument, potentially more damaging to the peace accord, is already
shaping up. On Monday, Clinton is to speak in Gaza City to members
of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and delegates from other Palestinian groups.
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the delegates are to reaffirm a
year-old letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that all
clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction are null and void.
	   Israel has said the PNC must hold a vote by a show of hands, but
the Palestinians say the Wye agreement only requires them to
approve the Arafat letter by acclamation.
	   Asked Thursday by Israel radio whether he would stick to this
position even if Clinton declared the PNC session a success,
Netanyahu said: ``If there is no vote and they (the Palestinians)
do not fulfill the other conditions, Israel will not implement its
part. We are, as you know, as sovereign state.''
	   Unless a last-minute compromise is found, it appears that
Netanyahu and Clinton are headed for a showdown. It is unlikely
Clinton will side with Israel in saying the PNC has not done what
it was asked to do because this would also mean the presidential
visit has failed.
	   Netanyahu said that in addition to a PNC vote, Arafat must
publicly withdraw from plans to unilaterally declare a state in
May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period, and drop his
demands concerning prisoner releases. Only then, Netanyahu said,
would Israel ``seriously consider continuing the peace process.''

Toronto GM says he likes an offer for Clemens, but won't say what
</HEADLINE>
offer is &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Roger Clemens chase will go into the
weekend. Jose Canseco and Benito Santiago didn't wait that long to
leave the Toronto Blue Jays.
	   Santiago agreed Wednesday to a dlrs 2 million, one-year contract
with the Chicago Cubs, while Canseco agreed to sign with the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
	   While they were free agents, Toronto general manager Gord Ash
kept up Clemens trade talks and said one team has made an
acceptable offer for the pitching ace _ although the Blue Jays
haven't accepted it.
	   By mentioning the offer, Ash increased pressure on other teams
to raise their offers for the five-time Cy Young Award winner.
	   ``I have an offer from a club that from a player point of view
satisfies our needs,'' Ash said. ``What I've suggested to that club
is that they get guidance from Roger's representatives on how they
should proceed from there.''
	   It was believed that the offer didn't come from one of the top
three contenders _ the New York Yankees, Texas and Houston _ and
that Ash was dealing with a team he wasn't sure Clemens would
accept.
	   ``I guess what I'm directing that club to do is make sure they
qualify,'' Ash said. ``They had a lot of questions for me that I
couldn't answer.''
	   The most likely candidate to fit that description is Cleveland,
although it's possible that it could be a National League team,
possibly the New York Mets or maybe even Colorado or Atlanta.
	   ``The calls today have been a little less frequent. I don't have
a reason for that,'' Ash said. ``I would say from the lack of
conversation, this is going to drag into the weekend, for sure.''
	   Ash said the team that made an acceptable proposal didn't
contact him Wednesday and that he talked with only two clubs.
	   One of those was Texas. Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, who
traveled to Toronto and talked with Ash for 90 minutes on Tuesday,
met with him again in the morning.
	   ``I even paid for breakfast,'' Ash said.
	   Money is an aspect of the Clemens negotiations, too. He has
salaries of dlrs 5 million next year and dlrs 6.35 million in 2000,
and Toronto owes dlrs 5 million in deferred money from the first
two seasons of the deal, which currently guarantees a minimum of
dlrs 31.5 million over four years.
	   Clemens, who lives in Houston, is convinced Toronto won't
contend and asked to be traded closer to home or to a contender.
When he signed with the Blue Jays after the 1996 season, Toronto
agreed to comply if he ever asked for a trade.
	   Santiago, 33, is a 12-year veteran who played in only 15 games
last season for the Toronto Blue Jays following an auto accident
last January in which he strained ligaments in his right knee. He
rejoined the team in September, batting .310 with five doubles and
four RBIs in 29 at-bats.
	   ``He's 100 percent. The Cubs did their homework to make sure of
that,'' said Santiago's agent, Lonnie Cooper. ``This is where he
wanted to play. He's very comfortable with the manager and the
general manager.''
	   Santiago gets a dlrs 1.5 million salary and the chance to earn
dlrs 500,000 in performance bonuses. Chicago's option is for dlrs
3.5 million with a dlrs 500,000 buyout.
	   Canseco hit .237 with 107 RBIs and 29 stolen bases for Toronto,
his best totals since 1991. Six of Canseco's homers came against
Tampa Bay, which got a total of 33 homers from its most productive
right-handed batters _ Bubba Trammell (12), Bobby Smith (11) and
Mike Kelly (10).

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained at his country
residence outside Moscow on Thursday, taking no part in government
talks to draw up a 1999 budget to handle Russia's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin, who was released from a hospital on Wednesday, has
turned over almost all responsibility for the economy to Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. He has practically disappeared from view
after a string of illnesses.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin had no
meetings planned for Thursday, but he was expected to stay at the
Rus country residence for as long as necessary to recover fully
from pneumonia.
	   The president will receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital''
and needs a ``convalescence period'' at Rus, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) north of Moscow, Yakushkin said earlier.
	   Despite his current inactivity, the 67-year-old Yeltsin insists
he is fit to run the country and will serve out his term. But most
Russians have long since given up on him, and believe he cannot
maintain a normal working schedule.
	   Yeltsin went to the Kremlin for several hours on Monday to fire
his chief of staff and several other top aides, and then returned
to the hospital soon after making the announcement.

`It's pretty awesome' _ astronauts prepare to enter space station

 &UR; Eds: Astronauts scheduled to open hatches at 1:46 p.m. EST and
enter Unity at 2:16 p.m. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ With most of their outside work
done, Endeavour's astronauts prepared to go inside the
international space station for the first time today to turn on the
lights and prepare the outpost for future assembly crews.
	   ``I think this is a very significant and almost momentous
event,'' NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, said of the first
in-orbit sojourn into the belly of the fledgling outpost 250 miles
above Earth.
	   Just before 2 p.m. EST, the crew of five American astronauts and
one Russian were to begin opening a series of hatches that connect
shuttle Endeavour with the two-part, seven-story space station.
	   Using flashlights to guide them, they were to float one by one
into the first piece of the outpost, the American-made Unity
module. The 36-foot cylindrical chamber will be pitch black, so the
astronauts' first official act is to flip on the lights.
	   ``It'll be kind of this momentous, `Zing! The lights come on,'''
Castle said.
	   The astronauts will share the moment with the world: They will
have a camera that should provide everyone back on Earth with the
first look inside the space station since it's been in orbit.
	   ``This is our goal _ building a space station and setting the
pace for the future. It's extremely challenging, but it's also
extremely rewarding,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said today.
``When you get to look out the window and see Zarya and Unity
joined together, and knowing that you get to go inside ... it's
pretty awesome.''
	   Once inside, there's plenty of work to be done.
	   Cabana and astronaut Jerry Ross will wire up a communications
system inside Unity. The others will continue on into the
Russian-built Zarya control module, where cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev
will replace a charging component on a faulty battery.
	   Other duties include transferring tools from the shuttle to the
space station for later use. The astronauts will even leave behind
clothes for the first permanent station crew, scheduled to arrive
in January 2000.
	   The work will continue through Friday, when the astronauts will
exit the space station and close the hatches to get ready for
Tuesday's return to Earth.
	   On Wednesday, in preparation for their journey inside the
station, Ross and astronaut James Newman ventured out on a
seven-hour spacewalk and attached two 100-pound antennas to the
outside of Unity.
	   The antennas are part of the communications system to be wired
up today. Once activated, the system will provide a direct,
virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and
Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to
rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations.
	   In a tense and meticulously planned operation, Newman also pried
open a stuck antenna on Zarya. After several pokes with a 10-foot
pole, the 4-foot strip antenna shot out.
	   ``There it goes! It's gone!'' Ross shouted.
	   ``You got it deployed. All right,'' Mission Control radioed up.
	   Other spacewalking chores completed by Ross and Newman included
erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity
and covering three of four protruding pins on the chamber with
thermal blankets.
	   Unfortunately for Ross, the thermal cover for the fourth pin got
loose and floated away; he lost two tools during Monday's
spacewalk. ``I don't believe this,'' he groaned.
	   It was the second time this week that Ross and Newman floated
out to work on the 35-ton station taking shape in the shuttle's
cargo bay. During a 7{-hour spacewalk on Monday, they connected
electrical and data cables to Unity, enabling it to be powered up.
	   One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission. On
Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out
a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna.

Ousted Megret says Le Pen should let party congress decide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The lieutenant of far right leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen, ousted by his boss a day earlier in a power struggle, fired
back Thursday by saying their party congress next month should
settle the dispute.
	   ``You don't resolve the problem by accusing members of the
National Front who propose this congress, of being racists or
extremists,'' Bruno Megret said of earlier comments by Le Pen.
	   ``It's an accusation that's extremely grave, because it's the
same accusation our adversaries make against us,'' he told RTL
radio.
	   ``I think it's important that Jean-Marie Le Pen retract himself
on that question,'' Megret said. ``The same weapons our adversaries
use have just been turned against ourselves.''
	   Megret renewed his call for the emergency party meeting in
January. ``If we don't have that congress, what do we do? Do we
continue to cut off heads? And when we've cut off 80 percent of the
heads of the party, what's left? That's not the solution.''
	   In firing Megret on Wednesday, Le Pen said the call for the
party congress was ``a crime against the National Front as well as
a crime against France.''
	   The rapid-fire events heralded a drawn-out showdown between the
two men _ sure to please opponents of a party that is widely seen
as racist and anti-Semitic, but consistently draws 15 percent of
French voters.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the party for a
quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle with the
quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _ Megret
has weakened his hand.

Younis' four-wicket burst leaves Zimbabwe struggling

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Paceman Waqar Younis snapped up four
wickets (4-18) in 25 balls as Zimbabwe limped to 68 for five at
lunch Thursday on the first day of the second cricket Test against
Pakistan.
	   Younis polished off the Zimbabwean top order on a grassy wicket
in a spell of eight overs which cost him just 18 runs.
	   Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail pulled out of the match on
Thursday morning as the home team made five changes from the team
which lost the first Test against the visitors.
	   ``Sohail is not feeling well. He had a low blood pressure last
night,'' team manager Azhar Zaidi said.
	   Moin Khan replaced Sohail as skipper as Pakistan awarded the
Test cap to 22-year-old Rawalpindi opener Muhammad Naveed, who will
open the innings with Saeed Anwar. Khan won the toss and put
Zimbabwe in to bat on a green top wicket.
	   Younis exploited the favorable conditions and removed opener
Gavin Rennie in his second over as the left-hander was caught by
Ijaz Ahmed in the second slip.
	   Murray Goodwin, who scored an unbeaten 73 in Zimbabwe's first
Test victory at Peshawar, was caught behind off a superb Younis
outswinger after scoring 10. Younis then further reduced the
visitors to 29 for four by claiming the wicket of Alistair Campbell
(5) and trapping Grant Flower leg before.
	   Shoaib Akhtar claimed his first wicket when Neil Johnson got the
top edge and offered a return catch to the bowler after making 14.
Andy Flower was unbeaten on 16 with the help of two fours while
Craig Wishart was not out on 8 at lunch.
	   Also back on the Pakistan team was Salim Malik, who is playing
his 100th Test match for Pakistan. He replaced injured Inzamamul
Haq, who is suffering from influenza.
	   Middle-order batsman Hasan Raza and Saqlain Mushtaq are the
other two changes made by Pakistan. They replaced Azhar Mahmood and
leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed respectively.
	   Zimbabwe made just one change from the first Test, bringing in
leg-spinner Adam Huckle in place of off-spinner Andrew Whittall.

Israeli warplanes repeatedly break sound barrier over Beirut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over a nervous Beirut for the second day Thursday in what the media
termed a ``sonic bombardment'' of the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut _ still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _
is on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   Six supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings and set off the alarms of vehicles Thursday
morning.
	   The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people who were frightened by
similar deafening bangs a day earlier.
	   The Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday,
including the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking
cover for fear the city was under attack.
	   Many here still remember Israel's 1982 invasion of Beirut, when
the city came under heavy air and naval attack.
	   The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least
175 people.
	   During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two
power stations in hills overlooking the capital.
	   Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon
on Thursday.
	   Asked Wednesday about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman
said: ``We do not divulge movements of the air force.'' The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under Israeli rules, would not
comment further.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper described the Israeli action in a
front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.''
	   Israeli jets frequently make high-altitude flights over Lebanon
for reconnaissance purposes.
	   The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fight to drive
Israeli troops and their allied militiamen from southern Lebanon,
where the Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in
1985 to protect its northern settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for most of the attacks on the Israeli soldiers last
month.

Dollar up against yen, Japanese stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar plunged and then recovered Thursday
following remarks about currency rates from Japan's finance
minister. Tokyo stock prices finished lower.
	   The dollar bought 117.06 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.72 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York
level of 117.82 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 124.10
points, or 0.83 percent, to close the day at 14,807.80. On
Wednesday, the average closed up 123.70 points, or 0.84 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar fell to a five-week low upon
reports that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the United
States prefers to keep its currency in the 110 to 120-yen range.
	   Miyazawa later said his comments had been taken out of context,
and the dollar surged back.
	   ``I was talking about history,'' Miyazawa told reporters
Thursday, explaining that he was merely saying the U.S. did not
want rates as extreme as in the past.
	   ``Miyazawa's comments (Thursday) sent everybody scrambling to
cover dollar short positions,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy manager
of foreign exchange at Nomura Trust and Banking. ``There really
wasn't anything that justified the dollar getting sold off like
that.''
	   Kyodo News agency had quoted Miyazawa on Wednesday as saying
that he sees nothing ``consistent'' in U.S. currency policy.
	   The dollar ranged from 116.65 yen to 118.40 yen in Thursday's
trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell as caution
prevailed ahead of Friday's special quotation for the settlement of
futures and options contracts, analysts said.
	   Investors also took to the sidelines to await the Japanese
central bank's quarterly survey of business sentiment, or tankan,
on Monday, analysts said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1139.78.
The TOPIX closed up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 360 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared to 368 million shares
Wednesday. Advances outnumbered declines 616 to 508, while 163 were
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.180 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.110
percent, driving its price down to 105.29 yen from 105.92 yen.

Palestinian ex-fighters to be out in force for Clinton visit

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It's not exactly the kind of
company President Bill Clinton normally keeps.
	   In the Gaza Strip, the welcome mat is out not only for the
American leader, but for hundreds of now-aging veterans of the era
when Palestinians pressed their cause the world over by hijacking
airliners, shooting up airports and staging guerrilla raids.
	   The centerpiece of Clinton's visit to Gaza on Monday is a
meeting of the Palestine National Council, a nearly 600-member
parliament-in-exile, which along with other Palestinian groups is
to reaffirm in his presence that the Palestinians have renounced
the goal of destroying Israel.
	   Like much else connected with the visit _ and the Wye River
land-for-security accord Clinton is coming here to promote _ the
Gaza gathering is viewed very differently by the two sides.
	   Palestinians consider the ex-fighters attending the session to
be heroes of a national struggle that they hope will culminate in
Palestinian statehood.
	   Israelis, however, can't stand the prospect of bringing together
what they regard as a notorious who's who of terrorism, a rogues'
gallery responsible for taking hundreds of innocent lives.
	   ``It's certainly not a group or body that we value, to say the
least,'' Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said of the
Palestine National Council.
	   Some former guerrillas are boycotting the meeting to express
their continuing opposition to any peace with Israel.
	   ``What will happen in Gaza does not represent the real will of
the Palestinian people,'' said PNC member Leila Khaled, a onetime
Palestinian commando who hijacked airliners in 1969 and 1970.
	   Those expected to attend include Mohammed Abbas, who oversaw the
1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in which an elderly
American passenger was shot dead in his wheelchair, and Mohammed
Oudeh, implicated by Israeli and American intelligence experts in
planning the botched hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics
that left 11 Israeli athletes dead.
	   Using its security veto over who enters Gaza, Israel has banned
some ex-fighters now living abroad, including members of the
radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
from attending the session.
	   But Israel cannot keep too many PNC members away or it will
defeat the main purpose of the meeting, which it itself insisted
upon: amending the Palestinian national charter to nullify clauses
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel and the Palestinians strongly disagree over exactly how
that should be accomplished.
	   The Palestinians say they already renounced the offending
clauses in a 1996 meeting of the PNC and in a subsequent letter
from Arafat to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
	   Reflecting that, official Palestinian invitations to the
gathering merely ask those attending to listen to a speech by
Clinton in support of the peace accords.
	   Palestinian leaders have said the abandonment of a call to arms
against Israel will be affirmed by acclamation, not by an actual
vote. But Israel wants a formal tally, and warns that without one,
the peace accord is off.
	   ``They have to vote _ and I stress to vote,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel radio on Thursday. ``If there is no
vote ... Israel will not implement its part (of the Wye accords).''
	   Whatever distaste Israel feels about the session is amply
reciprocated by some of the former Palestinian fighters who plan to
attend.
	   Oudeh, who is better known by his code name of Abu Daoud,
singles out Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, whom many
Palestinians blame for the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen.
	   ``Who is he to talk about us having blood on our hands?'' he
said.
	   Some of those who will be rubbing elbows with Clinton at the
Gaza gathering have distanced themselves from past acts of
violence.
	   Abbas, who oversaw the Achille Lauro hijacking, has said
publicly for several years now that the operation was a mistake.
	   Other PNC members remain defiant, insisting their bloody tactics
were a legitimate means of bringing the Palestinian plight to the
world's attention.
	   Leila Khaled, now a 54-year-old women's activist and mother of
two children, said in a telephone interview from Amman, Jordan,
that she had no regrets about her hijacker past.
	   Oudeh, 61 and a lawyer in the West Bank town of Ramallah, was
never charged in the Munich massacre and does not acknowledge
direct involvement in it. But he says attacks like it ultimately
led to peace negotiations with Israel.
	   ``It was a field of struggle,'' he said. ``Maybe we fought too
much, but we suffered too much too. Now we've come halfway across
the bridge. It's time the Israelis did too.''

Netanyahu won't pull back troops even if pressed by Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Thursday he will not hand over more West Bank land unless the
Palestinians meet a list of demands, and that even U.S. President
Bill Clinton will not be able to change his mind.
	   ``It is Israel which determines issues linked to its future,''
Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he was willing to
engage in a showdown with Clinton over whether the Palestinians
have fulfilled their obligations under the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.
	   Netanyahu has complained that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has violated the agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners,
in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The Israeli leader has accused Arafat of organizing the
widespread stone-throwing protests that have swept the West Bank in
recent days and of inciting against Israel over prisoner releases.
	   The Palestinians have said Netanyahu broke a promise to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activity, but the Israeli
leader said he never made such a commitment. Most of the 250
Palestinian prisoners freed so far have been criminals.
	   With the dispute over the prisoners still unresolved, the next
argument, potentially more damaging to the peace accord, is already
shaping up. On Monday, Clinton is to speak in Gaza City to members
of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and delegates from other Palestinian groups.
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the delegates are to reaffirm a
year-old letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that all
clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction are null and void.
	   Israel has said the PNC must hold a vote by a show of hands, but
the Palestinians say the Wye agreement only requires them to
approve the Arafat letter by acclamation.
	   Asked Thursday by Israel radio whether he would stick to this
position even if Clinton declared the PNC session a success,
Netanyahu said: ``If there is no vote and they (the Palestinians)
do not fulfill the other conditions, Israel will not implement its
part. We are, as you know, a sovereign state.''
	   Unless a last-minute compromise is found, it appears that
Netanyahu and Clinton are headed for a showdown. It is unlikely
Clinton will side with Israel in saying the PNC has not done what
it was asked to do because this would also mean the presidential
visit has failed.
	   Netanyahu said that in addition to a PNC vote, Arafat must
publicly withdraw from plans to unilaterally declare a state in
May, at the end of the five-year autonomy period, and drop his
demands concerning prisoner releases. Only then, Netanyahu said,
would Israel ``seriously consider continuing the peace process.''

Myanmar's Suu Kyi: struggle for democracy and human rights same
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE 10th graf with more NLD members
released

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a videotape smuggled out of
military-controlled Myanmar, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi marked
the 50th anniversary Thursday of the United Nation's human rights
charter by declaring the struggle for those rights and the struggle
for democracy as one and the same.
	   ``Coming as I do from a country which suffers from systematic
violations of human rights by those in power,'' Suu Kyi said she
had come to ``deeply appreciate the wisdom and vision,'' of those
who drafted the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights a half
century ago.
	   Myanmar's military leaders have insisted there is no human
rights problem or violations in their country.
	   But Suu Kyi's portrait of Myanmar has been supported by
Rajsoomer Lallah, a special envoy from U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan who visited Myanmar earlier this year.
	   Lallah reported that the government tortures and jails opponents
without trial, and its soldiers kill, commit gang rapes and round
up people for forced labor, among many other violations of human
rights.
	   Suu Kyi, who is the pivotal figure in Myanmar's democratic
movement, has spent the last nine years under house arrest or with
her movements strictly curtailed by the government.
	   Statements by the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner have become
extremely rare, as the government refuses to let her speak in
public and discourages journalists from attempting to meet her.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   In the past several months, the military has attempted to
dismantle her political party, the National League for Democracy,
by arresting nearly a thousand of its members and refusing to
release them until they sign a statement quitting the party.
	   On Thursday, it announced it had released 81 more NLD members.
	   The government insists the party members were invited to guest
houses for discussions and resigned voluntarily.
	   Suu Kyi has said the resignations were coerced, and the party
leadership does not recognize them.
	   Among those arrested were hundreds of members of the parliament
elected in 1990 but which the military never allowed to convene.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly.
	   Suu Kyi said the U.N. declaration held particular relevance to
the people of her country because it expressly states that
governments should reflect the will of the people through periodic
and genuine elections.
	   ``Eight years ago democratic elections were held in my country,
but the results have not been honored by the military regime, and
the victorious party, the NLD, is subjected to the most grueling
persecution,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   ``So for us, as for many others, the struggle for democracy has
become synonymous with the struggle for human rights,'' she said.

Asian Games doctors want to be closer to competing athletes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Doctors working at the Asian Games have
asked the organizers to allow them to stand by as close as possible
to competitions and ceremonies so they can deal more quickly with
injuries.
	   The request came after reports by some local newspapers that
doctors were nowhere to be found when a Thai gymnast was hurt
Wednesday.
	   ``The accusation is false. The doctors were there immediately as
you can see on television,'' Valerie McKenzie, the games' chief
spokeswoman, said Thursday.
	   Dr. Tanong Sutatam of the games' subcommittee for medical
services pointed to Sunday's opening ceremony, where five of the
Thai beauty queens who carried signboards for the national teams
collapsed in the heat.
	   ``It may have appeared that the doctors were slow to act. But in
fact, we were kept at a distance from the performers,'' said
Tanong.
	   The five fainted after the 40-minute athletes' parade, and three
were taken off the field on stretchers. Two others were helped to
walk to clinics in the stadium.
	   Nurses said later all five were sent home after treatment.

Indian cricket officials quiet on bribery scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-Australia-Reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Admissions by Australian cricket players
that they took money from a bookie seem to have struck a raw nerve
in India, where officials shied away from publicly discussing the
scandal.
	   ``Unless I have seen the full report of the Australian Cricket
Board, how can I comment?,'' Raj Singh Dungarpur, president of the
Board of Control for Cricket in India, said Thursday.
	   ``No comment,'' said Jayant Lele, the BCCI secretary.
	   But the issue is attracting lively interest in India, where
cricket is the national sport and players have been dogged by
accusations of match-fixing.
	   ``Are the stupid Aussies really naive?'' asked The Pioneer
newspaper in a typical headline Thursday. Shane Warne and Mark
Waugh said this week they were ``naive and stupid'' to take money
from a bookie in 1994 in exchange for information about field and
weather conditions that could be used to determine betting odds.
	   The Australian Cricket Board admitted it had covered up the
affair and asked the International Cricket Council to do the same.
Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and said they had never bet on cricket.
	   Betting on cricket is nearly as popular as the sport itself in
India. The bookie at the center of the Australian controversy has
been identified as New Delhi-based.
	   An Indian cricket writer who was forced to resign by his
newspaper after confessing his dealings with bookmakers said it
would be waste of time trying to find the bookmaker, identified
only as Pinky or John.
	   ``There are 3,000 bookmakers in New Delhi. You would not know
where he might be,'' The Pioneer quoted the writer as saying on
condition of anonymity.
	   Last year, former Indian test cricketer Manoj Prabhakar claimed
that a teammate offered him 2.5 million rupees (dlrs 70,000) to
make sure India lost to rivals Pakistan in the Singer Cup one-day
match in Sri Lanka in 1994. The match was washed out by rain.
	   A retired Supreme Court judge probed the accusation but nothing
came of it because Prabhakar refused to name his teammate.
	   Also last year, sportswriter Pradeep Magazine alleged that a man
offered him money during the Indian cricket team's tour to the
Caribbean to help him get players to rig the matches, but he
refused.
	   In neighboring Pakistan, cricketer Salim Malik said Wednesday he
would sue the two Australian cricketers who accused him of match
fixing.
	   ``I have suffered so much because of the false charges by these
Australian cricketers,'' Malik told The Associated Press in Lahore,
Pakistan, where a Pakistani judge is investigating accusations made
by Warne and Waugh against Malik.

Claiming death threats, Marcos asks newspaper to halt stories about
</HEADLINE>
her wealth

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos asked
a Manila newspaper to halt a series of articles about her claims of
amazing wealth, saying she had received numerous death threats, the
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``It's getting too dangerous,'' she told the Philippine Daily
Inquirer. ``My fax machine is throwing up death threats. We had to
change the number.''
	   Mrs. Marcos claimed she has had to add 25 bodyguards and borrow
a bulletproof car from her nephew, the newspaper said.
	   The Inquirer has been running daily stories based on a series of
interviews with the former first lady in which she claimed her
family secretly owns majority stakes in at least 200 companies,
including most of the Philippines' leading corporations, through
``cronies'' who held the shares on paper.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' it quoted
her as saying.
	   The former first lady said she had decided to reveal the
holdings because many of the cronies had betrayed her family's
trust by keeping the assets for themselves when her husband, the
late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was ousted from power in 1986.
	   Mrs. Marcos said she plans to file a 500 billion peso (dlrs 12.8
billion) lawsuit against Marcos' former associates in an attempt to
regain the properties.
	   She also claimed in the interview that her late husband owned
4,000 tons of gold.
	   Marcos has been accused of illegally amassing huge amounts of
wealth during his 20-year rule and of acquiring companies through
business associates who acted on his behalf.
	   But there has been little concrete evidence to prove the
allegations, and many people questioned Mrs. Marcos' wisdom in
making the recent claims.
	   Even members of Mrs. Marcos family were surprised by her
statements.
	   Her eldest daughter, Imelda ``Imee'' Marcos, said her mother's
claims were ``wild and crazy.'' Her children are supporting a
negotiated settlement with the government that would involve a
sharing of the family's wealth.
	   ``I was thinking that I might be digging my own grave if I talk
to the Inquirer,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying. But she said
she had decided to do so because it was ``time to reveal the
betrayal'' by Marcos' associates.
	   The newspaper did not print the sixth part Thursday of the
planned nine-part series.

Six international labor leaders condemn Thai government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The leaders of six international labor
unions condemned Thailand on Thursday for suppressing attempts by
workers at state enterprises to organize.
	   The union leaders said they have already raised the issue with
the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in connection
with the nomination of Thailand's Commerce Minister Supachai
Panichpakdi for head of the World Trade Organization.
	   Supachai is a leading candidate for the post.
	   They called on the Thai government to grant full rights to the
country's 330,000 state enterprise workers and said that, as a
member state of the International Labor Organization, Bangkok had a
binding legal commitment to do so.
	   ``The Thai government has callously played for eight years with
fundamental labor rights, flaunting world opinion as expressed by
the ILO,'' said Balan Nair, chairman of the International Trade
Secretariat, at a press conference in Bangkok.
	   He was joined by Somsak Kosaisook, head of the Thai State
Enterprise Labor Relations Confederation, which does not have legal
bargaining power with the government, and representatives of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; the International
Textile, Garment and Leather Workers Federation; the International
Metal Workers Federation; Public Services International and the
International Union of Food, Drinks, Agricultural and Allied
Workers.
	   State enterprise workers had their right to organize taken away
in a law passed in 1991 by a military government. Although
democracy was restored in 1992, each successive civilian government
has refrained from expunging the law.
	   The government has better bargaining power over the workers if
they can not bargain collectively.
	   The issue has been complicated by government plans to privatize
most state enterprises. That policy has been urged by the
International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout of Thailand's economy.
	   Supachai defended privatization as bringing Thailand's economic
structure up to the standards of more developed countries and
denied the IMF was forcing the government's hand.
	   ``We have reasons to believe the privatization of state
enterprises will inevitably result in hundreds of thousands of
working men and women thrown out of employment,'' the labor leaders
said in a press statement.
	   Hundreds of state enterprise workers protested against
privatization outside parliament when the legislative session
opened last month. They carried banners which read: ``IMF Go To
Hell'' and ``Thailand Is Not For Sale.''

Pakistan Cricket Board angry about Australian deception
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Cricket-Bribes &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's cricket chief on Thursday
slammed the Australian Cricket Board for keeping silent about the
scandal involving cricketers Shane Warne and Mark Waugh.
	   The Australian duo were fined for taking money from an Indian
bookmaker in 1994 to report pitch and weather conditions during a
match in Sri Lanka.
	   The Australian cricketers, who have accused Pakistani cricketer
Salim Malik of match fixing, were secretly fined by the Australian
Cricket Board in 1995.
	   ``More surprising is that the Australian Cricket Board knew it
in 1994 when they fined Warne and Mark Waugh, but they did not
share it with other cricket boards,'' said Khalid Mehmood, chief of
the Pakistan Cricket Board.
	   Pakistan had a particular interest given the allegations made
against Malik by Warne, Waugh and Tim May.
	   Mehmood said it was unfair of the Australian Cricket Board which
should be censured.
	   ``The Pakistan Cricket Board will certainly raise this issue in
the next International Cricket Council meeting,'' Mehmood said. The
meeting is scheduled for January in Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   ``Our cricket board's stance is always that such a matter should
not be swept under the carpet. We believe that the game of cricket
should be played in its true spirit,'' he said.
	   He said the scandal also seriously erodes the credibility of the
Australian pair.
	   Mehmood said Waugh and Australian captain Mark Taylor told a
Pakistani judicial inquiry into match fixing allegations leveled by
the Australians that ''they play fair cricket. Mark did not tell
the judge that he took money from an Indian bookie.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission on Thursday raided
several offices of a nationwide glass industry federation suspected
of fixing prices for repair glass used in automobiles.
	   The federation, comprising about 500 medium-and small glass
companies, is suspected of rigging prices on imported glass in
Japan, or restricting the distribution volume of glass on the
market, Kyodo News reported.
	   An official of the federation's Tokyo office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the raid was under way Thursday
afternoon, but refused to provide details. A Fair Trade Commission
official declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.
	   Bid-rigging, known as ``dango,'' is reputedly rife in Japanese
industry. The United States has accused Japanese companies of using
the practice to block American construction firms from competing in
Japan.
	   Under Japanese law, the maximum fine for bid-rigging is 100
million yen (dlrs 847,000).
	   Earlier this year, FTC, Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog, raided
more than 10 companies nationwide suspected of rigging bids for
contracts to build incinerators.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ About 1,000 Daewoo Electronics Co.
workers rallied Thursday to protest the planned takeover of their
company by the rival Samsung conglomerate.
	   In a deal struck earlier this week, Daewoo Electronics is to be
swapped by its parent conglomerate for the auto-making subsidiary
of the Samsung group, which also owns the nation's largest
electronics company.
	   Workers of both firms fear the deal will lead to mass layoffs.
	   ``This is a bad deal,'' said Rhee Yo-chan, a protest leader.
``If Daewoo Electronics is merged into Samsung Electronics, mainly
our people will be fired. This is unfair.''
	   The protesters, many of them union activists from the home
appliance maker's five plants, occupied the lobby of the Daewoo
headquarters building in central Seoul.
	   They wore headbands and waved pickets demanding that the
government and conglomerates nullify the swap. ``Guarantee our
livelihood!'' one picket said.
	   Also Thursday, 6,000 workers at Samsung Motors Inc. walked off
their jobs, declaring an indefinite work stoppage to protest the
swap.
	   Operations at the company's two plants had already been hampered
by workers' rallies for the past two days. The company produces
120,000 passenger cars and small trucks a year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese government employees have something to
cheer about amid the country's severe recession: Their winter
bonuses, paid out Thursday, rose for the fourth year in a row.
	   The average bonus paid to central government employees was up
1.8 percent to 735,000 yen (dlrs 6,228) per worker from a year
earlier, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   The largest bonus payments of 6.97 million yen (dlrs 59,067)
went to Supreme Court Chief Justice Shigeru Yamaguchi, while Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi received 6.92 million yen (dlrs 58,644), the
second largest amount.
	   Satoshi Neriai, an official of the agency's Personnel Bureau,
said 4.49 million public workers, or 6.6 percent of Japan's total
wage-earners, were eligible for Thursday's bonuses.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of both public and private
sector workers' salaries and a similar summer bonus is paid around
July or early August.
	   Neriai said the bonus payments for the government employees are
decided based on the previous year's actual payments by private
businesses.
	   The bonuses paid this winter by private companies fell 4.0
percent to 498,300 yen (dlrs 4,222) per worker, according to Sanwa
Research Institute, a major Japanese think tank.
	   It was the second consecutive year-on-year decline in winter
bonuses for private company workers after a 0.1 percent drop in
1997, the institute said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics has fired 750 workers in Singapore as part of a global
restructuring drive, a spokesman for the company said Thursday.
	   Before the layoffs, about 8,000 workers were employed in six
Philips manufacturing plants in Singapore, producing color TVs,
radios and cellular phones.
	   ``The reason for restructuring is that some of the production
load has been relocated to China and Mexico, and the market in Asia
has weakened,'' the spokesman said.
	   Last month, Philips, Europe's largest consumer electronics
group, said it wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002.
	   The cuts come amid a rough season for Philips. The company said
in October that third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38
percent to dlrs 241 million.
	   Though Singapore has been least affected by the regional
economic crisis, the unemployment rate has doubled to 4.5 percent
in recent months. The government has launched a host of measures to
reform the economy and save jobs, but it still refuses to extend
any unemployment benefits.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan expects a record budget deficit
next year as an economic slump takes its toll, officials said
Thursday.
	   ``The economic slowdown will cut into corporate revenues and
individual income, thus affecting tax revenues,'' said Tsai
Ching-lien, deputy head of the Finance Ministry's Treasury
Department.
	   Taiwan expects a deficit of 77 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
2.4 billion) in the current fiscal year that ends June 30 _ but the
government projects that in the subsequent 18 months the deficit
will soar to 800 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 24 billion),
according to a report in the United Daily News.
	   Taiwan's next budget will be calculated over an 18-month period
because the government is switching away from its old fiscal year
system and in the future will operate on a calendar year.
	   Tsai said the final estimated budget deficit will be somewhat
smaller because the government plans to cut all unnecessary
spending other than that which will help stimulate an economic
recovery, such as infrastructural expenditures.
	   Tax reductions to take effect next year will also widen the
deficit, he said.
	   The government plans to sell an estimate 200 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.2 billion) worth of state-run company stocks
during the new fiscal year to boost its income, the newspaper said.
	   Taiwan's economic growth is projected for 5 percent this year,
down from last year's 6.8 percent.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
and the central bank have approved the planned launch of up to dlrs
2 billion worth of U.S. dollar, euro and yen bonds, a finance
official said Thursday.
	   The bond offering, being launched by the Department of Finance,
requires the approval of both the president and the central bank's
policy-making council, the Monetary Board.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu has said the bond offerings
consist of dlrs 500 million in U.S. dollar-denominated global
bonds, dlrs 500 million worth of euro-denominated bonds and between
dlrs 500 million and dlrs 1 billion of yen-denominated bonds.
	   The proceeds of the bond offerings will be used to stimulate
economic growth by increasing spending for critical projects such
as infrastructure and agricultural programs.
	   The government wants the bonds to have a maturity of between
seven and 10 years.
	   The Finance Department has decided to launch the bonds in the
first quarter of 1999, when the appetite among investors in the
international debt market is expected to improve.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ People around the world celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations human rights charter on Thursday
called for more efforts to end still rampant abuses.
	   ``We've left a question mark after the word `happy' in `happy
anniversary,' '' said Hideki Morihara of Amnesty International in
Japan. ``Even now, there is no end to the violation of human rights
in the world.''
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights. The U.N. General Assembly has scheduled
a special session to mark the anniversary.
	   But throughout Asia and other regions, there were reminders of
the many who continue to be denied basic freedoms and rights.
	   In Myanmar, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi attended a
U.N.-sponsored ceremony with other officials of her opposition
National League for Democracy. No government officials took part.
	   ``Nobody can deny there are no human rights in Burma,'' said Suu
Kyi, who has endured nine years of either house arrest or strict
restrictions on her activities. ``And the people of Burma will
never enjoy peace and security unless there is a government that
can guarantee human rights.''
	   In the past several months, the military rulers have arrested
nearly a thousand of her party members.
	   The junta has never honored a 1990 election, in which the NLD
won 392 of the legislature's 485 seats, and has never allowed the
freely elected Parliament to meet.
	   Even as Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect human
rights in a letter marking the anniversary, police ransacked the
homes of several dissidents in a widening crackdown.
	   Police detained some dissidents for questioning and seized
photos and pamphlets, including copies of the declaration that the
dissidents had planned to hand out at schools and factories, New
York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   ``The Chinese government should recognize that oppression is not
the way,'' the group said in a statement.
	   Although China took part in drafting a U.N. statement on the
anniversary, in practice it still represses those who fight for
human rights, the group said.
	   ``The Chinese people, together with the international community,
will make their own contribution to a just, equitable, peaceful and
prosperous world,'' Jiang was quoted as saying by the official
Xinhua News Agency.
	   While attending an anniversary celebration in Paris, the Dalai
Lama said conditions for his fellow Tibetans were worsening under
Chinese rule.
	   ``The situation is very difficult, very grave,'' the Tibetan
spiritual leader said. ``We have to hope to improve our
situation.''
	   In India, scores of Tibetan exiles burned the Chinese flag in
protest of Beijing's rule of their homeland.
	   ``Tibet has been suffering under suppression without any freedom
of expression and thought,'' the Tibetan Youth Congress said in a
statement.
	   Elsewhere in India, people once known as ``untouchable''
announced that they were kicking off a yearlong campaign to ``cast
out caste.''
	   Discrimination based on caste is illegal in India, but it is
entrenched by tradition and continues to be widespread.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch started a worldwide campaign
in response to the Dec. 1 arrest of Hafez Abu Saada, head of the
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, which recently reported
widespread torture by police of Coptic Christians in a southern
village.
	   Abu Saada has been accused of accepting illegal foreign
donations and publishing false reports that damaged Egypt's image.
Conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years at
hard labor.
	   The accusations ``represent a direct threat to the entire human
rights community in Egypt,'' Human Rights Watch said in a
statement.
	   The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor started an on-line Chinese
language database of human rights treaties. In the business
district, about 200 people celebrated with dances and music in a
public garden.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, a conservative shipping
tycoon handpicked by Beijing, said the territory remained a
``robust and lively community where people have no hesitation in
speaking their minds.''
	   Many people were concerned about curbs on freedom after the
former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997. So far,
China has adopted a hands-off policy in most matters.
	   In Belarus in Russia, activists organized pickets to spread the
word about the declaration, Itar-Tass agency reported.
	   Polls by the Committee to Protect Journalists have put Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko among the world's 10 leaders with
the worst records for suppressing independent media. Rights groups
say 500 people have been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities
this year in Belarus.
	   Echoing widespread sentiments, Cambodian opposition leader Sam
Rainsy cast doubt on whether some of those celebrating the
anniversary were genuinely committed to the declaration.
	   ``It is deeply ironic to see international representatives
honoring the Universal Declaration at a time when their disregard
for its principles is so apparent,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Human Rights Watch in Asia has painted a gloomy picture of the
rights situation in Cambodia.
	   Officials linked to murders and mysterious disappearances still
held office, and Khmer Rouge leaders accused in the deaths of
millions of people in the 1970s were still at large, it said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard acknowledged his nation
had a long way to go. The 400,000 Aborigines, among Australia's 18
million people, have always been the poorest.
	   ``I don't pretend for a moment our human rights record has been
without blemish,'' he told Parliament. ``If you don't respect the
human rights of your own people, then you can hardly put yourself
in a position to lecture the rest of the world.''

Taiwanese sports club owner wins gold in pool

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwanese sports club owner Chao
Fong-pang won gold Thursday in the new Asia Games event of
eight-ball pool, defeating Tan Boon of Singapore 13-5 in the final.
	   Tan was no match for Chao, 31, a father of three children, who
played consistently and never looked worried.
	   ``I knew if I held my nerve, I was going to win and this is what
happened,'' said Chao, wearing a red vest in keeping with the
sport's formal look for competition.
	   Earlier, Kunihiko Takahashi of Japan took the bronze, defeating
Romeo Villaneuva of the Philippines 9-3.
	   Pool is in the billiards and snooker category, making its Asian
Games debut here.

Albright: U.S. assessing latest move to extradite Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Thursday said Washington is evaluating Britain's latest decision to
go ahead with extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``We have said that we want justice, that we have these values,
that we are concerned about justice being done,'' Albright told
reporters a day after London decided Spain could try to extradite
Pinochet from Britain.
	   But she said: ``I think we have to again assess what the
decision has meant.''
	   Albright reiterated that ``we respect the Chileans, the
significant changes that have been made in the Chilean system.
We've talked about reconciliation. We have to assess how the
situation is now.
	   ``I don't want to specifically comment on the judicial aspect of
this case,'' she said.
	   Still, Albright again pledged U.S. cooperation, saying
Washington ``would be releasing documents as rapidly as we can,
consistent with the guidelines that the administration has given us
on national security.''
	   Chile denounced Britain's decision Wednesday as a violation of
its sovereignty, immediately withdrew its ambassador from Britain.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested in his hospital bed Oct. 16 while
recuperating from back surgery in London, must now appear Friday
before a London magistrate.
	   The general's lawyers, meanwhile, were preparing to seek an
immediate judicial review of Straw's decision. This begins a legal
battle that will likely stretch for months, as both sides can
appeal at every step of the process.

Mozambique introduces human rights as school subject
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The government said Thursday it plans
to introduce human rights as a subject in schools, starting with
primary school students in early 2000.
	   The announcement coincided with the worlwide commemoration of
the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The human rights record of this southeastern African country has
not been widely criticized. But activists last week said many
prisoners at the Machava Maputo jail have not been brought to trial
for up to six years. The prison, with a capacity for 800 inmates,
has more than 2,000.
	   The conditions are not unusual for Mozambican prisons, and the
attoney general's office has ordered an inquiry.

	   PRACHUAB KHIRI KHAN, Thailand (AP) _ More than 2,000 protesters
returned on Thursday to the scene of a bloody highway battle with
police the previous night over government plans to build three
power plants in southern Thailand.
	   The protesters set up road blocks on the Phet Kasem Highway, the
main artery connecting Bangkok with the south, blocking traffic for
several kilometers (miles) since early morning.
	   Some of the protesters told reporters that no one had been
killed in the violent confrontation between 5,000 anti-pollution
demonstrators and 3,000 police on Wednesday night, although they
confirmed that dozens had been injured.
	   However, Jor Sor Roi Radio and Daily News, a Thai-language
newspaper, reported that three people were killed, and the Bangkok
Post said 50 protesters and 15 police were injured and taken to
local hospitals.
	   The information could not be confirmed because road access to
Prachuab Khiri Khan, where police are headquartered, was cut off by
the picketers. No one responded to telephone calls to the city's
main station house.
	   Wednesday's battle was just one of several that have broken out
in recent years between police and members of communities opposed
to dams, power plants or other development projects in their areas.
	   More than 15,000 farmers and villagers descended on Bangkok last
year to protest that many development projects were destroying
their land and way of life while only enriching the country's elite
and wealthy businessmen.
	   The three power plants that ignited the current protest are
planned for Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (145 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, a port and industrial center.
	   They all use lignite, or brown coal, as their power source. The
demonstrators say that lignite is a major pollutant of the air and
water and have cited as evidence the environmental havoc wreaked by
a lignite power plant in the northern Thai town of Mae Moh.
	   Mae Moh villagers attribute abnormally high rates of cancer,
lung diseases, birth defects and the poisoning of their soil and
water to residue from the lignite power plant.
	   The demonstrators in Prachuab Khiri Khan originally gathered in
front of the provincial hall on Tuesday where they burned an effigy
of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   On Wednesday, having received no response from provincial
authorities, they decided to block the highway, stalling traffic
for six hours. Police were mobilized from several provinces to
force them off the road, the Post reported.
	   The demonstrators sent a delegation of four Buddhist monks to
ask the police to let the protest continue and not use force, but
their entreaties failed, the Post reported.
	   Police said trouble broke out at 7 p.m. (1200 GMT) when
demonstrators began destroying several cars belonging to stranded
motorists.
	   Officers then mounted a baton charge and drove trucks into the
crowd as a battering rams, the paper said. Demonstrators fought
back by throwing stones.
	   The protesters said they had been complaining to various
governments since 1996 that the community was strongly opposed to
lignite power plants in their area, but they have consistently been
ignored.

Economic slump to widen Taiwan's budget deficit

down from last year's 6.8 percent.
	   According to the Finance Ministry, tax revenues fell 10.2
percent in November to 15 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 460
million).
	   Stock-transaction tax revenues fell 2.5 percent to 7.8 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 240 billion).

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwanese sports club owner Chao
Fong-pang won gold Thursday in the new Asia Games event of
eight-ball pool, defeating Tan Boon of Singapore 13-6 in the final.
	   Tan was no match for Chao, 31, a father of three children, who
played consistently and never looked worried.
	   ``I knew if I held my nerve, I was going to win and this is what
happened,'' said Chao, wearing a red vest in keeping with the
sport's formal look for competition.
	   Earlier, Kunihiko Takahashi of Japan took the bronze, defeating
Romeo Villaneuva of the Philippines 9-3.
	   Pool is in the billiards and snooker category, making its Asian
Games debut here.

Taxis hold nationwide strike

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Crowds clogged bus stops and train
stations Thursday as taxi drivers around the country staged a
24-hour strike.
	   Greece's taxi owners' union said a small number of taxis were
allowed to operate to aid people with health problems or facing
other emergencies.
	   Taxi owners and drivers are protesting tax increases and the
granting of new taxi licenses, which they fear will make their
profession too competitive. They are also demanding an increase in
the minimum fare from 300 drachmas (dlrs 1.07) to 500 drachmas
(dlrs 1.78).
	   Greek taxi fares are among the lowest in the European Union.

Most Australians welcome Pinochet extradition ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A British ruling that an extradition
case against Augusto Pinochet could proceed was hailed Thursday by
the former Chilean dictator's opponents in Australia as a wonderful
way to mark International Human Rights Day.
	   An Australian lawyer for the human rights groups fighting for
Pinochet's extradition, Geoffrey Robertson, said the decision gave
meaning to international human rights law for the first time.
	   Australia-Chile Friendship Society president Victor Marillanca
hailed the
	   decision as particularly good news for those who, like him, had
been tortured during the Pinochet regime.
	   ``We are very pleased, very happy,'' Marillanca said.
	   ``It is wonderful that today, the day marking the 50th
anniversary of the
	   International Declaration of Human Rights, that something is
being done -- he is being made to face the court, to face the
music.''
	   Marillanca said Pinochet's fate was of personal concern to those
tortured under his regime.
	   ``In my case I would like to see them lock him up and squeeze
his private parts with pliers, like they did to me,'' he said.
	   Robertson said the decision was the beginning of the enforcement
of international justice.
	   ``For the first time since Nuremberg, a dictator has been unable
to plead
	   state sovereignty for protection of the acts of state which has
been the tyrants' defence down the ages,'' he told reporters in
Melbourne.
	   Robertson said Pinochet was one of most wicked men in the world
and ``one of the great torturers of the 20th century.''
	   ``International human rights law is given today some meaning,''
he said.
	   Prime Minister John Howard expressed surprise at the decision
and said it would surprise many people to find the general did not
enjoy automatic sovereign immunity.
	   ``It's a decision that will be debated and it's a decision that
is not without import so far as the future activities and the
future movement and the future behaviour of leaders,'' Howard told
Parliament.
	   ``The fact is it represents a very significant development and
it is a very significant reminder to all of us of the universality
of human rights.''

Israeli warplanes repeatedly break sound barrier over Beirut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over Beirut for the second day Thursday in what the media termed a
``sonic bombardment'' of the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut _ still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _
was on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   Six supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings and set off the alarms of vehicles Thursday
morning.
	   The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people who were frightened by
similar deafening bangs a day earlier.
	   The Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday,
including the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking
cover for fear the city was under attack.
	   Many here still remember Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when
the city came under heavy air and naval attack.
	   The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least
175 people.
	   During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two
power stations in hills overlooking the capital.
	   Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon
on Thursday.
	   Asked Wednesday about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman
said: ``We do not divulge movements of the air force.'' The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under Israeli rules, would not
comment further.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper described the Israeli action in a
front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.''
	   Israeli jets frequently make high-altitude flights over Lebanon
for reconnaissance purposes.
	   The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fighting to
drive Israeli troops and their allied militiamen from southern
Lebanon, where the Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security
zone'' in 1985 to protect its northern settlements from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for most of the attacks on Israeli soldiers last
month.

Afghan women protest ''savage assault'' on their rights by Taliban

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Accusing successive Afghan leaders of
''savagely assaulting the rights'' of women, dozens of Afghan women
protested outside United Nations offices in the Pakistani capital
Thursday to mark the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   The women attacked the rigid Islamic law imposed by
Afghanistan's current rulers, the Taliban religious army, which
controls roughly 90 percent of the country.
	   The protest was organized by the Revolutionary Association of
the Women of Afghanistan, which is headquartered in Pakistan
because its members fear attacks by the hardline religious militia
if they return to their homeland.
	   ''The people of Afghanistan and in particular the agonized women
of Afghanistan are being brutalized in the most tragically inhuman
conditions,'' said a statement the women's association handed over
to the United Nations.
	   The women's association also appealed to the international
community to issue ``an unequivocal condemnation of the Taliban,
who deride the civilized concept of human rights.''
	   In Afghanistan, women have borne the brunt of the Taliban's many
edicts to implement their strict version of Islamic law.
	   Women have been forced off the job, and ordered to wear the
all-enveloping burqua that covers them from head to toe. Girls are
not allowed to attend school after the age of eight. Women must be
accompanied outside the home by a close male relative.
	   The women's association also attacked the Taliban's opposition,
led by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The opposition
controls barely 10 percent of the country, but still holds the
Afghan seat at the United Nations.
	   Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed Shah Massood ruled
Afghanistan from 1992 when the communists were thrown out of power
until 1996 when the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital of Kabul
and took control.
	   During Rabbani's rule relentless fighting between rival Islamic
factions destroyed vast sections of the capital and left 50,000
people dead, most of them civilians caught in the crossfire.
	   Referring to Rabbani and his allies as ``Jehadi'' (or holy
warriors), the Afghan Women's Association said ''treating the likes
of Rabbani, Massood ... or any other as the lesser evil as compared
with the Taliban is a cruel insult to our devastated people who
have suffered enough under the whips and knives of Islamic
fundamentalists of all hues and colors.''
	   The association also criticized Afghanistan's neighbors,
accusing them of supplying money and weapons to opposing factions
in the bitter and protracted conflict, a charge that also has been
leveled by the United Nations.
	   Pakistan has been accused of aiding the Taliban, and Iran and
Russia of supplying assistance to the opposition soldiers.

Four Bosnian Serbs plead innocent to murder, torture, rape

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Four Bosnian Serbs pleaded
innocent Thursday to broadened U.N. charges that they murdered,
tortured and raped scores of Muslim prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal of atrocities at
the Omarska camp in northwest Bosnia.
	   The defendants were taken into custody earlier this year and
pleaded innocent. On Thursday, they entered pleas to a new
indictment joining their cases and altering some charges.
	   The new joint indictment charges them with a total of 36 war
crimes and crimes against humanity. Each charge carries a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment.
	   No date was set for their trial.
	   Kvocka, Kos and Radic, who allegedly held positions of power at
Omarska camp, are accused with command responsibility for and
personal involvement in the murder and torture of Muslim inmates.
Radic also is accused of personally raping a prisoner.
	   Zigic allegedly visited Omarska and the nearby Keraterm camp to
kill and torture prisoners but held no official post.
	   Omarska and Keraterm were two of the most notorious camps set up
during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   Television pictures of emaciated inmates crowded behind
barbed-wire fences shocked the world and helped prompt the
international community to set up the U.N. tribunal in 1993.
	   ``Severe beatings, torture, killings, sexual assault and other
forms of physical and psychological abuse were commonplace at
Omarska and Keraterm,'' according to the indictment. Prosecutors
believe hundreds of prisoners were murdered there.
	   Kvocka was briefly commandant of Omarska, while Kos and Radic
were shift commanders, their indictment says.
	   Kvocka and Radic were arrested by NATO troops in Bosnia in
April. Kos was arrested in May, and Zigic turned himself in to
authorities in April.
	   While the charges in the new indictment are slightly different,
the horrific allegations remain the same: All four suspects are
accused of participating in ``the murder, torture, sexual assault,
beating, humiliation, psychological abuse and/or confinement in
inhumane conditions'' of non-Serbs in camps in and around the town
of Prijedor.

Australians stunned, outraged, disillusioned with cricket scandal

scandal. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The prime minister suddenly appeared on
nationwide television, standing somberly in front of an Australian
flag, to say ``something that's going to deeply disturb
Australians.''
	   Though John Howard's demeanor was solemn enough for an
announcement of the death of the Queen, he spoke of something far
deeper and more dear to Aussies than Her Majesty -- the scandal
engulfing Australian cricket.
	   Newspapers, broadcasters and Australians in the street were
incandescent with rage Thursday that top cricketers Shane Warne and
Mark Waugh took money from an Indian bookie in 1994 for weather and
playing field tips.
	   The aspect that enraged most people even more though, was that
the Australian Cricket Board kept the matter secret until this week
-- a case of Cricket-gate.
	   ``The Australian Cricket Board is guilty of hypocrisy in its
attitude to cricket's gambling problem. The board has pressed for
an inquiry into allegations of match-fixing in Pakistan while
engaging in a concerted cover-up of its own betting scandal,'' The
Australian national newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``Australia Mourns as the Game Falls from its Pedestal,'' cried
the Sydney Morning Herald's headline Thursday.
	   Cricket is deeply ingrained in Australia's consciousness, with
the nation
	   measuring itself against Britain, the mother country, on the
cricket green.
	   The Ashes tour, the big confrontation between Britain and
Australia, is now on, and the third match in the series begins
Friday in Adelaide.
	   The Australian team has bested Britain for years, but this
scandal turned
	   two of the top Aussie players from ``heroes into zeros
overnight'' in the
	   eyes of most people, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Cricket's greatest living legend, Sir Donald Bradman, was
disappointed by the scandal, national captain Mark Taylor said
Thursday.
	   ``I think he's a little disappointed,'' Taylor said of Bradman's
reaction after they met Wednesday.
	   The prime minister, an avid cricket fan was stunned by the
disclosures.
	   ``I would imagine that, given the great passion that Australians
have for
	   cricket, there's an intense feeling of disappointment about the
whole issue,'' Howard said.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb
	   Australians,'' he said, with considerable understatement.
	   The Australian's headline read: ``The Bookie Scandal -- 11,000
Dollars: Price of Disgrace,'' referring to the Australian dollar
payments the bookie gave Warne and Waugh during the 1994 tour of
Sri Lanka.
	   Both players admitted they were ``naive and stupid'' at a news
conference
	   Wednesday, then denied they had ever taken a bribe or thrown a
match and walked out without answering questions from reporters.
	   ``Ashamed -- And So You Bloody Well Should Be!'' read the
headline in the
	   tabloid Daily Telegraph of Sydney on Thursday. Its editorial was
headlined, ``Wounding the soul of a nation.''
	   In the nation's Parliament, opposition senators said they could
consider staging an inquiry next year if they were dissatisfied
with the Australian Cricket Board's handling of the Mark
Waugh/Shane Warne saga.
	   ``If there's still an inadequate response, it may be appropriate
for the Parliament to have a look at it,'' Australian Democrats
sports spokesman Andrew Bartlett said.
	   ``Unfortunately, one skeleton's been found, what else is
there?'' he asked.
	   ``I believe this may be cricket's biggest crisis since 1817,''
wrote Matthew Engel, editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack,
considered the ``Bible'' of cricket, in an essay in the Herald.
	   ``This calls into question the whole morality of the game, the
concept of
	   what is and is not cricket,'' Engel wrote.
	   ``So what happened in 1817? The same thing. Cricket rose to
prominence in
	   England in the 18th century as a gambling game. Eventually, the
betting overwhelmed the sport. Corruption took over,'' he said.
Bookies were banned -- until 1973.
	   Two weeks before Christmas, most Australians seem to feel they
same way they did after they learned, at some age, that Santa Claus
was a hoax -- disillusioned, enraged, ashamed at their own
gullibility.
	   They will go on to celebrate Christmas, and they will keep on
attending cricket matches, but only with a sense of innocence lost.

Austrian chancellor sees no agreement on budget at EU summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima expects
the upcoming European summit to produce no final agreement on
reform of the European Union budget.
	   In an interview published Thursday in the Vienna newspaper Der
Standard, Klima said much work has been done on the ``Agenda 2000''
issue but added that ``the time isn't right'' for a final deal when
EU leaders meet here Friday and Saturday.
	   ``In Vienna we want to ask the heads of government to discuss
the matter urgently because we need the reform and it should be
agreed in March,'' he was quoted as saying. Austria is the current
EU president.
	   Agenda 2000 is a package of reforms of the EU budget to cover
costs of enlarging the union in the coming years. Net gainers in
the EU, including Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, fear their
funding may be cut while net payers, including Germany and the
Netherlands, want to reduce their contributions.

Protesters gather in Indonesian capital on human rights anniversary

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of student protesters choked
the streets of Indonesia's capital Thursday, demanding greater
democracy and human rights as well as the prosecution of
ex-President Suharto for corruption.
	   It was one of the biggest days of protest in Jakarta since
demonstrations and deadly riots forced Suharto to quit last May
after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Thursday's massive, but mainly peaceful turnout coincided with
the 50th anniversary of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   Several minor clashes were reported with security forces, who
closed down many streets in the city of 11 million, causing traffic
chaos.
	   More than 2,500 chanting and flag-waving students forced their
way through a police line near several luxury hotels and moved
along Jakarta's main boulevard.
	   They supported an array of causes. One banner read: ``Release
political prisoners.'' Another said: ``Stop money politics and
violence.''
	   Office workers applauded as the group marched to the local
United Nations building. A police helicopter swooped overhead.
	   Some protesters lied down in front of cars carrying police who
had challenged their group.
	   Several protesters beat up a man they accused of being a police
agent.
	   About 3,000 students gathered outside Jakarta police
headquarters. About 1,000 others marched on the Parliament.
Hundreds more protested outside of government buildings or blocked
toll roads.
	   Witnesses said brief fights broke out between police and
students at one protest near Indonesia's foreign ministry.
	   However, at most spots security personnel were careful not to
engage in clashes with the protesters. Other demonstrations in
recent weeks have ended in deaths and injuries.
	   Security forces guarded the presidential palace as well as the
home of Suharto and the Parliament. Tanks and armored vehicles were
in place at several strategic locations.
	   Earlier President B.J. Habibie warned that stern measures would
be taken to stamp out violent protests to protect the rights of
most Indonesians.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas predicted that student
demonstrations would continue as Indonesia moves toward greater
democracy and tries to fix its shattered economy.
	   ``Everybody has a right to express his views. So demonstrations
will continue, I think, as a feature of our newly emerging
democracy,'' he said.
	   Alatas also warned that troops and police would prevent protests
from degenerating into riots.
	   ``Demonstrations are one thing. Riots are another thing,'' the
minister said at a news conference.
	   ``We cannot condone the burning, the sacking, the pillaging and
especially the violence that accompanies riots.''
	   He said some unidentified groups have tried to manipulate
otherwise peaceful student protests to create unrest for their own
political purposes.
	   ``We will use acknowledged and recognized anti-riot gear ... but
not lethal weapons'' to quell unrest, he said.
	   On Nov. 13 security personnel opened fire on hundreds of student
protesters who tried to march on the Parliament. Nine protesters
were killed.
	   Outbreaks of riots and lawlessness have increased in recent
months as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years delivers
soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty.
Students are also dissatisfied with a program by Habibie for
political change.
	   Religious tensions between the Muslim majority and the Christian
minority have resulted in deaths and attacks on dozens of mosques
and churches.
	   Most of the student groups on Thursday called for democratic
reform.
	   Activists also demanded an immediate trial of Suharto, who was
questioned by state prosecutors Wednesday about allegations that he
corruptly amassed a fortune during his three decades in power.
	   Hours after the ex-authoritarian leader was quizzed, thousands
of students demonstrated, and some threw rocks and clashed with
riot police not far from the home of Habibie, Suharto's successor
and one-time protege.
	   Habibie has pledged to hold general elections next year and has
implemented some political reforms, but he lacks credibility among
activists who say he is a stooge of the old regime. They reject his
investigation of Suharto as cosmetic.
	   Habibie has released dozens of political prisoners since taking
office in May from Suharto, who was dislodged by riots and
protests. But some pro-democracy activists remain in jail.
	   Thursday's protesters included members of a women's rights
group, supporters of opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and
students from the disputed territory of East Timor.

Le Pen says Megret `coup' has failed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Le Pen and Megret quotes, background,
Le Pen comments on his daughter's betrayal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A day after ousting his longtime lieutenant in a
bitter leadership struggle, National Front boss Jean-Marie Le Pen
accused Bruno Megret Thursday of plotting a ``commando operation''
to replace him.
	   ``The putsch he has attempted has obviously failed,'' Le Pen
said on France Inter radio.
	   ``From the outside, he prepared a commando operation to try to
replace me and take the controls,'' Le Pen said.
	   For his part, Megret demanded that his boss retract comments
implying Megret was racist and extremist.
	   ``It's an accusation that's extremely grave, because it's the
same accusation our adversaries make against us,'' Megret told RTL
radio.
	   ``I think it's important that Jean-Marie Le Pen retract himself
on that question,'' Megret said.
	   Over the weekend, Le Pen had described Megret as being backed by
a group of ``racists and extremists'' _ terms widely used in the
outside world to describe the National Front itself.
	   Megret lost his job as general delegate Wednesday exactly two
hours after he appeared before a packed news conference to demand
an urgent congress of all members nationwide.
	   Though he wouldn't say it, the aim of such a congress would
implicitly be to reconsider leadership of the National Front.
	   Le Pen said the call for the party congress was ``a crime
against the National Front as well as a crime against France.''
	   But Megret called his firing ``without significance,'' and
renewed his call for the party congress on Thursday.
	   ``If we don't have that congress, what do we do? Do we continue
to cut off heads? And when we've cut off 80 percent of the heads of
the party, what's left? That's not the solution.''
	   The rapid-fire events heralded a drawn-out showdown between the
two men, certain to please opponents of a party that consistently
draws 15 percent of French voters.
	   Le Pen, 70, leader of the National Front for a quarter-century,
took the opportunity of a TV interview Wednesday night to criticize
not only Megret but also his eldest daughter, Marie-Caroline, whose
companion is one of Megret's top aides, Philippe Olivier.
	   ``My daughter is linked to a chief of sedition,'' Le Pen said.
``I am used to family betrayals.''

Palestinians convene to scrap calls for Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, threatened
to crush Palestinian riots with an ``iron fist'' and said he would
not go ahead with a West Bank troop pullback, as promised under the
Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat met a list of demands.
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting
more unrest rather than calming the already tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas. On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung
along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem.
	   The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his
address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City.
	   Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this
session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.
	   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the
Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less
than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success
without it. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with
its future,'' Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he
would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five
percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his
decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally
declare a state in May.
	   The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse
after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a
very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the
accord. On Thursday, 98 members of the 124-member Palestinian
Central Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote
on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
	   The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session,
and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63
members is required, and a vote was expected by Thursday evening.
	   The council has not met for years and was revived specifically
for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members of the
Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,
among others.

Opposition walks out in defense of right to strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers walked out of
Thursday's parliament session to protest what they said were
attempts to derail a planned nationwide general strike against the
government's economic policies.
	   The walkout came as a high court in the eastern state of Bihar
ruled that the one-day strike called by unions and leftist parties
for Friday violated the rights of Bihar citizens. It was not
immediately clear whether the strike's organizers would defy the
court ruling.
	   Lawmakers said officials in other states had declared that the
strike violated laws meant to protect the functioning of the Indian
economy.
	   Members of the Congress party, the main opposition group, joined
the walkout even though their leaders have said they support a bill
opening up the Indian insurance sector that has been the main
target of the strike's organizers.
	   With Congress' support, the bill allowing up to 40 percent
foreign investment in Indian insurance companies was expected to
pass. Debate on the bill was scheduled to start Friday.
	   Thursday's parliamentary walkout reflects long-standing
differences over opening up the Indian economy, a process Congress
began in the early 1990s. Leftists argue working people will be
hurt because foreigners will destroy indigenous businesses, while
reformers say the Indian economy will be strengthened by new ideas
and entrepreneurs.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   The office is inside a two-story stucco building behind black
gates. There are no signs outside indicating it is an office of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but there is an emblem of
the party over the door.

Boston residents nabbed in FBI drug-money sting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Three Boston-area residents were arrested in a New
York-based FBI sting aimed at Russian organized crime groups,
according to published reports.
	   One of the people arrested was a BankBoston employee, The Boston
Globe and the Boston Herald reported today.
	   The papers said the FBI investigation was part of an attack on a
multimillion dollar drug money scheme with ties to Russian
organized crime groups.
	   The nine people charged, all from Russia or other former Soviet
republics, allegedly laundered $2.7 million in drug money _ mostly
$5, $10 and $20 bills _ for undercover agents posing as Colombian
smugglers, according to an indictments that were unsealed
Wednesday.
	   Court papers allege the money was laundered through banks in
Boston, New York, Antigua and Switzerland then drawn out again in
check form.
	   A 24-year-old customer service representative at a BankBoston
branch in West Newton _ Oksana Galchanskaya _ was charged with
``processing transactions through various accounts while avoiding
certain bank and federal regulations,'' the papers reported.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Huggard said Galchanskaya
authorized and issued numerous checks, apparently without
permission from the ``account holder,'' from two of 64 different
accounts allegedly used in the scheme.
	   The indictment alleges the accounts were ``frequently
replenished with large wire transfers from accounts in New York and
Switzerland.''
	   Galchanskaya is scheduled to appear for another hearing today.
	   Also arrested were Roman Luban, 44, and Samuil Lyubomirsky, 41,
both of Newton, who allegedly received the checks from the two
Boston accounts and transferred them to bank accounts belonging to
the drug smugglers, who were actually undercover agents.

Iran, Kazakstan win in second round

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Powered by two goals from star striker
Ali Daei, Iran roared back Thursday as a favorite for Asian Games
soccer gold, destroying Tajikistan 5-0 and setting up a showdown
against Group 1 rival China for a quarterfinal berth.
	   World Cup veteran Daei, Karim Bagheri and Mohammad Khakpour
scored in the first 15 minutes against a Tajikistan team that was
never in the game.
	   Sayd Mousavi and Daei reopened the shooting gallery in the
second half.
	   The convincing Iranian victory over the lowliest side in their
second round group helped ease the stain of Tuesday's upset to Gulf
rival Oman, 4-2, that was was fueled by an own goal.
	   In a Group 4 match, Kazakstan downed Qatar 2-0. Kazakstan has a
win and a draw while Qatar has a win and a loss.
	   In its group, Iran now has a victory and a loss, with Tajikistan
eliminated from contention for a quarterfinal berth with two
losses.
	   Unbeaten China, which brought a young side as a training
exercise for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, faced the Omanis in the
group later Thursday.
	   Victorious over Tajikistan in their opener, the Chinese later
will play a revitalized Iran in a match likely to determine which
two teams advance into the quarterfinals.
	   Mansour Pourheidari, the Iranian coach, looked forward to that
match.
	   ``We want to win, both me and the players. On Saturday, we want
three points against China,'' Pourheidari said.
	   Iran quickly put the game against the Tajiks out of reach.
	   Bayern Munich star Daei opened the scoring in the third minute
as Iran's powerful offense quickly crumbled the Tajikistan left
side.
	   Connecting with a long cross from near the corner, Daei headed
high and at short range between the keeper and the far post for his
third goal of the Games.
	   Bagheri added insurance in almost identical circumstances eight
minutes later. Khakpour, formerly a professional hero in Singapore,
put the match away with a low 40-meter shot that Tajikistan goalie
Akumed Enguzarov braced for but never touched.
	   Daei had an apparent second goal from a point-blank chip that
was disallowed for being offside.
	   In the second half, Daei and company had numerous chances to
widen the score beyond Mosavi's fourth-minute goal, but most were
sloppily taken and went wide or over the crossbar.
	   With the play all in Tajikistan's end, Daei finally pushed
through a shot 20 minutes into the half from the top of the goal
area, making it 5-0.

Pre-Ramadan death toll rises to 120; 20 women kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The death toll from three massacres
earlier this week rose to 81, hospital officials said Thursday,
boosting to 120 the number of people killed in violence blamed on
Muslim militants this month.
	   Residents recounted how the attackers slashed and mutilated
infants and killed or kidnapped women in a new wave of bloodshed
from a nearly 7-year-old insurgency.
	   Armed groups descended on three villages in the mountains
southwest of Algiers overnight Tuesday, torturing and mutilating,
then killing 81 people, the hospital officials said on condition of
anonymity.
	   More than 20 women were kidnapped during the pre-dawn
coordinated attacks near Chlef, 170 kms (100 miles) southwest of
Algiers, the officials said. Militants have kidnapped and raped
women in the past before killing them.
	   Members of the Boumaza family, who declined to give their first
names, said attackers slashed the throats of children, cutting the
arms and legs off one of them and throwing the body in a boiling
pot.
	   A government statement on Wednesday had put the death toll at 45
from a single attack in the area overnight Tuesday.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts Dec. 20 this
year, has seen an intensification of the insurgency. The trend
appeared to confirm itself this year, with the approach of Ramadan.
	   Meanwhile, authorities retrieved the remains of 16 people from a
well outside Algiers where militants dumped their victims, raising
the total found to 62, a civil defense official said on customary
anonymity.
	   Officials expected to find more remains in the 70-meter-deep
(230-foot-deep) well, with work crews having reached a depth of 47
meters (150 feet).
	   The well at the Hafiz farm is in the southern Algiers suburb of
Mefta, in an area now referred to as the ``Triangle of Death'' for
the widespread attacks there during the insurgency.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in seven years of violence in
this North African nation after the military-backed government
canceled January 1992 the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to
win.

Philips lays off 750 workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS graf 3 that company was fifth largest employer in
Singapore; RECASTS throughout

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Dutch giant Royal Philips Electronics has fired
750 workers in Singapore as part of a global restructuring drive, a
spokesman for the company said Thursday.
	   Before the layoffs, about 8,000 workers were employed in six
Philips manufacturing plants in Singapore, producing color TVs,
radios and cellular phones.
	   The company was the fifth-largest employer in the tiny
city-state, which relies heavily on foreign investment and
electronics manufacturing.
	   ``The reason for restructuring is that some of the production
load has been relocated to China and Mexico, and the market in Asia
has weakened,'' the spokesman said.
	   Last month, Philips said it planned to cut the number of global
production sites to between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by
2002.
	   The cuts come amid rough times for Europe's largest consumer
electronics group. In October, the company revealed that
third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38 percent to dlrs
241 million.
	   Though Singapore has been least affected by the regional
economic crisis, the unemployment rate has doubled to 4.5 percent
in recent months.
	   The government has launched a host of measures to reform the
economy and save jobs, but it still refuses to extend any
unemployment benefits.

Russian Cabinet presents next year's tight budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov presented a draft
of the 1999 budget Thursday, unveiling a document that calls for
printing more money and factors in foreign loans that may not
materialize.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that is very austere,'' Primakov
said at a Cabinet meeting where leaders hashed out the draft.
``And, the essential thing is that it is honest. We didn't include
spending that can't be covered by revenues.''
	   But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the
budget includes dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans the government
hopes to receive, but can't necessarily count on.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders froze a dlrs
22.6 billion loan package after Russia defaulted on some of its
debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget plan as
a requirement for more loans, and has specifically warned the
Cabinet against factoring in foreign credits which are yet to
materialize.
	   The budget forecasts spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion at Thursday's exchange rate) and revenues of 474 billion
rubles (dlrs 24 billion), according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government expects to cover the 101 billion ruble (dlrs 5
billion) deficit through loans and printing about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) of new cash.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar and foresees inflation of 30 percent next year. Many
private economists see those estimates as unrealistic, and predict
the budget deficit will be even larger.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.
	   Primakov warned government ministers against trying to boost
spending in their fields, threatening to fire them if they disobey.
	   He also said the budget should serve as a ``prelude'' for
economic growth by creating new incentives for Russia's ailing
industries. The Cabinet has recently approved a package of bills to
lower taxes and streamline Russia's convoluted tax system.
	   The bills have been sent to the Russian parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, which must approve them along with the
budget.
	   Primakov and other Cabinet officials have voiced hopes for a
quick approval of the budget. Unlike previous governments, his
Cabinet enjoys broad support in the Duma.

Magazine: Singapore PM opposes Cambodia's immediate entry to ASEAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister signaled his
opposition to Cambodia's bid to immediately join ASEAN in a
Thursday magazine interview, possibly spelling the end to Phnom
Penh's hopes for admission at next week's summit.
	   ``I would like to see the full sense of the coalition agreement
fully implemented before we admit them'' to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was quoted as
saying in the Dec. 17 edition of Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   Last week, leaders of rival Cambodian political groups formed a
government after months of wrangling following disputed national
elections and a coup in July. The turmoil delayed plans to admit
Cambodia into the regional grouping, and its seat in the United
Nations was revoked.
	   But with the formation of the coalition government, Cambodian
officials immediately began lobbying for a quick entrance to ASEAN.
	   Opinion within the group has been divided, though a decision to
admit the country must be by consensus.
	   Singapore has already expressed reservations about Cambodia's
entry to ASEAN at next week's summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, but not so
directly and forcefully.
	   ``It's procedural. It's technical. In principle we want Cambodia
to be a member of ASEAN,'' added Goh in the magazine interview.
	   But he noted that ``the coalition agreement says there must be a
government in place, the Senate must be established and the
senators must be appointed.''
	   ``This process should be completed before Cambodia gets in,'' he
was quoted saying. ``Otherwise there's still a risk of the
coalition agreement unraveling.''
	   Foreign and economic ministers from ASEAN's nine current members
will meet separately Friday and Saturday in Hanoi, then jointly on
Sunday, ahead of the Dec. 15-16 summit.
	   Cambodia's application is expected to dominate their agenda. The
country received a welcome boost Monday when the United Nations
agreed to restore its representation at the world body.

Women protest upsurge in killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana(AP) _ Representatives of various women's groups
have staged a march in the Ghanaian capital to protest a recent
upsurge in murders against women there.
	   The Wednesday march organized by the National Council on Women
and Development brought together female lawyers, journalists and
members of the Police Wives Association.
	   Bearing placards and chanting slogans, the women said they used
the march, originally scheduled as an activity to mark the 50th
anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to
express concern about the present security situation.
	   Police have reported an increasing spate of killings against
women in Accra in the past couple of weeks.
	   At least 17 women aged between 45 and 50 years, have been
murdered within the Dansoman and Mataheko suburbs, according to
police reports from the capital.
	   So far, no arrests have been made, but the killings have
generated an increasing anti-foreigner sentiment throughout the
country.
	   The demonstrators also presented Parliament with a resolution
recommending that it ensure police patrols within the capital were
stepped up to help halt violent crimes against women.
	   They also called for better equipment and logistics for the
capital's police force. (kk-ad)

	   Jassim insisted that the office was private property and that it
was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said the party
works on political matters and not anything related to the
inspectors's goal _ weaponry.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' he said.
	   U.N. inspectors have insisted they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to enter any site in Iraq without conditions.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 inspectors was turned back when it
tried to enter the office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said. The official was not
identified by name.
	   Jassim's statements came just hours after a full contingent of
inspectors resumed searches of suspected weapons sites Thursday.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said. But she
declined to say whether teams would try to re-enter the site.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   The office is inside a two-story stucco building behind black
gates. There are no signs outside indicating it is an office of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but there is an emblem of
the party over the door.

Schroeder vows to curb German payments to European Union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder vowed Thursday
to win limits in German payments to the European Union during his
country's six-month presidency of the economic bloc starting Jan.
1.
	   Germany contributes about one-third of the EU budget, putting
far more into the 15-nation group than it gets back, and Schroeder
said redressing the imbalance would be a priority during the German
presidency.
	   However, bargaining to win a reduction of German payments will
be tough with EU ranks about nearly to double through expansion.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in a
speech to parliament laying out Germany's agenda.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to solve Europe's problems with a
German checkbook.''
	   Allowing new members from the former Soviet bloc into the EU
will be ``incredibly difficult'' without budget reform, though
Germany remains committed to the goal, Schroeder said.
	   His speech attempted to set the tone for a two-day summit of EU
leaders opening Friday in Vienna, Austria, where disputes over EU
expansion and budget plans are expected to take center stage.
	   Germany will seek to break the impasse over the EU budget by the
end of March, Schroeder said.
	   With Europe's biggest economy, Germany is the top net
contributor to the EU, paying in 22 billion marks (dlrs 13.2
billion) more than it gets back. About half the EU budget goes for
farm subsidies, much of the rest for aid to poorer regions.
	   The previous government of Helmut Kohl had also pressed for
limiting Germany's dues, but Schroeder has set a new, tougher tone
since taking office in October.

	   Iraqi newspapers Thursday carried the official agency report on
the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials.
	   Jassim's comments seemed sure to complicate matters.
	   He said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said: ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

	   Jassim insisted that the office was private property and that it
was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said the party
works on political matters and not anything related to the
inspectors' work _ weaponry.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' he said.
	   U.N. inspectors have insisted they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to enter any site in Iraq without conditions.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 inspectors was turned back when it
tried to enter the Baath Party office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said. The official was not
identified by name.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the Iraqi
escorts had made a mistake in declaring the site sensitive.
	   Jassim's statements came just hours after a full contingent of
inspectors resumed searches of suspected weapons sites Thursday.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said. But she
declined to say whether teams would try to re-enter the site.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he
has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a

Interest rate on 91-day treasury bill continues fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The interest rate on 91-day treasury bills
continued to fall in November to 17.6 percent from the previous
20.6 percent in October, the Central Bank of Kenya said Thursday.
	   The bank said the interbank interest rate also declined to 12.0
percent in November from 16.4 percent the previous month.
	   Government public debt rose to Kenya shillings 483.8 billion
(dlrs 8.06 billion) in October from Kenya shillings 477.3 billion
(dlrs 7.96 billion) in June 1998, the bank said.
	   The overall balance of payments position remained strong with a
surplus of dlrs 112 million in the year to October compared with
dlrs 17 million last year, the bank said.
	   ``This means our exports stayed more or the less the same while
the imports fell. The difference between the two (exports and
imports) must lead to an improved balance of payment position,''
said Central Bank Chief Economist, Maurice Kanga.
	   ``This does not mean the economy is doing very well. In fact the
economy is doing very badly,'' he said.
	   The bank said the current account deficit narrowed to dlrs 98
million or 1.1 GDP, from dlrs 308 million or 3.4 percent GDP in the
year to October 1997.
	   The bank said the Kenya shilling strengthened against the dollar
averaging KES 59.6 in November compared to KES 59.9 in October this
year.
	   However, the shilling is now on a downward trend, trading at
61.65, the bank said Thursday.

Banana sentence on gay charges put off in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The High Court ordered prosecutors and
defense lawyers to redouble their efforts to bring home fugitive
ex-president Canaan Banana, convicted last month on sodomy and
homosexual assault charges.
	   Banana, 63, believed to be in hiding in neighboring South
Africa, was to have been sentenced Thursday for offenses carrying a
maximum penalty of more than 20 years in jail.
	   Defense lawyer Josephine McNally said Judge Godfrey Chiyausiku
postponed Thursday's hearing to Jan. 18 to give the state and
Banana's defense time to get him to the court.
	   The judge said the state should urgently negotiate Banana's
return with South African authorities.
	   He also asked both sides to prepare arguments on whether Banana
can be sentenced in absentia. McNally said defense lawyers had
already found no precedent for sentencing an absent criminal.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela triggered controversy
earlier this month when he met with Banana at his official
residence in Pretoria at Banana's request.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister who served as ceremonial president
after independence in 1980 until 1987, was convicted Nov. 26 in
Harare on 11 charges of sodomy, homosexual assault, ``unnatural
acts'' and common assault.
	   He fled to Botswana earlier in November.
	   South African officials have said they have no record of his
crossing into their territory and they didn't know his whereabouts
after the meeting with Mandela.
	   Zimbabwe has no formal extradition treaty with South Africa but
officials there have said Banana would be returned to Zimbabwe as
an illegal alien if it was proven he slipped into the country
unlawfully.
	   In the past, South Africa and Zimbabwe have exchanged criminals
by mutual agreement.
	   Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe but not in South Africa.
	   The case has embarrassed President Robert Mugabe, who has waged
an outspoken campaign against homosexuality, describing same-sex
partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a Finnish
forensics team Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of
Kosovo massacre victims in a dispute over Serb access to
rebel-controlled territory.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstruction.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the war-torn
Serbian province.
	   But a Serb police contingent consisting of an armored personnel
carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and
carrying automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the graves site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital Pristina after more than two hours at roadside.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic,
said her team's safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to
our laws, the exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje which is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during Serbian
forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in Kosovo. The
slaughtered bodies were witnessed before burial by diplomats,
journalists and human rights workers, some with limbs hacked off
and all shot in the back of the head.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people in the majority ethnic Albanian province have
been killed in this year's offensive as well as subsequent periodic
violence since the October truce.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Weeks of shuttle diplomacy have failed to produce a settlement
that would settle the dispute over the future political status of
Kosovo, which had autonomy until 1989.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill planned talks in Belgrade on
Thursday with government authorities, who are determined to keep
Kosovo within Serbia, the dominant republic left in Yugoslavia.
	   Hill insisted after meeting with ethnic Albanian negotiators
Wednesday in Pristina that efforts to resolve the conflict are
``still on track'' _ even though all sides in the dispute had
rejected his latest peace proposal.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top Japanese government officials agreed Thursday
to support a bid by the nation's third-largest city of Osaka to
host the 2008 Olympics, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Cabinet ministers are expected to formally endorse the decision
Friday, paving way for financial support for the city's preparation
for the event.
	   Osaka, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo, will
formally file its candidacy with the International Olympic
Committee in early 2000.
	   Paris, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur have also expressed hopes to
host the 2008 summer games. The host will be decided at an IOC
meeting in Moscow in 2001.
	   Osaka has asked the central government to shoulder about half of
the costs to prepare for the games, following the example of the
Nagano Olympics held in central Japan in February.
	   An estimated 80 billion yen (dlrs 680 million) will be needed to
build an Olympic stadium and a swimming pool if the city wins the
bid, said Osaka City spokesman Yoshimitsu Yorise.

	   Iraqi newspapers on Thursday carried the official agency report
on the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials.
	   Jassim's comments seemed sure to complicate matters.
	   He said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said, ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraqi
officials have long insisted they have eliminated all illegal
weapons.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.

Most foreign firms in Japan don't expect sales to rise this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Some barriers to doing business in Japan are
disappearing for foreign companies, but making money here is
expected to become more difficult, according to a survey of foreign
firms released Thursday.
	   Companies surveyed by the Japan External Trade Organization said
the climate for investment in Japan had improved in recent years
because of deregulation and changes in the labor market that have
made it easier for foreign companies to find good workers.
	   But while 53 percent of the companies responding to the poll
said their sales rose last year, only 36 percent of them expected
sales to rise again this year, the trade group said.
	   Just over half the companies, or 51 percent, said it will take
three to five years for the Japanese economy to recover. Japan is
mired in the worst recession in its postwar history.
	   Many foreign firms have complained in the past that it was
difficult to hire skilled workers because of a reluctance by
Japanese to join foreign companies.
	   In the poll, which was conducted in October, 31.9 percent of the
companies said it had become easier to hire staff because of
greater mobility in the Japanese labor market, while 8.9 percent
said it was more difficult.
	   Traditionally, Japan's lifetime employment system has meant that
few people changed jobs in mid-career, but that system has
deteriorated in recent years.
	   In addition, 32.4 percent reported less prejudice about foreign
firms in Japan, while only 2.8 percent thought the prejudice had
worsened.
	   To make doing business in Japan easier yet, 68 percent of those
surveyed said the government should reduce the tax rate.
	   The trade group polled 3,280 foreign companies operating in
Japan market and received valid responses from 705 companies. Of
the 705, 149 were manufacturers and 556 were non-manufacturers.
	   The group gave no margin of error for the survey.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A French company has signed a dlrs 3.5
million contract with the government of Laos to upgrade and extend
Vientiane's electricity networks, Lao government radio said on
Thursday.
	   The contract is being financed by the French government, the
report said.
	   The company, ETDE S.A., will also train engineers from Laos'
state-owned power company, according to the terms of the contract.
	   Government radio said the project reflects the will of the
French Republic to participate in the development of Laos.
	   It would also help the country not only from a technological
standpoint but a social one as well, as electric power improves
people's lives, the report said.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An unknown attacker shot and killed
Armenia's deputy minister of defense on Thursday, a spokesman in
Armenia's Interior Ministry said.
	   The 48-year-old minister, Bagram Khorkhoruni, was killed outside
his apartment as he left for work early in the morning, said
Interior Ministry spokesman Vladimir Grigoryan.
	   Officials had no explanation for the killing. Police found seven
bullet casings at the scene, and an investigation into the shooting
was underway.
	   Khorkhoruni, who was married and had three children, served in
his post since 1997. Before that, he worked in the Armenian
Interior Ministry. An army veteran, he was also a policeman earlier
in his career.
	   Armenia, an ex-Soviet republic in the Caucasus Mountains, has
seen a sharp increase in crime in recent years.

Priest is accused of armed robbery and indecent proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ Police ended Thursday their
investigation of an Orthodox priest who is accused of armed robbery
and indecent proposals to women he held hostage, a police officer
said.
	   Father Nicolae, whose full name and age were not disclosed by
police, was arrested 45 days ago after, after he and six men robbed
passengers in three buses which were traveling from the former
Soviet Republic of Moldova north to Ukraine.
	   Maj. Vladimir Botnaru, of Chisinau police said that several
victims, mainly women, had declared that they were ordered to
completely undress at gunpoint by a group of robbers and all their
jewels, wedding rings and earrings were stolen.
	   Nicolae who was not dressed in his priest robes at the time made
indecent proposals to several women but other robbers stopped him
acting out his proposals, Botnaru said, quoting the victims'
statements.
	   Father Nicolae was arrested in October and is now in prison in
the city of Soroca, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of
Chisinau. Botnaru did not say when his trial would start but said
the priest whose parish is near Chisinau could get from 12 to 25
years in prison.
	   The Moldovan Orthodox church has excommunicated Nicolae.
	   Four men who took part in the robberies were later caught by
police, two in Moscow and two in Chisinau. Another two are at large
in Russia and Moldova, police believe.

S.African security firm decides to close

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ For years it blazed a trail
through Africa's bloody conflicts, earning a reputation for
supplying the continent's most efficient guns for hire.
	   Now Executive Outcomes, the South African private military
company, is closing, bringing an end to almost a decade of
controversial involvement in other people's wars.
	   Defending the firm to the last, director Nico Palm on Thursday
denied EO was a mercenary outfit. He said he was proud of its
record in helping end civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone.
	   ``We have had some good times and we are proud of what we have
achieved,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In a brief announcement on Tuesday the Pretoria-based firm said
it would wind up its business by Jan. 1.
	   ``Over the past two years the majority of governments in Africa
have endeavored to secure and maintain law and order. The nature of
these efforts do not justify our involvement,'' the firm said.
	   But analysts say the opportunities for private security
companies have never been greater. With wars raging across Africa
from the Congo to Sudan, the hundreds of ``freelance'' soldiers on
EO's database of potential employees are unlikely to be short of
work.
	   Some security analysts say EO was motivated by strict new
anti-mercenary laws passed in South Africa earlier this year. The
laws ban South African firms from participating in mercenary
operations, allowing the state to confiscate the assets of guilty
companies.
	   Palm, however, denied the decision to close shop was caused by
the legislation. He said the firm had secured a government permit
to operate, but its management was simply tired of the business.
	   ``I have got a family and after ten years we had enough of it,''
Palm said.
	   Marketing itself as a legal _ if unusual _ company, EO has
always denied getting involved in wars itself. Instead it says it
supplied security, training and equipment to legitimate governments
or foreign companies working in tough areas.
	   Founded in 1989 during the endgame of apartheid, it has a slick
Internet site detailing past successes and giving information on
how clients can get in contact. Its logo is a fierce looking knight
chess piece.
	   Mark Malan, head of the peacekeeping program at the Institute
for Security Studies in Johannesburg said the firm's image had
suffered a blow after a disastrous contract taken out by the
government of Papua New Guinea in 1997.
	   After being hired to provide a small mercenary force to help
Papua New Guinea deal with a rebellion, the foreigners' arrival
instead triggered a military mutiny and protests that prompted the
government to nullify the deal.
	   Malan said EO also became a victim of its own success, with its
famous name being used by ill-trained soldiers of fortune with no
link to the firm.
	   For Palm, who declines to say what he plans next, it is no
longer his business.
	   ``They are freelancers and we can't be responsible for what they
do,'' he said.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a Finnish
forensics team Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of
Kosovo massacre victims in a dispute over Serb access to
rebel-controlled territory.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstruction.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the war-torn
Serbian province.
	   But a Serb police contingent consisting of an armored personnel
carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and
carrying automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the grave site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital Pristina after more than two hours at the roadside.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic,
said her team's safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to
our laws, the exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje which is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during Serbian
forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in Kosovo. The
slaughtered bodies were witnessed before burial by diplomats,
journalists and human rights workers, some with limbs hacked off
and all shot in the back of the head.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people in the majority ethnic Albanian province have
been killed in this year's offensive as well as subsequent periodic
violence since the October truce.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Weeks of shuttle diplomacy have failed to produce a settlement
that would settle the dispute over the future political status of
Kosovo, which had autonomy until 1989.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill planned talks in Belgrade on
Thursday with government authorities, who are determined to keep
Kosovo within Serbia, the dominant republic left in Yugoslavia.
	   Hill insisted after meeting with ethnic Albanian negotiators
Wednesday in Pristina that efforts to resolve the conflict are
``still on track'' _ even though all sides in the dispute had
rejected his latest peace proposal.

Small explosion injures four and threatens Basque truce calm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Five people received minor injuries from
a small explosion early Thursday, in the first incident threatening
the calm of this northern city since the armed Basque separatist
group ETA declared an unlimited cease-fire in September.
	   The explosion at the home of a Spanish civil guard at 4 a.m.
(0300gmt), was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline, Interior
Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   Five people, not identified by name, required medical attention
including the wife of the targeted civil guard who received burns
to the face and hands.
	   Four neighbors were also taken to hospital after inhaling fumes
from the explosion that damaged doors and broke windows at the
house, Dors said.
	   ``This is the first time something like this has happened here
since the cease-fire,'' Dors said, referring to the truce observed
by ETA since Sept. 18.
	   ETA's cease-fire triggered talk of possible peace negotiations
with the government aimed at putting a definitive end to the
violence that has surrounding the issue of Basque separatist
aspirations for 30 years.
	   The spokeswoman said it was not known who was behind Wednesday's
explosion, but that the only people with a tradition of similar
attacks in the city were young supporters of ETA.
	   ETA includes Pamplona, and the province of Pamplona, in its
vision of an independent Basque state, despite the fact that they
are located south of the current definition of the Basque province.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its violent
campaign for an independent state straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   In recent years the group's bombings and shootings have been
accompanied by low-intensity pressure carried out by the group's
supporters against such targets as Spanish civil guards who are
believed to represent an occupying force in the Basque homeland.
	   This kind of violence virtually disappeared with the cease-fire
declaration.

Court case on SAfrican voter registration postponed 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A legal challenge by the
opposition New National Party to the way voters register for next
year's national elections was postponed on Thursday.
	   The delay, until Feb. 5, gives the government time to prepare
its case to counter the party's accusation that the registration
process is unfair and favors the ruling African National Congress.
	   The party is asking the Cape Town High Court to declare
unconstitutional a requirement that all voters must have a
bar-coded identity document in order to register to vote in next
year's elections.
	   Bar-coded identification books were first introduced in 1986.
But only about 65 percent of minority whites, the bulwark support
of opposition parties, have the proper documents, compared to 80
percent of the country's majority blacks.
	   Meanwhile, in Pretoria, another opposition party, the mostly
white liberal Democratic Party, said in a statement that it would
also be filing documents to court on Thursday to try to get the
rules changed.

U.S. congressman flies to disputed reef in Spratly Islands

Philippine lawmaker

	   OVER MISCHIEF REEF, South China Sea (AP) _ U.S. Congressman Dana
Rohrabacher flew Thursday on a Philippine air force plane over a
disputed South China Sea reef to observe structures being built by
China and said the United States should help stop Chinese expansion
in the area.
	   ``We can't ignore this bullying by the Communist Chinese in the
Spratlys. This is intolerable,'' Rohrabacher said while viewing
clusters of structures jutting out from Mischief Reef. Three
Chinese warships were on guard nearby.
	   Rohrabacher was accompanied on the C-130 cargo plane by
Philippine military officials and Roilo Golez, chairman of the
Philippine House defense committee.
	   His trip to the Spratlys, which China had opposed, was the first
in recent years by a lawmaker from a country not part of the
conflicting claims to the territory. It reflects Philippine
attempts to seek international support to halt Chinese expansion in
the contested area.
	   ``The main objective of this trip is to seek an international
forum. We want the world to know what is happening,'' Golez said.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief Reef. Both
countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but the Philippines says they could have military uses.
	   The plane carrying Rohrabacher flew for about 20 minutes over
the reef, making six passes and flying as low as 100 meters (300
feet) at one point over the structures to steer clear of clouds.
The California Republican used binoculars and took pictures while
kneeling in front of a small round window.
	   Below, four large clusters of structures on stilts stood near
the fringes of the reef, surrounded by warships and several other
Chinese boats.
	   Army Maj. John Bonafos, a Philippine military expert on the
Spratlys who joined the trip, said satellite dishes have been
installed on all of the structures, which can serve as docks for
large ships.
	   Rohrabacher, who as a member of the U.S. House International
Relations Committee led efforts to block most-favored nation trade
status for China, said he was aghast at the presence of the Chinese
warships. He said China was bullying its way into the Spratlys
knowing that other claimants like the Philippines have weaker
militaries.
	   He said the Philippines should assert its claim because if China
is allowed to fortify its presence near the Philippine coastline,
it would endanger sea lanes near the contested areas as well as
nearby Philippine oil and natural gas exploration sites.
	   ``When you're dealing with gangsters and dictatorships like
Communist China, they only understand it when you're strong and
courageous and standing up for your rights,'' the California
Republican said.
	   Rohrabacher said he would submit a report about the trip to the
House committee and would urge the U.S. government to exert
political and economic pressure on China to dismantle its
structures on Mischief Reef and send its warships home.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   Aside from their strategic location, the Spratlys also are
believed to be sitting atop large deposits of oil and natural gas.

Palestinians convene to scrap calls for Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he
has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a
``firm hand.'' He added that he would not go ahead with a West Bank
troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement,
unless Arafat met a list of demands.
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting
more unrest rather than calming the already tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas. On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung
along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem.
	   The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his
address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City.
	   Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this
session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.
	   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the
Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less
than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success
without it. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with
its future,'' Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he
would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, had failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five
percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his
decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally
declare a Palestinian state in May.
	   The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse
after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a
very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the
accord. On Thursday, 98 members of the 124-member Palestinian
Central Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote
on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
	   The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session,
and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63
members is required, and a vote was expected by Thursday evening.
	   The council has not met for years and was revived specifically
for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members of the
Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,
among others.

KLA rejects equal blame with `fascist' Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels objected again
Thursday to international statements blaming both sides for the
failure to end bloodshed in the province. The rebels said it was
the Serbs who had failed to cooperate.
	   ``This attempt to put on an equal level the Serb fascist regime
with KLA units is unacceptable, and demonstrates an inability to
name the main guilty party in the wars in the territories in
ex-Yugoslavia,'' the Kosovo Liberation Army's general command said.
	   ``The KLA has shown a couple of times its willingness to
cooperate with international institutions,'' said the statement,
published in the ethnic Albanian paper Koha Ditore. ``It released
all the captured and detained Serbs, and the other side never
cooperated.''
	   In an apparent reference to Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist Kosovo
Albanian leader who is in France to receive an award, the rebels
said: ``It would be an honor for French democracy but also for
European democracy to the victims of freedom and democracy.''
	   They called on ethnic Albanians to unite behind a single
``intellectual and financial force to save Kosovo'' _ apparently
appealing for support from those who back Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo, the dominant Albanian political party.

<TEXT>
	   Iraqi newspapers on Thursday carried the official agency report
on the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials.
	   Jassim's comments seemed sure to complicate matters.
	   He said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said, ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraqi
officials have long insisted they have eliminated all illegal
weapons.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned back when
it tried to enter the office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later, however, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were mistaken in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to
suggest the team should not have been barred.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's action Wednesday,
saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and
they blocked us.''
	   The United States, which had threatened military action during
two previous standoffs between Iraq and U.N. inspectors this year,
was cautious.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, said Wednesday. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   The office in contention is in a two-story stucco building
behind black gates. There are no signs outside indicating it is an
office of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but there is an
emblem of the party over the door.
	   Jassim insisted that the office was private property and that it
was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said the party
works on political matters and not anything related to the
inspectors's goal _ weaponry.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' he said.
	   Jassim said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said: ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's statements came just hours after a full contingent of
inspectors on Thursday resumed searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

IOC to discuss redress in East German doping cases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Faced with clear evidence of drug
use by former East German athletes, Olympic leaders must now deal
with the tricky question of whether to revise the record books
going back 20 years and more.
	   The International Olympic Committee opens a four-day executive
board meeting Friday that will consider petitions seeking redress
for American and British swimmers who were beaten to gold medals by
East Germans.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee is seeking ``appropriate medal
recognition'' for the American women's relay team which finished
second behind an East German quartet at the 1976 Montreal Games.
	   The British Olympic Association has filed a similar petition on
behalf of Sharron Davies, who won the silver medal in the 400-meter
individual medley at the 1980 Moscow Games behind East Germany's
Petra Schneider.
	   The precedent-setting cases _ based on court evidence in Germany
_ will be closely watched around the world. They could open the
floodgates to numerous claims from other athletes who believe they
were cheated out of medals.
	   ``The issue is: Do we rewrite history? How do we deal with the
past?'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said.
	   Carrard said the executive board is expected to open preliminary
discussions on the cases and not make any final decision this week.
	   There appears to be no clear consensus among IOC leaders on what
_ if anything _ to do to acknowledge the state-sponsored doping
which made East Germany an Olympic power in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Recent studies have revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000
athletes were covered by a systematic doping program that operated
in the former Communist country.
	   East German women won 11 of 13 gold medals in swimming at both
the 1976 and 1980 Olympics.
	   Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted
this year in Berlin on charges of administering steroids to young
swimmers without their knowledge. More trials are scheduled.
	   Chances of any radical moves by the IOC, such as the stripping
of medals or wholesale rewriting of results, are remote. Instead,
officials may consider awarding supplemental medals or certificates
or entering an asterisk in the record books.
	   ``I don't know what the solution is,'' IOC vice president Dick
Pound of Canada said. ``Do you start repassing out all the medals,
in which case you might be giving a medal to someone who hasn't
been tested? Everybody who got a medal at the time was tested, and
they tested negative.''
	   ``And what do you do for team sports?'' he said. ``It's just a
mess. I don't see any easy cure.''
	   Pound said in an ``ideal world'' the East Germans who admitted
using drugs would hand back their medals _ an unlikely scenario.
	   ``That would really be the class thing to do _ the truth and
reconciliation approach,'' Pound said. ``As a matter of ethics, the
onus ought to be on them.''
	   That view was echoed by fellow IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz
of the United States _ a former rower who finished third in the
coxed eights at the 1976 Olympics behind teams from East Germany
and the Soviet Union.
	   DeFrantz, who feels certain that her East German rivals were on
drugs, said she has spoken to many former athletes who competed
during that era and found no consensus for revising the results.
	   ``The basic message I've gotten is: if an East German wants to
give up his or her medal, then the Olympic Museum ought to receive
it as testament as to what happened at that time,'' she said.
	   DeFrantz said she hasn't decided whether to support the U.S.
petition to upgrade the medals for the relay team of Linda Jezek,
Lauri Siering, Camile Wright and Shirley Babashoff _ who finished
6.6 seconds behind the East Germans in Montreal.
	   The USOC contends that a recent German trial has provided proof
that at least one member of the German team _ Andrea Pollack Pinske
_ was boosted by anabolic steroids.
	   Davies, the British swimmer, finished 10 seconds behind
Schneider in Moscow. Davies said Schneider told her recently that
she was on drugs since the age of 14 and is now suffering from
heart problems and other side effects.
	   Davies wants the record books marked to reflect that Schneider
took drugs.
	   ``She would like the record put straight to show that she really
won that race in 1980,'' BOA president and British IOC member Craig
Reedie said.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer
dominated the women's Super-G field Thursday, posting her third
World Cup win of the season.
	   The 26-year-old blitzed down the classic 1,985-meter Piste-G
course in 1 minute, 21.95 seconds, leaving the rest of the field in
her dust.
	   Winner of the season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada,
Meissnitzer finished a solid 0.79 seconds ahead of Germany's
Martina Ertl, who is still winless this season.
	   Regine Cavagnoud of France finished third, crossing in 1:22.94.
	   It was Meissnitzer's third World Cup victory since the start of
the season, the Austrian winning a giant slalom in Park City, Utah
three weeks ago.
	   The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the rankings, where she
sits with 525 points, ahead of Ertl, second with 383.

Bulgaria abolishes capital punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria on Thursday abolished capital
punishment and replaced it with life imprisonment without parole in
a measure to move its legal system closer to European standards.
	   The parliament voted 96-22 to approve the change. There were 3
abstentions.
	   Bulgaria has suspended executions since 1990 when it endorsed a
moratorium on carrying out death penalties. Courts have, however,
kept on imposing them.
	   The abolishment of the capital punishment doesn't automatically
undo the verdicts of 19 convicts, who have been sentenced to death
since 1990. They may be pardoned by President Petar Stoyanov.

Russian Cabinet presents next year's tight budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with government approval of budget, minor edits in

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Cabinet approved a draft of the 1999
budget Thursday, giving the green light for a document that calls
for printing more money and factors in foreign loans that may not
materialize.
	   The budget, which was approved with unspecified amendments, will
now go before the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State
Duma, said Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has voiced hopes for a quick
approval of the trimmed-down budget because his Cabinet enjoys
broad support in the Duma.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that is very austere,'' Primakov
said at a Cabinet meeting where leaders hashed out the draft.
``And, the essential thing is that it is honest. We didn't include
spending that can't be covered by revenues.''
	   But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the
budget includes dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans the government
hopes to receive, but can't count on.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders froze a dlrs
22.6 billion loan package after Russia defaulted on some of its
debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget plan as
a requirement for more loans, and has specifically warned the
Cabinet against factoring in foreign credits which are yet to
materialize.
	   The budget forecasts spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion at Thursday's exchange rate) and revenues of 474 billion
rubles (dlrs 24 billion), according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government expects to cover the 101 billion ruble (dlrs 5
billion) deficit through loans and printing about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) in new cash.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar and foresees inflation of 30 percent next year. Many
private economists see those estimates as unrealistic, and predict
the budget deficit will be even larger.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.
	   Primakov warned government ministers against trying to boost
spending in their fields, threatening to fire them if they disobey.
	   He also said the budget should serve as a ``prelude'' for
economic growth by creating new incentives for Russia's ailing
industries. The Cabinet has recently approved a package of bills to
lower taxes and streamline Russia's convoluted tax system.
	   The bills have been sent to the Russian parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, along with the rest of the budget.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest bank slashed its prime
lending rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent Thursday, a step likely
to trigger another round of cuts by the city-state's biggest
lenders.
	   The government-linked Development Bank of Singapore has now cut
the rate it charges its best customers five times in about three
months, by a total of two percentage points.
	   Singapore's other major local banks _ Overseas Union Bank,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and United Overseas Bank _ are
expected to follow DBS's move soon.
	   The trend of falling interest rates has slowed the decline of
prices in Singapore's property market, boosted optimism in the
business community and fueled a stock market rally.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index jumped about 2 percent higher
during the first few minutes of trading Thursday, ending the day up
1.1 percent at 1439.88 points.
	   The Singapore dollar was also stronger Thursday. In late
afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar bought 1.6472 Singapore dollars,
down from 1.6496 late Wednesday.

Most Asian stocks end higher on hopes of more interest rates cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Thursday
on hopes of further interest rates cuts, though the absence of
fresh buying incentives kept volume thin.
	   Shares in Tokyo, the region's biggest market, fell as traders
stayed away ahead of Friday's settlement of December futures and
options contracts, when prices could swing unpredictably.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 124.10
points, or 0.83 percent, to close at 14,807.80.
	   Investors were also cautious over the Japanese central bank's
closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' business confidence survey to
be released Monday.
	   In the currency market, the U.S. dollar briefly fell to a
five-week low of 116.65 Japanese yen amid confusion about comments
from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   The dollar plunged on reports that Miyazawa had said the United
States preferred to keep the dollar between 110 and 120 yen, but he
later clarified that he did not believe the Americans want to see
the dollar fall into the lower end of that range, and the greenback
regained some of its losses.
	   The dollar bought 117.72 yen by mid-afternoon, still down 1.06
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level
of 117.82 yen overnight.
	   In Seoul, blue chips soared 7.8 percent on lower local interest
rates and increased foreign buying. The benchmark KOSPI index rose
41.09 points to close at 567.61.
	   In Singapore, an interest rate cut and hopes of more to come
sent the benchmark STI index up 1.1 percent, or 15.29 points, to
close at 1,439.88.
	   The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. _ Singapore's largest _
slashed prime lending rates Thursday to 5.5 percent from 6 percent
_ a move analysts say may trigger more rate cuts.
	   In Hong Kong, shares ended moderately lower as investors found
no news to motivate them and generally stayed out of the market.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 45.85 points, or 0.44
percent, to close at 10,315.44.
	   ``Since it's almost the end of the year people are reluctant to
open new positions,'' said trader Sean Li of Amsteel Securities
(Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   JAKARTA: Shares rose on hopes of further interest rates cuts in
the coming weeks. The JSX index was up 4.885 points, or 1.2
percent, to close at 403.668.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose as blue chips pushed up the main index
near the close. The Composite Index was up 3.4 points, or 0.70
percent, to close at 525.58.

China sweeps medals, unveils new star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATED after women's 10-meter platform event &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China unveiled a 14-year-old diving
star at the Asian Games Thursday, a day after gymnastics officials
were demanding proof that North Korean competitors were at least
16.
	   Li Na, in her first serious international meet, gave a scare to
more experienced compatriot Cai Yuyan before Cai sealed the
10-meter platform gold on the final dive.
	   Cai's gold added to another from Zhou Yilin in the men's 3-meter
springboard and gave China a sweep of all four diving gold and
silver medals at the games.
	   The women's contest was a good boost for Chinese diving, which
is looking for talent to replace Fu Mingxia, the women's double
gold medalist from the 1996 Olympics who retired at 19.
	   Li was less than two points behind Cai, who clinched the gold
with a final dive that split the judges. Her scores ranged from 7.5
to one perfect 10, giving her a total of 549.57 to Li's 547.80.
	   Li is already locked into a life of hard study and long hours of
training but says she has no concerns about devoting her time to
the sport.
	   ``I wouldn't do it if I didn't like it,'' Li said. ``I started
at 10 years old and I don't think I'm too young, I think this is
the best age.''
	   Gymnastics officials have banned anyone under 16 from competing
at international meets but diving is open to anyone 14 or over. The
rule was changed by governing body FINA after Fu won a world title
in 1991 when aged just 12.
	   Li understands China's tradition in the event, being a mature 12
herself when Fu won the 1996 Olympic double.
	   ``She has been very encouraging to us and I hope I will be for
others,'' Li said of her predecessor.
	   She said her goal was to train hard for the Sydney 2000
Olympics, something that team leader Xue Li will insist on after
being less than completely happy with China's efforts in 1-2
finishes in every event here.
	   ``Our divers' performances are not impeccable, sometimes even
flawed,'' said Xue. ``If we want to regain our supremacy in the
world, we have to work hard after going home.''
	   Zhou also had a close battle with a compatriot before winning
his gold.
	   He had a superb final dive to beat compatriot Yu Zhuocheng by
less than four points on the 3-meter springboard.
	   Yu hit the front after five of Thursday's six optional dives
with an inward 3-1/2 somersault with tuck, which scored 84.66
points, but Zhou made up a 2.7-point deficit with the same dive at
the finish.
	   Zhou, the world championship silver medalist, scored 712.02
points, with Yu on 708.12. Thailand's Suchart Pichi claimed his
second bronze after also placing third in the men's platform event.
	   China won three gold medals in the four events given status at
the 1996 Olympics but was unable to win any of those four at the
world championships in Perth this year.
	   In Bangkok, ``winning these golds means nothing to us, for most
of other Asian countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving
and we Chinese divers mainly compete against ourselves in the
games,'' Xue said. ``But in the world major competitions such as
the Olympics or the world championships, there will be a galaxy of
high-echelon divers. Even a small error can cost you the gold when
you compete against them.''
	   China has been passed by Russians, including 1996 platform
champion Dmitry Sautin. But both Li Na and women's 3-meter
springboard champion Guo Jingjing cite Sautin as their hero.

Congo adamant in not meeting rebels
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Congolese government Thursday remained
adamant that it would not meet with rebels backed by Rwanda and
Uganda, dashing prospects for a cease-fire in the four-month
conflict any time soon.
	   President Laurent Kabila met briefly at the airport with his
Kenyan counterpart, Daniel arap Moi, on the way home from a meeting
with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Kabila refused to speak with reporters, but his ambassador to
Kenya, Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza, said Kinshasa would not sign a
cease-fire until Rwanda and Uganda set a date for the withdrawal of
their troops from neighboring Congo.
	   Both countries have been backing the rebellion with troops and
equipment, claiming that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels to establish bases in eastern Congo from which to attack
their countries.
	   Both countries insist they will remain in Congo until measures
are taken to secure their borders.
	   International efforts to reach a cease-fire have foundered on
Kabila's refusal to meet with or even acknowledge the rebels.
	   After a cease-fire was apparently agreed upon at a
Franco-African summit in Paris late last month, the warring parties
were to meet next week in Lusaka, Zambia, to sign it.
	   It was also agreed that a multinational force would be necessary
to keep the peace and maintain security along the Rwandan and
Ugandan borders in eastern Congo.
	   But Ambassador Mwanza said Congo would only attend a Lusaka
meeting under two conditions.
	   ``The first point is that there are no rebels. If the rebels are
brought to the same table, we will leave the conference,'' he said.
	   ``The second point is that we are in accordance with signing the
cease-fire on the condition that the invading forces leave our
territory.''
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and
equipment to bolster Kabila's forces and to stage a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
	   Kabila claims the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Congolese
Tutsis and disaffected military officers and Congolese politicians
and academics _ are a creation of Rwanda and Uganda, which both
helped him obtain power after toppling longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   ``It is true that President Kabila was aided by Rwanda and
Uganda, but that does not mean he sold the country to Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Mwanza said.
	   He added that once a cease-fire was signed the Congolese
government would accept the deployment of a multinational force.
	   He said Chiluba had yet to issue invitations to the Lusaka
summit, raising doubts the meeting scheduled for Dec. 14 would take
place.

Belgrade court again punishes independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - In an ongoing purge of Serbia's
independent media, a Belgrade court fined Thursday an independent
daily and its chief editor the equivalent of dlrs 45,000 for
allegedly slandering a neo-communist official.
	   This was the second hefty fine slapped against Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraph) since October when the restrictive media law,
de-facto banning criticism of state officials and their policies,
was adopted in Serbia.
	   The first time on Nov. 9, the popular daily was fined the
equivalent of dlrs 120,000. Later, its property was impounded and
it had to move to Montenegro, the small republic which with Serbia
forms Yugoslavia, to resume publishing.
	   Early Thursday, the court acted on charges filed by deputy
Serbian Prime Minister and leading neo-communist official Milovan
Bojic who said an article published in Dec. 5 edition of Dnevni
Telegraf slandered his image.
	   During the brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers in
vain tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be implemented for
newspapers which are published in Montenegro.
	   Its chief editor Dragan Novakovic said he won't pay the fine and
the authorities won't be able to impound his property as they
already did so after the last trial.
	   Several independent media outlets have been fined, and many had
to close down, as the result of the media law which has been
bitterly criticized by the West.

More malfunctions reported at Chernobyl's only operational reactor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Malfunctions in the only operational
reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant forced operators to
reduce output twice over the past three days, officials said
Thursday.
	   The output of reactor No. 3 was reduced by 10 percent before
dawn Thursday after one of 200 safety rods used to stop the reactor
was unexpectedly disconnected from its electricity supply, a
spokeswoman at the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   Thursday's malfunction, fixed within two hours, followed another
incident at the troubled reactor on Tuesday, when plant officials
reduced its output by 30 percent for 10 hours to repair a pump in
the reactor's turbine section.
	   Neither malfunctions caused radiation leaks at the plant,
Energoatom said.
	   The incidents, however, contribute to worries over the
Soviet-designed RBMK reactor, whose frequent malfunctions have led
the West to demand that Chernobyl be shut for good.
	   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed
to provide dlrs 118 million to buy new safety equipment for the
reactor.
	   Although reactor No. 3 underwent major repairs between July 1997
and May 1998, it has been stopped many times since.
	   Ukrainian nuclear safety authorities had ordered the reactor
shut by Dec. 1 to upgrade and replace its safety equipment.
	   But with Ukraine facing energy shortages, the government decided
to put off the repairs until Dec. 15.
	   Many towns and villages in Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day because the former Soviet
republic's energy plants can't afford to buy enough fuel to meet
the demand for energy.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, when the plant's other reactor was stopped in compliance with
Ukraine's pledge to fully shut down Chernobyl by 2000.
	   Another Chernobyl reactor was stopped after a 1991 fire, and the
fourth was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and fire, the world's
worst nuclear accident.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned back when
it tried to enter the office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later, however, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were mistaken in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to
suggest the team should not have been barred.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's action Wednesday,
saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and
they blocked us.''
	   The United States, which had threatened military action during
two previous standoffs between Iraq and U.N. inspectors this year,
was cautious.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, said Wednesday. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   The Baath office is in a two-story stucco building behind black
gates. There are no signs outside indicating it is an office of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but there is an emblem of
the party over the door.
	   Jassim insisted that the office was private property and that it
was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said the party
works on political matters and not anything related to the
inspectors's goal _ weaponry.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' he said.
	   Jassim said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said: ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's statements came just hours after a full contingent of
inspectors on Thursday resumed searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraqi
officials have long insisted they have eliminated all illegal
weapons.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.

Thailand, South Korea break China's grip on Asian gymnastics gold

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cracking China's gold medal grip,
Thailand's Amornthep Unchai was king of the rings at the Asian
Games gymnastics competition Thursday, in a victory that sent the
home crowd wild.
	   Screams, whistles and huge applause echoed through the packed
arena as Amornthep's feet hit the mat at the end of an immaculate
routine of grace, control and raw power that scored 9.800 for gold.
	   Amornthep was the first but not the last gymnast to break what
otherwise had been an unblemished Chinese record in four days of
competition.
	   South Korea's Yeo Hong-chul beat out China's Li Xiaopeng by
0.038 point for gold in the men's vault. China's Xing Aowei had to
share his gold on the pommel horse with North Korea's Pae Kil Su,
an Olympic and world champion in that event.
	   But there was still plenty more gold and other medals for China,
adding to the men's and women's team and all-around titles it had
won earlier in the competition.
	   Making his mark in his first major international contest,
China's 18-year-old newcomer Yang Wei won gold on the floor with a
routine that combined soaring somersaults and breathtaking control.
His 9.775 beat Kim Dong-hwa of South Korea, who got silver with
9.650.
	   China's Li Xiaopeng got bronze with 9.600. Li would have won
silver had he not stepped out of bounds after a somersault, a
mistake that cost him a 0.1-point penalty.
	   In the women's apparatus finals, China's Bi Wenjing won the
uneven bars with a daring routine in which she swung around holding
on with just one hand. The 17-year-old's 9.700 beat North Korea's
Kang Sun-yong, who took silver with 9.500, and Japan's Yuki Ohata,
bronze medal-winner with 9.450.
	   Veteran Chinese team member Kui Yuanyuan won the women's vault
with 9.537. Uzbekistan's Svetlana Bakhridinova took silver with
9.400.
	   China's Xu Jing, a 16-year-old also making her debut in
international competition, and Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova shared
bronze with 9.350.
	   Amornthep was the first Thai ever to win an Asian Games gold in
gymnastics, Thai sports officials said.
	   After collecting his pommel horse gold, a tearful Pae told
Korean reporters his victory was ``the most honorable moment'' of
his life. He also said he was retiring and getting married on his
return to North Korea.
	   Some of the North Korean coaches broke into tears as the North's
anthem, ``The Patriotic Song,'' played.
	   Taiwan's Chian Chieng-tun and China's Huang Xu shared bronze
with 9.700. Chian's bronze was Taiwan's first gymnastics medal in
the Asian Games since 1990.
	   Huang, who had already won the men's all-around gold, also
picked up a silver medal on the rings, behind Thailand's Amornthep.
Huang scored 9.675, with Japan's Yoshihiro Saito and Taiwan's Chen
Kuang-hui sharing a bronze with 9.625. Japan also got another
bronze in the vault through Naoya Tsukahara, the all-around bronze
medalist and son of five-time Olympic gold medalist, Mitsuo
Tsukahara.

Ukrainian police detain teen-age kidnapper suspected of killing
</HEADLINE>
girl &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A teen-age boy allegedly kidnapped and then
killed a 14-year-old girl in a central Ukrainian town when the
victim's father could not meet a ransom demand, a newspaper said
Thursday.
	   Oksana Fedorenko left her home in the town of Ovruch on Sunday
night and did not return home. Her father received a telephone call
late at night, and the caller demanded dlrs 25,000 and 5,000 hryvna
(dlrs 1,460) in exchange for the girl.
	   After Fedorenko's father said he couldn't pay the ransom, the
caller hung up, the daily Fakty reported. Fedorenko's body was
found the next day at an abandoned military base in Ovruch, the
newspaper said.
	   Police then detained a teen-ager who had earlier been sentenced
for theft. The teen confessed to first strangling and then stabbing
the girl to death, Fakty said. The name of the suspect was not
released.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury
urged Arab states Thursday to move toward an Arab common market to
counter trade blocs.

for talks with his counterpart, Fayez Tarawneh, on setting up a

cooperation in various fields.
	   The two states plan to start reducing customs duties on each

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ People around the world celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations human rights charter on Thursday
called for more efforts to end still rampant abuses.
	   ``We've left a question mark after the word `happy' in `happy
anniversary,' '' said Hideki Morihara of Amnesty International in
Japan. ``Even now, there is no end to the violation of human rights
in the world.''
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights. The U.N. General Assembly has scheduled
a special session to mark the anniversary.
	   But throughout Asia and other regions, there were reminders of
the many who continue to be denied basic freedoms and rights.
	   Thousands of student protesters marched to the U.N. building in
Indonesia's capital, demanding greater democracy and human rights
as well as the prosecution of ex-President Suharto on corruption
charges.
	   Several minor clashes were reported with security forces, but
the demonstration was generally peaceful. One banner read:
``Release political prisoners.'' Another said: ``Stop money
politics and violence.''
	   In Myanmar, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi attended a
U.N.-sponsored ceremony with other officials of her opposition
National League for Democracy. No government officials took part.
	   ``Nobody can deny there are no human rights in Burma,'' said Suu
Kyi, who has endured nine years of either house arrest or strict
restrictions on her activities. ``And the people of Burma will
never enjoy peace and security unless there is a government that
can guarantee human rights.''
	   In the past several months, the military rulers have arrested
nearly a thousand of her party members.
	   The junta has never honored a 1990 election, in which the NLD
won 392 of the legislature's 485 seats, and has never allowed the
freely elected Parliament to meet.
	   Even as Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect human
rights in a letter marking the anniversary, police ransacked the
homes of several dissidents in a widening crackdown.
	   Police detained some dissidents for questioning and seized
photos and pamphlets, including copies of the declaration that the
dissidents had planned to hand out at schools and factories, New
York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   ``The Chinese government should recognize that oppression is not
the way,'' the group said in a statement.
	   Although China took part in drafting a U.N. statement on the
anniversary, in practice it still represses those who fight for
human rights, the group said.
	   While attending an anniversary celebration in Paris, the Dalai
Lama said conditions for his fellow Tibetans were worsening under
Chinese rule.
	   ``The situation is very difficult, very grave,'' the Tibetan
spiritual leader said. ``We have to hope to improve our
situation.''
	   Scores of Tibetan exiles in India burned the Chinese flag in
protest of Beijing's rule of their homeland.
	   Elsewhere in India, people once known as ``untouchable''
announced that they were kicking off a yearlong campaign to ``cast
out caste.''
	   Discrimination based on caste is illegal in India, but still
entrenched by tradition.
	   In the capital of Islamabad in nearby Pakistan, dozens of Afghan
women protested outside the U.N. offices. They attacked the rigid
Islamic law imposed by Afghanistan's rulers, the Taliban religious
army.
	   The protest was organized by the Revolutionary Association of
the Women of Afghanistan, which is headquartered in neighboring
Pakistan because its members are unable to return to their homeland
fearing attacks.
	   ``The people of Afghanistan and in particular the agonized women
of Afghanistan are being brutalized in the most tragically inhuman
conditions,'' the group said in a statement handed over to the
United Nations.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based Human Rights Watch started a worldwide
campaign in response to the Dec. 1 arrest of Hafez Abu Saada, head
of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, which recently
reported widespread torture by police of Coptic Christians in a
southern village.
	   Abu Saada has been accused of accepting illegal foreign
donations and publishing false reports that damaged Egypt's image.
Conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years at
hard labor.
	   The accusations ``represent a direct threat to the entire human
rights community in Egypt,'' Human Rights Watch said in a
statement.
	   Some government leaders promised to take action to protect human
rights in their countries.
	   The Mozambique government announced that it plans to introduce
human rights as a subject in schools, starting with primary school
students in early 2000.
	   Although the rights record of this southeastern African country
has not been widely criticized, activists say many prisoners at the
Machava Maputo jail have not been brought to trial for up to six
years.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a review of all
people jailed for politically related crimes.
	   ``We know that human rights and justice are the only true way to
peace in our land,'' he said during anniversary ceremonies at the
presidential palace.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, a conservative shipping
tycoon handpicked by Beijing, said the former British colony
remains a ``robust and lively community where people have no
hesitation in speaking their minds.''
	   Echoing widespread sentiments, Cambodian opposition leader Sam
Rainsy cast doubt on whether some of those celebrating were
genuinely committed to the declaration.
	   ``It is deeply ironic to see international representatives
honoring the Universal Declaration at a time when their disregard
for its principles is so apparent,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Human Rights Watch in Asia has painted a gloomy picture of the
rights situation in Cambodia. Officials linked to murders still
held office, and Khmer Rouge leaders accused in the deaths of
millions of people in the 1970s were still at large, it said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard acknowledged his nation
had a long way to go. The 400,000 Aborigines, among Australia's 18
million people, have always been the poorest.
	   ``I don't pretend for a moment our human rights record has been
without blemish,'' he told Parliament. ``If you don't respect the
human rights of your own people, then you can hardly put yourself
in a position to lecture the rest of the world.''

Chirac accepts invitation to Washington in February
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac has accepted an
invitation to visit Washington in February, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced after a breakfast with him Thursday.
	   ``I had the opportunity to extend to him President Clinton's
invitation for an official visit in Washington for Feb. 19, which
he accepted,'' Albright said.
	   The trip will come two months before a meeting in Washington
marking the 50th anniversary of NATO, the U.S.-led alliance in
which France has remained a member but has stayed out of the
integrated command since 1967.
	   On the agenda would be ``all the current issues of the day''
including NATO, the Middle East and Iraq, said Chirac spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna, confirming the plans.
	   Colonna said, however, that French reintegration into the NATO
command would not be an issue.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has maintained friendly ties with
Chirac, and Albright said she had ``a very good discussion'' with
the French president about NATO, Iraq and Clinton's plans to visit
the Middle East later this week.
	   ``The president is going forward with his trip,'' she said,
despite recent violence on the West Bank. ``We want very much for
various parts of Wye to be carried out,'' she said, referring to
the latest peace accord.

Ukrainian poachers detained for allegedly killing teenager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police detained two poachers
suspected of killing a teen-ager who stole their fishing net, a
newspaper said Thursday.
	   The two suspects, a 48-year-old man and his 17-year-old
companion, wanted to catch fish illegally at a lake in the Crimean
peninsula.
	   After placing their nets, they left, and two teen-agers who were
nearby stole one of the nets, a Crimean criminal prosecutor, Rudolf
Synelshchykov, told the daily Fakty.
	   The poachers pursued the boys in their car and beat them with a
stick, killing a 17-year-old, identified only as Andriy,
Synelshchykov reported.
	   The second boy managed to escape and alerted police, who drew up
composite portraits of the suspects and soon detained them, he
said.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For most of those receiving Nobel
Prizes in the Swedish capital on Thursday, science is a way of
improving the human condition, but for one it's a means of
describing it.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago of Portugal often uses eerie,
almost-credible scientific events as metaphors for addressing
philosophical issues. In his most-recent novel ''Blindness,''
people suddenly and inexplicably go blind in an allegory of social
disintegration.
	   '''The Stone Raft'' from 1986 posits the Iberian Peninsula
snapping off from the rest of the European continent and floats
into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical search for identity away
from the standardizing nature of the European Union.
	   Saramago and winners of the physics, chemistry, medicine and
economics prizes receive their prizes in an afternoon ceremony at
Stockholm's imposing Konserthuset hall, then are feted at a banquet
in the castle-like city hall.
	   The prizes are given every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor
of dynamite who established the prizes in his will.
	   It's probably not a day too soon if any of the laureates are
interested more in the prize's money than in its prestige. The
Swedish kronor has consistently fallen since the prizes were
announced in October; the 7.6-million-kronor prizes were worth
about dlrs 978,000 two months ago, but at Thursday's exchange rate
the value had dropped to dlrs 943,000.
	   The medicine prize is shared by Americans Robert Furchgott of
the State University of New York, Louis Ignarro of the University
of California-Los Angeles and Ferid Murad of the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston, for their work in discovering how
nitric oxide does its life-saving work of dilating blood vessels.
	   Nitric oxide also plays a role in the working of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra and the laureates say it is likely to
have wide new applications in counteracting asthma and coronary
disease.
	   Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar, won the economics prize for his
work in examining the causes behind famines and other catastrophes.
He is a specialist in welfare economics, the discipline that tries
to establish quantitative ways of assessing quality of life.
	   The physics prize goes to Robert Laughlin of Stanford
University, Horst Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel Tsui of
Princeton University for discovering how electrons can change
behavior and act more like fluid than particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions. Kohn did not come to Stockholm because of an illness in
his family; he plans to come for the 1999 ceremony, according to
the Nobel Foundation.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, also receive their prizes on Thursday, in
ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.

Polish official says Yeltsin postponed visit due to illness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin postponed
a planned visit to Poland this month due to his poor health, an
official in the Polish president's office says.
	   Andrzej Majkowski, director of the office of international
affairs in the president's office, told the PAP state news agency
on Wednesday the visit planned for this week probably would be
rescheduled for sometime next year.
	   Majkowski's secretary confirmed Thursday that the PAP report was
accurate.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski invited Yeltsin to Poland
during a meeting in Moscow in June, Majkowski told PAP.
	   Russian Ambassador Leonid Drachevsky also said Yeltsin postponed
the visit due to his health problems, according to the PAP report.
	   Yeltsin, who was released from a hospital on Wednesday, has
practically disappeared from view after a string of illnesses.
	   His spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Yeltsin, 67, was expected
to stay at a country residence for long as necessary to recover
fully from pneumonia.
	   Despite his current inactivity, Yeltsin insists he is fit to run
the country and will serve out his term. But most Russians believe
he cannot maintain a normal working schedule.

China blames Tibet movement on `imperialist aggression'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed disappointment Thursday that
France's president ignored its appeal not to meet with the Dalai
Lama and blamed support for Tibetan independence on ``imperialist
aggression.''
	   The exiled Tibetan leader, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, had lunch
Tuesday in Paris with President Jacques Chirac and other Nobel
laureates to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
	   ``We expressed deep dissatisfaction and regret over that,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a press briefing.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region. China accuses him of agitating for
independence and objects to any official foreign contacts with him.
	   ``The Tibetan independence issue, fundamentally speaking, is a
product of imperialist aggression against China,'' Zhu said.
	   ``Some foreign anti-China forces are trying to exert pressure on
China on the Dalai Lama issue. The purpose is very clear.''
	   Zhu did not elaborate.
	   The Dalai Lama, speaking Wednesday in Paris, said conditions for
Tibetans were worsening under Chinese rule and indirect
communications with Beijing had failed to produce results.
	   ``It seems to be like a new Cultural Revolution is taking place
in Tibet,'' he said, referring to the 1966-76 upheaval in which
Chinese radicals destroyed thousands of Tibetan temples and
monasteries.

Four Bosnian Serbs plead innocent to murder, torture, rape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Four Bosnian Serbs pleaded
innocent Thursday to broadened U.N. charges that they murdered,
tortured and raped scores of Muslim prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal of atrocities at
the Omarska camp in northwest Bosnia.
	   The defendants were taken into custody earlier this year and
pleaded innocent. On Thursday, they entered pleas to a new
indictment joining their cases and altering some charges.
	   The new joint indictment charges them with a total of 36 war
crimes and crimes against humanity. Each charge carries a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment.
	   No date was set for their trial.
	   Kvocka, Kos and Radic, who allegedly held positions of power at
the Omarska camp, are accused of command responsibility for and
personal involvement in the murder and torture of Muslim inmates.
Radic also is accused of personally raping a prisoner.
	   Zigic allegedly visited Omarska and the nearby Keraterm camp to
kill and torture prisoners but held no official post.
	   Omarska and Keraterm were two of the most notorious camps set up
during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   Television pictures of emaciated inmates crowded behind
barbed-wire fences shocked the world and helped prompt the
international community to set up the U.N. tribunal in 1993.
	   ``Severe beatings, torture, killings, sexual assault and other
forms of physical and psychological abuse were commonplace at
Omarska and Keraterm,'' according to the indictment. Prosecutors
believe hundreds of prisoners were murdered there.
	   Kvocka was briefly commandant of Omarska, while Kos and Radic
were shift commanders, their indictment said.
	   Kvocka and Radic were arrested by NATO troops in Bosnia in
April. Kos was arrested in May, and Zigic turned himself in to
authorities in April.
	   While the charges in the new indictment are slightly different,
the horrific allegations remain the same: All four suspects are
accused of participating in ``the murder, torture, sexual assault,
beating, humiliation, psychological abuse and/or confinement in
inhumane conditions'' of non-Serbs in camps in and around the town
of Prijedor.

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's ruling executive committee
on Thursday opens a two-day meeting to finalize details of a
revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup.
	   Plans for the new competitions have been drawn up by the
European governing body to counter a breakaway Super League.
	   Europe's top soccer clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved by the executive committee.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would help boost annual revenues for
Europe's leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the top
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players opting into the League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European soccer competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
around three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot,
UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups would
advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second round before the
quarterfinal stage.
	   Third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering the competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it replaces.

In blow for Anwar, judge reverses ruling on impeaching witness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to update with fresh comment, end of key
witnesses testimony
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After defense lawyers lost the
chance Thursday to impeach a key witness, the man took the stand to
claim he not only had been sodomized by Anwar Ibrahim but by the
jailed politician's adopted brother, too.
	   The defense team suffered a major setback when High Court Judge
Augustine Paul reversed his decision to let them argue that Azizan
Abu Bakar was lying about being sodomized by the ousted deputy
prime minister.
	   Defense lawyers said there were glaring inconsistencies in the
witness' story. Paul had agreed Wednesday to adjourn the trial
temporarily for an impeachment hearing.
	   But when the trial resumed Thursday, he changed his mind.
	   ``It's meaningless to hold the proceedings to impeach,'' Paul
said upon opening the 24th day of the trial. ``I am afraid I will
have to reconsider the decision I have made.''
	   He then put Azizan back on the stand.
	   The former driver of Anwar's wife startled the court when he
said he had been sodomized by Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma
Dermawan, in 1992 in an apartment in a posh Kuala Lumpur
neighborhood.
	   ``I particularly cannot forget one incident,'' Azizan said,
winding up his testimony. He recounted how one night he had sex
with both Anwar and Sukma.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence after pleading guilty
to allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar. The other person in
jail after pleading guilty to having sex with Anwar is Munawar
Ahmad Anees, Anwar's speech writer.
	   Both men have since appealed their convictions. Munawar said he
was physically and mentally coerced by police into admitting he had
sex with Anwar when in fact he had not.
	   Azizan's sodomy accusations form the core of the 10 charges
against Anwar, who was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Sept. 2.
	   Azizan, who kept his alleged liaisons with Anwar secret until
1997, said he decided to break the silence after meeting with Ummi
Hafilda Ali, another witness who accuses Anwar of sleeping with her
sister-in-law.
	   ``I told her I am not surprised it is true that Anwar had an
affair with her sister-in-law,'' Azizan said. ``I told her he plays
even with guys.''
	   Anwar's family members, who attend the hearings each day,
groaned loudly and held their heads as Azizan mentioned Sukma,
prompting a bailiff to order silence in the court.
	   The defense objected to Azizan's testimony about Sukma.
	   When the judge overruled the objections, Christopher Fernando, a
senior defense attorney, demanded that the objections at least be
recorded.
	   ``You must have some faith and trust in me. I am sure you can
see my hand moving,'' Paul said. ``I am not drawing pictures.''
	   Defense attorneys requested that Azizan be impeached after he
appeared to contradict himself when he said during
cross-examination this week that he never had sex with Anwar.
	   But Thursday, Azizan testified he had misunderstood the defense
questioning.
	   ``The acts of sodomy continued to happen while I worked as a
driver for Anwar's wife between early 1992 and May 1992,'' he said.
	   Anwar's sacking in September and his subsequent arrest and
beating while in police custody have triggered anti-government
protests in this normally placid Southeast Asian capital.
	   He is being tried first on four counts of corruption. He will
face trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and
five for alleged illegal sex acts.

Kurd sets himself on fire outside French Embassy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Mohammed Mohammed in 3rd graf CQ. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Kurdish demonstrator suffered serious
burns when he doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire
Thursday during a protest outside the French Embassy.
	   The man, identified by fellow demonstrators as Jihad Ciko, 28,
was rushed to a hospital. Doctors said he was in critical condition
with second- and third-degree burns over most of his body.
	   A second Kurdish demonstrator, Mohammed Mohammed, 45, was
hospitalized with lighter burns he suffered trying to save Ciko.
	   The incident occurred as about 50 Kurds _ carrying red and gold
flags of the Kurdish Workers Party and beating drums _ gathered
outside the French Embassy to protest the detention of their
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in Italy.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome last month and is accused of crimes
in both Turkey and Germany.
	   He heads the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for the past
14 years.
	   The demonstration occurred outside the French Embassy because
the Kurds perceive France as favoring the Turkish demand for
Ocalan's extradition and trial on a capital charge.
	   It was the second Kurdish demonstration at the embassy this
week.
	   Italy refused to send Ocalan to Turkey because its constitution
forbids extradition to countries where the death penalty is in
force.
	   Germany decided not to press for his extradition for fear of
stirring unrest among the nation's Turkish population of two
million, about a fifth of whom are Kurds.
	   Earlier in the week the European Union endorsed a call by Italy
and Germany for a court in a neutral nation to try Ocalan.

Indonesia hopes to reach East Timor deal with Portugal by March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's foreign minister said
Thursday he hopes his government and Portugal can reach an
agreement on an autonomy plan for the troubled territory of East
Timor by next March.
	   However, he said there might be difficulties garnering wider
support for it.
	   Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master, had
originally hoped to conclude a new round of U.N.-sponsored talks on
the territory's future by the end if this year.
	   Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975, has offered to
grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange for an end to a separatist
guerrilla war and international recognition of its sovereignty.
	   Alatas said the talks, which are to resume in February, were
proceeding well, but more time was needed.
	   ``I hope that by March we may have a full agreement on what kind
of offer is on the table,'' he said.
	   Alatas said, however, that this would only be the first part of
negotiations.
	   ``We will then have to tackle the next and more difficult aspect
of the negotiations, namely: Will everybody accept our proposal
that this form of solution is the final solution?'' Alatas told a
news conference.
	   To date Indonesia has rejected demands from pro-independence
groups for a referendum on the future of the half-island territory
of 800,000 people.
	   Moves to reach a peaceful settlement on East Timor have gathered
pace since the resignation last May of Indonesia's former
president, Suharto, who ordered the invasion and tried to stamp out
the rebel movement.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ What has an Afghan's body, the heart
of a lion and eyes to fall in love with?
	   For Romanian dog lovers, this riddle's easy: It's the mioritic,
a fluffy, heavyset canine that has been part of Romanian dog lore
for centuries. Now, their push for international recognition for
the breed is finally getting some attention.
	   ``I believe that the Romanian mioritic is a charming, natural,
elegant, intelligent and charismatic dog,'' Dr. Jean Maurice
Pachoud of the Belgium-based International Canine Federation was
quoted by the newspaper Ziua as saying after coming to Bucharest to
check out the gentle off-white canine.
	   He said the mioritic deserves to be recognized by the
federation. That gives the dog a leg up on formal acceptance as a
breed when the federation holds it next international conference in
Mexico in 1999.
	   The dog, which looks something like a bulky Afghan with a lion's
head, stands up to 35 inches (89 cms) high, and weighs up to 198
pounds (90 kilos), comes originally from the Carpathian Mountains.
Its size and strength, along with a gentle disposition, has made it
the ideal sheep dog.
	   That gentleness is reflected in the eyes, which Razvan Petrisor,
deputy head of the Romanian Sheep Dogs National Club, describes as
``brown, rimmed with a thin black line, with curved eyelashes.''
	   Bravery is also one of the mioritic's traits.
	   A medieval chronicle from 1359 tells of a mioritic named Molda
who died while trying to protect her master, King Bogdan, from
being gored by a bull.
	   In the mid-1970s, newspapers published a story about a mioritic
who fought a bear to protect an injured shepherd and then ran nine
miles (13 kms) to the nearest village to bring help.
	   At that time, Romania was communist, and owning a dog _ at least
in the city _ was considered a ``bourgeois habit.'' Fighting back,
The Romanian Dog Association gave a mioritic puppy to dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu's son, Nicu.
	   Given Ceausescu's mania for all things Romanian, the ploy
worked. By the early 1980s, the mioritic was recognized as a unique
national breed.
	   Nowadays, the dog's price tag of dlrs 250 to dlrs 500 puts it
out of range for most Romanians, who earn an average of dlrs 120 a
month. But that doesn't stop the well-off from owning the
four-legged status symbol: President Emil Constantinescu's son,
Dragos, has a mioritic as does Agriculture Minister Ioan Muresan.

Newspaper editors resume hunger strike in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Seven newspaper editors resumed a hunger
strike Thursday to protest a government crackdown on the press.
	   The editors will be on hunger strike for several days, and will
then be replaced by other journalists, who will in turn be replaced
by a third group, the Turan news agency said.
	   The protesters say they will continue the protest until
government pressure on the free press ends, according to Turan. The
strike initially began Nov. 18, but was stopped for 10 days amid
attempts to resolve the dispute.
	   The journalists are protesting a spate of libel suits the
government has filed against reporters who have written articles
critical of President Geidar Aliev and his administration.
	   Damages sought by officials in the lawsuits is about dlrs 1
million, Turan reported. The sum is a staggering amount in a
country where average salaries rarely surpass the equivalent of $43
a month.
	   The strike also follows the trial of a Azerbaijani journalist
who was sentenced in November to 18 months in a maximum-security
prison for writing an opposition-minded article _ even though it
was never published because of a censor's intervention.

After rule changes, non-Latvians line up for citizenship

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ She speaks Latvian well enough to teach it.
But for years, Olga Polushkina, like thousands of other ethnic
Russians in this Baltic country, couldn't apply for citizenship.
	   With the easing of Latvia's widely criticized naturalization
laws, Polushkina and other ethnic Russians are now streaming to
submit applications.
	   ``I have long waited for this opportunity,'' said Polushkina,
57. ``As soon as it appeared, I decided to submit the
naturalization documents.''
	   The liberalized laws took effect Nov. 10 and within two weeks,
officials said, about 2,000 people applied to be Latvian citizens _
as many as had applied for the entire previous nine months.
	   With citizenship, they'll get practical advantages such as the
right to vote in national elections and will be eligible to hold
jobs _ ranging from airline pilots to judges _ from which they had
been shut out.
	   But just as important, they may get a sense of stability and
relief from the ethnic tensions that have troubled the country
since it became independent in 1991, when the Soviet Union fell
apart.
	   ``These people want to have a sense of belonging or a sense of
social status that maybe they feel they didn't have without
citizenship,'' said Nils Muznieks of the Latvian Center for Human
Rights and Ethnic Studies, one of the strongest critics of the old
laws.
	   ``More than anything else, citizenship gives them this sense of
psychological security,'' he said.
	   Latvia's ethnic tensions never exploded into violence, but the
country's treatment of ethnic Russians enraged the Kremlin. This
spring, Russia threatened trade sanctions over the issue, and
Latvians worried about aggression by their giant eastern neighbor.
	   Under Latvia's 50 years of Soviet rule, hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Russians moved in, so many that ethnic Latvians feared they
were about to become a minority in their own land. They bitterly
resented the Russians.
	   After independence, ethnic Latvians and those who could trace
their roots to pre-Soviet Latvia were granted citizenship. But the
Russians and other Slavic speakers who had moved in, and their
descendants, were not granted citizenship.
	   They could apply, but the old law's so-called windows system
meant that the older a person was, the longer he'd have to wait to
apply; some would have had to wait into the next century. The
system was seen by many as a clear attempt to punish those who had
been in the first wave of Stalin's drive to Russify Latvia.
	   Amendments that were narrowly approved in a referendum this fall
eliminate the windows system and grant citizenship to children born
of non-citizen parents after independence.
	   Because of the rule changes, around 20,000 ethnic Russians are
expected to become citizens each year, naturalization officials
estimate. That's in comparison with a total of just 10,000
naturalized citizens in the seven years after independence.
	   The new laws do not remove all the hurdles to citizenship.
Applicants must show proficiency in Latvian _ a tough task for many
who lived and worked in all-Russian communities and were not
educated in Latvian.
	   Muiznieks estimated that only 250,000 of 650,000 non-citizens
speak Latvian well enough to pass the test, and speculated many
won't even try to learn.
	   ``Some feel so alienated, they're saying, 'Forget it, you've
made the process so hard in the past, I don't want your darn
citizenship.'''
	   Many young ethnic Russian men also say they don't want
citizenship, because that would mean obligatory service in the
national army.
	   Naturalization Board head Eizenija Aldermane also noted that
some applicants could end up with long waits because the civil
service is capable of handling only about 20,000 applications a
year.
	   Mikhail Matveev, a 54-year-old electrician, said he wants to
avoid any delays for his daughter, so he lined up right away to
file her applications, and said he and his wife would follow suit
soon.
	   ``If a person lives in a state, he should be a citizen,'' he
said.

Anwar's wife forms new reform party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of sacked deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday announced the creation of a new
political party with herself as the chief.
	   But Azizah Ismail told reporters that the new party, the Social
Justice Movement, would not contest elections.
	   ``It will serve as a bond to unite all justice-loving Malaysians
against the arrogance and oppression of the powerful,'' Azizah said
at the launch in her home, timed to coincide with the World Human
Rights Day.
	   Flanking the woman, who had shown little interest in politics
before her husband was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
were prominent Malaysian lawyers, academics, women's rights
activists and even fringe religious leaders.
	   It was the boldest move she has made since her husband, also
sacked as finance minister, was arrested Sept. 2 after organizing
huge rallies that demanded Mahathir's resignation.
	   Police have threatened Azizah with jail if she took up the
leadership of the nascent movement for political reforms that her
husband began.
	   But Azizah, who gave up a successful practice as an eye surgeon,
wasted no time in indicating her priorities.
	   ``One of the immediate objectives of our reform movement would
be to check the present dangerous flight toward one-man rule,''
said Azizah, who will become president of the ADIL party as it will
be known in the local Malay language. Adil means justice in Malay.
	   Azizah held up the group's logo, a white ribbon tied in a bow
against a blue backdrop. The blue denoted clarity and transparency,
she said.
	   The group's vice president, Chandra Muzaffar, a well-known
professor of politics, said it would continue to hold peaceful
demonstrations and organize seminars in schools and universities.
	   The group will have to be registered under Malaysian rules
before it can hold meetings.
	   Chandra insisted that it was not the beginning of a new
political party to challenge the traditional supremacy of
Mahathir's United Malays National Organization.
	   Last week, Mahathir dared Anwar's supporters to form a party to
challenge him in the general election in 2000.
	   The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the
formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests
and promised not to hold demonstrations.
	   Pro-reform activists have gathered repeatedly in the capital
city of Kuala Lumpur in recent months to hold mostly peaceful
anti-government demonstrations. Police have cracked down with
hundreds of arrests and used tear gas and water cannons to disperse
the activists.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar alleging that he was too immoral to rule.
Anwar is currently on trial for abuse of office and illegal sex. He
has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
politically motivated.

China pledges better human rights as police suppress dissent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Foreign Ministry comment on
crackdown. Picks up 7th graf pvs, `President Jiang ...'

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect
the rights and freedoms of China's citizens Thursday while police
ransacked dissident homes in a widening clampdown on political
dissent.
	   Police in poor, overpopulated Sichuan province raided the homes
of at least six dissidents Wednesday, seized photos, writings and
pamphlets and detained some for questioning, New York-based Human
Rights in China reported.
	   Copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
U.N. rights treaties were believed to have been confiscated, the
group said. It added that Sichuan dissidents had planned to mark
the declaration's 50th anniversary Thursday by handing out copies
at schools, factories and mines.
	   One dissident questioned for six hours yesterday, Hu Mingjun,
was on a hunger strike to demand the release of a principal
organizer of a would-be opposition political party, Human Rights in
China said.
	   At least 29 dissidents have been detained or questioned since
China's Communist Party leaders moved last week to crush the China
Democracy Party. Its leading figures remain in jail and appear to
be headed for trial, one of them next week for subversion.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao denied there was any
contradiction between the crackdown and China's commemoration of
the human rights declaration.
	   The detainees are ``suspected of activities that undermine state
security,'' Zhu said at a press briefing. ``This has nothing to do
with efforts to promote human rights in China.''
	   President Jiang, who heads the Communist Party, did not mention
the crackdown in a letter sent to a Beijing meeting to commemorate
the Universal Declaration's anniversary. Instead the government-run
Xinhua News Agency quoted him as pledging to strengthen democracy
and the rule of law.
	   ``The Chinese people, together with the international community,
will make their own contribution to a just, equitable, peaceful and
prosperous world,'' Jiang was quoted as saying.
	   In keeping with the party's belief that economic rights
supersede individual political liberties, Jiang called the
communist revolution the ``most significant achievement'' in
improving human rights worldwide.
	   He noted that China has signed 17 international rights treaties,
including the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights
in October.
	   Dissidents in China were energized by the government's
announcement last spring that it planned to sign the covenant,
which supports freedom of assembly. Since the signing, however,
China has tightened rules on setting up groups.
	   While China took part in drafting a U.N. statement for the
Universal Declaration anniversary, ``in practice it continues to
repress advocates for human rights, democracy, labor rights and
religious freedoms,'' Human Rights in China said.
	   ``The Chinese government should recognize that oppression is not
the way. The Chinese people's struggle for democracy and their
rights and interests is the tide of history,'' the group said in a
statement.
	   Human Rights in China said Chinese activists have formed two new
groups: one by laid-off workers from a Beijing factory who are
demanding better compensation, the other by dissidents in southern
Hunan province seeking freedom for labor rights campaigner Zhang
Shanguang. He has been held without charge since July.

U.S. rapper Coolio won't appeal sentence, may write trial into next
</HEADLINE>
album &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ U.S. rap artist Coolio does not plan
to appeal his conviction last week for theft and punching a
boutique owner and may use impressions from the trial in his next
album, his attorney said Wednesday.
	   Georg Prasser said Coolio believed the Stuttgart court verdict
was unjust but preferred to accept it and to concentrate on his
music and a planned European tour.
	   A Stuttgart court last Thursday sentenced Coolio to six months
probation and fined him dlrs 17,000 after convicting him of being
an accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury.
	   The Grammy-award winning artist and members of his band, the 40
Thevz, took clothing worth dlrs 940 from a boutique in a Stuttgart
suburb on Nov. 20, 1997, and punched the owner in the stomach, the
court ruled.
	   Coolio, 35, said the incident was a misunderstanding. He says he
signed autographs in the boutique, and that in exchange a clothing
company had promised him and his group free outfits.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., won a Grammy for
best rap solo in 1996 for ``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was
featured in the film ``Dangerous Minds.'' He is scheduled to tour
Germany in January.

Congo adamant in not meeting rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to clarify that Kabila arrived in Nairobi Wednesday
and spoke with Moi Thursday; no pickup &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Congolese government Thursday remained
adamant that it would not meet with rebels backed by Rwanda and
Uganda, dashing prospects for a cease-fire in the four-month
conflict any time soon.
	   President Laurent Kabila, who arrived unannounced in Nairobi
Wednesday, met for more than an hour Thursday morning with his
Kenyan counterpart, Daniel arap Moi, on the way home from a meeting
with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Kabila refused to speak with reporters, but his ambassador to
Kenya, Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza, said at the airport before Kabila
departed that Kinshasa would not sign a cease-fire until Rwanda and
Uganda set a date for the withdrawal of their troops from
neighboring Congo.
	   Both countries have been backing the rebellion with troops and
equipment, claiming that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels to establish bases in eastern Congo from which to attack
their countries.
	   Both countries insist they will remain in Congo until measures
are taken to secure their borders.
	   International efforts to reach a cease-fire have foundered on
Kabila's refusal to meet with or even acknowledge the rebels.
	   After a cease-fire was apparently agreed upon at a
Franco-African summit in Paris late last month, the warring parties
were to meet next week in Lusaka, Zambia, to sign it.
	   It was also agreed that a multinational force would be necessary
to keep the peace and maintain security along the Rwandan and
Ugandan borders in eastern Congo.
	   But Ambassador Mwanza said Congo would only attend a Lusaka
meeting under two conditions.
	   ``The first point is that there are no rebels. If the rebels are
brought to the same table, we will leave the conference,'' he said.
	   ``The second point is that we are in accordance with signing the
cease-fire on the condition that the invading forces leave our
territory.''
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and
equipment to bolster Kabila's forces and to stage a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
	   Kabila claims the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Congolese
Tutsis and disaffected military officers and Congolese politicians
and academics _ are a creation of Rwanda and Uganda, which both
helped him obtain power after toppling longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   ``It is true that President Kabila was aided by Rwanda and
Uganda, but that does not mean he sold the country to Rwanda and
Uganda,'' Mwanza said.
	   He added that once a cease-fire was signed the Congolese
government would accept the deployment of a multinational force.
	   He said Chiluba had yet to issue invitations to the Lusaka
summit, raising doubts the meeting scheduled for Dec. 14 would take
place.

Arafat says he may not live to see the new millennium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare moment of openness about his health,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told visitors he may not live to
see the peace process through.
	   Arafat, who suffers from an uncontrollable trembling of the
hands and lower lip, was asked by members of a Washington think
tank how he envisioned his Palestinian Authority in 20 years. He
answered that ``I don't know if I'll live one year or two years.''
	   The exchange between Arafat and members of the Washington
Institute of Near East Policy was reported by the Israeli daily
Haaretz on Thursday. The meeting took place at Arafat's office in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat, 68, has denied persistent reports that his health is
failing and that he is suffering from Parkinson's disease.
	   However, in recent months he has looked tired and pale in public
appearances.
	   Arafat's neurologist, Ashraf Kurdi, said last year that Arafat
suffers from bouts of depression, but does not have Parkinson's, a
degenerative disease that affects motor function
	   Kurdi confirmed that after a 1992 plane crash in the Libyan
desert, Arafat bled internally and suffered from cognitive
disorders. After tests and draining of the accumulated blood,
Arafat returned to normal, Kurdi said.
	   Israel and the Palestinians still have a long way to go before
reaching a permanent peace accord. The five-year period of
Palestinian autonomy ends in May 1999, but it is unlikely the final
peace agreement will be in place by then. Arafat has not designated
a successor.

Small explosion injures four and threatens Basque truce calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with top government official in Basque Country noting
outbreak of ``lightweight terrorism,'' CORRECTS day in 7th graf to
Thursday sted Wednesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Five people received minor injuries from
a small explosion early Thursday, in the first incident threatening
the calm of this northern city since the armed Basque separatist
group ETA declared an unlimited cease-fire in September.
	   The explosion at the home of a Spanish civil guard at 4 a.m.
(0300gmt), was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline, Interior
Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   Five people, not identified by name, required medical attention
including the wife of the targeted civil guard who received burns
to the face and hands.
	   Four neighbors were also taken to hospital after inhaling fumes
from the explosion that damaged doors and broke windows at the
house, Dors said.
	   ``This is the first time something like this has happened here
since the cease-fire,'' Dors said, referring to the truce observed
by ETA since Sept. 18.
	   ETA's cease-fire triggered talk of possible peace negotiations
with the government aimed at putting a definitive end to the
violence that has surrounding the issue of Basque separatist
aspirations for 30 years.
	   The spokeswoman said it was not known who was behind Wednesday's
explosion, but that the only people with a tradition of similar
attacks in the city were young supporters of ETA.
	   ETA includes Pamplona, and the province of Pamplona, in its
vision of an independent Basque state, despite the fact that they
are located south of the current definition of the Basque province.
	   A top government official in the Basque province Enrique Villar
said the latest explosion was evidence of ``a breakout of
lightweight terrorism,'' and called for continued vigilance against
the possibility that ETA's cease-fire will not hold.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its violent
campaign for an independent state straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   In recent years bombing and shooting attacks carried out by ETA
have been accompanied by low-intensity pressure from the group's
supporters against such targets as Spanish civil guards who are
believed to represent an occupying force in the Basque homeland.
	   This kind of violence virtually disappeared with the cease-fire
declaration.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned back when
it tried to enter the office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later Wednesday, however, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer
Mohammed Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi
escorts were mistaken in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed
to suggest the team should not have been barred.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's action Wednesday,
saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and
they blocked us.''
	   The United States, which had threatened military action during
two previous standoffs between Iraq and U.N. inspectors this year,
was cautious.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, said Wednesday. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   In Britain, which also has threatened military action, a Foreign
Office spokesman said Thursday that ``all problems over inspection
are a serious concern.''
	   He added: ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its
response so far is not, in our view, consistent with full
cooperation.'' The spokesman spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Baath Party office in contention is in a two-story stucco
building behind black gates. There are no signs outside indicating
it is an office of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but
there is an emblem of the party over the door.
	   Jassim _ a former information minister who is the Baath Party
chief in Baghdad _ insisted that the office was private property
and that it was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said
the party works on political matters and not anything related to
the inspectors's goal _ weaponry.

Singapore Airlines coy on Ansett equity interest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The head of Singapore Airlines
remained coy Thursday about the airline taking an equity interest
in Ansett Australia.
	   Speaking at an Asialink seminar here, Singapore Airlines chief
executive Cheong Choong Kong was enthusiastic about Ansett's future
but would not comment directly on any potential equity interest for
Singapore.
	   ``There is no doubt that Ansett is a quality airline with a
strong brand, excellent management and considerable potential. We
believe Ansett has a great future,'' Cheong told the seminar.
	   ``You must forgive me if I opt to adhere to our company policy
of not commenting ... of course -- and here it can be duly reported
that I'm speaking
	   with a smile -- you can consider the enthusiasm I've been
displaying over Ansett, and draw your own conclusions.''
	   Earlier this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission approved a five year, trilateral relationship between
Ansett, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines.
	   In September, Ansett chief executive Rod Eddington said he
thought Singapore becoming an equity partner would be a ``terrific
idea.''
	   Cheong said that expansion remained part of Singapore's
strategy.
	   ``In the longer term, we aim to grow globally into an
international group of airline and airline-related companies,'' he
said.
	   ``As part of our globalization strategy, we are extending our
route network, not only through flying to more destinations
ourselves, but also through code-sharing with suitable alliance
partners.''
	   Cheong also said that Singapore Airlines was finding the going
hard in
	   the midst of the Asian downturn but, unlike many other regional
airlines, had remained in the black.
	   Singapore Airlines has deferred the delivery of 11 aircraft
because it did not need the additional capacity.

Lake meets with Sudanese dissidents in Asmara
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The U.S. special envoy to the Horn of
Africa met with Sudanese rebels and dissidents during his six-day
mission in the region to deal with the Ethiopian-Eritrean border
conflict stay, according to a rebel spokesman.
	   In an inteview Wednesday with The Associated Press, Yasir Arman,
spokesman in Eritrea for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, said
Anthony Lake met Monday with representatives of the National
Democratic Alliance in the Eritrean capital.
	   The alliance is an umbrella group of Sudanese opposition groups
from the north and the south and includes the SPLA.
	   Lake was on his third mission to the Horn since the border
conflict broke out in May. There was no indication whether he made
any progress this time around.
	   Last year, the United States gave non-lethal military aid in the
form of communications equipment and boots to both Eritrea and
Ethiopia as part of a policy of containment against the National
Islamic Front government in Sudan. It was not clear whether the
equipment was intended for the dissidents.
	   Arman said Sudanese government forces had been attacking several
points in eastern Sudan recently, forcing people to flee to
Eritrea.
	   The SPLA has been fighting Sudanese government forces since 1983
in an effort to secure autonomy for southern Sudan.

 &UR; Senior U.S. admiral inaugurates NATO mission in Macedonia
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - A senior U.S. admiral arrived in
Macedonia on Thursday to officially open a command center for
NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international monitors in
neighboring Kosovo.
	   Before heading for Kumanovo, the Macedonian border town where
the center is located, Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief
of NATO's Allied Forces Southern Europe, said the French-led force
which is being assembled ``is well-equipped, well-trained, well-led
and fully capable to carry out this mission.''
	   ``This extraction force represents the last option'' if the
safety of some 2,000 unarmed international observers in the Serbian
province of Kosovo is jeopardized, Ellis told reporters.
	   He, however, said that the safety of the Kosovo verifiers is
``the full responsibility of the Federal Yugoslav government.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reluctantly agreed to
accept the verifiers after he signed a U.S.-sponsored cease-fire
agreement on Kosovo on Oct. 12.
	   Yugoslavia has bitterly opposed the deployment of some 1,800
NATO quick reaction troops in Macedonia, saying they jeopardized
the country's safety. Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav
republic which seceded without bloodshed from the six-republic
federation in 1991.
	   ``The forces are here only as a reaction to the concern of all
the NATO countries which contributed members ... to ensure the
safety of unarmed men and women'' verifiers in Kosovo, Ellis said.
	   After meeting new Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski,
Ellis said ``I have assured the prime minister of our continued
commitment for the continuation of very warm and positive
relationship that we have established with this country.''
	   Georgievski said earlier that Macedonia agreed to accept the
NATO troops from France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and the
Netherlands because it hopes to become a full-fledged member of the
Western military alliance.

Bargain-hunting lifts Philippine stocks; index up 2.9 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower against dollar

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rebounded Thursday
as bargain hunters swooped down on oversold issues, propelling the
market to a strong finish, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 52.89 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 1,822.23, more than enough to cover its 2.6
percent loss Wednesday.
	   ``The market is basically following technicals right now rather
than fundamentals owing to a lack of news to perk up buying
activity,'' said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of
Abacus Securities Corp.
	   The market's recovery buoyed a number of blue-chip stocks.
	   A large block sale of Philippine Commercial International Bank
shares boosted its stock price by 2.3 percent. The shares were
bought by Benpres Holdings, raising its stake to 30 percent from
17.7 percent.
	   Siao said investors were just waiting for a surge in buying
activity before re-entering the market.
	   ``The outlook, both economic and corporate, is improving
compared to earlier apprehensions, but investors don't want to be
chasing up stock prices,'' he said.
	   The cue to resume purchasing stocks came when the main index hit
1,759 points at mid-session, convincing market players that most
stock prices have reached oversold levels, he added.
	   The rally raised hopes Manila shares may still end the year on a
positive note, traders said. Traditionally, the market posts strong
gains in the last weeks of December as traders square off their
books before ending the year.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed lower against the U.S.
dollar after a relatively large order for dollars in afternoon
trading triggered wider demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 38.724 pesos for the day, up from 38.682
pesos on Wednesday. It reached a high of 38.890 pesos and closed at
38.870 pesos.
	   Early trading was marked by a stronger peso, buoyed by gains in
the yen. However, a surprise order for dollars placed by one bank
at around 38.70 pesos triggered demand for the U.S. currency from
other institutions, with the raised offer rates for the dollar
pressuring the peso.

Homeless man briefly a suspect in slaying of British schoolgirl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with man released after DNA tests negative

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police in this southern port said
Thursday that DNA testing of a suspect failed to link him to the
1996 slaying of a British schoolgirl in a Brittany youth hostel.
	   The homeless man, arrested Wednesday, had fit the sketch of a
suspect, with thick eyebrows and stocky build, the authorities said
on customary anonymity.
	   But DNA testing of the man proved negative, yet another false
lead in a drawn-out and highly publicized investigation into the
death of 13-year-old Caroline Dickinson.
	   The homeless man's arrest was the top story in much of the
French media early Thursday.
	   Prosecutor Robert Baffert, from the Brittany city of Rennes,
confirmed the test results and criticized the ``excessive publicity
of the Caroline Dickinson affair.''
	   The homeless man had spent time in the Brittany city of Rennes
during his wanderings across France, which along with the police
sketch raised suspicions, authorities said.
	   The investigation prompted a widespread search in France and
Britain, including genetic testing of the male residents in Pleine
Fougeres, the Brittany town where she was killed.
	   After a long dry spell of evidence, French investigators
re-intensified their search since October, when a student in the
eastern city of Nancy said a police sketch of the suspect resembled
the man who raped her in 1993.
	   Dickinson was raped and then strangled in a youth hostel in
Pleine Fougeres while on a five-day trip with 39 other youngsters
and five adults from her school.

German town to defuse World War II bombs, 10,000 people evacuated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ About 10,000 residents of the north
German town of Oranienburg were evacuated Thursday as experts
prepared to defuse two 1,000-kilo (2,400-pound) bombs from World
War II.
	   The bombs were unearthed in the center of Oranienburg, a town
just north of Berlin. Two main roads into the town and the central
rail station were closed.
	   More than 60 bombs have been found and removed over the last
seven years in Oranienburg, which was heavily bombed by the Allies
because of its weapons industries and role as a transportation
crossroads.

Relatives of missing Serbs stage march in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Several hundred Serbs staged a
protest march to a rebel stronghold in southwestern Kosovo on
Thursday, calling attention to the disappearance of Serbs during
the conflict in the tense province.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began the 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   The organizer, Andeljko Kolasinac, said about half the mostly
elderly crowd would attempt to walk the entire route of the ``march
of peace.''
	   ``This peaceful protest is only a symbol of solidarity for the
families of missing people,'' he said at the former rebel
stronghold of Pojate after the group had walked for some two hours.
``We want to tell the public what consequences terrorism had here,
and the tragedy of Orahovac.''
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The rebels have released some of their hostages following
mediation by international officials. But they claimed this week to
be no longer holding any, raising fears that many were killed.
	   One elderly woman on the march was supported by her two
daughters, crying as she lamented: ``My life isn't worth anytyhing
without my son.''
	   A man whose two cousins have been missing for six months came
from a village near the town of Suva Reka to join the walk.
	   ``I came to protest because they are innocent,'' he said. ``Let
foreign countries see that we are for peace.''

category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday. ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim,
a member of the party's leadership, said during a news conference
at the office in Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood. ``You will not
find inside this office any materials related to what they are
looking for,'' he said. On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors
was turned back when it tried to enter the office. The inspectors
left after an Iraqi official demanded they first provide a written
declaration ``on the material and items'' they sought, the official
Iraqi News Agency said. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's
action Wednesday, saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice
inspection and they blocked us.'' (IRAQ-UN)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With Republican lawmakers poised to send a
resolution impeaching President Bill Clinton to the House of
Representatives, the president is scrambling for the support of
moderate Republicans to prevent the measure from passing. Before a
historic session of the House that is likely next week, the
Republican-led Judiciary Committee must consider four proposed
articles of impeachment. The articles will be dissected and
possibly revised before the panel votes later this week.
Investigators from both parties on Thursday were to give the
committee's 21 Republicans and 17 Democrats their conclusions based
on reviews of the evidence. Making use of the same testimony, FBI
interviews and depositions, Democratic investigator Abbe Lowell is
expected to find no impeachable offenses. His counterpart,
Republican investigator David Schippers, is likely to conclude
there was impeachable conduct. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a Finnish
forensics team Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of
Kosovo massacre victims in a dispute over Serb access to
rebel-controlled territory. The Finnish team leader accused the
Serb side of obstruction. The scheduled start of digging on the
makeshift graves of as many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was
to have marked a breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities
in the war-torn Serbian province. Serb police, who did not comment,
reportedly insisted on accompanying the team. But the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which controls the area virtually unchallenged
during the current truce, said the police were unwelcome.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he has ordered
the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a ``firm
hand.'' He added that he would not go ahead with a West Bank troop
pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement, unless
Arafat met a list of demands. The West Bank has been swept by
stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of
Palestinians marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a
17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army
gunfire a day earlier. The violence raised concern that U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to the region, which is to start
late Saturday, is fomenting more unrest rather than calming the
already tense situation. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ People around the world celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations human rights charter on Thursday
urged more efforts to end still rampant abuses. ``We've left a
question mark after the word `happy' in `happy anniversary,''' said
Hideki Morihara of Amnesty International in Japan. ``Even now,
there is no end to the violation of human rights in the world.''
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most comprehensive
and widely recognized international standard for the protection of
human rights. The U.N. General Assembly has scheduled a special
session to mark the anniversary. But throughout Asia and other
regions, there were reminders of the many who continue to be denied
basic freedoms and rights. Thousands of student protesters marched
to the U.N. building in Indonesia's capital, demanding greater
democracy and human rights as well as the prosecution of
ex-President Suharto on corruption charges. (HUMAN RIGHTS ROUNDUP,

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Thursday
on hopes of further interest rates cuts, though the absence of
fresh buying incentives kept volume thin. In Seoul, blue chips
soared 7.8 percent on lower local interest rates and increased
foreign buying. The benchmark KOSPI index rose 41.09 points to
close at 567.61. In Singapore, an interest rate cut and hopes of
more to come sent the benchmark STI index up 1.1 percent, or 15.29
points, to close at 1,439.88. Shares in Tokyo, the region's biggest
market, fell as traders stayed away ahead of Friday's settlement of
December futures and options contracts, when prices could swing
unpredictably. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped
124.10 points, or 0.83 percent, to close at 14,807.80. In the
currency market, the U.S. dollar briefly fell to a five-week low of
116.65 Japanese yen amid confusion about comments from Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The dollar bought 117.72 yen by
mid-afternoon, still down 1.06 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and
below its late New York level of 117.82 yen overnight. (ASIAN

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Cabinet approved a draft of the 1999
budget Thursday, giving the green light for a document that calls
for printing more money and factors in foreign loans that may not
materialize. The budget, which was approved with unspecified
amendments, will now go before the lower house of Russia's
parliament, the State Duma, said Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has voiced hopes for a
quick approval of the trimmed-down budget because his Cabinet
enjoys broad support in the Duma. ``The budget's advantage is that
is very austere,'' Primakov said at a Cabinet meeting where leaders
hashed out the draft. ``And, the essential thing is that it is
honest. We didn't include spending that can't be covered by
revenues.'' But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that
the budget includes dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans the
government hopes to receive, but can't count on. The International
Monetary Fund and other lenders froze a dlrs 22.6 billion loan
package after Russia defaulted on some of its debts and devalued
the ruble in mid-August. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ For years it blazed a trail
through Africa's bloody conflicts, earning a reputation for
supplying the continent's most efficient guns for hire. But now
Executive Outcomes, the South African private military company, is
closing, bringing an end to almost a decade of controversial
involvement in other people's wars. Defending the firm to the last,
director Nico Palm on Thursday denied EO was a mercenary outfit. He
said he was proud of its record in helping end civil wars in Angola
and Sierra Leone. In a brief announcement on Wednesday the
Pretoria-based firm said it would wind up its business by Jan. 1,
since most African governments ``have endeavored to secure and
maintain law and order.'' But analysts say the opportunities for
private security companies have never been greater with wars raging
across Africa from the Congo to Sudan. Some security analysts say
EO was motivated by strict anti-mercenary laws passed in South
Africa earlier this year. The laws ban South African firms from
participating in mercenary operations, allowing the state to
confiscate the assets of guilty companies. (SOUTH

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Federal Court found
Thursday that investment house Nomura International Plc.
manipulated the Australian stock market by creating a ``false and
misleading appearance'' of active trading in a series of trades in
March 1996. On the day in question, the Japanese investment giant
unloaded 587 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 364 million)
worth of securities, selling in large parcels in the last few
minutes of trading and allowing some 12,900 futures contracts to
expire. Justice Ronald Sackville upheld allegations by the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission that Nomura knew
its actions would cause a fall in both the benchmark All Ordinaries
Index, the nation's basic stock market indicator, and the March
share price index (SPI). (AUSTRALIA-NOMURA)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
and the central bank have approved the planned launch of up to dlrs
2 billion worth of U.S. dollar, euro and yen bonds, a finance
official said Thursday. The bond offering, being launched by the
Department of Finance, requires the approval of both the president
and the central bank's policy-making council, the Monetary Board.
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu has said the bond offerings
consist of dlrs 500 million in U.S. dollar-denominated global
bonds, dlrs 500 million worth of euro-denominated bonds and between
dlrs 500 million and dlrs 1 billion of yen-denominated bonds. The
proceeds of the bond offerings will be used to stimulate economic
growth by increasing spending for critical projects such as
infrastructure and agricultural programs. The government wants the
bonds to have a maturity of between seven and 10 years.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons
sites in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling
Baath Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party
official said Thursday.
	   ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the
party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office in
Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood.
	   ``You will not find inside this office any materials related to
what they are looking for,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned back when
it tried to enter the office.
	   The inspectors left after an Iraqi official demanded they first
provide a written declaration ``on the material and items'' they
sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later, however, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were mistaken in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to
suggest the team should not have been barred.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's action Wednesday,
saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and
they blocked us.''
	   The United States, which had threatened military action during
two previous standoffs between Iraq and U.N. inspectors this year,
was cautious.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, said Wednesday. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   In Britain, which also has threatened military action, a Foreign
Office spokesman said Thursday that ``all problems over inspection
are a serious concern.''
	   He added: ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its
response so far is not, in our view, consistent with full
cooperation.'' The spokesman spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Baath office is in a two-story stucco building behind black
gates. There are no signs outside indicating it is an office of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's party, but there is an emblem of
the party over the door.
	   Jassim _ a former information minister who is the Baath Party
chief in Baghdad _ insisted that the office was private property
and that it was his decision whether anyone could enter. He said
the party works on political matters and not anything related to
the inspectors's goal _ weaponry.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' he said.
	   Jassim said the inspectors' attempt to search the site was
``unprecedented.''
	   Asked if inspectors would be barred again, he said: ``Yes it
will be forbidden because there is no justification. Nor will you
find by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's statements came just hours after a full contingent of
inspectors on Thursday resumed searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraqi
officials have long insisted they have eliminated all illegal
weapons.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Consul General Kay Anske took up her
post in Kenya Thursday, four months after her predecessor and his
son were killed in the Aug. 7 blast at the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``This is a very important day for me today because I have the
great pleasure of also seeing all kinds of visa applicants today
which shows that U.S embassy is back in business to servicing
American citizens and Kenyan citizens,'' U.S. Ambassador Prudence
Bushnell said in a brief introduction ceremony.
	   Bushnell said Anske, a career foreign service officer from San
Antonio, Texas, came to Nairobi from Guatemala where she had been
working since 1996 in the same capacity.
	   ``Consular services are among the most important functions of an
American mission overseas,'' said Bushnell, ``It not only takes
care of American taxpayers who, after all, are our bosses, but it
had been the place that serves as the bridge between any country
and the United States,'' she said.
	   A car bomb exploded outside the embassy building in the heart of
downtown Nairobi, killing 213 people, among them 12 Americans,
including Consul General Julian Bartley and his son, Jay.
	   The U.S consular section resumed service last month in a former
embassy residence in a residential neighborhood in Nairobi. The
embassy proper will be moved to the city's outskirts until a new
embassy is built.
	   A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam
in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all of them Africans.

Palestinians convene to scrap calls for Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat quote, several dozen Palestinians throwing
stones after West Bank funeral, participation in council session
now at 105, sted 98 &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he
has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a
``firm hand,'' and said he would not go ahead with a West Bank
troop pullback he promised under the Wye River peace agreement
unless Arafat met a list of demands.
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to the region, which starts late Saturday, is
fomenting unrest rather than calming the already tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.
	   The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his
address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City.
	   Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this
session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.
	   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the
Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less
than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success
without it. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with
its future,'' Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he
would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue.
	   Arafat said the procedure during the PNC session was an internal
Palestinian matter. ``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he
said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five
percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his
decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally
declare a state in May.
	   The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse
after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a
very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the
accord. On Thursday, 105 of the 124 members of Palestinian Central
Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on
whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
	   The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session,
and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63
members is required, and a vote was expected by Thursday evening.
	   The council has not met for years and was revived specifically
for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members of the
Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,
among others.

Syria opposes any attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria opposes attempts by the United
States and Britain to overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam said Thursday.
	   Such moves would ``serve Israel's design to disintegrate the
Arab and Islamic world,'' Khaddam said after receiving his Iranian
counterpart, Hassan Habibi, at Damascus airport.
	   The United States has granted dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
opposition groups. British and American officials hosted meetings
in London last month of 16 Iraqi dissident groups in a bid to
promote cooperation among them.
	   ``This is a very dangerous issue ... No state in the world has
the right to interfere in the internal affairs of any other
country,'' Khaddam said.
	   Habibi said the Iraqi and Palestinian questions were of great
concern to Iran and Syria: ``There should be coordination between
the two countries over these issues.''
	   The official Iranian news agency, IRMA, said the Iraqi and
Palestinian issues would be the focus of talks between Habibi and
Khaddam at the meeting of the Syrian-Iranian Supreme Committee. The
committee meets biannually to promote cooperation in foreign
affairs, trade and technology.
	   Habibi, who is accompanied by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, is expected to meet Syrian President Hafez Assad during
his three-day visit.
	   Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian
state during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Badly stung in elections, Taiwan's main
opposition party now finds itself facing a power vacuum following
the resignation of its chairman, officials said Thursday.
	   Lin Yi-hsiung turned down pleas that he stay on for the time
being, telling the Democratic Progressive Party's central standing
committee on Wednesday he would quit his post to take
responsibility for big defeats the DPP suffered at the polls on
Saturday.
	   Lin immediately left the capital for ``meditation,'' his
secretary said Thursday.
	   His departure leaves the DPP rudderless at a time when
politicians are setting up a new legislative leadership and also
making initial preparations for next year's primary elections ahead
of the 2000 presidential and vice presidential races.
	   Lin resigned following the DPP's loss of Taipei's mayorship to
the governing Nationalist Party and winning only 70 seats in the
225-seat national Legislature.
	   Lin was urged to stay on by major party figures, including two
former chairmen and defeated Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's
top politician. The past two chairmen have both resigned following
electoral defeats, and newspapers speculated Lin may have felt
pressured into abiding by that established practice.
	   Most speculation about Lin's successor has focused on Chen, who
retains huge influence in the party but has not yet announced any
future plans. Chen might be less inclined to run for chairman if he
decides to launch a presidential bid, as many supporters are
urging, party officials said.
	   Yu Shyi-kun, a popular former county executive, has been
mentioned as a possible candidate for chairman, as has Annette Lu,
head of Taoyuan county, who is known to have national ambitions.
	   Whoever goes for the job, it won't be possible for the DPP to
name an immediate replacement.
	   Because the party permits its more than 152,000 members to elect
the chairman by direct vote, it may be more than six weeks before a
new leader is installed. In the meantime, an interim chairman will
be appointed by the 11-member central standing committee.
	   The disappointing election results also led to the resignation
of the party's secretary-general, Chiu Yi-jen, a key strategist.
	   A new chairman faces the challenge of restoring morale at party
headquarters, where the mood is ``very low,'' said Hsiao Bi-khim,
who was director of the party's Department of International Affairs
but had to hand in her resignation along with other staffers when
Lin quit.
	   Chen's loss in Taipei, by a 5-percent margin, shocked
supporters, who blamed huge campaign spending by the Nationalists,
whose candidate Ma Ying-jeou won the race. The DPP also lashed out
at what they called a smear campaign launched against Chen.
	   But observers said Chen's decision to cast the election as a
contest between majority native Taiwanese _ a group that includes
Chen _ and Chinese emigrants represented by his Nationalist
opponent may have stirred a backlash among voters.
	   Other commentators interpreted the vote as a rejection of the
DPP's platform of formal and permanent independence from China, a
move Beijing says it would meet with military force.
	   Though DPP leaders have refined that position, saying they have
no plans to hold a plebiscite to press the issue in the near
future, voters appeared to have endorsed the Nationalists' stance
of maintaining the status quo of de-facto independence without
provoking China.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said Thursday that accepting the Nobel Peace Prize doesn't
mean their efforts to end 30 years of sectarian violence in the
British province have ended.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said the prize was for an
incomplete peace.	   The peace accord reached in April has yet to be implemented,
with Trimble insisting he won't let Irish Republican Army
supporters into a new government for Northern Ireland unless the
IRA starts to disarm.
	   ``We have a peace in Ireland. But it is still something of an
armed peace,'' Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, said according to a
text of his remarks released in advance.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished. But the paramilitaries
are finished. But the politics are not finished,'' Trimble's text
said. He vowed to see the accord implemented.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome,'' his advance text said.
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that lead to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that later
fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted, according to a
copy of his planned speech. But, he said, there could be no turning
back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accept their awards, which include a
gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   About 4,000 Norwegian school children, signing songs and
carrying the flags of many nations, gathered outside of the city
hall in a peace parade, with Hume and Trimble stopping to light
their peace torch before the ceremony.
	   The ceremony was being held against a backdrop of rising crisis
in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA, nearly 17 months into a
truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its secret
stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   In his speech Trimble emphasized why a symbolic start to
disarmament was so important now to Protestants. Trimble's
long-postponed demand has often been criticized by Hume's SDLP as
pointless, since the IRA could always smuggle in new weaponry, and
counterproductive since it put the IRA truce under unnecessary
pressure.
	   Noting he had never asked for specific amounts of weaponry on
specific dates, Trimble said in his advance text: ``All I have
asked for is a credible beginning. All I have asked for is that
they say the `war' is over. And that is proved by such a beginning.
	   ``That is not too much to ask for,'' Trimble said, taking aim at
Hume's position. ``Nor is it too much to ask that the reformist
party of Irish nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.''
	   Turning to the IRA's allied political party, he said: ``Any
further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein
are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking
from the dark stream of fascism.''
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,,'' said
Hume's text. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in Ireland in the
pursuit of political goals,'' Hume's text said. ``The challenge
now, is to grasp and shape history.''
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and the others in Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women weightlifters extended
their world record-breaking streak to four consecutive days
Thursday as Lei Li won the 63-kilogram division at the Asian Games.
	   Lei broke records for both the snatch and total lift as she
finished 2.5 kilograms ahead of India's Malleswari Karnam.
	   Her 107.5 in the snatch broke the record of 103 set by
compatriot Xiong Meiyin in September, and her 232.5 total beat the
mark of 230 set by China's Diao Weiwei in April.
	   Karnam's total was 230, matching the old record, after she
lifted 2.5 kilograms less than Lei in the snatch.
	   Taiwan's Chen Jui-lien won the bronze with 222.5.
	   Lei and Karnam both failed in efforts to jerk 132.5 kilograms,
four above the world record. They tied at 125.
	   ``I was relieved to see Karma failing to hoist 132.5 kilograms
because I knew that I would not be able to lift that much as I have
lost weight to compete in this category,'' Lei said through an
interpreter.
	   Bhatia Balbir Singh, an Indian Olympic Committee official, said,
``If Karma could lift 132.5 kilograms, she would have been the
winner. But she had done her best. Take a look at her points, the
same as old world records. We are so happy for her and our
nation.''
	   Chinese women also set world records on the previous three days
of weightlifting. On Wednesday, a North Korean woman and South
Korean man joined in the record-breaking blitz.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said Thursday that accepting the Nobel Peace Prize doesn't
mean their efforts to end 30 years of sectarian violence in the
British province have ended.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said the prize was for an
incomplete peace.	   The peace accord reached in April has yet to be implemented,
with Trimble insisting he won't let Irish Republican Army
supporters into a new government for Northern Ireland unless the
IRA starts to disarm.
	   ``We have a peace in Ireland. But it is still something of an
armed peace,'' Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, said according to a
text of his remarks released in advance.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished. But the paramilitaries
are finished. But the politics are not finished,'' Trimble's text
said. He vowed to see the accord implemented.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome,'' his advance text said.
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that lead to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that later
fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted, according to a
copy of his planned speech. But, he said, there could be no turning
back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accept their awards, which include a
gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   About 4,000 Norwegian school children, signing songs and
carrying the flags of many nations, gathered outside of the city
hall in a peace parade, with Hume and Trimble stopping to light
their peace torch before the ceremony.
	   The ceremony was being held against a backdrop of rising crisis
in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA, nearly 17 months into a
truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its secret
stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   In his speech Trimble emphasized why a symbolic start to
disarmament was so important now to Protestants. Trimble's
long-postponed demand has often been criticized by Hume's SDLP as
pointless, since the IRA could always smuggle in new weaponry, and
counterproductive since it put the IRA truce under unnecessary
pressure.
	   Noting he had never asked for specific amounts of weaponry on
specific dates, Trimble said in his advance text: ``All I have
asked for is a credible beginning. All I have asked for is that
they say the `war' is over. And that is proved by such a beginning.
	   ``That is not too much to ask for,'' Trimble said, taking aim at
Hume's position. ``Nor is it too much to ask that the reformist
party of Irish nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.''
	   Turning to the IRA's allied political party, he said: ``Any
further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein
are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking
from the dark stream of fascism.''
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,,'' said
Hume's text. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in Ireland in the

	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and the others in Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer
easily dominated the women's Super-G field Thursday, to collect her
third World Cup win of the season.
	   Under clear, sunny skies, the 25-year-old Austrian blitzed down
the glittery 1,985-meter (6,512-foot) Piste-G course in 1 minute,
21.95 seconds, leaving the rest of the field in her spray.
	   Winning the Super-G for the second time at this classic World
Cup event, Meissnitzer finished a convincing 0.79 ahead of
Germany's Martina Ertl, who is still winless this season.
	   France's Regine Cavagnoud delighted the home crowd, finishing
third in 1:22.94, ahead of 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla
Wiberg of Sweden, fourth in 1:23.08.
	   Germany's Regina Haeusl placed fifth, 1.14 adrift, while
Stefanie Schuster of Austria finished sixth in 1:23.18.
	   Renate Geotschl, winner of both downhills this season and second
at the Super-G in Mammoth Mountain last week, finished seventh,
1.30 back.
	   Coming into the season with three career World Cup victories,
Meissnitzer has since doubled that number, winning the
season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, as well as a giant
slalom in Park City, Utah three weeks ago.
	   It was her fourth career World Cup Super-G win.
	   Clearly dominating since the start of the season, holding the
lead in every discipline, the Austrians placed five skiers in the
top ten.
	   Germany, weakened by the absence of double Olympic gold
medallist Katja Seizinger, had three in the top-10.
	   Seizinger, the overall downhill and Super-G World Cup champion
last year, announced at the start of the week that her injured
knees would keep her out of competition for the entire season.
	   The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the rankings, where she
sits with 525 points. Ertl's second place finish, however,
prevented Meissnitzer from digging too wide a gap. The German is
still close on her heels, with 383 points.
	   The Super-G standings are of an identical order, Meissnitzer
topping the table with 240, 80 points ahead of Ertl in second.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serb march to rebel area &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a Finnish
forensics team Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of
Kosovo massacre victims in a dispute over Serb access to
rebel-controlled territory.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstruction.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the
war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   But a Serb police contingent consisting of an armored personnel
carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and
carrying automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the graves site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after more than two hours on the side of the
road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic,
said her team's safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to
our laws, the exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during the
Serbian forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in
Kosovo.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   Hundreds of people in the majority ethnic Albanian province have
been killed in this year's offensive as well as subsequent periodic
violence since the October truce.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Underscoring the brutality on both sides, several hundred Serbs
began a protest march Thursday to a rebel stronghold in
southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the disappearance of Serbs
during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began the 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in Yugoslavia.

U.S. envoy: Progress made in Bosnia, but much has yet to be done
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Bosnia has made progress toward
rebuilding after the 1992-1995 war ``but much more still needs to
be done,'' a senior U.S. envoy said Thursday.
	   Robert Gelbard met President Franjo Tudjman, who signed the
U.S.-orchestrated 1995 Dayton peace accord for Bosnia on behalf on
Bosnian Croats.
	   The pact ended three-year-long war in Bosnia, but the tensions
remain high between the country's Serbs, Muslims and Croats.
	   Gelbard, who spent three days touring Bosnia before coming to
Croatia, said that ``the United States believes that very important
progress has been made (there), but much more still needs to be
done.''
	   He said priority issues that need to be achieved in the next
year were ``accelerated development of the economy, so it can
become self-sustaining, serious accelerated return of refugees,
major progress in creating a multi-ethnic police force and
development of joint institutions.''
	   The Dayton accord envisaged the Bosnian Serb- and
Muslim-Croat-controlled two halves of Bosnia, united with joint
institutions. Only a few of them work so far.
	   Gelbard praised the new, moderate Bosnian Serb member of the
country's joint presidency, Zivko Radisic.
	   ``We look forward to much greater accelerated progress in
developing the joint institutions which were stalled'' by the
previous Bosnian Serb representative, he said.
	   Gelbard also emphasized that Zagreb, which still is a patron of
Bosnian Croats, ``very important obligations'' in implementing that
agreement.
	   He called on Croatia and Bosnia to resolve the dispute over the
border town of Martin Brod ``peacefully and calmly.''
	   During the war, Croatia installed its border police in the city,
claiming the maps show that it falls under its authority. Bosnia
insists the city should stay within its borders.
	   The two countries' commissions began talks on the dispute
earlier this week.

Juve's Del Piero back in Italy after knee surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus and Italy star striker Alessandro
Del Piero arrived in Italy on Thursday, two weeks after undergoing
knee surgery in the United States.
	   ``I'm satisfied (with my condition), everything is going well,''
Del Piero, who used crutches, told reporters awaiting his arrival
at Milan's Malpensa airport. ``But it will take six months for a
full recovery.''
	   The 24-year-old tore left knee ligaments in a Nov. 22 Italian
League game against Udinese. He was operated on by Dr. Richard
Steadman, in Vail, Colorado, and is out for the rest of the season,
which ends in May.
	   Juventus has been shut out in four straight league games since
Del Piero went down and is in sixth place. But the club did qualify
for the Champions Cup quarterfinals with a 2-0 victory over
Norway's Rosenborg on Wednesday.

Iranian embassy denies report that it recruited Russian scientists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran's Embassy on Thursday denied a report that it
has actively recruited Russian scientists who previously worked on
Russia's germ warfare program.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had successfully
lured five Russian scientists, and was trying to attract more from
research centers in Russia and Kazakstan.
	   In a statement, Iran's Embassy said that the Iranian government
``has not and will not try under any circumstances to get access to
such types of (biological) arms.''
	   Iran is conducting peaceful biological research programs that
are ``directed at combating AIDS and lung diseases, tuberculosis in
particular,'' the statement added.
	   The statement said that the relationship between Russia and Iran
is fully open, and both countries were meeting their commitments
concerning the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor, and both
countries insist the reactor will only be used to generate power.
	   However, the United States and Israel say that the technology
may help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no plans to
develop such weapons.
	   The United States also has been providing aid to Russian
scientists in recent years in hopes that they will not be tempted
to sell their expertise to countries that want to build weapons of
mass destruction.

Israeli warplanes repeatedly break sound barrier over Beirut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with more flights, Lebanon seeking U.N.
help in lead, grafs 12-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over a nervous Beirut for the second day Thursday, prompting
Lebanon to seek U.N. help in ending the ``sonic bombardment'' of
the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut _ still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _
is on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings and set off the alarms of vehicles on
Thursday.
	   The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people who were frightened by
similar deafening bangs a day earlier.
	   The Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday,
including the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking
cover for fear the city was under attack.
	   Many here still remember Israel's 1982 invasion of Beirut, when
the city came under heavy air and naval attack.
	   The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least
175 people.
	   During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gun ships rocketed
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two
power stations in hills overlooking the capital.
	   Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon
on Thursday.
	   Asked Wednesday about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman
said: ``We do not divulge movements of the air force.'' The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under Israeli rules, would not
comment further.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   On Thursday, Hoss called on a special multinational committee
that monitors a 1996 truce to discuss the flights because they are
``terrifying the civilian population, especially children,'' the
radio reported.
	   Hoss also said Lebanon would ask U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to intercede with Israel.
	   He briefed diplomats representing the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Britain, France,
China and Russia _ on Lebanon's position, the radio said.
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper described the Israeli action in a
front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.''
	   The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fight to drive
Israeli troops and their allied militiamen from southern Lebanon,
where the Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in
1985 to protect its northern settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for most of the attacks on the Israeli soldiers last
month.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As many as 10,000 protesters choked
the streets of Indonesia's capital Thursday, demanding more
democracy as they clashed several times with troops and police.
	   Angry students pelted Jakarta's police headquarters with rocks
and bottles after they were beaten by baton-wielding officers who
blocked 3,000 from marching on the Parliament.
	   At least 30 students were injured, student leaders said.
	   As night fell some tried again to march to the legislature.
	   Another group of several thousand attempted to get to the
heavily guarded presidential palace but were blocked by troops and
armored vehicles about a kilometer (a half mile) away.
	   It was one of the biggest days of protest since student
demonstrations and deadly riots forced ex-President Suharto to quit
last May after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Thursday's massive turnout coincided with the 50th anniversary
of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was held
despite a warning from Indonesia's government that it would not
tolerate violent protests.
	   The protesters also demanded the immediate prosecution of
Suharto, who is now being investigated for corruption.
	   The demonstrators gathered at various locations across Jakarta,
stretching security forces. At first the protests were peaceful and
soldiers and police showed restraint. But violence broke out later.
	   Several other clashes were reported with security forces, who
closed down many streets in the city of 11 million, causing traffic
chaos.
	   Another group of more than 3,000 chanting and flag-waving
students forced their way through a police line near several luxury
hotels and moved along Jakarta's main boulevard.
	   Office workers applauded as the group marched to the local
United Nations building. A police helicopter swooped overhead.
	   Some protesters lied down in front of cars carrying police who
had challenged their group. Others beat up a man they accused of
being a police agent.
	   About 1,000 other demonstrators were earlier allowed to protest
outside gates of Parliament. Thousands more gathered outside
various government buildings or blocked toll roads.
	   Witnesses said brief fights broke out between police and
hundreds of students near Indonesia's foreign ministry.
	   Security forces guarded the presidential palace as well as the
home of Suharto and the Parliament. Tanks and armored vehicles were
in place at several strategic locations.
	   Earlier President B.J. Habibie warned that stern measures would
be taken to stamp out violent protests so as to protect the rights
of most Indonesians.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas predicted that student
demonstrations would continue as Indonesia moves toward greater
democracy and tries to fix its shattered economy.
	   However, Alatas also warned that troops and police would prevent
protests from degenerating into riots.
	   ``Demonstrations are one thing. Riots are another thing,'' the
minister said at a news conference.
	   ``We cannot condone the burning, the sacking, the pillaging and
especially the violence that accompanies riots.''
	   He said some unidentified groups have tried to manipulate
otherwise peaceful student protests to create unrest for their own
political purposes.
	   ``We will use acknowledged and recognized anti-riot gear ... but
not lethal weapons'' to quell unrest, he said.
	   On Nov. 13 security personnel opened fire on hundreds of student
protesters who tried to march on the Parliament. Nine protesters
were killed.
	   Outbreaks of riots and lawlessness have increased in recent
months as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years delivers
soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty.
	   Religious tensions between the Muslim majority and the Christian
minority have resulted in deaths and attacks on dozens of mosques
and churches.
	   On Wednesday Suharto was questioned by state prosecutors about
allegations that he corruptly amassed a fortune during his three
decades in power.
	   Hours after the ex-authoritarian leader was quizzed, thousands
of students demonstrated, and some threw rocks and clashed with
riot police not far from the home of Habibie, Suharto's successor
and one-time protege.
	   Habibie has pledged to hold general elections next year and has
implemented some political reforms, but he lacks credibility among
activists who say he is a stooge of the old regime. They reject his
investigation of Suharto as cosmetic and say he is moving too
slowly on political reform.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Torlap Sethsothorn lifted
himself on a wave of fanatical support Thursday to win the host
country's first swimming gold medal of the 13th Asian Games.
	   Torlap, a silver medalist in the 200-meter freestyle, won the
400 amid emotional scenes. He took over the lead at the 250-meter
mark and kept out Japan's Masato Hirano as noise rained down from
overflowing stands.
	   Torlap touched in a games record 3 minutes, 53.61 seconds, just
in front of Hirano in 3:54.13. Hong Kong's Kwok Kin-Ming was third.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure going into the race at home,'' said
Torlap, who thrashed around wildly in celebration immediately after
he touched the wall.
	   Torlap, whose younger brother Torwai finished sixth, received a
pop star reception when he came out for the victory ceremony. Every
time he looked up at a section of the crowd or lifted his arms
there were shrieks.
	   His parents shared the moment and father Koop said, ``This is a
gift to us because today's our 24th anniversary.''
	   The noise level soared again when Ratapong Sirisanont took his
place in lane 4 as fastest qualifier in the 200 breaststroke. He
came from third at the final wall to just miss gold.
	   China's Zhu Yi edged Ratapong by a finger tip, finishing in
2:16.26 to his rival's 2:16.47. Japan's Yoshinobu Miyazaki was
third.
	   In the lull after and before the storms of noise, Japan's world
championship silver medalist Ayari Aoyama glided to a victory
noticed by just a few.
	   The 16-year-old, beaten by American star Jenny Thompson at the
Perth world championships, had too much class for the field,
posting a time of 59.44 seconds to 1 minute, 0.57 seconds by
China's Ruan Yi. Hitomi Kashima of Japan took bronze.
	   Aoyama's win pushed Japan to a 9-6 lead over rival China in the
medal count after 17 events but Zhu kept China in contact with his
win in No. 18.

West Indies grab initiative in cricket test against SAfrica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies elected to
bowl after winning the toss on the first day of the second test
against South Africa at St. George's Park Thursday -- and their
decision immediately paid off as they had South Africa struggling
on 86 for four wickets at lunch.
	   And it was again Courtney Walsh who was the man who did the
damage. His three wickets propelled him past Ian Botham as the
third highest wicket taker in test history. His tally now stands at
385, two clear of the great Englishman's haul.
	   The West Indies gambled by picking Mervyn Dillon in place of
legspinner Rawl Lewis, and, when they saw the grass on the pitch at
the toss this morning, they must have been pleased they did so.
	   Dillon, responding to his late callup, removed Darryl Cullinan's
legstump with a beautiful yorker in his second over, and was
constantly in the batsmen's face.
	   Hershelle Gibbs -- a mixed-race batsman called to the side after
government complaints the team was too white -- -- was the first to
go. Somewhat unluckily, he squeezed a Walsh express onto his own
stumps after scoring just two.
	   Walsh's other two wickets came in the form of Gary Kirsten,
caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs for 29, and
Jacques Kallis, caught at first slip as he gloved a mistimed hook
to Carl Hooper for 30.
	   At the wicket at lunch were captain Hansie Cronje on one, and
Jonty Rhodes on 17.

Palestinians convene to scrap calls for Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat quote, several dozen
Palestinians throwing stones after West Bank funeral, participation
in council session now at 105, sted 98. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he
has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a
``firm hand,'' and said he would not go ahead with a West Bank
troop pullback he promised under the Wye River peace agreement
unless Arafat met a list of demands.
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to the region, which starts late Saturday, is
fomenting unrest rather than calming the already tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.
	   The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his
address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City.
	   Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this
session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.
	   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the
Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less
than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success
without it. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with
its future,'' Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he
would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue.
	   Arafat said the procedure during the PNC session was an internal
Palestinian matter. ``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he
said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five
percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his
decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally
declare a state in May.
	   The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse
after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a
very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the
accord. On Thursday, 105 of the 124 members of Palestinian Central
Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on
whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
	   The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session,
and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63
members is required, and a vote was expected by Thursday evening.
	   The council has not met for years and was revived specifically
for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members of the
Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,
among others.

Chechen official shows video of slain hostage claiming to be
</HEADLINE>
British spy &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a video tape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   The hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in Russian that
he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the British
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission
was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in the region, he claimed in the video.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard in the
tape.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Kennedy said the group's purported mission of helping install a
telephone system for a private company was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
press conference in Grozny. He refused to answer any questions
about the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or
why the government had it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
questions about the possible role of Chechen officials, long
rumored to be linked to Chechnya's wave of kidnappings.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ has caused outrage in Russia and Britain.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-96 war for independence from Russia.
	   The Chechen Telecom office was attacked before dawn Wednesday by
assailants using grenade launchers. One guard was wounded, security
officials said. Several Chechen Telecom employees have been
kidnapped in recent days.
	   It was unclear whether there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   Since the end of an independence war against Russia, Chechnya
has been running its own affairs. But it has been plagued by
criminal gangs and there are frequent kidnappings for ransom. Most
hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in
captivity.

Soccer: A decent investment _ until your team gets creamed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Investors in Amsterdam's premier
soccer team were kicking themselves Thursday after the squad lost a
key match and its shares plunged.
	   A humiliating defeat Wednesday evening by Portugal's FC Porto
caused publicly traded shares in the Ajax team to plummet on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, driving the stock to a new all-time low.
	   Ajax's 3-0 loss to Porto subsequently got it kicked out of the
Champions League, the competition of national soccer champions.
	   Its stock was trading at 18.20 guilders (dlrs 10) per share at
midday Thursday, down 8.5 percent from Wednesday's close after
hitting an all-time low of 17.70 guilders (dlrs 9.46) earlier in
the session.
	   The company listed on the Amsterdam bourse in May at an issue
price of 25 guilders (dlrs 13.36).
	   The declining stock price has closely followed the team's
performance _ no surprise to either investors or fans.
	   Ajax, which won the national championship 27 times, is currently
in third place in the league and will drop to fifth if other teams
win their matches.
	   Its performance on the field has resulted in fans and newspapers
calling for the dismissal of Ajax' Danish coach, Morten Olsen.
Several players, among them stars like the brothers Ronald and
Frank de Boer, will leave the club by the end of this season.
	   This has caused concern about the club's performance in the
coming season, another reason why the stock fell Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Five people received minor injuries from
a small explosion outside the house of a Spanish civil guard in
this northern town early Thursday that authorities attributed to
groups linked to the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   A top government official from the northern Basque province
Enrique Villar said on National Spanish Radio that the explosion
was evidence of ``a breakout of lightweight terrorism,'' by groups
of young radicals who support ETA.
	   ETA has been observing a cease-fire since Sept. 18 that
triggered talk of possible peace negotiations with the government
aimed at putting a definitive end to 30 years of violence
surrounding Basque separatist aspirations.
	   Villar said Thursday's attack underlined the need for continued
vigilance against the possibility that ETA will break its
cease-fire, the radio reported.
	   The explosion at the home of a Spanish civil guard at 4 a.m.
(0300gmt), was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline, Interior
Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   Five people, not identified by name, required medical attention
including the wife of the targeted civil guard who received burns
to the face and hands.
	   Four neighbors were released from hospital later Thursday after
been treated for shock and problems caused by inhaling fumes from
the explosion that damaged doors and broke windows at the house,
Dors said.
	   ``This is the first time something like this has happened here
since the cease-fire,'' Dors said.
	   ETA includes Pamplona, and the province of Pamplona, in its
vision of an independent Basque state, despite the fact that they
are located south of the current definition of the Basque province.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its violent
campaign for an independent state straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   In recent years bombing and shooting attacks carried out by ETA
have been accompanied by low-intensity pressure from the group's
supporters against such targets as Spanish civil guards who are
believed to represent an occupying force in the Basque homeland.
	   This kind of violence virtually disappeared with the cease-fire
declaration.

Iran, China post big victories; Kazakstan, Thais win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A resurgent Iran routed Tajikistan 5-0
and China stayed unbeaten with a 6-1 demolition of Oman Thursday,
setting up a crucial showdown to advance into the quarterfinals of
Asian Games soccer.
	   In Group 4 matches, Kazakstan downed Qatar 2-0. Thailand got an
early goal to beat Lebanon 1-0 and stay in contention in their
group.
	   Kazakstan and Thailand each have four points from a victory and
a tie. Qatar has a victory and a loss, while Lebanon has two
losses. On Saturday, Thailand plays Qatar and Kazakstan meets
Lebanon.
	   In Group 3, China has a 2-0 record, with Iran and Oman trailing
with a win and a loss apiece.
	   Oman goes into the final second-round match favored to defeat
Tajikistan.
	   That would leave Iran needing a clear victory over the Chinese
to establish a three-way tie at the top with 2-1 records.
	   The two sides to advance into the knockout round would be
decided on goal differential.
	   Agility and speed displayed by the young Chinese side contrasted
with the power of an Iranian team dominated by World Cup veterans.
	   The rival Asian styles of soccer promise a tough clash Saturday.
	   Mansour Pourheidari, the Iranian coach, looked forward to the
crucial match.
	   ``We want to win, both me and the players. On Saturday, we want
three points against China,'' Pourheidari said.
	   Led by two goals by star striker Ali Daei, Iran roared back as a
favorite after faltering Tuesday against Oman when an own goal led
to a 4-2 defeat.
	   World Cup veteran Daei, Karim Bagheri and Mohammad Khakpour
scored in the first 15 minutes against a Tajikistan team that was
never in the game.
	   Sayd Mousavi and Daei reopened the shooting gallery in the
second half.
	   The convincing Iranian victory over the lowliest side in their
second round group helped ease the stain of Tuesday's upset to Gulf
rival Oman.
	   Iran quickly put the game against the Tajiks out of reach.
	   Bayern Munich star Daei opened the scoring in the third minute
as Iran's powerful offense quickly crumbled the Tajikistan left
side.
	   Connecting with a long cross from near the corner, Daei headed
high and at short range between the keeper and the far post for his
third goal of the games.
	   Bagheri added insurance in almost identical circumstances eight
minutes later. Khakpour, formerly a professional hero in Singapore,
put the match away with a low 40-meter shot that Tajikistan goalie
Akumed Enguzarov braced for but never touched.
	   Daei had an apparent second goal from a point-blank chip that
was disallowed for being offside.
	   In the second half, Daei and company had numerous chances to
widen the score beyond Mousavi's fourth-minute goal, but most were
sloppily taken and went wide or over the crossbar.
	   With the play all in Tajikistan's end, Daei finally pushed
through a shot 20 minutes into the half from the top of the goal
area, making it 5-0.
	   In the other match, Oman looked tired against China, never
reaching the intensity that enabled it to beat Iran.
	   China swarmed into the Omani end throughout the first half,
putting in four goals.
	   Hao Haidong struck in the 2nd minute, scoring from above the
penalty spot.
	   In the 22nd minute, Sun Jihai dribbled up close and passed to
Yao Xia, who chipped in to lengthen the lead to 2-0.
	   Li Jinyu, who scored Tuesday against Tajikistan, fired the first
of his two first-half goals in the 30th minute. He ran around a
defender and scored from a tight angle at close range.
	   Li nailed the second goal 10 minutes later.
	   Li Weifeng stretched China's lead to 5-0 in the second half.
Oman's only goal, a bit later, came from Hani al-Dhabit, his fifth
goal of the Asian Games.
	   With minutes left in the game, Chen Yang scored to make it 6-1,
heading the ball into the net.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Paceman Waqar Younis polished off
Zimbabwe's top order, while Saqlain Mushtaq spun a web around their
tail-enders as Pakistan dismissed the tourists for 183 shortly
before the close of play on the first day of the second cricket
Test Thursday.
	   Pakistan will start its first innings Friday after poor light
brought play to an end Thursday 16 minutes early.
	   Andy Flower fought a lone battle with an unbeaten 60 after
Younis' four-wicket burst in 25 deliveries rocked the Zimbabweans
who were 68 for five at lunch.
	   Mushtaq ran through the tail-enders with his Test-best of 5-32
surpassing his previous record of 5-54 against West Indies in
Karachi last year.
	   Flower stroked his 13th half century and shared the highest
partnership of 49 for the sixth wicket with Craig Wishart (28). He
faced 147 balls during his cautious 260 minutes at the wicket and
hammered seven boundaries before he ran out of partners.
	   After Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail pulled out of the match
Thursday morning due to low blood pressure, wicketkeeper Moin Khan
took over as captain and decided to field after winning the toss.
	   Younis removed opener Gavin Rennie (3) in his second over,
caught at second attempt by Ijaz Ahmed at second slip. Younis fully
exploited the early morning conditions on a grassy track.
	   Murray Goodwin (10) was caught behind by Khan off a superb away
swinger. Then Younis took Alistair Campbell's (5) and Grant
Flower's (7) wickets as Zimbabwe tumbled to four for 29.
	   Paceman Shoaib Akhtar took Neil Johnson's wicket.
	   Mushtaq then grabbed five wickets when Zimbabwe's tail-enders
could not build a partnership with Flower. Mushtaq had Wishart
smartly held by Salim Malik off a mistimed sweep, while Heath
Streak (19) was brilliantly snapped up low at first slip by Wasim
Akram. Saeed Anwar also took a fine running catch to dismiss Adam
Huckle (13), who put on 30 runs for the ninth wicket with Flower.

Australians welcome Pinochet extradition ruling

 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A British ruling that an extradition
case against Augusto Pinochet could proceed was hailed Thursday by
the former Chilean dictator's opponents in Australia as a wonderful
way to mark International Human Rights Day.
	   An Australian lawyer for the human rights groups fighting for
Pinochet's extradition, Geoffrey Robertson, said the decision gave
meaning to international human rights law for the first time.
	   Australia-Chile Friendship Society president Victor Marillanca
hailed the decision as particularly good news for those who, like
him, had been tortured during the Pinochet regime.
	   ``It is wonderful that today, the day marking the 50th
anniversary of the International Declaration of Human Rights, that
something is being done _ he is being made to face the court, to
face the music,'' Marillanca said.
	   Marillanca said Pinochet's fate was of personal concern to those
tortured under his regime.
	   ``In my case I would like to see them lock him up and squeeze
his private parts with pliers, like they did to me,'' he said.
	   Robertson said the decision was the beginning of the enforcement
of international justice.
	   ``For the first time since (the Nazi war crimes trial at)
Nuremberg, a dictator has been unable to plead state sovereignty
for protection of the acts of state which has been the tyrants'
defense down the ages,'' he told reporters in Melbourne.

Thailand, South Korea break China's grip on Asian gymnastics gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with competition over &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cracking China's gold medal grip,
Thailand's Amornthep Unchai was king of the rings Thursday at the
Asian Games, sending the home crowd wild with the host country's
first ever gymnastics gold.
	   Screams, whistles and huge applause echoed through the packed
arena as Amornthep's feet hit the mat at the end of an immaculate
routine of grace, control and raw power that scored 9.800.
	   Amornthep was the first but not the last gymnast to break what
otherwise had been an unblemished Chinese record in four days of
competition.
	   South Korea's Yeo Hong-chul beat China's Li Xiaopeng by 0.038
point for gold in the men's vault. China's Xing Aowei had to share
his gold on the pommel horse with North Korea's Pae Kil Su, an
Olympic and world champion in that event.
	   China's women, however, were undefeated, sweeping all four
individual apparatus golds Thursday to add to their all-around and
team titles. With the men's all-around, team and four apparatus
titles, the Chinese got gold in 12 of the 14 competition events,
reaffirming their position as Asia's gymnastics powerhouse.
	   Making his mark in his first major international contest,
China's 18-year-old newcomer Yang Wei won gold on the floor with a
routine that combined soaring somersaults and breathtaking control.
His 9.775 beat Kim Dong-hwa of South Korea, who got silver with
9.650.
	   China's Li Xiaopeng got bronze with 9.600. Li would have won
silver had he not stepped out of bounds after a somersault, a
mistake that cost him a 0.1-point penalty. But Li won on the
parallel bars, beating out four others, including his teammate
Zhang Jinjing, who tied for silver.
	   Zhang got consolation on the high bar, pumping his fists in the
air after a routine that won him gold.
	   In the women's apparatus finals, China's Bi Wenjing won the
uneven bars with a daring routine in which she swung around holding
on with just one hand. The 17-year-old's 9.700 beat North Korea's
Kang Sun-yong, who took silver with 9.500, and Japan's Yuki Ohata,
bronze medal-winner with 9.450.
	   Veteran Chinese team member Kui Yuanyuan won the women's vault
with 9.537. Uzbekistan's Svetlana Bakhridinova took silver with
9.400.
	   China's Xu Jing, a 16-year-old also making her debut in
international competition, and Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova shared
bronze with 9.350.
	   Xu, who is expected to compete at next year's World
Championships and the 2000 Olympics, won the floor competition with
a stylish and energetic routine with lightning fast somersaults
that scored 9.775.
	   Liu Xuan, at 19 the oldest member of the Chinese women's team,
took the balance beam title with a rock-steady routine that scored
9.850 and made the 4-inch (10-centimeter)-wide beam look as wide as
a highway. Liu was also the all-around winner.
	   Having delighted the largely home crowd with his victory,
Amornthep told Thai reporters that he might retire because of
injuries. He was the first Thai gymnast to win an Asian Games gold,
Thai sports officials said.
	   After collecting his pommel horse gold, a tearful Pae told
Korean reporters his victory was ``the most honorable moment'' of
his life. He also said he was retiring and getting married on his
return to North Korea.
	   Some of the North Korean coaches broke into tears as the North's
anthem, ``The Patriotic Song,'' played.
	   Taiwan's Chian Chieng-tun and China's Huang Xu shared bronze
with 9.700. Chian's bronze was Taiwan's first gymnastics medal in
the Asian Games since 1990.
	   Huang, who had already won the men's all-around gold, also
picked up a silver medal on the rings, behind Thailand's Amornthep.
Huang scored 9.675, with Japan's Yoshihiro Saito and Taiwan's Chen
Kuang-hui sharing a bronze with 9.625. Japan also got another
bronze in the vault through Naoya Tsukahara, the all-around bronze
medalist and son of five-time Olympic gold medalist, Mitsuo
Tsukahara.

Ghana's government predicts good harvest for 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana, (AP) _ A report from Ghana's Food and Agriculture
Ministry has predicted good food harvests for 1998, despite a
drought early in the year.
	   The report, issued Wednesday, studied the country's overall food
production through October.
	   It attributed the prospects of a good harvest to improved
rainfall distribution the second half of the year.
	   Altogether, a surplus of 3,853,000 metric tons of starchy
staples is expected. The country does, however, also face a cereal
deficit of 475,000 metric tons, the report said.
	   The production of other crops, with the exception of rice, is
expected to increase from 1998 levels by anywhere from four percent
to 20 percent.
	   Agriculture is the dominant sector of this west African nation's
economy, contributing more than 40 per cent to the gross domestic
product.
	   About 80 per cent of Ghana's population depend on farming,
distributing farm produce, or providing farming-related services.
	   Ghana has two harvest seasons; one in June or July and the other
in December.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said Thursday that accepting the Nobel Peace Prize doesn't
mean their efforts to end 30 years of sectarian violence in the
British province have ended.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said the prize was for an
incomplete peace.
	   The peace accord reached in April has yet to be implemented,
with Trimble insisting he won't let Irish Republican Army
supporters into a new government for Northern Ireland unless the
IRA starts to disarm.
	   ``We have a peace in Ireland. But it is still something of an
armed peace,'' Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, said according to a
text of his remarks released in advance.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished. But the paramilitaries
are finished. But the politics are not finished,'' Trimble's text
said. He vowed to see the accord implemented.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome,'' his advance text said.
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that lead to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that later
fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted, according to a
copy of his planned speech. But, he said, there could be no turning
back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accept their awards, which include a
gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   About 4,000 Norwegian schoolchildren, signing songs and carrying
the flags of many nations, gathered outside of the city hall in a
peace parade, with Hume and Trimble stopping to light their peace
torch before the ceremony.
	   The ceremony was being held against a backdrop of rising crisis
in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA, nearly 17 months into a
truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its secret
stockpiles of weaponry, a goal of the accord.
	   In his speech, Trimble emphasized why a symbolic start to
disarmament was so important to Protestants. Trimble's
long-postponed demand has often been criticized by Hume's SDLP
party as pointless, since the IRA could always smuggle in new
weaponry, and counterproductive since it put the IRA truce under
unnecessary pressure.
	   Noting he had never asked for specific amounts of weaponry on
specific dates, Trimble said in his advance text: ``All I have
asked for is a credible beginning. All I have asked for is that
they say the `war' is over. And that is proved by such a beginning.
	   ``That is not too much to ask for,'' Trimble said, taking aim at
Hume's position. ``Nor is it too much to ask that the reformist
party of Irish nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.''
	   Turning to the IRA's allied political party, he said: ``Any
further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein
are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking
from the dark stream of fascism.''
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,'' said
Hume's text. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in Ireland in the
pursuit of political goals,'' Hume's text said. ``The challenge
now, is to grasp and shape history.''
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and the others in Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

 &UR; Triple murderer executed in Oklahoma &LR;  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) _ A Vietnamese immigrant convicted of
killing his estranged wife and two young children was executed by
injection on his 39th birthday early Thursday.
	   Tuan Anh Nguyen was convicted of fatally stabbing his
20-year-old wife, Donna Nguyen, and her young relatives,
three-year-old Amanda White and six-year-old Joseph White, in 1982.
Nguyen received the death sentence for killing the children. The
Nguyens' infant son was found unharmed in his crib at the Tulsa
duplex where the others were killed.
	   Nguyen came to America as a teenage Vietnamese refugee in 1975
during the fall of Saigon. Assistant federal public defender Scott
Braden contended that Nguyen's mental health had deteriorated so
much he could not understand the death penalty.

 &UR; Bulgaria abolishes death penalty &LR; 
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (Reuters) _ Bulgaria's Parliament abolished the
death penalty Thursday, bringing its legal system in line with that
of the European Union which the Balkan state is striving to join.
	   Under amendments to the penal code, which had 70 references to
capital punishment, the death penalty was replaced with a life
sentence without right of appeal.
	   Some deputies opposed the decision, saying that an overwhelming
majority of Bulgarians supported capital punishment to counter
soaring crime.
	   But Svetoslav Luchnikov from the centre-right Union of
Democratic Forces, which has a parliamentary majority, said legal
experience in other parts of the world had shown that the existence
of capital punishment did not affect the crime rate. A moratorium
on executions, carried out in Bulgaria by a single shot to the back
of the head, was imposed in 1990.
	   ___ &QC;  
 &UR; Thai protesters, police in bloody clash &LR; 
	   PRACHUAB KHIRI KHAN, Thailand (Reuters) _ Thousands of armed
protesters fought a bloody battle with police and blocked a highway
in a demonstration against new power plants in Thailand that
witnesses said left at least 70 people injured.
	   Shots were fired, police rammed lines of protesters with trucks
and demonstrators retaliated with bottles, stones and sticks during
the clashes late Wednesday, the witnesses said.
	   The confrontation erupted after local villagers backed by
environmental groups set up roadblocks on the Phet Kasem highway
near Prachuab Khiri Khan town, about 100 km south of the popular
tourist beach resort of Hua Hin. Opponents of the power plants said
pollution from the lignite-powered facilities would pose a health
threat and damage the local environment.

 &UR; Israeli warplanes break sound barrier over Beirut for second day &LR; 
	   BEIRUT (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over
Beirut on Thursday, the second day of sonic booms that frightened
residents of the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut, still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war,
is on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities in retaliation for guerrilla attacks
that killed seven Israeli soldiers last month in southern Lebanon.
	   Six supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
and set off vehicle alarms early Thursday. The Israeli planes also
made several low runs Wednesday, sending people seeking cover for
fear the city was under attack. The last time Israeli military
aircraft attacked Beirut was during an April 1996 bombing blitz of
Lebanon that killed at least 175 people. Israeli jets also broke
the sound barrier today over southern Lebanon.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Russia border guards ambushed in Caucasus,one dead &LR; 
	   MOSCOW (Reuters) _ One Russian border guard died and two others
were wounded in an ambush in North Ossetia, one of Russia's
turbulent Caucasus provinces, a spokesman for the Federal Border
Guard Service said Thursday.
	   The spokesman told Reuters it was not clear who carried out the
attack, near the province's capital Vladikavkaz, or why.
	   Russian border guards have been placed in North Ossetia
following two regional conflicts, between South Ossetia and former
Soviet Georgia, and between North Ossetia and neighbouring Russian
region of Ingushetia.

Rules rob South Korean of bowling bronze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with South Korea seeks clarification, medals still not
awarded &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Cha Mi-jung was denied a
bronze medal in women's bowling because Asian Games rules prevent a
nation sweeping the medals in a single event.
	   Cha placed behind compatriots Lee Ji-yean and Li Mi-young in the
women's final Wednesday night. Malaysian officials insisted that
their nation's Yap Mun-Yee was entitled to the bronze because only
two athletes from any one country can win medals in one event.
	   Games organizers ruled in Malaysia's favor Thursday, but South
Korea then requested a clarification, saying games rules conflicted
with other rules. The medal-awarding ceremony still has not been
held, nor even scheduled.
	   South Korea had five competitors in the event but under games
rules only two are allowed to win medals and their names must be
registered by the federation before the start of competition.
	   ``The rule is clear and the Koreans were made aware of it before
the competition started,'' said games organizing committee
spokeswoman Valerie McKenzie. ``It is designed to prevent one
country from dominating the medals in one sport.''
	   McKenzie said the South Koreans had been requested to register
two of their five women bowlers but failed to do so. The top two
finishers were counted.

plunged 116.3 points, or 6.75 percent, this week to close at a new
low of 1,607.1 points, the National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   ``What is needed now is taking speedy economic measures to stop
this bleeding,'' said the company in its weekly report.
	   It warned that losses will produce ``economic, social and
political problems especially that the index was widely expected to
drop to 1,500 points.''
	   Investors say the market is cash-strapped and a ministerial
committee set up to energize it has taken steps that would pump
liquidity into it. But the Central Bank believes the market is
experiencing a correction and that no such steps should be taken
before a thorough study.
	   According to the company, 167.63 million shares were traded this
week, up 52.34 percent from last week. The value of these shares
rose 74.75 percent to 31.76 million dinars (dlrs 105.16 million).
	   Of the 77 companies listed on the exchange, 69 were traded, the
report said. Only seven closed higher, 59 lower and the rest were
unchanged.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover shored up on the
stock exchange this week because of active dealing in shares of
lucrative industrial firms and some commercial banks, brokers said
Thursday.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for five business
days ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share index
increased 0.52 percent to 165.79 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms nudged up 2.73 percent and the
services sector by 0.91 percent. But shares of insurance firms
declined 1.52 percent and commercial banks 0.16 percent.
	   Turnover rose by 73.6 percent to 9.2 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 12.9 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 107 firms were traded during the week.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a video tape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   The hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in Russian that
he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the British
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission
was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in the region, he claimed in the video.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard in the
tape.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Kennedy said the group's purported mission of helping install a
telephone system for a private company was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
press conference in Grozny. He refused to answer any questions
about the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or
why the government had it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
questions about the possible role of Chechen officials, long
rumored to be linked to Chechnya's wave of kidnappings.
	   Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia
Andrew Wood said, ``we don't comment on these things in general but
any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on
Chechen territory,'' according to spokesman Mike Haddock.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ has caused outrage in Russia and Britain.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-96 war for independence from Russia.
	   The Chechen Telecom office was attacked before dawn Wednesday by
assailants using grenade launchers. One guard was wounded, security
officials said. Several Chechen Telecom employees have been
kidnapped in recent days.
	   It was unclear whether there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   Since the end of an independence war against Russia, Chechnya
has been running its own affairs. But it has been plagued by
criminal gangs and there are frequent kidnappings for ransom. Most
hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in
captivity.

General Motors' show-room to be demolished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The show-room of Americar-Zagreb company,
the only representative of General Motors in the Balkans, is to be
demolished because authorities ruled the building was built
illegally, local media reported Thursday.
	   The city inspectors came to the site in a Zagreb suburb
Wednesday, planning to begin the demolition. The company's
attorneys managed to negotiate a delay until all the Chevrolets,
Pontiacs, Cadillacs and other properties worth a total of dlrs 4
million are removed.
	   The inspectors, however, cut off the company's electricity,
water supplies and phone lines.
	   Earlier this year, General Motors bought the building, then
still under construction, for an equivalent of dlrs 100,000. The
firm was aware the construction was done without city approval but
believed the necessary certification was imminent because the owner
provided submitted required documents, the newspaper Vecernji List
reported.
	   But the city ruled out any retroactive approval. The decision
was taken as part of a crackdown by authorities on unauthorized
construction.
	   The company's attorneys appealed the city ruling. General Motors
headquarters, as well as U.S. ambassador to Croatia, have been
notified about the case, the newspaper said.
	   Critics have often accused Croatian government of obstructing
foreign investment in the country.

Royal Doulton announces major job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOKE-ON-TRENT, England (AP) _ Fine china manufacturer Royal
Doulton announced plans Thursday to cut 1,000 jobs in Britain, a
fifth of its British workforce, due to depressed sales.
	   A further 200 positions will be axed worldwide, a number of
sluggishly performing stores will be closed and production
facilities in Britain will be cut back ``substantially,'' the
company said.
	   Most jobs will be eliminated at Royal Doulton's ceramics
operations here in the English Midlands, but cuts at its glass
operations might follow next year, the company said.
	   In a further bid to cut production levels, Royal Doulton said it
would shut down most of its British ceramics factories early for
Christmas and reopen them sometime in January.
	   ``It is a major blow to the employees who have worked
productively for the company and is particularly bitter just before
Christmas,'' Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said of the announcements.
	   The company had eliminated 330 jobs last summer. It currently
has about 7,000 employees worldwide.
	   Sales for the 11 months ending Nov. 30 were 205 million pounds
(dlrs 340 million), down 5 percent from this time last year, and
the downward trend was expected to continue through December.
	   The fine china group has been particularly hard hit by the
strong pound and steep declines in its Far Eastern and Asian
Pacific regions.
	   The company said it would not be paying a final dividend this
year.

attends ceremony in graf 10; EDITS throughout to smooth transitions

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A human rights group and an
opposition politician slammed Cambodia's human rights record as
government leaders commemorated Thursday's 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Former bitter enemies Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh delivered speeches Thursday evening at a United Nations
observance of the historic declaration. They acknowledged the
country's poor rights record, but pledged to do better.
	   ``We in Cambodia, with a past of gross violations of human
rights, need to work harder to achieve full respect for human
rights,'' the prince said.
	   Hun Sen said that by implementing forceful reforms his new
government ``will continue to take the lead in bringing Cambodian
society toward everything deemed necessary for human rights.''
	   That optimistic forecast was a stark contrast to the gloomy
picture Human Rights Watch Asia painted of Cambodia in a report
this week.
	   ``No progress was made during the year toward ending impunity
for rights violations; officials linked to murders and
`disappearances' remained in office,'' the New York-based group
said.
	   ``Khmer Rouge leaders associated with the 1975-79 massacres of a
million or more Cambodians remained at large even after Pol Pot's
death in April,'' the report added.
	   Those sentiments were echoed by opposition leader Sam Rainsy,
who claimed that actions by the international community had given
Hun Sen's government ``the green light'' to suppress its political
opponents.
	   ``It is deeply ironic to see international representatives
honoring the Universal Declaration at a time when their disregard
for its principles is so apparent,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Sam Rainsy also attended the U.N. ceremony but made no speech or
statement. His comments came earlier in the day.
	   Sam Rainsy and HRW blasted the international community for its
quick endorsement of Hun Sen's victory in recent elections despite
opposition parties' allegations of voter intimidation and ballot
fraud.
	   Nonetheless, hopes that Cambodia's turmoil may be easing were
raised last month when Hun Sen and Ranariddh ended a 16-month
violent conflict with an agreement to form a coalition government.
	   Hun Sen was named sole prime minister in the deal, and the
prince was made president of the National Assembly. Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a bloody coup d'etat in July
1997.
	   Human Rights Watch Asia said little attention has been paid to
human rights in Cambodia since the international community agreed
to fund July's election, eventually won by Hun Sen.
	   Promised investigations into nearly 100 political killings
committed in the wake of the 1997 coup never materialized;
opposition supporters in the military and police were assassinated
in the run-up to the election; and protests against election fraud
were violently suppressed by riot police, the report stated.
	   ``The international response to developments in Cambodia was
characterized by donor weariness with Cambodia's seemingly
never-ending problems, eagerness to sign off on a flawed electoral
process, and acquiescence in Hun Sen's consolidation of power,''
the group stated.

Thanksgiving service planned for Duchess of York's mother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A service of thanksgiving for the life of Susan
Barrantes, the Duchess of York's mother, will be held here next
week, the family announced Thursday.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 61, died near her polo ranch on the Argentine
pampas in September when her car collided with another vehicle.
	   At the time, her daughter, the former Sarah Ferguson, paid
tribute to her resilence, saying, ``Our friend, our mother, in the
harshest times was able to dance with life and offer her heart.''
	   The duchess is the former wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second
son, Prince Andrew.
	   Barrantes was the former wife of the duchess's father, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the British monarch's former polo manager.
	   The family said the thanksgiving service would be held Tuesday
at St. Paul's Church in the Knightsbridge section of London.

Schroeder vows to curb German payments to European Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged
Thursday to fight for a limit on Germany's payments to the European
Union during its upcoming six-month EU presidency.
	   He insisted that curbing the German contribution must be part of
a wider budget deal the 15-nation bloc is seeking to allow it to
fund eastward expansion to include former Soviet bloc countries.
	   Europe's biggest economy, Germany contributes about a third of
the EU budget, paying 22 billion marks (dlrs 13.2 billion) more
into the EU than it gets back. Schroeder said redressing the
imbalance would be a priority for the German presidency starting
Jan. 1.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in a
speech to parliament laying out Germany's agenda.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to solve Europe's problems with a
German checkbook.''
	   Reflecting Europe's shift to the political left, Schroeder said
Germany will also push for a pact among EU countries to fight
unemployment.
	   He said he would take a jobs pact as seriously as Europe's
``stability pact,'' which pledges governments to fiscal discipline
after 11 nations launch a single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder also promised to renew efforts to give Europe a common
voice in foreign policy and its own military capability within
NATO.
	   But he made clear the ``unusually difficult'' effort to overhaul
the EU budget for 2000-2006 would be his main challenge. Germany
will seek to resolve disputes over the reforms by the end of March,
he said.
	   The previous government of Helmut Kohl had also pressed for
limiting Germany's dues, but Schroeder has pursued a tougher line
since taking office in October.
	   Schroeder's speech attempted to set the tone for a two-day
summit of EU leaders opening Friday in Vienna, Austria, where
disputes over EU expansion and budget plans are expected to take
center stage.
	   Germany remains committed to EU expansion, but current members
must first agree on ``a financial structure that allows new
entries,'' he said.
	   In an appeal also aimed at France, Germany's closest partner in
Europe, Schroeder urged all EU nations to work for a compromise.
	   ``There can be no taboos,'' he said.
	   In unusually frank criticism, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
accused France of hampering talks on cutting farm subsidies by
balking at suggestions to have national governments pick up more of
the tab for their farmers.
	   About half the EU budget goes for farm subsidies, much of the
rest for aid to poorer regions.

EU ambassador: much work ahead before European Union membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A great deal of work needs to be
completed before Hungary is ready for European Union membership,
the EU envoy said Thursday.
	   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been pressing for a
timetable for this former Communist country to join the EU. But the
ambassador, Michael Lake, said ``to complete all the work
necessary, it's going to be very tough indeed.''
	   Lake granted that ``Hungary has created a momentum toward full
accession, but there is a great deal to be done.''
	   Orban had called for EU membership in the year 2002, when the
next parliamentary elections are to be held. Lake said ``that would
mean Hungary being ready by mid-2000, because ratification will
take 18 months.''
	   Lake added he saw ``no evidence of delay anywhere'' and good
progress is being made on a wide variety of fronts, such as
industrial standards being aligned with EU guidelines.
	   But he said Hungary needs to find more effective ways of
combating corruption in the administration, organized crime and tax
evasion.
	   The Hungarian parliament began debate Wednesday on a
controversial measure to establish an internal revenue police
force, which would have broad powers to place people under
surveillance and to enter premises in an effort to stop tax evasion
and fraud.

Philips lays off 750 workers in Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Dutch giant Royal Philips Electronics fired 750
workers from its Singapore operations on Thursday in one of
country's single largest corporate retrenchments this year.
	   Before the decision, about 8,000 workers were employed in six
Philips manufacturing plants in Singapore, producing color TVs,
radios and cellular phones.
	   The company was the fifth-largest employer in the tiny
city-state, which relies heavily on foreign investment and
electronics manufacturing.
	   ``The reason for restructuring is that some of the production
load has been relocated to China and Mexico, and the market in Asia
has weakened,'' a spokesman said.
	   Last month, Philips said it planned to cut the number of global
production sites to between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by
2002, signaling that job cuts were imminent.
	   ``We have tried all kinds of things'' to avoid cutting
employees, said Elizabeth Martin, head of human resources at
Philips Singapore, on national television news.
	   She said the company had frozen recruitment, tried to redeploy
workers and had sought higher work loads but had not managed to
protect all the jobs in its Singapore operations.
	   The cuts come amid rough times for Europe's largest consumer
electronics group. In October, the company revealed that
third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38 percent to dlrs
241 million.
	   Though Singapore has managed to avoid the full brunt of the
regional economic crisis, unemployment has doubled to 4.5 percent
in recent months and layoffs have reached record levels.
	   The government has launched a host of measures to reform the
economy and save jobs, but it still refuses to extend any
unemployment benefits.
	   The government-linked National Trades Union Congress and the
Ministry of Manpower sought early Thursday to find new jobs for
some of the fired workers, said the TV report.

Nobel Prize laureates have their gala day in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: awards ceremony begins at 1530 GMT; banquet at 1800 GMT. &QL;

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For most of those receiving Nobel
Prizes in the Swedish capital on Thursday, science is a way of
improving the human condition, but for one it's a means of
describing it.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago of Portugal often uses eerie,
almost-credible scientific events as metaphors for addressing
philosophical issues. In his most-recent novel ``Blindness,''
people suddenly and inexplicably go blind in an allegory of social
disintegration.
	   '''The Stone Raft'' from 1986 posits the Iberian Peninsula
snapping off from the rest of the European continent and floats
into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical search for identity away
from the standardizing nature of the European Union.
	   Saramago and winners of the physics, chemistry, medicine and
economics prizes receive their prizes in an afternoon ceremony at
Stockholm's imposing Konserthuset hall, then are feted at a banquet
in the castle-like city hall.
	   The prizes are given every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor
of dynamite who established the prizes in his will.
	   It's probably not a day too soon if any of the laureates are
interested in the prize's money in addition to its prestige. The
Swedish kronor has consistently fallen since the prizes were
announced in October; the 7.6-million-kronor prizes were worth
about dlrs 978,000 two months ago, but at Thursday's exchange rate
the value had dropped to dlrs 943,000.
	   The medicine prize is shared by Americans Robert Furchgott of
the State University of New York, Louis Ignarro of the University
of California-Los Angeles and Ferid Murad of the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston, for their work in discovering how
nitric oxide does its lifesaving work of dilating blood vessels.
	   Nitric oxide also plays a role in the working of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra and the laureates say it is likely to
have wide new applications in counteracting asthma and coronary
disease.
	   Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar, won the economics prize for his
work in examining the causes behind famines and other catastrophes.
He is a specialist in welfare economics, the discipline that tries
to establish quantitative ways of assessing quality of life.
	   The physics prize goes to Robert Laughlin of Stanford
University, Horst Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel Tsui of
Princeton University for discovering how electrons can change
behavior and act more like fluid than particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions. Kohn did not come to Stockholm because of an illness in
his family; he plans to come for the 1999 ceremony, according to
the Nobel Foundation.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, also receive their prizes on Thursday, in
ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.

Russian Cabinet presents next year's tight budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Cabinet today approved a draft of the
1999 budget that calls for printing more money and factors in
foreign loans that may not materialize.
	   The budget, approved with unspecified amendments, will go before
the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, on Friday,
said Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has voiced hopes for a quick
approval of the trimmed budget because his Cabinet enjoys broad
support in the Duma.
	   ``The essential thing is that it is honest. We didn't include
spending that can't be covered by revenues,'' Primakov said at a
Cabinet meeting where leaders hashed out the draft.
	   But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the
budget includes $7.5 billion in foreign loans the government hopes
to receive but can't count on.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders froze a $22.6
billion loan package after Russia defaulted on some of its debts
and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget plan as
a requirement for more loans and has specifically warned the
Cabinet against factoring in foreign credits that have yet to
materialize.
	   The budget forecasts spending $29 billion and revenues of $24
billion, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government expects to cover the $5 billion deficit through
loans and printing about $1.7 billion in new cash. Substantial
money-printing is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar and foresees inflation of 30 percent next year. Many
private economists see those estimates as unrealistic and predict
the budget deficit will be even larger.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the dollar in recent
months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.
	   Primakov warned government ministers against trying to boost
spending in their areas, threatening to fire them if they disobey.
	   He also said the budget should serve as a ``prelude'' for
economic growth by creating new incentives for Russia's ailing
industries. The Cabinet has recently approved a package of bills to
lower taxes and streamline Russia's convoluted tax system.

Iran, China post big victories; Kazakstan, Thais win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes, details of other games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A resurgent Iran routed Tajikistan 5-0
and China stayed unbeaten with a 6-1 demolition of Oman Thursday,
setting up a crucial showdown to advance into the quarterfinals of
Asian Games soccer.
	   In Group 4 matches, Kazakstan downed Qatar 2-0. Thailand got an
early goal to beat Lebanon 1-0 and stay in contention in their
group.
	   Kazakstan and Thailand each have four points from a victory and
a tie. Qatar has a victory and loss, while Lebanon has two losses.
On Saturday, Thailand plays Qatar and Kazakstan meets Lebanon.
	   In Group 3, China has a 2-0 record, with Iran and Oman trailing
with a win and a loss apiece.
	   Oman goes into the final second-round match favored to defeat
Tajikistan.
	   That would leave Iran needing a clear victory over the Chinese
to establish a three-way tie at the top with 2-1 records.
	   The two sides to advance into the knockout round would be
decided on goal differential.
	   Agility and speed displayed by the young Chinese side contrasted
with the power of an Iranian team dominated by World Cup veterans.
	   A victory over Iran would be sweet for China, since two defeats
to Iran kept China out of this year's World Cup finals, while Iran
qualified.
	   The rival Asian styles of soccer promise a tough clash Saturday.
	   Bobby Houghton, the Briton who coaches China, is not relaxed.
	   ``This group is still tough. Any two of the three can still
qualify,'' he said.
	   He knows it could come down to a goal differential.
	   ``You can never score enough goals to make up the difference,''
he said.
	   Mansour Pourheidari, the Iranian coach, looked forward to the
crucial match.
	   ``We want to win, both me and the players. On Saturday, we want
three points against China,'' Pourheidari said.
	   Led by two goals by star striker Ali Daei, Iran roared back as a
favorite after faltering Tuesday against Oman, when an own goal led
to a 4-2 defeat.
	   World Cup veteran Daei, Karim Bagheri and Mohammad Khakpour
scored in the first 15 minutes against a Tajikistan team that was
never in the game.
	   Sayd Mousavi and Daei reopened the shooting gallery in the
second half.
	   The convincing Iranian victory over the lowliest side in their
second round group helped ease the stain of Tuesday's upset to Gulf
rival Oman.
	   Bayern Munich star Daei opened the scoring in the third minute
as Iran's powerful offense quickly crumbled the Tajikistan left
side.
	   Connecting with a long cross from near the corner, Daei headed
high and at short range between the keeper and the far post for his
third goal of the Games.
	   Bagheri added insurance in almost identical circumstances eight
minutes later. Khakpour, formerly a professional hero in Singapore,
put the match away with a low 40-meter shot that Tajikistan goalie
Akumed Enguzarov braced for but never touched.
	   Daei had an apparent second goal from a point-blank chip that
was disallowed for being offside.
	   In the second half, Daei and company had numerous chances to
widen the score beyond Mousavi's fourth-minute goal, but most were
sloppily taken and went wide or over the crossbar.
	   With the play all in Tajikistan's end, Daei finally pushed
through a shot 20 minutes into the half from the top of the goal
area, making it 5-0.
	   In the other match, Oman looked tired against China, never
reaching the intensity that enabled it to beat Iran.
	   China swarmed into the Omani end throughout the first half,
putting in four goals.
	   Hao Haidong struck in the second minute, scoring from above the
penalty spot.
	   In the 22nd minute, Sun Jihai dribbled up close and passed to
Yao Xia, who chipped in to lengthen the lead to 2-0.
	   Li Jinyu, who scored Tuesday against Tajikistan, fired the first
of his two first-half goals in the 30th minute. He ran around a
defender and scored from a tight angle at close range.
	   Li nailed the second goal 10 minutes later.
	   Li Weifeng stretched China's lead to 5-0 in the second half.
Oman's only goal, a bit later, came from Hani al-Dhabit, his fifth
goal of the Asian Games.
	   With minutes left in the game, Chen Yang scored to make it 6-1,
heading the ball into the net.
	   Valdeir Vieira, the Brazilian who coaches Oman, said his team
was tired from the big victory over Iran.
	   ``Forty-eight hours is a short time to recover from such a big
effort,'' Vierira said.
	   He plays the second game of the day after the China-Iran match.
	   ``It's no secret I will be supporting China. If Iran wins, then
it will be an almost impossible mission for us,'' Vieira said.
	   Kazakstan polished off Qatar with a goal in each half. Viktor
Zubarev scored in the 13th minute to start Kazakstan on its way to
the victory.
	   Thailand got a gift goal when Lebanon's goalie Ahmad Sakr
mishandled the ball and gave Thailand's Worawoot Srimaka the ball
with an open net to shoot into in the 14th minute. The ball bounced
off Sakr and Worawoot was all alone with an easy chip of less than
five meters.

New Swiss president plans to confront U.S., Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's first Jewish president plans to be
more outspoken toward the United States and Jewish organizations
over World War II issues, she said in an interview Thursday.
	   ``I have always refused to speak as the token Jew of our
government,'' said Ruth Dreifuss, elected by parliament Wednesday
to the one-year presidency for 1999.
	   ``It will be different in my role as president, which gives me
much clearer legitimacy,'' Dreifuss said. ``It's an opportunity I
intend to seize both in this country and abroad.''
	   Dreifuss was quoted by the daily Le Temps saying she previously
has held back from commenting on the search for the assets of
Holocaust victims in Swiss banks during the past 3 1/2 years, when
Switzerland has come under heavy criticism from international
Jewish organizations and the U.S. government.
	   Her portfolio has been that of interior minister, responsible
for issues like health and social security, and not foreign
minister in the seven-member coalition Cabinet that tries to govern
by consensus.
	   She said the election gave her ``a great chance'' to contribute
to the debate about neutral Switzerland's role in World War II and
its efforts to repair any wrongdoing the Swiss committed toward
Nazi victims.
	   Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust than the
other members of the Cabinet, and that her personal and family
history had given her special insights.
	   Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon after the outbreak of World War
II, to a Swiss Jewish family.
	   She said she could empathize both with the 27,000 Jewish
refugees allowed into Switzerland and the 30,000 who were turned
back during the war.
	   Dreifuss has said she thinks the Swiss government should
compensate Jews who were sent back. The Nazis sent many of the
returnees straight into concentration camps.
	   A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come
next spring when an international panel of historians appointed by
the Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy,
Dreifuss said.
	   ``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she
said. ``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish
organizations where they are totally justified and legitmate in
their demands and where they are less so. I think I will be able to
do a lot and I don't have any complexes with Jewish
representatives.''
	   She said she knows the United States and the way the
international Jewish community functions better than her
colleagues.
	   Dreifuss, also the first Swiss woman to be president, said,
``the election of a Jewish female president of the confederation
demonstrates that what would have been impossible just a few years
ago has become normal.''

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Torlap Sethsothorn lifted
himself on a wave of fanatical support Thursday to win the host
country's first swimming gold medal of the 13th Asian Games.
	   Japan and China won two golds apiece, leaving Japan with a 10-8
lead in the gold standings after 20 events.
	   Japan's world silver medalist Ayari Aoyama had her best time
under new regulations for the 100-meter breaststroke and Shunsuke
Ito anchored the men's 4x100 freestyle team to a narrow victory
over China to preserve the lead.
	   But only one gold seemed to matter to the capacity crowd
Thursday as Torlap, a silver medalist in the 200-meter freestyle,
won the 400 amidst emotional scenes. He took over the lead at the
250-meter mark and kept out Japan's Masato Hirano as noise rained
down from overflowing stands.
	   Torlap touched in a games record 3 minutes, 53.61 seconds, just
in front of Hirano in 3:54.13. Hong Kong's Kwok Kin-Ming was third.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure going into the race at home,'' said
Torlap, who thrashed around wildly in celebration immediately after
he touched the wall. ``But I'm glad for the support from them,
they're charming.''
	   Torlap, whose younger brother Torwai finished sixth, received a
pop star reception when he came out for the victory ceremony. Every
time he looked up at a section of the crowd or lifted his arms
there were shrieks.
	   His parents shared the moment and father Koop said, ``This is a
gift to us because today's our 24th anniversary.''
	   The noise level soared again when Ratapong Sirisanont took his
place in lane 4 as fastest qualifier in the 200 breaststroke. He
came from third at the final wall to just miss gold.
	   China's Zhu Yi edged Ratapong by a finger tip, finishing in
2:16.26 to his rival's 2:16.47. Japan's Yoshinobu Miyazaki was
third.
	   In the lull after and before the storms of noise, Aoyama glided
to an important victory noticed by just a few. But her mother was
one of them.
	   The 16-year-old, beaten by American star Jenny Thompson at the
Perth world championships, had too much class for the field,
posting a time of 59.44 seconds to 1 minute, 0.57 seconds by
China's Ruan Yi. Hitomi Kashima of Japan took bronze.
	   While she did not get much of a cheer from a crowd still
celebrating gold, she did get a call from her mother that reduced
her to tears. Her mom watched the race on television in Japan.
``She told me I have a cute smile,'' Aoyama said.
	   It was Aoyama's best time since governing body FINA in March
banned the so-called submarine start, where breaststrokers traveled
as far as possible under water at the gun.
	   ``I am very glad to do it under one minute under the new
regulation,'' said Aoyama, who has the second best time in the
world this year. ``This is the first time.''
	   China's Li Wei was another to draw little reaction from the
crowd despite an impressive swim to win the women's 100
breaststroke in an Asian Games record of 1 minute, 8.95 seconds.
She was more than a second ahead of compatriot Xu Shan (1:10:00),
with Japan's Masami Tanaka taking bronze.

Air travel throughout Germany disrupted by snow and ice

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Air travel was disrupted throughout
Germany on Thursday as Lufthansa canceled and delayed flights due
to heavy snow in its hub, Frankfurt, the airline said.
	   European and domestic flights were canceled, with priority for
international travel outside Europe. Schedules will not return to
normal until the weather improves, and forecasts for more snow and
icy rain in Frankfurt suggested the situation could worsen or
continue ahead of the weekend.
	   Michael Lamberty, Lufthansa spokesman said only about 10 out of
35 flights moved Thursday morning.
	   ``We're trying to move the international flights, if with
delays,'' he said.
	   Stuttgart and Munich airports also were affected. Unseasonably
early and heavy snow fell overnight throughout large areas of
Germany.

Springsteen wins injunction against bootleggers

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rock legend Bruce Springsteen won a battle against
music pirates Thursday when a judge blocked the release of an
unauthorized collection of songs recorded early in his career.
	   Springsteen, 49, had argued that the release of ``Before the
Fame'' would damage his artistic integrity because the songs did
not meet his high standards.
	   ``I came over here to defend the ownership of my music,'' he
said outside the courtroom after his victory. ``It's something I
fought for since I was young, and I'm really satisfied.''
	   The London-based record company Masquerade Music had contended
it had a legal right to the songs, recorded between 1972-74,
because it was licensed to use them by Jim Cretecos, a member of
Springsteen's former management team who claimed he owned the
rights.
	   But Judge Francis Ferris ruled that Springsteen owned the 19
songs, and ordered Masquerade to pay his costs in bringing the
action, estimated to be about 500,000 pounds (dlrs 825,000).
	   Masquerade Music's Ronald Winter said the company would appeal
the decision, contending Springsteen failed to produce sufficient
evidence supporting ownership.
	   The judge also ruled that Springsteen could seek damages against
Robert Tringham, whose now-defunct Flute International Ltd.
released unauthorized CDs of Springsteen's music in Britain in
1996. The ``Unearthed I'' and ``Unearthed II'' collections
contained some of the same songs Masquerade had sought to release.
	   Springsteen, known to his fans as ``The Boss,'' is one of the
most bootlegged artists in rock and has often gone to court to
fight music pirates.
	   ``The music you release is the way you shape your career,'' he
said, dressed for court in a dark blue suit. ``The music is yours.
You wrote it, you came up with it. You're sitting in your room late
at night with your guitar, and it's one of the most personal things
in your life to you.''
	   Springsteen, who was to fly to Paris later Thursday to perform
in an Amnesty International concert, said his trips to London for
his court appearances in October were worth it.
	   ``I really didn't come here for the money,'' he said. ``I came
here for my music.''

Refugee conference calls on Africa to face up to the problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Africa must face up to the problem of its
8 million refugees and bear the responsibility, the Organization of
African Unity said here Thursday.
	   Opening a pan-African conference on refugees, the assistant
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Daniel
Antonio, said host countries were experiencing ``fatigue' and
donors were suffering ``donor fatigue.''
	   The continent had to ``shoulder its responsibility,'' he said.
The refugee problem was caused by ``war, internal conflict, human
rights abuses and natural catastrophes.''
	   Antonio told the delegates, who represent some 40 African
states, that they had to find a solution to the problem as it was
affecting their countries' economic development and causing
instability.
	   ``Africa has to come up with a new strategy for the welfare of
all Africans,'' he said. ``This is a big challenge, but is is a
noble challenge.''
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the approximately 8
million refugees in Africa represent an increase of 500 percent
over the 1993 figures.
	   Another 15 million people have been displaced by war and famine.
	   Sudan says it hosts at least 1.1 million refugees, mainly from
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Its government complains that foreign
aid to the refugees has dropped from about dlrs 111 per head in
1985 to a mere dlrs 7 in 1997.
	   ``We are shouldering the burden of some 95 percent of the
refugees on our soil,'' said the Sudanese commissioner for
refugees, Mohammed Alagbash, told The Associated Press on Thursday.
``This is too much for our resources.''

Pinochet's Spanish judicial pursuer completes indictment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge who has been the driving force
behind efforts to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to
Spain to face trial on Thursday completed the criminal indictment
of the aging general who is currently detained in Britain pending
extradition proceedings.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for crimes committed
during his virulently anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began
with a bloody coup to overthrow elected Marxist president Salvador
Allende.
	   Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue. Legal experts expect it will be several months or even
years before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be
extradited or not.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic in
fulfillment of a warrant issued by Garzon with a view to
extradition.
	   The arrest and subsequent indictment are backed by evidence
collected by a two-year Spanish judicial probes into human rights
abuses in Chile that allege Pinochet is responsible for the death
or disappearance of over 3,000 people during his 17-year rule.

	   OVER MISCHIEF REEF, South China Sea (AP) _ U.S. Congressman Dana
Rohrabacher flew Thursday on a Philippine air force plane over a
disputed South China Sea reef to observe structures being built by
China and said the United States should help stop Chinese expansion
in the area.
	   ``We can't ignore this bullying by the Communist Chinese in the
Spratlys. This is intolerable,'' Rohrabacher said while viewing
clusters of structures jutting out from Mischief Reef. Three
Chinese warships were on guard nearby.
	   Rohrabacher was accompanied on the C-130 cargo plane by
Philippine military officials and Roilo Golez, chairman of the
Philippine House defense committee.
	   His trip to the Spratlys, which China had opposed, was the first
in recent years by a lawmaker from a country not part of the
conflicting claims to the territory. It reflects Philippine
attempts to seek international support to halt Chinese expansion in
the contested area.
	   ``The main objective of this trip is to seek an international
forum. We want the world to know what is happening,'' Golez said.
	   Chinese Ambassador Guan Dengming sought a meeting with
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon in Manila to express
concern over the trip.
	   ``Beijing has always been against the presence of a third party
because it will create more problems,'' he told reporters.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief Reef. Both
countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but the Philippines says they could have military uses.
	   The plane carrying Rohrabacher flew for about 20 minutes over
the reef, making six passes and flying as low as 100 meters (300
feet) at one point over the structures to steer clear of clouds.
The California Republican used binoculars and took pictures while
kneeling in front of a small round window.
	   Below, four large clusters of structures on stilts stood near
the fringes of the reef, surrounded by warships and several other
Chinese boats.
	   Army Maj. John Bonafos, a Philippine military expert on the
Spratlys who joined the trip, said satellite dishes have been
installed on all of the structures, which can serve as docks for
large ships.
	   Rohrabacher, who as a member of the U.S. House International
Relations Committee led efforts to block most-favored nation trade
status for China, said he was aghast at the presence of the Chinese
warships. He said China was bullying its way into the Spratlys
knowing that other claimants like the Philippines have weaker
militaries.
	   He said the Philippines should assert its claim because if China
is allowed to fortify its presence near the Philippine coastline,
it would endanger sea lanes near the contested areas as well as
nearby Philippine oil and natural gas exploration sites.
	   ``When you're dealing with gangsters and dictatorships like
Communist China, they only understand it when you're strong and
courageous and standing up for your rights,'' the California
Republican said.
	   Rohrabacher said he would submit a report about the trip to the
House committee and would urge the U.S. government to exert
political and economic pressure on China to dismantle its
structures on Mischief Reef and send its warships home.
	   The United States officially takes no sides in the conflicting
claims in the Spratlys but says preserving freedom of navigation in

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with radio report on nature of the diplomatic
violation &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a Finnish
forensics team Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of
Kosovo massacre victims in a dispute over Serb access to
rebel-controlled territory.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstruction.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the
war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   But a Serb police contingent consisting of an armored personnel
carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and
carrying automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the graves site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after more than two hours on the side of the
road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   In Belgrade, the independent radio station B-92 radio quoted
Ranta as saying a Serb policeman opened the ambassador's car,
grabbed a camera and took out a film.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them. A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina,
Danica Marinkovic, said her team's safety also was reportedly at
issue. ``According to our laws, the exhumations can't take place
without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during the
Serbian forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in
Kosovo.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   Hundreds of people in the majority ethnic Albanian province have
been killed in this year's offensive as well as subsequent periodic
violence since the October truce.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Underscoring the brutality on both sides, several hundred Serbs
began a protest march Thursday to a rebel stronghold in
southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the disappearance of Serbs
during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began the 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in Yugoslavia.

No progress reported on WTO leadership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization looks set to miss its
mid-December target of choosing a new leader to lead it into the
next century because of U.S. and European indecision.
	   Diplomats charged with trying to forge a consensus among WTO
members said Thursday they had made no progress in narrowing down
the list of four candidates.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub are widely regarded as the
front-runners, ahead of former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren
and former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore.
	   But the European Union remains internally divided over its
choice and the United States has not yet declared its position.
Japan and other Asian countries are backing Supachai. Abouyoub is
expected to pick up support from developing countries.
	   ``There is only a limited possibility that all members of the
organization will declare their positions by Dec. 18,'' said
ambassadors Celso Lafer and William Rossier.
	   Renato Ruggiero, the current incumbent, wants to step down in
April. The WTO had set itself a mid-December deadline to make the
final choice.
	   Lafer, from Brazil, and Rossier, from Switzerland, are charged
with trying to mold a consensus among the 132 WTO members.
	   ``It's one thing to have problems to reach agreement on one
candidate. But it's quite a different matter not to be able to work
toward such a decision because certain members haven't let us know
their choice,'' the diplomats said, in veiled reference to
Washington and Brussels.
	   ``The current state of flux can't be maintained for much
longer,'' they said in a report to the WTO council.
	   The indecision comes at a time when the WTO and the open trade
system it champions is under pressure as a result of the global
economic crisis. There have been calls, especially in Asia, for
some form of protection to curb excesses of the free market.
	   The WTO is struggling to come up with a trade agenda for the
turn of the century, amid big differences between rich and poor
countries over environmental and labor issues.
	   All four candidates say they want to speed long-running
accession talks and bring China and Russia into the international
trading order as quickly as possible.
	   The silence of the United States and European Union is in
contrast to their unseemly public fight in the last leadership
contest, when the EU pushed Ruggiero and the United States wanted
former Mexican president Salinas de Gortari.

China says poaching pushes Tibetan antelope toward extinction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An antelope found only on the high, desolate
Tibetan plateau has been hunted by poachers to the verge of
extinction, a Chinese government report said Thursday.
	   The fine fur of the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, is used to
produce a soft fabric called shahtoosh that fetches high prices in
the West.
	   Although Chinese environmentalists have campaigned to save the
antelope, the report Thursday by the State Administration of
Forestry marked the first time the government has openly joined the
crusade.
	   The assessment was even bleaker than warnings given by the
environmental movement. It estimated that there were only 50,000 to
75,000 of the antelopes left in China in 1975, the official Xinhua
News Agency cited the report as saying.
	   ``They are now rarely seen, even in many places that used to be
the Tibetan antelope's major habitats, and the animal is now on the
edge of extinction,'' Xinhua quoted the report as saying.
	   Nature reserves and increased game warden patrols have failed to
stop illegal hunting, and antelope herds are dwindling, the report
said.
	   One of China's best-organized environmental campaigners, Friends
of Nature, earlier this year estimated that 75,000 to 100,000
chirus were left in the wild and that the current rate of poaching
would kill off the species in 20 years.

THE HAGUE: life sentence.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   But their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to allow her to be questioned again and to hear evidence
from experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.

	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija becomes the first Bosnian Croat convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to
broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim
prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the infamous Omarska
camp in northwest Bosnia.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian rocket carrying two satellites blasted
off from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northwestern Russia on
Thursday, a news report said.
	   The Kosmos-3M booster rocket carried into orbit a Russian
satellite called Nadezhda _ meaning ``hope'' _ and a Swedish
scientific satellite, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Nadezhda will join a satellite network shared by Russia and the
United States that locates ships and planes that need to be rescued
and sends SOS messages to monitoring centers.
	   The Russian satellite has a two-year service life and weighs
more than 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds). It will be put into a 1,000
kilometer (620 mile) orbit.
	   Sweden's Astrid-2 satellite is made up of scientific instruments
to measure electric and magnetic fields in the earth's atmosphere.
	   The 35-kilogram (77-pound) satellite can also be used to monitor
ultraviolet rays near the polar icecaps and measure the absorption
of ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere, Interfax said.

Jubilant Juventus, off cup miracle, heads to Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ One down, one to go.
	   Facing two must-win games in less than a week, Juventus of Turin
took care of the first task _ earning a Champions League
quarterfinal spot _ and now takes on Serie A leader Fiorentina
needing a victory to get back into the domestic title chase.
	   A loss in Sunday's 13th round would leave the two-time defending
league titlists 10 points off the pace.
	   ``We're going to enjoy this,'' striker Filippo Inzaghi said of
Juve's 2-0 cup win over Norway's Rosenborg on Wednesday, ``but
right away we have to go back and concentrate on the league. We're
sure we can get back on track, and this success could really turn
things around decisively.''
	   Juventus needs to do nothing short of that.
	   With star striker Alessandro Del Piero out for the season after
knee ligament surgery, the club has been struggling. It is winless
in its last five league games and has been shut out in four
straight.
	   Fiorentina (8-1-3) heads the standings with 25 points, followed
by AS Roma and AC Parma _ who square off Sunday _ with 22 apiece.
AC Milan is next with 21, three points ahead of the two clubs
touted as the strongest title contenders: Internazionale of Milan
and Juventus.
	   In addition to the big clashes at Florence and at Parma,
Sunday's games are Milan vs. Vicenza, Udinese vs. Internazionale,
Bari vs. Empoli, Bologna vs. Salernitana, Lazio of Rome vs.
Sampdoria of Genoa, Perugia vs. Cagliari, and Venezia vs. Piacenza.
	   Juventus has been downright mediocre of late, as its 5-3-4
league mark and record of 12 goals scored and 13 allowed indicate.
But it has a core of players _ from 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi and
Uruguayan center back Paolo Montero to French World Cup heroes
Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps _ who are used to success and
find ways to win.
	   Fiorentina, by contrast, is enjoying its first ride atop the
standings since 1982. Juventus has won five titles since then _ and
a record 25 overall.
	   Fiorentina does have a strong lineup, with its best defense in
years and Argentine forward Gabriel Batistuta scoring in bunches.
He has 12 goals in as many games so far, on pace to break the
single-season scoring record of 33. Fiery Brazilian Edmundo has 4
goals, making them the top duo in Italy.
	   Right behind them, with 15 goals, is Roma's tandem of Marco
Delvecchio (8) and Francesco Totti (7). Taking advantage of Czech
coach Zdenek Zeman's attack-at-all-costs philosophy, Roma leads the
league with 26 goals, better than 2 per game.
	   On Sunday, they come face to face with the league's best
defense: Parma has allowed only five goals, putting it on pace to
break the all-time record low of 15 in a 34-game season.
	   Roma's problem could be defense. Four starters could miss the
game with injury: 'keeper Antonio Chimenti and defenders Cafu and
Zago of Brazil plus Cameroon's Pierre Wome. The good news is that
Austrian 'keeper Michael Konsel, who lost his starting job when he
underwent surgery in August, appears set to return.

Bosnian Croat paramilitary chief found guilty of allowing rape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conviction of Bosnian Croat commander. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat paramilitary
commander was convicted of war crimes Thursday for failing to
prevent a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes
counts for failing to stop the rape and then taking no action
against the rapist.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in
prison. He had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   But their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to allow her to be questioned again and to hear evidence
from experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija becomes the first Bosnian Croat convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to
broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim
prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the infamous Omarska
camp in northwest Bosnia.

Pope: Persevere in ensuring human rights for all
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Citing ``serious and continuous violations
of human rights,'' Pope John Paul II urged nations Thursday to
persevere in securing basic freedoms for all.
	   The pope's comments were in a message to the U.N. General
Assembly on the 50th anniversary of the human rights charter.
	   ``Let's make sure that the Declaration of Human Rights does not
become just a monument to admire, or worse, a document for the
archives,'' the pontiff said.
	   The U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights.
	   The pope said the charter had ``permitted the development of
international law,'' and ``allowed millions of men and women to
live with more dignity.''
	   But, the world still faces the ``challenge'' of guaranteeing
human rights, which requires perseverance and creativity, the pope
said.

Four opposition leaders detained for distributing leaflets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police detained four opposition
leaders on Thursday as they distributed political leaflets, the
opposition Parti Rakyat Malaysia said.
	   They were Abdul Razak Ahmad, the party's deputy president, and
two of its senior members, Hassan Abdul Karim and Mohd Salleh Haji
Haji Ahmad.
	   A leader of a second opposition party, Mrs. Chan Yoke Lam of the
Democratic Action Party, was also detained, the Parti Rakyat said
in a statement.
	   They were arrested Thursday evening in the city of Johor Bahru,
360 kilometers (216 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, while
distributing party pamphlets.
	   Parti Rakyat demands they should be released immediately, the
statement said.

Official says a friendlier China better for relations with Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Recent friendlier policies by China toward
Taiwan raise the chances of a president being elected here in 2000
who would steer the island toward closer relations with Beijing, a
top official said Thursday.
	   Stable relations between the sides contributed to a sense of
security in Taiwan that boosted the ruling Nationalist Party in
Saturday's elections, said Lin Chong-pin, a vice chairman of the
cabinet's Mainland Affairs Commission.
	   China should take the election result as a cue to expand
contacts with Taiwan and restore reconciliation dialogue that it
suspended in 1995 in anger over Taipei's bid to raise its
international profile, Lin said.
	   The Nationalists, who advocate eventual reunification with
China, were credited by voters with keeping relations with China on
an even keel.
	   The ruling party took 123 of 225 seats in the legislature and
recovered the mayorship of Taipei from the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates formal independence
from China _ a stance that many Taiwanese fear would lead to a
military attack from the mainland.
	   Though talks remain stalled, China has moved gradually towards a
rapprochement with Taiwan over the past year.
	   China accepted a visit by Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu,
in October and has agreed to send its top envoy to Taiwan next
spring.
	   Politicians espousing independence and a more confrontational
stance towards Beijing were battered in the polls. The tiny Taiwan
Independence Party won only one of the 18 seats it contested.
	   That contrasted with the DPP's sweeping victory in 1997's local
elections.
	   Taiwan and China separated during civil war in 1949, and Beijing
still considers the island a renegade province to be retaken by
force if necessary.

UNICEF says sanctions wrecking Iraqi education system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly half of Iraqi schoolchildren do not
have desks to sit at, and enrollment rates are plummeting from the
impact of U.N. sanctions, a UNICEF official said Thursday.
	   Philippe Heffinck, the group's representative in Baghdad, said
4,520 schools need rehabilitation and that the number of teachers
in Iraq is declining by 10 percent every year.
	   ``There has been a steady deterioration over the past eight
years of education in the country,'' he told a news conference.
``To reverse that trend, it's going to require massive
investment.''
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions, which include an oil embargo, can
only be lifted once U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's weapons of
mass destructions have been eliminated.
	   Before the Kuwait invasion, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War,
Iraq had one of the highest literacy rates in the Arab world.
School attendance was mandatory, and the government spent heavily
on schools, books and supplies.
	   Citing government figures, Heffinck said 1 million Iraqi
students _ 20 percent of the total _ did not enroll this year.
About 47 percent of students do not have desks to sit at, he said.
	   Iraq's education budget went from dlrs 500 million before the
war to less than 10 percent of that figure today, he said.

South Koreans win taekwondo gold rush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan intruded again on South Korea's
party at Asian Games taekwondo competition Thursday, but the
sport's home nation still won three more gold medals.
	   That left the Koreans with 11 of the 16 golds awarded at these
games. Taiwan finished with three golds, and Vietnam and Iran had
one each.
	   Thursday's semifinal and final rounds were unmarred by the
controversy that had dogged the three previous days' action, when
rowdy spectators and discontented competitors staged disruptive
protests.
	   Taiwan's lone winner Thursday was Chen Yi-an, who handily
defeated Nepal's Sabita Rajbhanari 8-1 in the women's featherweight
division. Chen, who towered over her foe, was cheered on by a large
and loud crowd of Taiwanese boosters.
	   In the semifinals, Chen had conquered Soo Lai-yin of Malaysia
7-3, and Sabita beat Thailand's Pridi Pansombut 2-1.
	   South Korea's Kim Je-young, the Asian Games defending champion,
won the men's heavyweight division gold with a 7-3 victory over
Jordan's Ibrahim Kamal.
	   He had defeated Hassan Aslani of Iran 3-0 in the semifinals,
where Kamal, 19, won 2-1 against Vietnam's Nguyen Van Hung.
	   The losers in the semifinal rounds share the bronze medals.
	   The women's heavyweight gold went to South Korea's Jung
Myoung-sook, who won 3-1 over Lee Wan-yuen of Malaysia.
	   In the semifinals, Jung beat Margarita Bonifacio of the
Philippines 4-0, and Lee defeated Sinta-Berlian Heru of Indonesia
7-3.
	   In the men's featherweight final, Kang Nam-won of South Korea
defeated a bigger and more flamboyant Donald-David Geisler of the
Philippines 7-1.
	   Kang also had won a gold medal at the Asian Championships
earlier this year.
	   In the semifinals, Kang had beaten Bijan Moghanloo of Iran 5-1,
and Geisler defeated Hsu Chi-hung of Taiwan 4-3.

Border police catch two Nepalese smuggling tiger bones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese border police have caught two Nepalese
trying to smuggle the skeletons of two tigers out of Tibet.
	   Border police found 49 kilograms (107 pounds) of tiger bones
inside the suitcases of two nervous-looking Nepalese men last
month, the Tibet Daily reported on Dec. 1. The report did not
provide further details.
	   A belief, especially among Chinese, that tiger body parts and
bones have medicinal properties has created a lucrative market and
caused the animal to be hunted to near extinction in Asia.

Spanish judge indicts Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge driving efforts to bring former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial on
Thursday completed the criminal indictment of the aging general who
is currently detained in Britain pending extradition proceedings.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for crimes committed
during his virulently anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began
with a bloody coup against elected president Salvador Allende.
Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets.
	   Earlier Garzon charged Pinochet with genocide, torture and
terrorism in the deaths of more than 3,000 suspected political
dissidents during his rule, but it is not clear if he was indicted
Thursday on all of the same charges.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue. Legal experts expect it will be several months or even
years before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be
extradited.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic on a
warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite
Pinochet.
	   The arrest and subsequent indictment are backed by evidence in
two years of Spanish judicial probes into government human rights
abuses in Chile. The victims included Spaniards.

as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   But their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to let her be questioned again and to hear evidence from
experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers,''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces in attacking Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija becomes the first Bosnian Croat convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to
broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim
prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the infamous Omarska
camp in northwest Bosnia.

Israeli warplanes repeatedly break sound barrier over Beirut

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over a nervous Beirut for the second day Thursday, prompting
Lebanon to seek U.N. help in ending the ``sonic bombardment'' of
the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut _ still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _
is on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings and set off the alarms of vehicles on
Thursday.
	   The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people who were frightened by
similar deafening bangs a day earlier.
	   The Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday,
including the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking
cover for fear the city was under attack.
	   Many here still remember Israel's 1982 invasion of Beirut, when
the city came under heavy air and naval attack.
	   The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least
175 people.
	   During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gun ships rocketed
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two
power stations in hills overlooking the capital.
	   Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon
on Thursday.
	   Asked Wednesday about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman
said: ``We do not divulge movements of the air force.'' The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under Israeli rules, would not
comment further.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   On Thursday, Hoss called on a special multinational committee
that monitors a 1996 truce to discuss the flights because they are
``terrifying the civilian population, especially children,'' Beirut
Radio reported.
	   Hoss also said Lebanon would ask U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to intercede with Israel.
	   He briefed diplomats representing the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Britain, France,
China and Russia _ on Lebanon's position, the radio said.
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper described the Israeli action in a
front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.''
	   The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fight to drive
Israeli troops and their allied militiamen from southern Lebanon,
where the Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in
1985 to protect its northern settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for most of the attacks on the Israeli soldiers last
month.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said Thursday that accepting the Nobel Peace Prize doesn't
mean their efforts to end 30 years of violence in the British
province have ended.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said the prize was for an
incomplete peace. The peace accord reached in April has yet to be
implemented, with Trimble insisting he won't let Irish Republican
Army supporters into a new government for Northern Ireland unless
the IRA starts to disarm.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished,'' Trimble said.
	   ''The paramilitaries are finished. But the politics are not
finished,'' he said, vowing to see the accord implemented.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome.''
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that led to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that later
fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted. But, he said,
there could be no turning back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accepted their awards, which include
a gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   About 4,000 Norwegian school children, signing songs and
carrying the flags of many nations, gathered outside of the city
hall in a peace parade, with Hume and Trimble stopping to light
their peace torch before the ceremony.
	   Inside, Trimble and Hume stood together, appearing solemn, as
they displayed the prizes to the applauding audience.
	   The ceremony was being held against a backdrop of rising crisis
in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA, nearly 17 months into a
truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its secret
stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   In his speech Trimble emphasized why a symbolic start to
disarmament was so important now to Protestants. Trimble's
long-postponed demand has often been criticized by Hume's SDLP as
pointless, since the IRA could always smuggle in new weaponry, and
counterproductive since it put the IRA truce under unnecessary
pressure.
	   Noting he had never asked for specific amounts of weaponry on
specific dates, Trimble said: ``All I have asked for is a credible
beginning. All I have asked for is that they say the so-called war
is over. And that is proved by such a beginning.
	   ``That is not too much to ask for,'' Trimble said, taking aim at
Hume's position. ``Nor is it too much to ask that the reformist
party of Irish nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.''
	   Turning to the IRA's allied political party, he said: ``Any
further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein
are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking
from the dark stream of fascism.''	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,,'' said
Hume. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in the pursuit of
political goals,'' Hume said. ``The challenge now, is to grasp and
shape history.''
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and the others in Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge driving efforts to bring former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial on
Thursday completed the criminal indictment of the aging general who
is currently detained in Britain pending extradition proceedings.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for crimes committed
during his virulently anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began
with a bloody coup against elected president Salvador Allende.
Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets.
	   Earlier Garzon charged Pinochet with genocide, torture and
terrorism related to the deaths of more than 3,000 people during
his crackdown on political opposition, but it is not clear if he
was indicted Thursday on all of the same charges.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue. Legal experts expect it will be several months or even
years before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be
extradited.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic on a
warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite
Pinochet.
	   The arrest and subsequent indictment are backed by evidence in
two years of Spanish judicial probes into government human rights
abuses in Chile. The victims included Spaniards.

New Swiss president plans to confront U.S., Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's first Jewish president plans to be
more outspoken toward the United States and Jewish organizations
over World War II issues, she said in an interview Thursday.
	   ``I have always refused to speak as the token Jew of our
government,'' said Ruth Dreifuss, elected Wednesday by parliament
to the one-year presidency for 1999. ``It will be different in my
role as president, which gives me much clearer legitimacy.''
	   ``It's an opportunity I intend to seize both in this country and
abroad,'' she said.
	   Dreifuss was quoted by the daily Le Temps saying she previously
held back comments on the search for the assets of Holocaust
victims in Swiss banks during the past 3 1/2 years, when
international Jewish organizations and the U.S. government have
heavily criticized Switzerland.
	   Her portfolio has been that of interior minister, responsible
for issues like health and social security in the seven-member
coalition Cabinet that tries to govern by consensus.
	   She said the election gave her ``a great chance'' to contribute
to the debate about neutral Switzerland's role in World War II and
its efforts to repair any wrongdoing the Swiss committed toward
Nazi victims.
	   Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust than other
Cabinet members, and that her personal and family history had given
her special insight.
	   Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon after the outbreak of World War
II, to a Swiss Jewish family.
	   She said she could empathize both with the 27,000 Jewish
refugees allowed into Switzerland and the 30,000 who were turned
back during the war.
	   Dreifuss has said she thinks the Swiss government should
compensate Jews who were sent back. The Nazis sent many of the
returnees straight into concentration camps.
	   A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come
next spring when an international panel of historians appointed by
the Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy,
Dreifuss said.
	   ``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she
said. ``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish
organizations where they are totally justified and legitimate in
their demands and where they are less so.''
	   She said she knows the United States and the way the
international Jewish community functions better than her
colleagues.
	   Dreifuss, also the first woman to be president, said, ``the
election of a Jewish female president of the confederation
demonstrates that what would have been impossible just a few years
ago has become normal.''

Bayern closer to recapturing past glory, but needs new stars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ One day after his team reached the
quarterfinals of the Champions League, Bayern Munich coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld said Thursday he needs new players to be able to rule
Europe for several years.
	   ``We have to strengthen ourselves for the next season to be able
to keep the standard, meet the lofty goals expected of us and stay
among the top teams in Europe,'' Hitzfeld said.
	   ``I want to win the Champions League at some point with Bayern
and I want to have one of the best teams in Europe _ and not for
one season, but for several years in a row,'' Hitzfeld said.
	   Hitzfeld won the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund in 1987
and was hired by Bayern at the start of the season to do the same
for the Bavarian club.
	   The club's roster now has 20 internationals from five nations
and Hitzfeld has instituted a rotation system to give most of the
stars a fairly equal opportunity to play.
	   Bayern qualified for the quarterfinals by playing to a 1-1 draw
at Manchester United and won its group ahead of United and
Barcelona.
	   ``We lagged behind for many years but now we are where we belong
_ among the best in Europe,'' said manager Uli Hoeness. ``It was
very important for our reputation.''
	   Bayern has been seeking to recapture the most prestigious club
trophy in Europe ever since the generation of Franz Beckenbauer and
Gerd Mueller won the last of its three consecutive crowns in 1976.
	   It has not reached the final since losing to Porto in 1987.
	   After losing its opening game to underdog Brondby, Bayern never
lost again in the next five games to win its group.
	   ``After the bad start I did not believe that we would make it,''
said Beckenbauer, who is now the chairman of Bayern.
	   ``But the players showed character and we can be proud,'' he
said.
	   Hitzfeld said Bayern had a good chance of reaching the
semifinals.
	   ``If you leave Manchester and Barcelona behind you and you don't
lose against them, that shows the strength of Bayern Munich,'' the
coach said. ``We don't have to fear any team in Europe.''
	   Except perhaps Kaiserslautern, the second German
quarterfinalist.
	   ``Kaiserslautern would be a real punishment,'' said defender
Markus Babbel.
	   Manager Hoeness admitted that he always fears Kaiserslautern,
which stole the Bundesliga title from Bayern last season.
	   Bayern lost against another German team (Borussia Dortmund) at
the same stage last season.
	   Beckenbauer said Bayern fans would prefer to see a foreign team
than watch another Bundesliga rival.
	   Kaiserslautern coach Otto Rehhagel, who had a brief stint at
Bayern, also said he would like to avoid the fellow Germans in the
next round.
	   ``There are only top teams left, but it doesn't have to be
Bayern,'' he said.
	   Bayern's next challenge comes Sunday, when it tries to regain
the Bundesliga lead from Bayer Leverkusen in a direct showdown.

Boston residents nabbed in FBI drug-money sting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th to REMOVE extraneous word. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Three Boston-area residents were arrested in a New
York-based FBI sting aimed at Russian organized crime groups,
according to published reports.
	   One of the suspects was a BankBoston employee, The Boston Globe
and the Boston Herald reported today.
	   The papers said the FBI investigation was part of an attack on a
multimillion dollar drug money scheme with ties to Russian
organized crime groups.
	   The nine people charged, all from Russia or other former Soviet
republics, allegedly laundered $2.7 million in drug money _ mostly
$5, $10 and $20 bills _ for undercover agents posing as Colombian
smugglers, according to indictments unsealed Wednesday.
	   Court papers allege the money was laundered through banks in
Boston, New York, Antigua and Switzerland then drawn out again in
check form.
	   A 24-year-old customer service representative at a BankBoston
branch in West Newton _ Oksana Galchanskaya _ was charged with
``processing transactions through various accounts while avoiding
certain bank and federal regulations.''
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Huggard said Galchanskaya
authorized and issued numerous checks, apparently without
permission from the ``account holder,'' from two of 64 different
accounts allegedly used in the scheme.
	   The indictment alleges the accounts were ``frequently
replenished with large wire transfers from accounts in New York and
Switzerland.''
	   Galchanskaya is scheduled to appear for another hearing today.
	   Also arrested were Roman Luban, 44, and Samuil Lyubomirsky, 41,
both of Newton, who allegedly received the checks from the two
Boston accounts and transferred them to bank accounts belonging to
the drug smugglers, who were actually undercover agents.

Chelsea can go top by winning at Derby
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ From sixth to first in four days.
	   Gianluca Vialli's Chelsea could jump to the top of the English
soccer league for the first time since 1989 by winning at Derby on
Saturday.
	   Unbeaten in the Premier League since the opening day of the
season, Vialli's team beat leader Aston Villa 2-1 on Wednesday to
move up three places to third.
	   And with Villa not in action until Sunday and second place
Manchester United facing a tough game at Tottenham, Vialli's team
can make it to the top.
	   He doesn't want to talk about it.
	   ``Despite us having a great run and everybody still being tuned
in, we know there is a long way to go,'' the former Sampdoria and
Juventus striker said.
	   ``The players are meeting everybody's expectations. We know
we've got a big chance to be successful. I'm not saying we're going
to win the league or the cups but we want to do our best and the
players are very responsible and professional.
	   ``It's up to us to go on like that and to keep our feet on the
floor.''
	   After beating Villa for the second time this season _ knocking
John Gregory's team out of the League Cup 4-1 _ Vialli has to get
his players focused on a more mundane visit to mid-standings Derby.
	   With Gianfranco Zola returning to form and Norwegian striker
proving his value as substitute with a last-minute winner, Chelsea
looked impressive against Villa and had the league leader under
pressure for almost the entire second half at Stamford Bridge.
	   But Derby's wily manager, Jim Smith, no doubt will have some
tricks up his sleeve when Chelsea's talented team of mainly
overseas stars arrive at Pride Park.
	   Powered by the goals and mercurial skills of Costa Rican forward
Paolo Wanchope, Smith's team lies 10th in the table and is capable
of beating the best or losing to the worst.
	   With Chelsea enjoying the eurphoria of beating the league
leader, Manchester United is basking in the glory of reaching the
last eight of the European Champions Cup.
	   Alex Ferguson's team achieved that with a 1-1 tie with Bayern
Munich on Wednesday and, after the excitement of qualifying for the
quarterfinal of Europe's premier club soccer tournament, Ferguson
has to get his players focused on a trip to White Hart Lane to meet
in-form Spurs.
	   Since George Graham took over, Tottenham has developed a steely
look to the team and now looks tough to beat. French star David
Ginola, urged by Graham to work a little harder and put his
undoubted talent to better use, is in standout form and the goals
have started to flow from Chris Armstrong.
	   By the time Villa gets to host defending titlist and fifth-place
Arsenal on Sunday, Gregory's team could be down in third, having
led the standings for two months.
	   The Gunners likely will have eight of their top players out
through injury, including Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel
Petit and Tony Adams, yet their replacements performed superbly in
their final Champions Cup game on Wednesday, winning 3-1 in Athens
against Panathinaikos.
	   Fourth place Leeds is not in action until Monday, when David
O'Leary's team hosts struggling Coventry.
	   Although his team has climbed since he took over from Graham at
Elland Road, O'Leary is playing down his own team's chances of
taking the title.
	   ``We're fourth in the league at the moment but in all honesty
we're only a top eight team,'' said the former Arsenal and Ireland
international center-back.
	   ``When the going really gets tough later on this season the
young kids, and there's six of them in the team, will get tired.
That's a fact.''
	   Seventh place Middlesbrough hosts West Ham, which slipped to
sixth after last week's 4-0 loss at Leeds, while Liverpool had the
tough task of reversing its slide to ninth when it visits
eight-place Wimbledon on Sunday.
	   Gerard Houllier's under fire Liverpool won't be helped by the
fact that it was outplayed for the second time by Spanish club
Celta Vigo on Tuesday, losing 1-0 at Anfield and tumbling tamely
out of the UEFA Cup.
	   A the other end of the standings, Blackburn manager Brian Kidd,
whose team climbed away from last in his first game in charge,
hopes for another good performance at home to Newcastle.
	   Rovers' victory over Charlton lifted the team two places and
dropped Southampton back to last. The Saints go to 15th place
Everton while next-to-last Nottingham Forest visits Leicester.
	   Sheffield Wednesday, 14th after edging Nottingham Forest, hopes
to gain three more points by beating 16th place Charlton at home.
	   Four points clear in division one, Sunderland should profit from
a home game against second from last Port Vale while second place
Ipswich hosts mid-standings Barnsley.
	   Rangers and Kilmarnock, first and second in the Scottish Premier
League and level on points, meet at Ibrox Saturday. Third place and
defending titlist Celtic, which has five points to make up, visits
Dundee United.

Meissnitzer wins second Super-G

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Despite an ``imperfect'' run,
Alexandra Meissnitzer's performance Thursday was easily superior to
the rest of the women's Super-G field, earning the Austrian her
third World Cup win of the season.
	   Under clear, sunny skies, the 25-year-old skier blitzed down the
glittery 1,985-meter (6,512-foot) Piste-G course in 1 minute, 21.95
seconds, leaving the rest of the field in her spray.
	   Winning the Super-G for the second time at this classic World
Cup event, Meissnitzer finished a convincing 0.79 seconds ahead of
Germany's Martina Ertl, who is still winless this season.
	   ``I was aggressive from the start to the bottom,'' said
Meissnitzer, who won here in 1996. ``But it was a very difficult
course and you just couldn't ski without mistakes. My run was
certainly far from perfect.''
	   ``It was also difficult to make the transition from the race in
Mammoth Mountain, which was a child's race, to the race here, which
is so technically difficult,'' added Meissnitzer.
	   Ertl also acknowledged the course was tough, and admitted having
underestimated its level of difficulty.
	   ``During the inspection run I didn't evaluate the course
properly,'' said Ertl, who won one Super-G last season. ``So I
ended up skiing too defensively and lost time because of that. It
probably comes from my lack of confidence at the moment.''
	   Regine Cavagnoud's confidence in her ability was far from
lacking, the Frenchwoman ignoring her coaches' advice in favor of
her own instincts.
	   The gamble paid off, Cavagnoud finishing third in 1:22.94, to
the delight of the home crowd.
	   ``I chose a low start number because I didn't want to receive
any information about the course or be told what to do by the
coaches,'' said Cavagnoud, who posted her best Super-G result since
1993. ``I wanted to run this race my way.''
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion,
crossed fourth in 1:23.08.
	   Germany's Regina Haeusl placed fifth, 1.14 adrift, while
Stefanie Schuster of Austria finished sixth in 1:23.18.
	   Renate Geotschl, winner of both downhills this season and second
at the Super-G in Mammoth Mountain last week, finished seventh,
1.30 seconds back.
	   Coming into the season with three career World Cup victories,
Meissnitzer has since doubled that number, winning the
season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, as well as a giant
slalom in Park City, Utah three weeks ago.
	   It was her fourth career World Cup Super-G win.
	   The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the rankings, where she
sits with 525 points. Ertl's second place finish, however,
prevented Meissnitzer from digging too wide a gap, sticking close
to her heels with 383.
	   The Super-G standings are of an identical order, Meissnitzer
topping the table with 240, 100 points ahead of Ertl in second.
	   The battle for the lead in the overall competition promises to
be fierce, with both women determined to prevail, and each with
their own trump card.
	   While Meissnitzer appears to have the edge over Ertl in the
speed events, the Austrian doesn't race in the slalom, one of
Ertl's stronger suits.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the overall,'' said Ertl. ``I'm
astonished at my results in the downhill and I hope my skills in
the slalom will give me an edge in the overall.''
	   Running the slalom gives Ertl the opportunity to collect extra
points in the combined event as well.
	   Clearly dominating since the start of the season, holding the
lead in every discipline, the Austrians placed five skiers in the
top ten.
	   Germany, weakened by the absence of double Olympic gold medalist
Katja Seizinger, had three in the top ten.
	   Seizinger, the overall, downhill and Super-G World Cup champion
last year, announced at the start of the week that her injured
knees would keep her out of competition for the entire season.

Thousands of workers take to streets to protest poverty

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some 5,000 workers marched through the
capital Thursday, throwing firecrackers to protest falling living
standards, threatened job cuts and what they see as the
government's failure to reform the economy.
	   ``We want to work not beg,'' chanted angry workers from the
defense, subway, energy and heavy industry sectors who gathered in
a central square. Workers, some of who had not received their
salaries for months, came from cities around the country.
	   Workers also asked the government to allocate more money to
health and education. Unions claim the government could get extra
funds from the underground economy which accounts for 35 percent of
Romania's economic activity last year. Most of the money is in
customs' tax evasion.
	   In the Transylvanian city of Brasov, some 150 kilometers (95
miles) northwest of the capital, about 800 employees at the IAR
Ghimbav airplane manufacturers took to the streets to protest
possible job cuts.
	   The government has said that it will axe some 70,000 jobs at
state enterprises in coming months as it closes down loss-making
companies to cut debts to the Romanian economy by 15 percent.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile tried during two days of talks to
convince trade unions leaders to cease street protests for six
months while reforms are implemented.
	   Some unions accepted and others refused. Some 170,000 workers
have already been laid off this year. Unemployment is about 9
percent.
	   The National Bloc of Trade Unions which represents 600,000
workers said on Friday they would stage protests outside the houses
of the prime minister, President Emil Constantinescu, and other
ministers in charge with reform.
	   The government promised IAR Ghimbav to find a foreign investor
by Dec. 1, but the deadline expired. Workers were sent home and are
receiving a part of their salary.
	   Negotiations between IAR Ghimbav and U.S. Bell Helicopter
Textron for a joint venture failed to materialize in a deal this
year.
	   Bell was asking the Romania army to buy 96 attack helicopters as
part of the deal which would cost the cash-strapped government dlrs
1.45 billion.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Throwing its weight behind
charges that racism was keeping nonwhites off national sports
teams, the governing African National Congress on Thursday promised
legislation to rectify the problem.
	   In a statement, the ANC charged that both cricket and rugby
teams, which often field all-white sides against international
opponents, were not trying hard enough to promote talented players
of other races.
	   ``Both the rugby and cricket national teams remain lily-white
despite their much publicized development programs in previously
disadvantaged communities,'' the party said.
	   Without specifying what sort of laws it would draw up, the ANC
promised to propose legislation next year to enforce more racially
representative sides.
	   The attack follows similar pronouncements by the National Sports
Council and Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, who has announced the
creation of a special commission to explore integration efforts.
	   The cricket team added a mixed-race player to its all-white
lineup for this season's second test against the mostly black West
Indies, which started Thursday.
	   The rugby team that lost to England in its last match on Dec. 5
was all-white. The fact that the only English try was scored by a
black, Jeremy Guscott, was an irony not lost on the 89 percent of
South Africa's population that is not white.
	   During years of international sporting isolation in the
apartheid era, many blacks and coloreds, as people of mixed race
are called in South Africa, refused to support their national teams
and the feeling of hostility to all-white selections has lingered.
	   Rugby, beloved of the white Afrikaners who dominated apartheid
governments, is still hated by many blacks who see it as a symbol
of oppression.
	   Soccer has a largely black following, and the national team is
mainly black. White soccer fans tend to root for English clubs.

Prisoners smuggle out plea to Clinton out of Israeli jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian prisoners have smuggled a
plea for their freedom out of an Israeli jail to U.S. President
Bill Clinton, and a copy of the letter was released Thursday.
	   The United States is trying to resolve the bitter dispute
between Israel and the Palestinians over prisoner releases that is
threatening to derail the Wye River land-for-security accord.
Clinton is arriving Saturday for a 4-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas.
	   Israel has said it has met its obligations under the Wye
agreement by releasing 250 prisoners _ most common criminals _ last
month, the first group of a total of 750 to be freed by the end of
January.
	   The Palestinians say say they had been given to understand that
all those freed would be prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities
and have accused Israel of violating the Wye accord.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States is
trying to get Israel to accept a compromise under which Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. officials will review prisoner lists name by
name and see whose release would be acceptable to all sides.
	   About 2,000 so-called security prisoners are held by Israel and
most have been on a hunger strike for a week.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser,
David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   In recent days, Palestinian marches for the release of prisoners
turned violent. On Wednesday, thousands threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas. A
17-year-old Palestinian was killed and scores of others were
wounded.
	   The prisoners' letter, written Nov. 22 in Nafha Prison, was
smuggled out and delivered to officials at the U.S. Consulate in
Jerusalem this week, said Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian
Prisoners' Association. A copy of the letter was obtained by The
Associated Press on Thursday.
	   The letter, handwritten in English in tiny letters on a page of
lined paper ripped out of a notebook, implores the U.S. president
to take serious steps to win their release.
	   The letter begins with the traditional Islamic blessing, ``In
the name of God,'' and continues: ``Mr. President Clinton _ Hi, how
are you, hoping you doing OK.''
	   It describes how their continued presence in jail has dashed
their hopes for a better future. ``We were fighters before the
peace to achieve our rights, and now we are prisoners looking
forward to be free, to build our country,'' the letter said.
	   As part of the protests, two tents simulating conditions in
Israeli prisons have been set up in Gaza City, where Clinton will
be on Monday.
	   In one tent, 62 protesters _ most former prisoners _ were on a
hunger strike led by Sufian Abu Zaideh, a deputy leader of the
Palestinian Prisoners Association.
	   ``Its not logical to sign a peace agreement with the leader,
while the soldiers remain in jail,'' Abu Zaideh said.
	   About half the prisoners are members of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, while the others belong to the
Islamic militant group Hamas which opposes the peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have not contested that Hamas prisoners will
not be eligible for early release. Still, the spiritual leader of
the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, joined the hunger strike Wednesday.
Yassin was placed under house arrest by Arafat in October.

Refugee conference calls on Africa to face up to the problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Sudanese rebels criticism of government

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Africa must face up to the problem of its
8 million refugees and bear the responsibility, the Organization of
African Unity said here Thursday.
	   Opening a pan-African conference on refugees, the assistant
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Daniel
Antonio, said host countries were experiencing ``fatigue' and
donors were suffering ``donor fatigue.''
	   The continent had to ``shoulder its responsibility,'' he said.
The refugee problem was caused by ``war, internal conflict, human
rights abuses and natural catastrophes.''
	   Antonio told the delegates, who represent some 40 African
states, that they had to find a solution to the problem as it was
affecting their countries' economic development and causing
instability.
	   ``Africa has to come up with a new strategy for the welfare of
all Africans,'' he said. ``This is a big challenge, but is is a
noble challenge.''
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the approximately 8
million refugees in Africa represent an increase of 500 percent
over the 1993 figures.
	   Another 15 million people have been displaced by war and famine.
	   Sudan says it hosts at least 1.1 million refugees, mainly from
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Its government complains that foreign
aid to the refugees has dropped from about dlrs 111 per head in
1985 to a mere dlrs 7 in 1997.
	   ``We are shouldering the burden of some 95 percent of the
refugees on our soil,'' said the Sudanese commissioner for
refugees, Mohammed Alagbash, told The Associated Press on Thursday.
``This is too much for our resources.''
	   In Eritrea, a spokesman for the main Sudanese guerrilla faction,
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, said this week it was ironic
that the conference was taking place in Khartoum, considering the
government's ``bad record on refugees.''
	   ``The Sudanese government is convening an all-Africa conference
for refugees while the government has forced millions of Sudanese
refugees to scatter around the world,'' Yassir Arman said in the
Eritrean capital, Asmara.
	   The SPLA has waged an insurgency since 1983. It is supported by
the mainly Christian and animist peoples of southern Sudan who seek
autonomy from the Muslim and Arab peoples of the north.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
attendant famines and an estimated 4 million Sudanese have been
displaced.

Tribesmen blow up U.S.-owned oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen blew up a pipeline operated
by an American company on Thursday, apparently to try to force the
government to pay for development projects in their region,
security and tribal officials said.
	   An explosive device set off at dawn damaged the pipeline owned
by the Hunt Oil Co., setting it ablaze, according to a tribal
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   The pipeline carries oil from the Safer field in Marib province
to a port on the Red Sea.
	   The tribesmen are believed to be members of the Jahm tribe,
which carried out similar attacks in the past.
	   The latest incident occurred near Wadi Hayyab. It is not far
from Saraweh, where the pipeline was hit on Dec. 2.
	   The fire, which was still burning late Thursday, was being fed
by crude that leaked from the broken line, security officials said,
also on condition their names not be used.
	   Hunt Oil Co. officials estimated the leak at about 1,500
barrels. They, too, asked for anonymity.
	   In the past, repairs have taken from four days to a week.
	   Members of the Jahm tribe, who claimed similar incidents in the
past, say they want the government to build power plants and a
water distribution system in their region.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.
	   Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib produces
165,000 barrels per day. The company employs 1,300 Yemeni staff in
addition to 30 foreign workers.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Citing a global economic slowdown and the risk of
deflation, the Bank of England cut a key lending rate by half a
percentage point Thursday _ the third cut in as many months.
	   The bank reduced its base rate for loans to commercial banks
from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent. Building societies and banks
immediately announced a drop in mortgage rates.
	   Analysts and businesses welcomed the move, but warned of a sharp
downturn in the British economy.
	   ``A cut of at least half a percent was essential to boost
flagging consumer demand before the Christmas period and also to
help encourage sterling on its downward path,'' said Ian Peters,
deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.
	   Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at NatWest brokers, called the
decision ``a clear sign that the authorities are becoming concerned
about the risk of deflation in the economy rather than inflation.''
	   Union representatives criticized the cut, calling for a full
one-point fall in interest rates to avoid higher unemployment
levels.
	   The half-percent reduction was a ``pathetic response,'' union
leader John Edmonds said, adding that the bank's monetary committee
members ``seem to be living in a parallel universe. They should
come into the real world.''
	   A 19.2-point morning rise on the Financial Times Stock Exchange
100 index of leading British stocks jumped to a 36-point increase
after the midday announcement, reaching 5,705.1.
	   On Dec. 3, the 11 European Union countries that have signed up
to the European single currency coordinated a rate cut that sent
most of their national interest rates to 3 percent.
	   Analysts called the move a key step in preparing for monetary
and economic union, and said the difference between British and
European interest rates is likely to fuel pressure for Britain to
join the new European currency after its launch on Jan. 1.
	   ``Even after today's cut, British interest rates are over twice
the level of our European competitors and sterling is still about
10 percent overvalued,'' said Malcolm Bruce from the Liberal
Democrat Party, which supports closer European integration.

English-language plaque at Polish war monument full of errors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ City officials trying to make the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier more accessible to foreign tourists apparently
don't know something themselves _ how to proofread English.
	   An English-language plaque put up at the war monument in
downtown Warsaw a month ago has several errors, while two other
plaques, in Polish and German, appear to be error-free.
	   ``It is a shame,'' said Wayne Rentoul of Townsville, Australia,
who stopped at the monument Thursday while touring Warsaw with his
wife. ``It shows a little disrespect because it is a very important
place.''
	   The Tomb, established in 1925, includes a coffin with ashes of
an unidentified Polish soldier killed during the 1918
Polish-Ukrainian war and urns with soil from 14 other historic
battlefields.
	   Foreign dignitaries on official visits routinely place wreaths
at the monument, the site of state celebrations of Poland's
Independence Day on Nov. 11 and Constitution Day on May 3.
	   Most of the errors appear to be typographical.
	   ``The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier marker the place where the
Poles' aspiration to independence and freedom bah pursued,'' is
written in elegant brass on the English-language plaque.
	   It also mentions the ``fifficult'' post World War II era and
later incorrectly spells patriotic as ``patriotio.''
	   Krzysztof Mazurek, a spokesman for the Warsaw provincial
governor, said the problem was being addressed, but he was unable
to say when the plaque might be replaced.
	   Poland is one of three former Soviet bloc countries invited to
join NATO next year. One of the major requirements for bringing the
Polish military into conformance with NATO standards is better
English-language skills for officers and soldiers.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat paramilitary
commander was convicted of war crimes Thursday for failing to
prevent a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes
counts for doing nothing to stop the rape and then taking no action
against the rapist.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in
prison. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
faced a maximum life sentence.
	   Furundzija, wearing a dark suit, shirt and tie, looked unmoved
as the verdicts were read out. After hearing his sentence, he sat
down again and glanced up at his attorney, who did not say whether
he planned to appeal.
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Furundzija will serve his sentence in a jail in either Norway,
Finland or Italy, countries that have agreed to house prisoners
convicted by the tribunal.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to allow her to be questioned again and to hear evidence
from experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.
	   But presiding judge Florence Mumba of Zambia ruled the victim's
testimony was reliable even if she was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
	   ``The trial chamber ... accepts Witness A's testimony that she
has sufficiently recollected the material aspects of the relevant
events,'' Mumba said, reading extracts from a 100-page ruling
during Thursday's 15-minute hearing.
	   She added that ``expert evidence demonstrates that even when a
person is suffering from PTSD, she or he may still be a reliable
witness.''
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to
broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim
prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the infamous Omarska
camp in northwest Bosnia.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said Thursday that accepting the Nobel Peace Prize doesn't
mean an end to their efforts to end 30 years of violence in the
British province.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said the prize was for an
incomplete peace. The peace accord reached in April has yet to be
implemented, with Trimble insisting he won't let Irish Republican
Army supporters into a new government for Northern Ireland unless
the IRA starts to disarm.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished,'' Trimble said at the
Oslo ceremony.
	   ``The paramilitaries are finished. But the politics are not
finished,'' he said, vowing to see the accord implemented.
	   Winners of the literature, physics, chemistry, medicine and
economics prizes receive their prizes in an afternoon ceremony in
Stockholm.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome.''
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that led to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member selection committee has often used the prize to
nurture difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time
it has tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty
Williams and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that
later fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted. But, he said,
there could be no turning back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accepted their awards, which include
a gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   About 4,000 Norwegian school children, signing songs and
carrying the flags of many nations, gathered outside of the city
hall in a peace parade, with Hume and Trimble stopping to light
their peace torch before the ceremony.
	   Inside, Trimble and Hume stood together, appearing solemn, as
they displayed the prizes to the applauding audience.
	   The ceremony was being held against a backdrop of rising crisis
in Northern Ireland. The outlawed IRA, nearly 17 months into a
truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its secret
stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   In his speech Trimble emphasized why a symbolic start to
disarmament was so important to Protestants. Trimble's
long-postponed demand has often been criticized by Hume's SDLP
party as pointless, since the IRA could always smuggle in new
weaponry, and counterproductive since it put the IRA truce under
unnecessary pressure.
	   Noting he had never asked for specific amounts of weaponry on
specific dates, Trimble said: ``All I have asked for is a credible
beginning. All I have asked for is that they say the so-called war
is over. And that is proved by such a beginning.
	   ``That is not too much to ask for,'' Trimble said, taking aim at
Hume's position. ``Nor is it too much to ask that the reformist
party of Irish nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.''
	   Turning to the IRA's allied political party, he said: ``Any
further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein
are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking
from the dark stream of fascism.''
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,,'' said
Hume. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in the pursuit of
political goals,'' Hume said. ``The challenge now, is to grasp and
shape history.''
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Those who win the Nobel Peace Prize don't
get much peace and quiet when they come to the Norwegian capital to
receive the award.
	   This year's winners, John Hume and David Trimble of Northern
Ireland, have a heavy schedule of meetings, festivities and
appearances, all under the pressure of knowing the world is
watching.
	   It started with their arrival around midday Wednesday at Oslo's
international airport. They were quickly whisked by motorcade to
the center city, where they held a news conference and then were
guests of honor at the so-called ``Little Dinner'' given by the
five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee.
	   The high point for most laureates is the solemn awards ceremony
at the Oslo City Hall, where the winners give speeches to about
1,000 guests crowding the flower-bedecked hall.
	   Hume and Trimble were the first to see an event that organizers
hope will become a tradition: a parade of some 4,000 schoolchildren
through the snowy capital into the city hall's courtyard before the
Thursday award ceremony.
	   Hume spoke briefly to the kids in Norwegian, saying ''Mange
takk. Barn vil ha fred. (Many thanks. Children want peace.)''
	   Later, hundreds of people will join the traditional torch-light
parade through Oslo, ending with a salute to Hume and Trimble who
are expected to greet the crowd from their hotel balcony.
	   On Thursday evening, after the parades and ceremonies, the
laureates are expected at the annual black-tie Nobel Banquet, with
about 200 guests.
	   For four to five hours, waiters moving with the precision of
drill teams will serve course after course to banquette guests,
interupted only by sometimes lighthearted speeches and
entertainment.
	   Less than eight hours after the banquet usually ends, Hume and
Trimble are expected for meetings early Friday with Norwegian
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, then Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik and finally members of the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee.
	   On Friday evening, the laureates head to the annual Nobel
Concert, this year including performances by Phil Collins, Andrea
Bocelli, Alanis Morissette, The Cranberries, and the Norwegian pop
group A-Ha, reunited for the event.
	   Then, they're off to Stockholm, Sweden, where they are to take
part in a seminar on Saturday.

Asian soccer leaders call meeting to protest World Cup slots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian officials will hold an emergency
meeting Tuesday to launch a campaign against the decision by world
soccer authorities cutting the continent to two competitive
qualifying slots for the 2002 World Cup.
	   Japan and South Korea automatically will play in the Cup as
co-hosts, taking two of the four slots that the sport's world
governing body, FIFA, has decided to allocate Asia.
	   That means that 40-odd other Asian nations will be competing to
fill just two spots, a move members of the regional authority, the
Asian Football Confederaion, view as a reduction from the three
places Asia had at this year's World Cup in France.
	   ``The host always qualifies automatically,'' Zhang Jilong, a
Chinese member of the confederation's executive committee, argued
Thursday. ``You shouldn't take any of the other spots from the
continent because of that.''
	   The 17-member committee will gather in Bangkok next Tuesday to
decide what action to take to counter FIFA's decision. Zhang said
it wasn't clear what action would be taken, but noted feeling was
running high against the ruling.
	   ``We're getting a lot of complaints,'' Zhang said. ``We wouldn't
have an emergency meeting otherwise. You'll have to wait until it's
over to see what the result is.''
	   Many committee members are already in the Thai capital watching
their national sides compete in the Asian Games.
	   Japan, South Korea and Iran represented Asia at this year's
World Cup, with Zhang considering Oceania's entry as a sort of
half-Asian entry. None advanced beyond the first round.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat paramilitary
commander was convicted of war crimes Thursday for failing to
prevent a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes
counts for doing nothing to stop the rape and then taking no action
against the rapist.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in
prison. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
faced a maximum life sentence.
	   Furundzija, wearing a dark suit, shirt and tie, looked unmoved
as the verdicts were read out. After hearing his sentence, he sat
down again and glanced up at his attorney, who did not say whether
he planned to appeal.
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Furundzija will serve his sentence in a jail in either Norway,
Finland or Italy, countries that have agreed to house prisoners
convicted by the tribunal.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to let her be questioned again and to hear evidence from
experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.
	   But presiding judge Florence Mumba of Zambia ruled the victim's
testimony was reliable even if she was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
	   ``The trial chamber ... accepts Witness A's testimony that she
has sufficiently recollected the material aspects of the relevant
events,'' Mumba said, reading extracts from a 100-page ruling
during Thursday's 15-minute hearing.
	   She added that ``expert evidence demonstrates that even when a
person is suffering from PTSD, she or he may still be a reliable
witness.''
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers,''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to
broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim
prisoners in 1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the infamous Omarska
camp in northwest Bosnia.

Investigation launched into major Ukrainian alumina plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have launched
criminal cases against top executives of a major alumina plant in
southern Ukraine on suspicion of smuggling and concealing hard
currency earnings, officials said Thursday.
	   Agents have searched the offices and homes of the suspects,
against whom ``measures shall be taken in accordance with the
demands of the law,'' said the Mykolaiv branch of the country's
Security Service (SBU).
	   The SBU statement did not identify the suspects and offered no
explanation of the charges.
	   The Mykolaiv Aluminum Plant's director, Vitaliy Meshyn, said
Thursday that Mykolaiv prosecutors had issued a warrant for his
arrest and that of his financial director, Kateryna Bogachuk.
	   Meshyn said the investigation was largely triggered by his
resistance to attempts to privatize the company.
	   In an appeal issued in Kiev and carried by the independent UNIAN
news agency, Meshyn asked President Leonid Kuchma and parliament
for protection against what he called attempts to oust him and
portray his work ``as a state crime, plunder and theft.''
	   The arrest of the plant's top executives would be ``an act of
political vandalism fully ignoring moral norms and the country's
laws,'' he said.
	   The goal is to ``receive full control over the plant and use it
as an instrument of controlling the aluminum industry of Russia and
Tajikistan,'' he said.
	   The profitable company, which has 6,500 workers, is capable of
annually producing 1 million tons (1.1 million short tons) of
alumina, or aluminum oxide, most of which it exports to Russia and
Tajikistan. The substance, found in bauxite and clay, is used for
aluminum production.
	   Meshyn called on parliament to block attempts to privatize the
plant, noting that legislators already had managed to prevent a
Ukrainian-U.S. joint venture from taking control of the company.
	   The latest developments are ``an action of taking over the
Mykolaiv Alumina Plant by the same people and companies but by
simpler methods,'' he said. He did not blame any specific company.
	   Several tenders announced by the government for the purchase of
up to 30 percent of the plant's shares have been canceled for
various reasons amid sharp opposition by its executives.
	   Many in the leftist-leaning parliament have backed the plant's
stance, fearing a foreign takeover of what is seen as an exports
asset for this former Soviet republic.
	   Ukrainian media reported, meanwhile, that two deputy directors
of the Mykolaiv plant were detained by SBU officials on Wednesday.
	   Two other officials, the plant's technical director Yevhen
Kovalenko and Bogachuk, the financial director, were hospitalized
with heart attacks, UNIAN said.

Provincial election in Sri Lanka a test of president's popularity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Officials announced Thursday that
provincial elections will be held next month in northwest Sri
Lanka, scheduling voting that will be a popularity test for
President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a region governed by the main
opposition.
	   A victory may embolden Kumaratunga to order elections in five
other provinces where she postponed them in August, saying that
more than 25,000 troops were involved in a major offensive against
separatist Tamil rebels and couldn't be spared to police voting.
	   The offensive was called off earlier this month after the
military failed to capture the main highway linking the mainland
with the Jaffna Peninsula. More than 7,000 people, including 3,000
soldiers, were killed in the 19-month offensive.
	   Kumaratunga used extraordinary powers to take direct control of
the five states, four of which had been ruled by the opposition
United National Party since 1993. Kumaratunga's People's Alliance
and the UNP are the key parties contesting the 52-seat provincial
legislature in the northwest province.
	   Only the southern province, one of Sri Lanka's eight provinces,
is being governed by elected Alliance members. There have been no
elections in years in war-torn northeastern province, which also is
being federally administered.
	   The opposition has petitioned the Supreme Court to end federal
rule in the five provinces where elections were postponed in
August. The court hearings are still on.
	   Voting in the Northwestern Provincial Council will be held on
Jan. 25, Election Commissioner Dayananda de Silva said Thursday.
	   A victory may even tempt Kumaratunga to order snap general
elections 18 months ahead of schedule. At present, her alliance
enjoys a slender one-seat majority in 225-seat Parliament.
	   Tamil guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast
for the country's minority ethnic Tamils, who claim discrimination
from the majority Sinhalese who dominate the government and
military. The rebels have called for peace talks, but the
government wants them to surrender their weapons first.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Economic growth in the 15-nation
European Union accelerated to 0.6 percent in the third quarter from
0.4 percent in the preceding three months, EU officials said
Thursday.
	   Gross domestic product in the 11 EU countries taking part in the
launching of the single currency, the euro on Jan. 1, also grew 0.6
percent in the third quarter, according to the EU statistics
office, Eurostat.
	   No figures were given for individual EU countries.
	   Compared with the same period last year, GDP in the 15 EU
countries was 2.4 percent higher in the third quarter of 1998,
Eurostat said.

Arafat says he may not live to see the new millennium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare moment of openness about his health,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told visitors he may not live to
see the peace process through.
	   Arafat, who suffers from an uncontrollable trembling of the
hands and lower lip, was asked by members of a Washington think
tank how he envisioned his Palestinian Authority in 20 years. He
answered that ``I don't know if I'll live one year or two years.''
	   The exchange between Arafat and members of the Washington
Institute of Near East Policy was reported by the Israeli daily
Haaretz on Thursday. The meeting took place at Arafat's office in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat, 68, has denied persistent reports that his health is
failing and that he is suffering from Parkinson's disease.
	   However, in recent months he has looked tired and pale in public
appearances.
	   Arafat's neurologist, Ashraf Kurdi, said last year that Arafat
suffers from bouts of depression, but does not have Parkinson's, a
degenerative disease that affects motor function
	   Kurdi confirmed that after a 1992 plane crash in the Libyan
desert, Arafat bled internally and suffered from cognitive
disorders. After tests and draining of the accumulated blood,
Arafat returned to normal, Kurdi said.
	   Israel and the Palestinians still have a long way to go before
reaching a permanent peace accord. The five-year period of
Palestinian autonomy ends in May 1999, but it is unlikely the final
peace agreement will be in place by then. Arafat has not designated
a successor.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The government said Thursday it plans
to introduce human rights as a subject in schools, starting with
primary school students in early 2000.
	   The announcement coincided with the worldwide commemoration of
the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The human rights record of this southeastern African country has
not been widely criticized. But activists last week said many
prisoners at the Machava Maputo jail have not been brought to trial
for up to six years. The prison, with a capacity for 800 inmates,
has more than 2,000.
	   The conditions are not unusual for Mozambican prisons, and the
attorney general's office has ordered an inquiry.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Representatives of various women's groups
have staged a march in the Ghanaian capital to protest a recent
upsurge in murders against women there.
	   The Wednesday march organized by the National Council on Women
and Development brought together female lawyers, journalists and
members of the Police Wives Association.
	   Bearing placards and chanting slogans, the women said they used
the march, originally scheduled as an activity to mark the 50th
anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to
express concern about the present security situation.
	   Police have reported an increasing spate of killings against
women in Accra in the past couple of weeks.
	   At least 17 women aged between 45 and 50 years, have been
murdered within the Dansoman and Mataheko suburbs, according to
police reports from the capital.
	   So far, no arrests have been made, but the killings have
generated an increasing anti-foreigner sentiment throughout the
country.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A legal challenge by the
opposition New National Party to the way voters register for next
year's national elections was postponed on Thursday.
	   The delay, until Feb. 5, gives the government time to prepare
its case to counter the party's accusation that the registration
process is unfair and favors the ruling African National Congress.
	   The party is asking the Cape Town High Court to declare
unconstitutional a requirement that all voters must have a
bar-coded identity document in order to register to vote in next
year's elections.
	   Bar-coded identification books were first introduced in 1986.
But only about 65 percent of minority whites, the bulwark support
of opposition parties, have the proper documents, compared to 80
percent of the country's majority blacks.
	   --
	   ASMARA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The U.S. special envoy to the Horn of
Africa met with Sudanese rebels and dissidents during his six-day
mission in the region to deal with the Ethiopian-Eritrean border
conflict stay, according to a rebel spokesman.
	   In an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, Yasir
Arman, spokesman in Eritrea for the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
said Anthony Lake met Monday with representatives of the National
Democratic Alliance in the Eritrean capital.
	   The alliance is an umbrella group of Sudanese opposition groups
from the north and the south and includes the SPLA.
	   Lake was on his third mission to the Horn since the border
conflict broke out in May. There was no indication whether he made
any progress this time around.
	   Last year, the United States gave non-lethal military aid in the
form of communications equipment and boots to both Eritrea and
Ethiopia as part of a policy of containment against the National
Islamic Front government in Sudan. It was not clear whether the
equipment was intended for the dissidents.
	   Arman said Sudanese government forces had been attacking several
points in eastern Sudan recently, forcing people to flee to
Eritrea.
	   The SPLA has been fighting Sudanese government forces since 1983
in an effort to secure autonomy for southern Sudan.

 &UR; Air travel throughout Germany disrupted by snow and ice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Heavy snow disrupted air travel
Thursday morning at the Frankfurt airport, continental Europe's
biggest, with international delays and a quarter of domestic and
European flights canceled.
	   The situation improved later Thursday as the snowfall eased, and
all three runways were operating normally by mid-afternoon, said
Horst Aussem, an airport duty officer.
	   He said the closure of one runway alone during the morning
caused the cancellation of 170 arrivals and departures at the busy
airport, the hub for Germany's national carrier Lufthansa.
	   Long international flights outside Europe were given priority
during the worst of the weather, although there were delays,
Lufthansa spokesman Michael Lamberty said.
	   Schedules will not return to normal until the weather improves,
and forecasts for more snow and icy rain in Frankfurt suggested the
situation could worsen ahead of the weekend, Lamberty said.
	   Stuttgart and Munich airports also were affected by unseasonably
early and heavy snow overnight throughout large areas of Germany.
Munich saw snow-related delays earlier this year.
	   Frankfurt is Europe's biggest airport after London's Heathrow.

Viduka back in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian soccer international Mark
Viduka arrived in Melbourne early Friday and confirmed he planned
to honor his contract with Scottish club Glasgow Celtic.
	   After travelling from Zagreb, a tired Viduka said he was in
Melbourne for a rest and to catch up with his family over
Christmas.
	   ``I do not really want to talk now, I'd just like to say I hope
to be back playing for Celtic as soon as possible,'' Viduka said.
	   Asked if he would be back at Glasgow after spending the festive
season in his native Melbourne, Viduka said: ``I'm happy to be back
to see my family and friends, I love this city and I love this
country.''
	   Viduka's Australian manager Bernie Mandic escorted Viduka
quickly through
	   the airport, saying he would refuse to speak to the media until
Monday.
	   However, the 23-year-old was mobbed by television crews and
local and international media and did not make it to the exits
before his swift attempt
	   to avoid the media was halted.
	   Viduka walked out on Glasgow Celtic on Sunday only days after
arriving there following his transfer from Croatia Zagreb.
	   The Australian said he needed a rest and was not expected to
return to Scotland until at least the new year after fleeing to
Zagreb on Sunday.
	   Viduka, 23, was reportedly depressed and needed time with his
family. (djp)

Belgrade court again punishes independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In an ongoing purge of Serbia's
independent media, a Belgrade court fined an independent daily and
its chief editor the equivalent of dlrs 45,000 Thursday for
allegedly libeling a top official.
	   This was the second hefty fine slapped against Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraph) since October when a restrictive media law, which
effectively banned criticism of state officials and their policies,
was adopted in Serbia.
	   On Nov. 9, the popular daily was fined the equivalent of dlrs
120,000. Later, its property was impounded and it had to move to
Montenegro, the small republic which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia,
to resume publishing.
	   Early Thursday, the court acted on charges filed by Milovan
Bojic, the deputy Serbian prime minister and a leading
neo-communist official, who said the Dnevni Telegraf newspaper
libeled his image in its Dec. 5 edition.
	   During brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers
unsuccessfully tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be
implemented for newspapers that are published in Montenegro.
	   Its chief editor Dragan Novakovic said he won't pay the fine and
that authorities won't be able to impound his property as they did
after the last trial.
	   Several independent media outlets have been fined, and many had
to close down, as the result of the media law, which has been
bitterly criticized by Western powers.

EU leaders unlikely to heal budget rift at 2-day summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders open a two-day
summit Friday at which they will recommit to letting a dozen
countries into the EU. But on the summit's eve, it appeared
unlikely they would agree on how to finance their biggest expansion
ever.
	   ``The time isn't right'' for a deal, Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima said in an interview in Thursday's edition of the Vienna
daily Der Standard.
	   As summit chairman, Klima said he will ask the European leaders
to inject urgency into the debate so a budget overhaul can be
agreed in March.
	   The EU opened membership negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary
talks with nations judged less-ready: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is expected to join them.
	   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, among others, want to
bring Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first group. Germany
and France oppose that.
	   The leaders will meet in an ominous setting: the cavernous
Redoutensaal of the Hofburg Palace where Europe's aristocratic
leaders of 1815 redrew their continent's map and danced away the
memories of Napoleon's wars.
	   In its 20th century version of building a better Europe, the EU
refuses to set entry dates just to keep candidates working apace on
their economic and political reforms to meet EU membership
requirements.
	   Apart from a squabble over how to fund their admission, Turkey
continues to trouble the West Europeans.
	   They have ruled it out as an immediate candidate. Ankara has
declined an invitation to come here Saturday to meet with leaders
of the EU, Cyprus and the East European candidates. Not helping
matters has been Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, arrested in Rome Nov. 15, to Turkey.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and France insist the
EU's annual budget _ 86 billion European currency units (dlrs 100
billion) this year _ must not rise beyond inflation in the
2000-2006 period when the first newcomers would be entering.
	   They oppose a proposal to link spending to economic growth that
would raise the budget by 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) by
2006.
	   Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal _ which get special EU aid _
want the budget expanded so they don't lose out when even poorer
east European nations join.
	   Germany and other northerners say they already pay far more into
the EU than they get back. Germany's net payment is 22 billion
marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year.
	   On the eve of the summit, Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, pledged to fight for a limit on Germany's payments to
the EU. Germany assumes the EU presidency next month.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in a
speech to the German parliament in Bonn. ``We cannot and we do not
want to solve Europe's problems with a German checkbook.''
	   In a related dispute, Britain's refuses to give up a refund it
has been getting since 1984 to compensate for its net payments
though it is better off today.
	   The EU budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from
15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   Key to its reform is an agreement to make deep cuts in farm
spending. Subsidies for EU farmers still eat up half of the budget.
	   The EU leaders will also discuss plans to cut Europe's
stubbornly high unemployment, the launch of a single currency in
January and plans to ensure the 11 nations adopting the euro will
speak with a one voice in international finance meetings.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Search teams found a crashed fighter jet and its
dead pilot in the Russian Far East on Thursday, a day after the jet
disappeared from radar screens, news reports said.
	   Search teams found the Su-27 fighter near a lake located north
of the Far Eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6,200
kilometers (3,900 miles) east of Moscow.
	   The remains of the pilot were found near the crash site, Russian
television reported, quoting air force officials.
	   The Su-27 had been on a test mission after one of its engines
was replaced, and the pilot issued no distress signals before the
crash, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing local military
officials.
	   Russian military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat paramilitary
commander was convicted of war crimes today for failing to prevent
a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes
counts for failing to stop the rape and then taking no action
against the rapist.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in
prison. He had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija on closed-door
testimony of the alleged victim, identified only as ``Witness A.''
	   But their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to allow her to be questioned again and to hear evidence
from experts who examined her. At those proceedings, a doctor told
the court that the victim needed psychiatric treatment after her
ordeal and was suicidal.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``the Jokers,''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija becomes the first Bosnian Croat convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.
	   Earlier today, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded innocent to broadened
charges that they murdered, tortured and raped Muslim prisoners in
1992.
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic and Zoran Zigic all
are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the Omarska detention
camp in northwest Bosnia.

English-language plaque at Polish war monument full of errors

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ City officials trying to make the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier more accessible to foreign tourists apparently
don't know something themselves _ how to proofread English.
	   An English-language plaque put up at the war monument in
downtown Warsaw a month ago has several errors, while two other
plaques, in Polish and German, appear to be error-free.
	   ``It is a shame,'' said Wayne Rentoul of Townsville, Australia,
who stopped at the monument Thursday while touring Warsaw with his
wife. ``It shows a little disrespect because it is a very important
place.''
	   The Tomb, established in 1925, includes a coffin with ashes of
an unidentified Polish soldier killed during the 1918
Polish-Ukrainian war and urns with soil from 14 other historic
battlefields.
	   Foreign dignitaries on official visits routinely place wreaths
at the monument, the site of state celebrations of Poland's
Independence Day on Nov. 11 and Constitution Day on May 3.
	   Most of the errors appear to be typographical.
	   ``The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier marker the place where the
Poles' aspiration to independence and freedom bah pursued,'' is
written in elegant brass on the English-language plaque.
	   It also mentions the ``fifficult'' post World War II era and
later incorrectly spells patriotic as ``patriotio.''
	   Krzysztof Mazurek, a spokesman for the Warsaw provincial
governor, said the problem was being addressed, but he was unable
to say when the plaque might be replaced.
	   Poland is one of three former Soviet bloc countries invited to
join NATO next year. One of the major requirements for bringing the
Polish military into conformance with NATO standards is better
English-language skills for officers and soldiers.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat paramilitary
commander was convicted of war crimes Thursday for failing to
prevent a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes
counts for doing nothing to stop the rape and then taking no action
against the rapist.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in
prison. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
faced a maximum life sentence.
	   Furundzija, wearing a dark suit, shirt and tie, looked unmoved
as the verdicts were read out. After hearing his sentence, he sat
down again and glanced up at his attorney, who did not say whether
he planned to appeal.
	   By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial.
	   His case was the tribunal's first to deal exclusively with rape
as a war crime. Last month, a Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the
U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, but the charge was just one in a
long list of atrocities.
	   Furundzija will serve his sentence in a jail in either Norway,
Finland or Italy, countries that have agreed to house prisoners
convicted by the tribunal.
	   Prosecutors based their case against Furundzija almost
exclusively on closed-door testimony of the alleged victim,
identified by the tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Their case was undermined by defense claims that prosecutors
tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable.
	   Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in
November to let her be questioned again and to hear evidence from
experts who examined her.
	   At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and was
suicidal.
	   But presiding judge Florence Mumba of Zambia ruled the victim's
testimony was reliable even if she was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
	   ``The trial chamber ... accepts Witness A's testimony that she
has sufficiently recollected the material aspects of the relevant
events,'' Mumba said, reading extracts from a 100-page ruling
during Thursday's 15-minute hearing.
	   She added that ``expert evidence demonstrates that even when a
person is suffering from PTSD, she or he may still be a reliable
witness.''
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers,''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did
nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the tribunal contends.
	   The woman was subjected to ``a prolonged series of physical,
mental and serious sexual abuses including repeated rapes,''
prosecutors claimed.
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are on trial in three
separate cases for their alleged involvement in the purge.

Investigation launched into major Ukrainian alumina plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have launched
criminal cases against top executives of a major alumina plant in
southern Ukraine on suspicion of smuggling and concealing hard
currency earnings, officials said Thursday.
	   Agents have searched the offices and homes of the suspects,
against whom ``measures shall be taken in accordance with the
demands of the law,'' said the Mykolaiv branch of the country's
Security Service (SBU).
	   The SBU statement did not identify the suspects and offered no
explanation of the charges.
	   The Mykolaiv Aluminum Plant's director, Vitaliy Meshyn, said
Thursday that Mykolaiv prosecutors had issued a warrant for his
arrest and that of his financial director, Kateryna Bogachuk.
	   Meshyn said the investigation was largely triggered by his
resistance to attempts to privatize the company.
	   In an appeal issued in Kiev and carried by the independent UNIAN
news agency, Meshyn asked President Leonid Kuchma and parliament
for protection against what he called attempts to oust him and
portray his work ``as a state crime, plunder and theft.''
	   The arrest of the plant's top executives would be ``an act of
political vandalism fully ignoring moral norms and the country's
laws,'' he said.
	   The goal is to ``receive full control over the plant and use it
as an instrument of controlling the aluminum industry of Russia and
Tajikistan,'' he said.
	   The profitable company, which has 6,500 workers, is capable of
annually producing 1 million tons (1.1 million short tons) of
alumina, or aluminum oxide, most of which it exports to Russia and
Tajikistan. The substance, found in bauxite and clay, is used for
aluminum production.
	   Meshyn called on parliament to block attempts to privatize the
plant, noting that legislators already had managed to prevent a
Ukrainian-U.S. joint venture from taking control of the company.
	   The latest developments are ``an action of taking over the
Mykolaiv Alumina Plant by the same people and companies but by
simpler methods,'' he said. He did not blame any specific company.
	   Several tenders announced by the government for the purchase of
up to 30 percent of the plant's shares have been canceled for
various reasons amid sharp opposition by its executives.
	   Many in the leftist-leaning parliament have backed the plant's
stance, fearing a foreign takeover of what is seen as an exports
asset for this former Soviet republic.
	   Ukrainian media reported, meanwhile, that two deputy directors
of the Mykolaiv plant were detained by SBU officials on Wednesday.
	   Two other officials, the plant's technical director Yevhen
Kovalenko and Bogachuk, the financial director, were hospitalized
with heart attacks, UNIAN said.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police in an armored personnel
carrier blocked a team of forensics experts from Finland today from
carrying out the first exhumations of massacre victims in Kosovo.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta.
	   The start of digging on the makeshift graves of as many as 22
slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a breakthrough in
investigative work into atrocities in the war-ravaged Serbian
province.
	   But a Serb police contingent _ consisting of an armored
personnel carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak
jackets and carrying automatic rifles _ stopped the Finnish convoy
on the road in Trstenik, well short of their destination in the
central Drenica region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after spending more than two hours on the side
of the road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   A Serb judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic, said the team's
safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to our laws, the
exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 25 miles west of
Pristina were among the most savage during the Serb forces'
seven-month offensive against separatists in Kosovo.
	   The massacre prompted worldwide outrage and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to end the crackdown.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes. Serbia is
the larger of two republics left in Yugoslavia.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Several hundred Serbs began a protest march today to a rebel
stronghold in southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the
disappearance of Serbs during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began a 12-mile walk from Orahovac toward the KLA stronghold
of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo. Many are believed to
have been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before today's dispute. ``We're here to
shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.

Armenian deputy minister of defense killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ An unknown attacker shot and killed
Armenia's deputy minister of defense today.
	   The 48-year-old minister, Bagram Khorkhoruni, was killed outside
his apartment as he left for work, said Interior Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Grigoryan.
	   Officials had no explanation for the killing. Police found seven
bullet casings at the scene.
	   Khorkhoruni, who was married and had three children, had been
deputy defense minister since 1997. Before that, he worked in the
Interior Ministry. An army veteran, he was also a policeman earlier
in his career.
	   Armenia, a former Soviet republic in the Caucasus Mountains, has
seen a sharp increase in crime in recent years.

Belgrade court again punishes independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In an ongoing purge of Serbia's
independent media, a Belgrade court fined an independent daily and
its chief editor the equivalent of dlrs 45,000 Thursday for
allegedly libeling a top official.
	   This was the second hefty fine slapped against Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraph) since October when a restrictive media law, which
effectively banned criticism of state officials and their policies,
was adopted in Serbia.
	   On Nov. 9, the popular daily was fined the equivalent of dlrs
120,000. Later, its property was impounded and it had to move to
Montenegro, the small republic which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia,
to resume publishing.
	   Early Thursday, the court acted on charges filed by Milovan
Bojic, the deputy Serbian prime minister and a leading
neo-communist official, who said the Dnevni Telegraf newspaper
libeled his image in its Dec. 5 edition.
	   During brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers
unsuccessfully tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be
implemented for newspapers that are published in Montenegro.
	   Its chief editor Dragan Novakovic said he won't pay the fine and
that authorities won't be able to impound his property as they did
after the last trial.
	   Several independent media outlets have been fined, and many had
to close down, as the result of the media law, which has been
bitterly criticized by Western powers.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pilot found. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Search teams found a crashed fighter jet and its
dead pilot in the Russian Far East on Thursday, a day after the jet
disappeared from radar screens, news reports said.
	   Search teams found the Su-27 fighter near a lake located north
of the Far Eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6,200
kilometers (3,900 miles) east of Moscow.
	   The remains of the pilot were found near the crash site, Russian
television reported, quoting air force officials.
	   The Su-27 had been on a test mission after one of its engines
was replaced, and the pilot issued no distress signals before the
crash, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing local military
officials.
	   Russian military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

Bulgaria abolishes capital punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria on Thursday abolished capital
punishment and replaced it with life imprisonment without parole in
a measure to move its legal system closer to European standards.
	   The parliament voted 96-22 to approve the change. There were 3
abstentions.
	   Bulgaria imposed a moratorium on executions in 1990; however,
courts have continued to issue death sentences.
	   The abolishment of capital punishment doesn't automatically undo
the sentences of 19 convicts condemned to death since 1990. They
may be pardoned by President Petar Stoyanov.

Ultra-Orthodox may consider compromise on army service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ultra-Orthodox leaders in Israel may be ready
to compromise on an arrangement that exempts rabbinical students
from army service, Israel radio reported Thursday, partly out of
concern at growing poverty in their community.
	   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court nullified the ad-hoc
arrangement, in existence since the establishment of Israel in
1948, and ordered Israel's parliament to legislate a new compromise
between the secular and religious communities within a year.
	   The arrangement allows rabbinical students to study free in
seminaries and live on government stipends instead of serve in the
army. In order to receive the stipends, they are banned from
working.
	   Israel radio reported that legislators from two ultra-Orthodox
parties may proffer a compromise that would allow the students to
work, in exchange for reduced army service. Israeli men currently
serve three years in the army.
	   In recent years, the birthrate among the ultra-Orthodox has
mushroomed, and a lack of marketable skills has led to widespread
poverty _ some estimate that half the community live below the
poverty line.
	   The stipend, once substantial, has been slashed to
below-subsistence levels.
	   Leaders in the community who once extolled seminary study as the
highest calling have quietly encouraged their rank and file to
pursue careers.
	   Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, made the
arrangement in order to win backing for the state from the
then-non-Zionist ultra-Orthodox community.
	   At the time, it applied to no more than 600 students. Now there
may be up to 30,000 exemptions.
	   The ultra-Orthodox have said that sustaining a culture of
religious learning almost wiped out by the Nazis is as important as
securing Israel's borders.
	   A string of media reports about religious men who receive the
stipends while working on the black market have stoked secular
resentment of the arrangement.
	   The suit was brought to the Supreme Court by secular lawmakers,
as well as a university student's group. Israeli students are
forced to defer their studies until they are 20 or 21, and then
must pay thousands of dollars in tuition.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

radio report on nature of the diplomatic violation. No pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a forensics team
Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of Kosovo massacre
victims in a dispute over Serb access to rebel-controlled
territory.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the
war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   Government forces cracked down in February against Kosovo
militants seeking independence for the majority ethnic Albanian
province. Hundreds of people have been killed and in this year's
offensive and in periodic violence since an October truce.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstructing the
massacre investigation.
	   A Serb police contingent of an armored personnel carrier and
about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and carrying
automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the graves site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after more than two hours on the side of the
road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   In Belgrade, the independent radio station B-92 radio quoted
Ranta as saying a Serb policeman opened the ambassador's car,
grabbed a camera and took out a film.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them. A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina,
Danica Marinkovic, said her team's safety also was reportedly at
issue. ``According to our laws, the exhumations can't take place
without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during the
Serbian forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in
Kosovo.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Underscoring the brutality on both sides, several hundred Serbs
began a protest march Thursday to a rebel stronghold in
southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the disappearance of Serbs
during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began the 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in Yugoslavia.

Ruling party, opposition fight over check-up of privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats' request
for the examination of the privatization process turned into a
heated debate in the parliament Thursday.
	   Deputies of President Franjo Tudjman's governing party, which
controls parliament and whose members were in charge of the sale of
state assets, refused to endorse the proposal.
	   The opposition insists it should be done in order to check
whether a privileged elite has acquired valuable property through
financial swindles and corruption, as many suspect and independent
papers reported for years.
	   During the 1991-2 war with its rebel Serbs, Croatia began
adjusting its largely state-owned economy to a market one. But the
mass sell-off of state industries has raised little cash for either
the companies sold or the government.
	   Independent economists at home and abroad now say the process
was seriously abused to enrich a handful of entrepreneurs close to
Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union.
	   Critics charge that these businessmen reportedly got generous
loans to buy state enterprises, or that the value of certain
factories was greatly under-estimated to enable political favorites
to buy them.
	   The practice was dubbed ``tycoon-ization'' and seen as the main
cause of the increased gap between the rich elite and the poverty
of most of others.
	   Fierce verbal exchanges prompted the speaker to intervene often
during the four-hour discussion.
	   Vladimir Seks, a member of the ruling party, told an opposition
deputy that his constant attacks on Tudjman's party demonstrated
his ``moral insanity.''
	   Privatization Minister Milan Kovac accused the opposition of
violating the constitution, trying to obstruct foreign investments.
	   ``Those who acquired their properties in a legal way, should not
fear,'' Damir Kajin of the opposition Istrian Party said. ``The aim
of the revision would be to show how some people managed to pay for
their shares during the war and general impoverishment.''
	   The debate continues later in the day, but the request will
likely be rejected.

Egypt urges formation of Arab common market to counter trade blocs

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury
urged Arab states Thursday to move toward an Arab common market to
counter trade blocs.
	   The prime minister spoke to reporters after arriving in Jordan
for talks with his counterpart, Fayez Tarawneh, on setting up a
free trade zone between Egypt and the kingdom.
	   ``We are working together to establish a free trade zone and
hope to establish an Arab common market like the European Union,''
he said.
	   ``An Arab common market is the best way to challenge
international blocs,'' he said.
	   He said previous attempts to set up a pan-Arab market had failed
because the moves were too hasty.
	   The right way, he said, was to start with a free trade zone and
expand it to a customs union and then, ultimately, create a common
market for all the 21 Arab states and Palestine.
	   Egypt already has free trade zones with Morocco, Lebanon and
Tunis, el-Ganzoury said.
	   During his two-day visit, el-Ganzoury is scheduled to hold talks
with Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent while King
Hussein is away.
	   El-Ganzoury's talks with Tarawneh will be held in a meeting of
the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, which promotes
cooperation in various fields.
	   The two states plan to start reducing customs duties on each
other's goods next month and work for an abolition of all such
levies by 2005.
	   Jordan imported 275 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 387 million)
worth of Egyptian goods in 1997 and exported to Egypt goods worth
14.5 million dinars (dlrs 20 million).

Perry briefs Japan on suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS to UPDATE with comments from Perry

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry met
with senior Japanese officials Thursday to discuss what to do about
North Korea's refusal to allow the inspection of a suspected
nuclear weapons site.
	   Perry, a special advisor to President Clinton on North Korea
policy, held a hour-long meeting with Japanese Vice Defense
Minister Yasukazu Hamada on the progress of talks in the United
States between Washington and Pyongyang, Japan's Defense Agency
said.
	   He met later with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka and
outlined the U.S. position on North Korea.
	   ``It is important for us to consult with Japan, our close ally,
because of our common interest to promote peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula,'' Perry was quoted as saying by the U.S.
Embassy in Japan.
	   North Korea has refused a U.S. demand that it unconditionally
allow inspectors into a suspected underground nuclear site at
Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main
nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   Pyongyang has said it will open up the facility in exchange for
dlrs 300 million in compensation for America's ``false'' accusation
that North Korea is building a nuclear facility. Washington has
turned down the offer.
	   Perry arrived in Tokyo Wednesday after stops in South Korea and
China to discuss the ongoing negotiations and listen to views about
how Washington should revise its policy toward the North.
	   ``We came to listen, not to promote any views of our own, since
we just began this policy review,'' Perry said.
	   Japan has been particularly concerned about a military build-up
in North Korea after Pyongyang launched a missile in late August
that flew over northern Japan. U.S. officials believe the launch
was a test firing of a Taepo Dong-1 ballistic missile.
	   Japanese Defense Minister Hosei Norota reportedly told
Parliament on Wednesday that Japan is nervous about signs North
Korea is building new ballistic missile facilities but said he
doubts Pyongyang is planning another missile launch soon.
	   Reflecting U.S. concern about North Korea, the Clinton
administration recently named Perry to the newly established post
of policy coordinator for North Korea.
	   Perry, who also met with Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura, was scheduled to leave Tokyo Thursday evening.

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Five people received minor injuries from
a small explosion outside the house of a Spanish civil guardsman in
this northern town early Thursday that authorities attributed to
groups linked to the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   A top government official from the northern Basque province
Enrique Villar said on National Spanish Radio that the explosion
was evidence of ``a breakout of lightweight terrorism,'' by groups
of young radicals who support ETA.
	   ETA has been observing a cease-fire since Sept. 18. The truce
triggered talk of possible peace negotiations with the government
aimed at putting a definitive end to 30 years of violence
surrounding Basque separatist aspirations.
	   Villar said Thursday's attack underlined the need for continued
vigilance against the possibility that ETA will break its
cease-fire, the radio reported.
	   The explosion at the Pamplona home of a Spanish civil guard at 4
a.m. (0300gmt), was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline,
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   Five people, not identified by name, required medical attention
including the wife of the targeted civil guard who received burns
to the face and hands.
	   Four neighbors were released from hospital later Thursday after
been treated for shock and problems caused by inhaling fumes from
the explosion that damaged doors and broke windows at the house,
Dors said.
	   ``This is the first time something like this has happened here
since the cease-fire,'' Dors said.
	   ETA includes the province of Navarra, the capital of which is
Pamplona, in its vision of an independent Basque state despite its
location south of the current definition of the Basque province.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its violent
campaign for an independent state straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   In recent years bombing and shooting attacks carried out by ETA
have been accompanied by the maintenance of a climate of violence
by the group's supporters who were also blamed for small-scale
attacks on such targets as Spanish civil guards.
	   This kind of violence virtually disappeared with the cease-fire
declaration.
	   The Civil Guard was created in the 19th century to patrol
Spain's vast countryside, but now also serves as national highway
police, coast guard, and has a special anti-terrorist unit. Basque
separatists view the Civil Guard as an occupying force in a Basque
homeland.

China, Japan dominate judo at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's men and China's women dominated
the judo competition Thursday at the Asian Games, with each team
taking two gold medals.
	   The results let Japan come out on top overall in its native
sport, with five gold medals from 14 events. China and South Korea
each had three, Mongolia two and North Korea one.
	   China's golds Thursday came in the women's heavyweight and
half-heavyweight categories. In the heavier weight, Yuan Hua needed
barely a minute to beat Lee Hsiao-hung of Taiwan and take gold.
	   Japan's Miho Ninomiya and Paradawee Pestonyee of host Thailand
shared bronze.
	   In half-heavyweight, China's Tang Ling took gold with a victory
over Kazakstan's Varvara Massyagina. South Korea's Kang Min-jeong
and Mongolia's Sambuu Dashdulam tied for bronze.
	   The men's heavyweight final matched two evenly sized giants _
Iran's Seyedmahmoudreza Miranfashandi and Shinichi Shinohara of
Japan.
	   Shinohara got the upper hand, throwing Miranfashandi to the mat
for gold. China's Pan Song and Mongolia's Ochir Odgerel took
bronze.
	   Japan also was victorious in men's half-heavyweight, with the
smaller Kosei Inoue using quick footwork to beat Armen Bagdasarov
of Uzbekistan, sending a noisy contigent of Japanese fans into a
frenzy. South Korea's Park Sun-keun took bronze with
Maabi-Nowroozabadi of Iran.

China says poaching pushes Tibetan antelope toward extinction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs 4th graf pvs, `The assessment ...' to CORRECT that
estimate of 50,000 to 75,000 animals was in 1995, sted 1975.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An antelope found only on the high, desolate
Tibetan plateau has been hunted by poachers to the verge of
extinction, a Chinese government report said Thursday.
	   The fine fur of the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, is used to
produce a soft fabric called shahtoosh that fetches high prices in
the West.
	   Although Chinese environmentalists have campaigned to save the
antelope, the report Thursday by the State Administration of
Forestry marked the first time the government has openly joined the
crusade.
	   The assessment was even bleaker than warnings given by the
environmental movement. It estimated that there were only 50,000 to
75,000 of the antelopes left in China in 1995, the official Xinhua
News Agency cited the report as saying.
	   ``They are now rarely seen, even in many places that used to be
the Tibetan antelope's major habitats, and the animal is now on the
edge of extinction,'' Xinhua quoted the report as saying.
	   Nature reserves and increased game warden patrols have failed to
stop illegal hunting, and antelope herds are dwindling, the report
said.
	   One of China's best-organized environmental campaigners, Friends
of Nature, earlier this year estimated that 75,000 to 100,000
chirus were left in the wild and that the current rate of poaching
would kill off the species in 20 years.

UNICEF says sanctions wrecking Iraqi education system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly half of Iraqi schoolchildren do not
have desks to sit at, and enrollment rates are plummeting from the
impact of U.N. sanctions, a UNICEF official said Thursday.
	   The number of teachers in Iraq is declining by 10 percent every
year and 4,520 schools are in need of serious repair, UNICEF's
Baghdad representative Philippe Heffinck said.
	   ``There has been a steady deterioration over the past eight
years of education in the country,'' he said at a news conference.
``To reverse that trend, it's going to require massive
investment.''
	   Citing government figures, Heffinck said 1 million Iraqi
students _ 20 percent of the total _ did not enroll this year.
About 47 percent of students do not have desks to sit at, he said.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil exports, can
only be lifted once U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's weapons of
mass destructions have been eliminated.
	   Before the Kuwait invasion, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War,
Iraq had one of the highest literacy rates in the Arab world.
School attendance was mandatory, and the government spent heavily
on schools, books and supplies.
	   Iraq spends less than a tenth of the dlrs 500 million it spent
on education before the war, Heffnick said.

Albright meets Chirac, Jospin but skips human rights celebration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with
President Jacques Chirac and other French leaders Thursday, but
canceled a planned appearance at a 50th anniversary fete for the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Albright had been planning to appear with Chirac and others at
the ceremony, marking the Dec. 10, 1948 signing of the human rights
charter.
	   But she canceled due to pressing business back home, according
to the U.S. Embassy press office.
	   Albright had a breakfast meeting Thursday with Chirac, where she
invited him to visit Washington in February _ an offer that was
accepted.
	   On the agenda will be ``all the current issues of the day''
including NATO, the Middle East and Iraq, according to Chirac
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   Leaving the breakfast, Albright commented briefly on the crisis
with Iraq and on the case of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
	   On Iraq, she said she and Chirac ``are agreed that it is
essential for Saddam Hussein to cooperate with UNSCOM.'' She said
she was pleased that ``in the last year, the coalition has been
very strong.''
	   Albright did not want to comment specifically on Britain's
decision Wednesday to go ahead with extradition proceedings against
Pinochet.
	   But she said: ``We have said that we want justice, that we have
these values, that we are concerned about justice being done.''
	   ``I think we have to again assess what the decision has meant,''
she said.
	   Albright also lunched with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and
signed an bilateral accord on extraditions and exchanges with
Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou, called the Mutual Legal
Assistance Treaty.
	   She also met early Thursday with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, who a day earlier in Paris expressed fear of a ``mass
ethnic purification'' if the situation in Kosovo escalates.
	   On Wednesday night, Albright had a private dinner with Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, after a trip from Lyon that was delayed
when her plane was incapacitated, apparently by a bird stuck in the
engine.

West Indies bowlers keep SAfrica to 182 for eight wickets at tea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with action at tea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies fast bowlers
have the advantage at tea on Thursday as South Africa were at 182
for eight wickets, on the first day of the second test at St.
George's Park.
	   The West Indies won the toss and elected to bowl on a very
helpful wicket, and their decision was vindicated as they snatched
four wickets before lunch.
	   Hershelle Gibbs _ a mixed-race batsman called to the side after
government complaints that the team was too white - was the first
to go. Somewhat unluckily, he squeezed a Walsh express onto his own
stumps after scoring just two.
	   Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis stabilized the innings, but
struggled against a grassy pitch and a four-pronged West Indies
pace attack.
	   The tourists replaced legspinner Rawl Lewis with Mervyn Dillon,
and he struck almost as soon as he was introduced to the attack. He
removed Darryll Cullinan's legs stump with a yorker, and was
constantly in the batsmen's face.
	   Walsh was responsible for the other wickets, in the process
becoming the third-highest wicket taker in test history.
	   When he removed Gary Kirsten, caught down the legside by
wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs for 29, he surpassed Ian Botham's 383
wickets.
	   Kallis was the other man to go, as he gloved a short ball from
Walsh in an ill-advised hook shot, scoring a well-struck 30.
	   After lunch, it was Curtly Ambrose who struck, removing Jonty
Rhodes who had lived dangerously before the break. He was caught at
second slip for 17.
	   Shaun Pollock perished similarly when Ambrose switched the
attack to around the wicket. The South African allrounder had been
playing beautifully, but he sparred at one going across him.
	   When South Africa's captain Hansie Cronje was run out going for
a rash single, South Africa's innings was destined to crumble.
	   At the crease at tea were Pat Symcox on 15 and Allan Donald on
five.

Alleged Basque separatist attack slightly injures five in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Fireworks soaked in gasoline exploded
Thursday outside the home of a Spanish Civil Guard in northern
Spain in an attack authorities blamed on a Basque separatist group.
	   The explosion in Pamplona was evidence of ``a breakout of
lightweight terrorism,'' by groups of young radicals who support
the militant group ETA, Enrique Villar, a top official from Spain's
northern Navarra province said on National Spanish Radio.
	   ETA has been observing a cease-fire since Sept. 18 that
triggered talk of possible peace negotiations to end 30 years of
violence to attain a Basque homeland.
	   Villar said Thursday's attack underscored the need for continued
vigilance against breaks in ETA's cease-fire.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its violent
campaign for an independent state straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   The early morning explosion at the home of the unidentified
Spanish Civil Guard was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline,
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   Five people required medical attention including the wife of the
targeted Civil Guard whose face and hands were burned. The wounded
were not identified by name. Four neighbors were treated and
released from the hospital late Thursday, Dors said.
	   ``This is the first time something like this has happened here
since the cease-fire,'' he said.
	   In recent years the Spanish Civil Guards, whose role includes
counterterrorism, have been the targets of small-scale attacks
carried out by ETA's supporters.
	   ETA wants to include the province of Navarra in a future
independent Basque state, even though they are located south what
is now considered the Basque region.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police in an armored personnel
carrier blocked a team of forensics experts from Finland on
Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of massacre
victims in Kosovo.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta.
	   The start of digging on the makeshift graves of as many as 22
slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a breakthrough in
investigative work into atrocities in the war-ravaged Serbian
province.
	   But a Serb police contingent _ consisting of an armored
personnel carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak
jackets and carrying automatic rifles _ stopped the Finnish convoy
on the road in Trstenik, well short of their destination in the
central Drenica region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after spending more than two hours on the side
of the road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   A Serb judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic, said the team's
safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to our laws, the
exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family.
	   Ranta said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic immunity
of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who accompanied them.
	   In Belgrade, the independent radio station B-92 radio quoted
Ranta as saying a Serb policeman opened the ambassador's car,
grabbed a camera and took out a film.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during the Serb
forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in Kosovo.
	   The massacre prompted worldwide outrage and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to end the crackdown.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes. Serbia is
the larger of two republics left in Yugoslavia.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Several hundred Serbs began a protest march Thursday to a rebel
stronghold in southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the
disappearance of Serbs during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began a 20 kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo. Many are believed to
have been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.

Sri Lankan wins U.N. Human Rights Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sunila Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka is
among several winners of the 1998 U.N. Human Rights Prize, U.N.
officials said Thursday.
	   Abeyasekera is the executive director of INFORM, one of the key
human rights organizations in Sri Lanka. An activist for nearly 30
years, her work focused mainly on women's rights, armed conflicts
and conflict resolution.
	   She has played a key role in lobbying and advocacy work within
the U.N. human rights system and has established several
organizations working on human rights and democratic issues in Sri
Lanka, the U.N. citation said.
	   Other winners include former U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda, Jose Gregori of Brazil and Anna
Sabatova of the Czech Republic.
	   Abeyasekara's work assumes significance since Sri Lanka has been
fighting an ethnic conflict since 1983. Tamil Tiger rebels demand a
separate homeland for minority Tamils, accusing majority Sinhalese
of widespread discrimination in education and jobs.
	   She heads the Movement for Interracial Justice and Equality,
which debates possible solutions to the civil war and pressures the
government to investigate alleged military abuses.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will present the awards
later Thursday at the opening of the General Assembly commemoration
of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.

Ultra-Orthodox may consider compromise on army service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ultra-Orthodox leaders in Israel may be ready
to compromise on an arrangement that exempts rabbinical students
from army service, Israel radio reported Thursday, partly out of
concern at growing poverty in their community.
	   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court nullified the ad-hoc
arrangement, in existence since the establishment of Israel in
1948, and ordered Israel's parliament to legislate a new compromise
between the secular and religious communities within a year.
	   The arrangement lets rabbinical students study free in
seminaries and live on government stipends instead of serve in the
army. In order to receive the stipends, they are banned from
working.
	   Israel radio reported that legislators from two ultra-Orthodox
parties may proffer a compromise that would let the students work
in exchange for reduced army service. Israeli men currently serve
three years in the army.
	   In recent years, the birthrate among the ultra-Orthodox has
mushroomed, and a lack of marketable skills has led to widespread
poverty _ some estimate that half the community live below the
poverty line.
	   The stipend, once substantial, has been slashed to
below-subsistence levels.
	   Leaders in the community who once extolled seminary study as the
highest calling have quietly encouraged their rank and file to
pursue careers.
	   Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, made the
arrangement in order to win backing for the state from the
then-non-Zionist ultra-Orthodox community.
	   At the time, it applied to no more than 600 students. Now there
may be up to 30,000 exemptions.
	   The ultra-Orthodox have said that sustaining a culture of
religious learning almost wiped out by the Nazis is as important as
securing Israel's borders.
	   A string of media reports about religious men who receive the
stipends while working on the black market have stoked secular
resentment of the arrangement.
	   The suit was brought to the Supreme Court by secular lawmakers,
as well as a university student's group. Israeli students are
forced to defer their studies until they are 20 or 21, and then
must pay thousands of dollars in tuition.

Thais score swim gold

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS event of Aoyama in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Torlap Sethsothorn lifted
himself on a wave of fanatical support Thursday to win the host
country's first swimming gold medal of the XIII Asian Games.
	   Japan and China won two golds apiece leaving Japan with a 10-8
lead on the gold standings after 20 events.
	   Japan's world silver medalist Ayari Aoyama had her best time
under new regulations for the 100-meter butterfly and Shunsuke Ito
anchored the men's 4x100 freeestyle team to a narrow win over China
to preserve the lead.
	   But only one gold seemed to matter to the capacity crowd
Thursday as Sethsothorn, a silver medalist in the 200-meter
freestyle, won the 400 amidst emotional scenes. He took over the
lead at the 250-meter mark and kept out Japan's Masato Hirano as
noise rained down from overflowing stands.
	   Sethsothorn touched in a Games record 3 minutes, 53.61 seconds,
just in front of Hirano on 3:54.13. Hong Kong's Kwok Kin-Ming was
third.
	   ``I felt a lot of pressure going into the race at home,'' said
Sethsothorn, who thrashed around wildly in celebration immediately
after he touched the wall. ``But I'm glad for the support from
them, they're charming.''
	   Sethsothorn, whose younger brother Torwai finished sixth,
received a pop star reception when he came out for the victory
ceremony. Every time looked up at a section of the crowd or lifted
his arms there were shrieks.
	   His parents shared the moment and father Koop said, ``this is a
gift to us because today's our 24th anniversary.''
	   The noise level soared again when Ratapong Sirisanont took his
place in lane 4 as fastest qualifier in the 200 breaststroke. He
came from third at the final wall to just miss gold.
	   China's Zhu Yi edged Sirisanont by a finger tip, finishing in
2:16.26 to his rival's 2:16.47. Japan's Yoshinobu Miyazaki was
third.
	   In the lull after and before the storms of noise, Aoyama glided
to an important victory noticed by just a few. But her mom was one
of them.
	   The 16-year-old, beaten by United States star Jenny Thompson at
the Perth world titles, had too much class for the field, posting a
time of 59.44 seconds to 1 minute, 00.57 seconds by China's Ruan
Yi. Hitomi Kashima of Japan took bronze.
	   While she did not get much of a cheer from a crowd still
celebrating gold she did get a call from her mother which reduced
her to tears. Her mom watched the race on television in Japan.
``She told me I have a cute smile,'' Aoyama said.
	   It was Aoyama's best time since governing body FINA in March
banned the so-call submarine start, where butterfly swimmers
traveled as far as possible under water at the gun.
	   ``I am very glad to do it under one minute under the new
regulation,'' said Aoyama, who has the second best time in the
world this year. ``This is the first time.''
	   China's Li Wei was another to draw little reaction from the
crowd despite an impressive swim to win the women's 100 breastroke
in an Asian Games record of 1 minute, 08.95 seconds. She was more
than a second ahead of compatriot Xu Shan (1:10:00) with Japan's
Masami tanaka taking bronze.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ People around the world marked the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations' human rights charter Thursday by
protesting continued abuses, while some governments announced new
initiatives aimed at better rights protection.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights. The U.N. General Assembly scheduled a
special session to mark the anniversary.
	   But throughout the world, there were reminders of the many still
denied basic rights.
	   Thousands of student protesters marched to the U.N. building in
Indonesia's capital, demanding greater democracy as well as the
prosecution of former President Suharto on corruption charges.
	   And even as Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect
human rights in a letter marking the anniversary, police ransacked
the homes of several dissidents in a widening crackdown.
	   The Dalai Lama said in Paris that conditions for his fellow
Tibetans were worsening under Chinese rule, while scores of Tibetan
exiles in India burned the Chinese flag in protest of Beijing's
rule.
	   Elsewhere in India, people once known as ``untouchable''
announced the kickoff of a year-long campaign to eliminate the
caste system, which is illegal but persists.
	   Black-clad demonstrators outside the U.S. embassy in Athens hung
an effigy of the Statue of Liberty to protest America's continued
use of capital punishment.
	   In London, Amnesty International laid 3,197 white flowers _ one
for each of the people officially recognized as either murdered or
abducted under former Chilean President Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
regime. Pinochet is being held in London pending extradition to
Spain on charges of genocide and torture.
	   In Myanmar, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi attended a
U.N.-sponsored ceremony with other officials of her opposition
National League for Democracy. No government officials took part.
	   The junta has never honored the 1990 election in which her party
won 392 of the legislature's 485 seats, and has never allowed the
freely elected Parliament to meet. In the past several months, the
military rulers have arrested nearly a thousand of her party
members.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based Human Rights Watch started a worldwide
campaign in response to the Dec. 1 arrest of Hafez Abu Saada, head
of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, which recently
reported widespread torture by police of Coptic Christians in a
southern village.
	   South Africa, which staged several events, announced that it
would ratify several U.N. human rights conventions concerning civil
and political rights to mark the anniversary.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a review of all
people jailed for politically related crimes, and the Mozambique
government announced it plans to introduce human rights as part of
the school curriculum in 2000.
	   Echoing widespread sentiments, Cambodian opposition leader Sam
Rainsy cast doubt on whether some of those celebrating were
genuinely committed to the declaration.
	   ``It is deeply ironic to see international representatives
honoring the Universal Declaration at a time when their disregard
for its principles is so apparent,'' he said.
	   The 40-member Council of Europe committee of ministers called on
states to abolish the death penalty and establish independent
national institutions for the protection of human rights.
	   ``Three themes are of particular concern to us today: to secure
the abolition of capital punishment, to guarantee media freedom,
and the effective enjoyment of women's human rights,'' said Daniel
Tarschys, secretary-General of the council's human rights assembly.

Prisoners smuggle out plea to Clinton out of Israeli jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian prisoners have smuggled a
plea for their freedom out of an Israeli jail to U.S. President
Bill Clinton, and a copy of the letter was released Thursday.
	   The United States is trying to resolve the bitter dispute
between Israel and the Palestinians over prisoner releases that is
threatening to derail the Wye River land-for-security accord.
Clinton is arriving Saturday for a four-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas.
	   Israel has said it has met its obligations under the Wye
agreement by releasing 250 prisoners _ most common criminals _ last
month, the first group of a total of 750 to be freed by the end of
January.
	   The Palestinians say they had been given to understand that all
those freed would be prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities and
have accused Israel of violating the Wye accord.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States is
trying to get Israel to accept a compromise under which Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. officials will review prisoner lists name by
name and see whose release would be acceptable to all sides.
	   About 2,000 so-called security prisoners are held by Israel and
most have been on a hunger strike for a week.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser,
David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   In recent days, Palestinian marches for the release of prisoners
turned violent. On Wednesday, thousands threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas. A
17-year-old Palestinian was killed and scores of others were
wounded.
	   The prisoners' letter, written Nov. 22 in Nafha Prison, was
smuggled out and delivered to officials at the U.S. Consulate in
Jerusalem this week, said Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian
Prisoners' Association. A copy of the letter was obtained by The
Associated Press on Thursday.
	   The letter, handwritten in English in tiny letters on a page of
lined paper ripped out of a notebook, implores the U.S. president
to take serious steps to win their release.
	   The letter begins with the traditional Islamic blessing, ``In
the name of God,'' and continues: ``Mr. President Clinton _ Hi, how
are you, hoping you doing OK.''
	   It describes how their continued presence in jail has dashed
their hopes for a better future. ``We were fighters before the
peace to achieve our rights, and now we are prisoners looking
forward to be free, to build our country,'' the letter said.
	   As part of the protests, two tents simulating conditions in
Israeli prisons have been set up in Gaza City, where Clinton will
be on Monday.
	   In one tent, 62 protesters _ most former prisoners _ were on a
hunger strike led by Sufian Abu Zaideh, a deputy leader of the
Palestinian Prisoners Association.
	   ``Its not logical to sign a peace agreement with the leader,
while the soldiers remain in jail,'' Abu Zaideh said.
	   About half the prisoners are members of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, while the others belong to the
Islamic militant group Hamas which opposes the peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have not contested that Hamas prisoners will
not be eligible for early release. Still, the spiritual leader of
the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, joined the hunger strike Wednesday.
Yassin was placed under house arrest by Arafat in October.

Pamic appears on the way out from Hansa Rostock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Hansa Rostock's Croatian striker Igor
Pamic could be heading home soon.
	   Pamic has been dropped by coach Ewald Lienen from the roster for
poor performances in practice.
	   ``His attitude is bad for team morale,'' Lienen said Thursday.
	   Lienen has given Pamic a special jogging program outside the
team's practice.
	   Pamic is struggling Hansa Rostock's leading scorer with six
goals. But the burly forward already has had two red cards this
season and was caught driving drunk, prompting a club fine of
21,000 marks (dlrs 12,650).
	   Club chairman Eckhardt Rehberg reportedly is willing to let
Pamic go for a transfer fee of two million marks (dlrs 1.2
million).
	   Hansa is battling to avoid relegation and is 17th in the 18-team
Bundesliga.

Awards, concert on 50th anniversary of rights declaration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France honored Albanian Kosovo leader Ibrahim
Rugova as part of observances Thursday marking the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   On Thursday afternoon, President Jacques Chirac, near the Eiffel
Tower, and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, at United Nations
headquarters in New York, were holding a satellite linkup to wrap
up a weeklong conference in the French capital.
	   Meanwhile, Amnesty International was sponsoring a blockbuster
concert with Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Alanis Morisette,
Tracy Chapman and Radiohead, among others.
	   Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin handed out human
rights prizes to, in his words, ``support a raising of consciences
and to encourage collective action.''
	   Among the winners was Rugova, president of the Kosovo Democratic
League, for his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis
in Serb-ruled Kosovo province.
	   ``To transmit the culture of human rights, that's the first
mission of the government,'' the Socialist prime minister said. He
suggested having schoolchildren visit former concentration camps
and read books against racial hatred and exclusion.
	   The Dalai Lama, in Paris for the anniversary, issued a statement
saying some governments _ a clear reference to China _ treat the
principles in the rights declaration as ``products of Western
civilization, that don't apply to Asia or other parts of the Third
World.
	   ``I don't share that point of view and am certain that the
majority of people don't either,'' said the Tibetan spiritual
leader. The principles ``are a kind of natural law,'' he said.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police in an armored personnel
carrier blocked a team of forensics experts from Finland on
Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of massacre
victims in Kosovo.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta.
	   The start of digging on the makeshift graves of as many as 22
slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a breakthrough in
investigative work into atrocities in the war-ravaged Serbian
province.
	   The massacre prompted worldwide outrage and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to end his crackdown against militants seeking
indpendence for Kosovo.
	   On Thursday, a Serb police contingent _ consisting of an armored
personnel carrier and about two dozen policemen wearing flak
jackets and carrying automatic rifles _ stopped the Finnish convoy
on the road in Trstenik, well short of their destination in the
central Drenica region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after spending more than two hours on the side
of the road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
controls the area virtually unchallenged during the current truce,
said the police were unwelcome.
	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot
come with the police,'' said KLA local commander Gani Koci.
	   A Serb judge from Pristina, Danica Marinkovic, said the team's
safety also was reportedly at issue. ``According to our laws, the
exhumations can't take place without us,'' she said.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations on six sites, including a frozen hillside
in Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the mutilated bodies
of men, women and children from a single family.
	   Ranta said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic immunity
of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who accompanied them.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina were among the most savage during the Serb
forces' seven-month offensive against separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes. Serbia is
the larger of two republics left in Yugoslavia.
	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb
military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Several hundred Serbs began a protest march Thursday to a rebel
stronghold in southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the
disappearance of Serbs during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began a 20 kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo. Many are believed to
have been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.

No progress reported on WTO leadership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization looks set to miss its
mid-December target of choosing a new leader to lead it into the
next century because of U.S. and European indecision.
	   Diplomats charged with trying to forge a consensus among WTO
members said Thursday they had made no progress in narrowing down
the list of four candidates.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub are widely regarded as the
front-runners, ahead of former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren
and former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore.
	   But the European Union remains internally divided over its
choice and the United States has not yet declared its position.
Japan and other Asian countries are backing Supachai. Abouyoub is
expected to pick up support from developing countries.
	   ``There is only a limited possibility that all members of the
organization will declare their positions by Dec. 18,'' said
ambassadors Celso Lafer and William Rossier.
	   Renato Ruggiero, the current incumbent, wants to step down in
April. The WTO had set itself a mid-December deadline to make the
final choice.
	   Lafer, from Brazil, and Rossier, from Switzerland, are charged
with trying to mold a consensus among the 132 WTO members.
	   ``It's one thing to have problems to reach agreement on one
candidate. But it's quite a different matter not to be able to work
toward such a decision because certain members haven't let us know
their choice,'' the diplomats said, in veiled reference to
Washington and Brussels.
	   ``The current state of flux can't be maintained for much
longer,'' they said in a report to the WTO council.
	   The indecision comes at a time when the WTO and the open trade
system it champions is under pressure as a result of the global
economic crisis. There have been calls, especially in Asia, for
some form of protection to curb excesses of the free market.
	   The WTO is struggling to come up with a trade agenda for the
turn of the century, amid big differences between rich and poor
countries over environmental and labor issues.
	   All four candidates say they want to speed long-running
accession talks and bring China and Russia into the international
trading order as quickly as possible.
	   The silence of the United States and European Union is in
contrast to their unseemly public fight in the last leadership
contest, when the EU pushed Ruggiero and the United States wanted
former Mexican president Salinas de Gortari.

German finance minister seeks 25 percent cut in joblessness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Setting a specific jobs goal for the first
time since taking office, Germany's finance minister said Thursday
that the new government will have failed if it doesn't get 1
million unemployed Germans back to work by 2002.
	   Speaking on German television, Oskar Lafontaine said that the
new government, which won office in September, wants to reduce
unemployment to 3 million from the current 4 million by the next
election.
	   ``If we aren't able to manage this, then we've failed just like
the Kohl government,'' Lafontaine said.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election loss was blamed largely
on double-digit unemployment.
	   The new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, said earlier Thursday
that Germany, during its six-month chairmanship of the European
Union starting January, would aim to establish a European
employment pact.
	   On other issues, Lafontaine said the budget, scheduled to be
presented to parliament on Jan. 20, will likely record a deficit of
about 60 billion marks (dlrs 36 billion).
	   That would be about 4 billion marks (dlrs 2 billion) more than
planned in the draft prepared by Kohl's government before the Sept.
27 election.
	   Turning to the sensitive issue of European tax harmonization,
Lafontaine said that Britain and Germany were largely in agreement.
	   Britain has voiced strong criticism of such measures in fears
that it would mean a tax increase for the British. But Lafontaine
said: ``It would be an error to say British taxes are that low to
begin with.''

Bulgaria abolishes capital punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria on Thursday abolished capital
punishment and replaced it with life imprisonment without parole in
a measure to move its legal system closer to European standards.
	   The parliament voted 96-22 to approve the change. There were 3
abstentions.
	   Bulgaria imposed a moratorium on executions in 1990; however,
courts have continued to issue death sentences.
	   The abolishment of capital punishment doesn't automatically undo
the sentences of 19 convicts condemned to death since 1990. They
may be pardoned by President Petar Stoyanov.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police blocked a forensics team
Thursday from carrying out the first exhumations of Kosovo massacre
victims in a dispute over Serb access to rebel-controlled
territory.
	   The scheduled start of digging on the makeshift graves of as
many as 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians was to have marked a
breakthrough in investigative work into atrocities in the
war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   Government forces cracked down in February against Kosovo
militants seeking independence for the majority ethnic Albanian
province. Hundreds of people have been killed and in this year's
offensive and in periodic violence since an October truce.
	   The massacre prompted shock and outrage worldwide and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to withdraw forces and end the crackdown.
	   The Finnish team leader accused the Serb side of obstructing the
massacre investigation.
	   A Serb police contingent of an armored personnel carrier and
about two dozen policemen wearing flak jackets and carrying
automatic rifles stopped the Finnish convoy on the road in
Trstenik, well short of the graves site in the central Drenica
region.
	   The convoy carrying 19 forensics experts turned back toward the
capital, Pristina, after more than two hours on the side of the
road.
	   Serb police, who did not comment, reportedly insisted on
accompanying the team. But the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which

	   ``The Finnish team is free to come on their own but they cannot

	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them.
	   In Belgrade, the independent radio station B-92 radio quoted
Ranta as saying a Serb policeman opened the ambassador's car,
grabbed a camera and took out a film.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. She said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic
immunity of the Finnish ambassador for human rights, who
accompanied them. A Serbian investigative judge from Pristina,
Danica Marinkovic, said her team's safety also was reportedly at
issue. ``According to our laws, the exhumations can't take place

	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to

of men, women and children from a single family clan.
	   The September killings in a nearby forest 40 kilometers (25

	   While most of the victims were ethnic Albanians, the Serb

	   Underscoring the brutality on both sides, several hundred Serbs

	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our

they began the 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the

	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored

	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in Yugoslavia.

military also has alleged massacres by the KLA, and both sides have
been condemned for committing human rights abuses.
	   Several hundred Serbs began a protest march Thursday to a rebel
stronghold in southwestern Kosovo to call attention to the
disappearance of Serbs during the conflict.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' the 300-400 marchers were escorted by police as
they began a 20 kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac toward the
KLA stronghold of Dragobilje.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo. Many are believed to
have been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The 19-member Finnish team expects to spend up to a week at the
site in Gornje Obrinje, which the Albanians know as Obrija, before
moving on to the other sites, some containing Serb bodies:
Glodjane, Golubovac, Klecka, Orohovac and Volujak.
	   ``We're not here to say who's guilty and who's the
perpetrators,'' Ranta said before Thursday's dispute. ``We're here
to shed some light on the sequence of events and how these people
died.''
	   The results of exhumations and autopsies by the team, sponsored
by the European Union, will be given to local courts and also could
further war crimes investigations in Kosovo.

Yugoslav pop star plays in Croatia for the first time after war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Rambo Amadeus, a popular Belgrade pop
singer, is to hold a concert in Croatia on Thursday, the first
Yugoslav artist to do so since the two countries fought a 1991 war.
	   The six-month war erupted when Croatia's minority Serbs, backed
by the Yugoslav army, rebelled against the newly independent
Croatian government which had withdrawn from the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The war ended in January 1992, but the animosities between
Croats and Serbs, the dominant people in the current Yugoslavia,
remained high.
	   Just a few months ago, it was unthinkable that in nationalist
Croatia, a Yugoslav musician would perform in such a public venue.
	   Rambo Amadeus, whose real name is Antonije Pusic, lives in
Belgrade, but is of Montenegro origin.
	   Artists from Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia, other former
Yugoslav republics, continued to entertain Croatian fans. But Serbs
were unwelcome _ at least officially _ including those like Rambo
Amadeus who are outspoken critics of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Milosevic is widely accused for fomenting wars in Croatia and
Bosnia.
	   Yugoslav artists, whose music is also rarely aired on Croatian
radio stations, have held concerts in neighboring Slovenia. Tens of
thousands of Croats cross the border to attend.
	   But while state-run television last year criticized a local Serb
community for playing Serb music in downtown Zagreb, suburban clubs
and coffee shops that play Serbian music flourished.
	   Illegally printed CDs and cassettes are available on every
street corner. Pirated CDs and tapes with songs of Ceca, wife of
Serb militia leader Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan, are among the most
sought after.
	   Music critics said the concert of Rambo Amadeus, organized by a
non-governmental human rights organizations to mark the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. human rights charter, will be a test for
future projects.

Prosecutor: crime boss wanted to disrupt national order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Sergei Mikhailov posed a real threat to western
society as a Russian mafia boss, a Swiss prosecutor said Thursday.
	   Speaking at the end of a two-week trial, Jean-Louis Crochet
praised all the witnesses who had dared to testify against
Mikhailov, some under heavy protection.
	   ``If you find him guilty you will have said he has tried to
disrupt national order and infiltrate himself into Switzerland,''
Crochet told the jury of six. ``We will have succeeded in putting
an end sufficiently early to the gangrene for western society which
organized crime represents.''
	   Mikhailov, 40, is charged with being a member in a criminal
organization.
	   In a four-hour summation, Crochet pointed to the evidence of
witnesses from half a dozen countries about Mikhailov's activities.
	   He highlighted the testimony of retired FBI special agent Robert
Levinson, who described the structure of the Solntsevskaya mafia
organization, of which Mikhailov is allegedly the leader, and links
to the United States.
	   Crochet also praised the courage of witnesses who told the court
they had been subject to threats and beatings from Solntsevskaya.
	   ``Organized crime has the aim of taking control of the economy
and exerting influence over politics. The rule of silence is the
golden rule,'' he said.
	   Mikhailov, who has been in custody in Switzerland for two years,
denies the charges against him and claims he is an ordinary
businessman, though he admits to being ``very, very rich.''
	   The verdict is expected Friday or Saturday. If convicted,
Mikhailov faces a maximum of 7 1/2 years in jail.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In the first U.N. case to focus
exclusively on rape as a war crime, a Bosnian Croat paramilitary
chief was convicted Thursday of letting a subordinate sexually
assault a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced Anto Furundzija, 29,
to 10 years in prison, ruling that his failure to stop the rape
made him a ``fellow perpetrator'' guilty of two war crimes counts.
	   ``In such situations, the fellow perpetrator plays a role every
bit as grave as the person who actually inflicts the pain and
suffering,'' the judges wrote in a 100-page ruling.
	   Furundzija's attorney said he would appeal the conviction and
sentence.
	   ``Our position is one of true shock,'' said Luka Misetic. ``We
firmly, unequivocally state that our client is not guilty.''
	   Furundzija appeared unmoved when he heard the verdicts and
sentence. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   The case against Furundzija was based almost exclusively on the
closed-door testimony of the alleged victim, identified by the
tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Defense attorneys tried to have her testimony thrown out,
claiming it was unreliable because she was suffering post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). They also accused prosecutors of trying to
conceal her psychological problems.
	   In light of the claims, the three-judge panel led by presiding
Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia had taken the unprecedented step of
reopening the trial so the victim could be cross-examined again and
to hear evidence about her mental state.
	   But on Thursday, the judges rejected the argument that her
testimony was flawed.
	   ``The trial chamber ... accepts Witness A's testimony that she
has sufficiently recollected the material aspects of the relevant
events,'' Mumba said. She added that ``expert evidence demonstrates
that even when a person is suffering from PTSD, she or he may still
be a reliable witness.''
	   If Furundzija's appeal fails, he will be jailed in either
Norway, Finland or Italy.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija.
	   The judges deplored Furundzija's role in her ordeal.
	   ``A woman was brought into detention, kept naked and helpless
before her interrogators and treated with the utmost cruelty and
barbarity,'' their ruling said.
	   ``The accused, far from preventing these crimes, played a
prominent part in their commission.''
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight others are on trial in three separate cases for
their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.

Fans bivouac in frosty weather to see Kelly Family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Dozens of teenage fans of the
Irish pop stars Kelly Family have been bivouacing for days outside
the venue where the group is scheduled to perform Friday.
	   The most ardent fans arrived Tuesday in the town of Pilsen,
where the sold-out concert will take place. They've been sleeping
on the sidewalk in front of the concert hall in temperature
reaching minus 15 degrees centigrade, the CTK news agency reported
Thursday.
	   The Germany-based Kelly Family is a regular guest to the Czech
Republic, playing sold-out shows in some of the country's largest
concert halls.
	   The group causes frenzy among teenage pop music fans every time
it comes to the Czech Republic. In the past, several kids have been
known to run away from home and travel across the whole country to
see the band playing.
	   Kelly Family are virtually unknown in English-speakimg speaking
countries but rank among the most popular pop groups in places like
Germany, the Czech Republic or Slovakia.

China dominates shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China shot its opposition to pieces
Thursday, claiming seven of eight medals in the shooting
competition at the Asian Games.
	   China's clay target shooters led the way with all four golds
while it had others in the team and individual titles in the men's
rapid fire pistol and the men's air rifle event.
	   Zhang Penghui dethroned defending champion and former record
holder Vladimir Vokhmjanine in the rapid fire pistol event, scoring
688.7 points.
	   ``I was too excited. I have been waiting for this moment for a
long time,'' said Zhang, a 20-year-old from Southeast China.
	   Vokhmajnine, who set the previous Games record of 688.6 points
at Hiroshima in 1994, had to settle for silver with 686.0 points
here. He was followed by Park Byung-Taek of South Korea at 680.5.
	   In the rapid fire pistol team event, the Chinese trio of Zhang,
Ji Haiping and Meng Gang totaled 1,742 points, four points ahead of
silver medalist North Korea. Kazakhstan won the bronze with 1,736.
	   In the air rifle competition, Cai Yalin broke the Games record
696.8 points, topping the previous mark of 690.3. Japan's Masaru
Yanagida won the silver while Thailand's Komkrit Kongnamchok got
the bronze.
	   Thailand broke China's sharpshooting record with the air rifle
team title. Its score of 1,769 also broke the previous Games record
of 1,753 set at Hiroshima.
	   In clay shooting, Hu Bingyuan won the men's double trap with 177
hits while Gao E became the women's champion by scoring 137 hits.
Their teams also claimed golds.
	   Chinese Li Bo came home with a silver in the men's event,
followed by Mashfi Almutairi of Kuwait. Kuwait took the team silver
medal while Singapore won the bronze.
	   South Korea's Lee Sang-Hee and Thailand's Vilanan got the silver
and bronze medals in the women's event.
	   The team event silver went to South Korea and Japan took the
bronze.

Jewish settlers say they want to leave West Bank settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Most of the residents of a Jewish West Bank
settlement surrounded by Palestinian-ruled areas said Thursday they
want to leave and return to Israel because they are afraid.
	   The demand by residents of the Ganim settlement for government
compensation for making the move stirred debate over the future of
the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Ganim settlers were
showing ``momentary weakness.''
	   He accused the opposition Labor Party of trying to encourage
settlers to leave, in hopes of undermining his policy of not
dismantling any Jewish settlements, even in a permanent peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Labor legislator Hagai Merom denied the charges, saying the
Ganim settlers had turned to him for help.
	   Merom said he would initiate legislation to make government
compensation available to them and other settlers who wish to
leave. Homes in Israel are far more expensive than those in the
West Bank, and homes in a settlement being deserted would have
little resale value.
	   Nearly all the 50 families in Ganim signed a petition seeking
compensation, said Miriam Deutsch, one of the residents. ``We want
out of here because we are afraid,'' Deutsch said.
	   On Monday, a resident of the nearby Jewish settlement of Kadim
was wounded in a drive-by shooting, apparently by a Palestinian
militant. Ganim and Kadim became isolated enclaves, surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled areas, when Israel withdrew troops in the
northern West Bank as part of the Wye River agreement.
	   Residents of Ganim and Kadim readily admit that they came to the
West Bank because a house with a garden is much cheaper in the
settlements than in Israel's crowded cities.
	   In other West Bank settlements, the residents are religious Jews
who settled for ideological reasons, believing that Israel should
annex the West Bank because it is the heartland of the biblical
Land of Israel. These settlers would be more likely to stay in
their homes even in the face of attacks by Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The High Court on Thursday ordered
prosecutors and defense lawyers to redouble their efforts to bring
home fugitive ex-president Canaan Banana, convicted last month on
sodomy and homosexual assault charges.
	   The ruling came as gay activists in the capital of Harare and in
neighboring South Africa protested the government's criminalization
of homosexuality.
	   The demonstration in Harare was part of the country's
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
	   But Zimbabwe police refused to perform with their brass band as
planned and to escort a march of several groups of human rights
advocates because of the presence of gay activists, an activist
said.
	   ``The police said they could not be seen to be going against
state policies against homosexuality,'' said Keith Goddard, head of
the small activist group, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe.
	   Banana, 63, believed to be in hiding in neighboring South
Africa, was to have been sentenced Thursday for offenses carrying a
maximum penalty of more than 20 years in jail.
	   Defense lawyer Josephine McNally said Judge Godfrey Chiyausiku
postponed Thursday's hearing to Jan. 18 to give the state and
Banana's defense time to get him to the court.
	   The case has embarrassed President Robert Mugabe, who has waged
an outspoken campaign against homosexuality, describing same-sex
partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   The judge said the state should urgently negotiate Banana's
return with South African authorities. He asked both sides to
prepare arguments on whether Banana can be sentenced in absentia.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela triggered controversy
earlier this month when he met with Banana at his official
residence in Pretoria at Banana's request.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister who served as ceremonial president
after independence in 1980 until 1987, was convicted Nov. 26 in
Harare on 11 charges of sodomy, homosexual assault, ``unnatural
acts'' and common assault.
	   He fled to Botswana earlier in November.
	   South African officials have said they have no record of his
crossing into their territory and they didn't know his whereabouts
after the meeting with Mandela.
	   Zimbabwe has no formal extradition treaty with South Africa but
officials there have said Banana would be returned to Zimbabwe as
an illegal alien if it was proven he slipped into the country
unlawfully.
	   In the past, South Africa and Zimbabwe have exchanged criminals
by mutual agreement.
	   Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe but not in South Africa.

Excerpts of Nobel Peace Prize laureates' speeches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Nobel-Peace &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from the speeches of David Trimble and John Hume after
receiving the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday in Oslo, Norway.
	   ___
	    &UR; TRIMBLE:
	   In one sense, the singling of one or two persons for a peace
prize must always seem something of an injustice. In Northern
Ireland, I could name scores of people, unionist and nationalist,
who deserve this prize as well.
	   ___
	   We have a few fanatics who dream of forcing the Ulster British
People into a Utopian Irish state, more ideologically Irish than
its own inhabitants want. We also have fanatics who dream of
permanently suppressing northern nationalists in a state more
supposedly British that its inhabitants actually want.
	   ___
	   We go on all the better if we walk rather than run. If we put
aside fantasy and accept the flawed nature of human enterprises.
Sometimes we will stumble, but this need not matter.
	   ___
	   There are two traditions in Northern Ireland. There are two main
religious denominations. But there is only one true moral
denomination and it wants peace.
	    &UR; HUME:
	   We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,
particularly those of the North of Ireland who have lived and
suffered the reality of our conflict.
	   ___
	   There's not two people in this room who are the same. Difference
is the essence of humanity. Difference is an accident of birth, and
it should therefore never be a source of hatred or conflict. The
answer to difference is to respect it.
	   ___
	   I want to see our Ireland _ North and South _ the wounds of
violence healed. I want to see it play its rightful role in Europe
that will, for all Irish people, be a shared bond or patriotism and
new endeavor ... as an example to men and women everywhere of what
can be achieved by living for ideals, rather than fighting or dying
for them.
	   ____
	   Today, as I have said, our world also commemorates the adoption
50 years ago of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To me
there is a unique appropriateness, a sort of poetic fulfillment, in
the coincidence that my fellow laureate and I, representing a
community long divided by the forces of a terrible history, should
jointly be honored on this day. I humbly accept this honor on
behalf of a people who, after many years of strife made a
commitment to a better future in harmony together.

Big guns make it to last eight; now for the draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Previous titlists Real Madrid, Juventus, Inter
Milan, Bayern Munich and Manchester United have all made it to the
last eight of the European Champions Cup.
	   Now they are sweating on the draw.
	   German champion Kaiserslautern, Olympiakos of Greece and Dynamo
Kiev of Ukraine are also in next Wednesday's draw in Geneva and the
lineup sets up the possibility of some high-powered matchups.
	   UEFA has drawn up only three principles affecting the draw which
has the six group winners and two best runners up from the previous
round.
	   The winners and runners up from the same group won't face each
other. That means Inter Milan and defending champion Real Madrid
can't meet in the quarterfinal and Bayern Munich knows it won't
face Manchester United again.
	   The two runners up, Real and Manchester United, won't meet
either. But they know they will be at home in the first legs on
March 3.
	   UEFA has made no provision to separate teams from the same
country. That means Inter could face Juventus and Bayern Munich
could meet Kaiserslautern.
	   For Bayern and Manchester United, who tied 1-1 at Old Trafford
on Wednesday, this is the chance to recapture former glories.
Bayern hasn't won the title since 1976 and United's sole appearance
in the final was when it beat Benfica in 1968.
	   A three-time winner between 1974-76, Bayern lost in the '82 and
'87 finals and general manager Uli Hoeness says that reaching the
last eight could be a springboard to another success.
	   ``We lagged behind for many years but now we are where we
belong,'' he said. ``It was very important for our reputation.''
	   Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld won the title with Borussia
Dortmund two seasons ago but believes the Munich team must improve
to get to the top and stay there.
	   ``We have to strengthen ourselves for the next season to be able
to keep the standard, meet the lofty goals expected of us and stay
among the top teams in Europe,'' Hitzfeld said.
	   ``I want to win the Champions League at some point with Bayern
and I want to have one of the best teams in Europe _ and not for
one season, but for several years in a row.''
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who guided his team to
four league titles in five years and a Champions Cup semifinal two
seasons ago, has made no secret that he wants the European title,
even at the expense of another domestic league triumph.
	   ``We have the imagination and the playing ability to do really
well. Our playing ability makes me feel quite confident for what
lies ahead,'' Ferguson said.
	   ``We can settle down now until March and all I hope is that we
have the same group of players to pick from as we did for this game
and do not suffer the kind of injuries that affected us so much
last season when we went out to Monaco in the quarterfinal.''
	   Despite appearing in the last three finals, Juventus only made
it to the last eight by scoring its first win after five tied
games. La Juve downed Norway's Rosenborg 2-0 Wednesday and advanced
on a results count-back only because Galatasaray lost 1-0 at
already-eliminated Athletic Bilbao.
	   ``It would have been a big slap in the face for us to be out of
European competition, which we have dominated in recent years,''
said Juve's French midfielder, Didier Deschamps.
	   Inter, which has fired its coach mid-season after some poor
performances in Serie A, appears rejuvenated after wins over Real
Madrid and Sturm Graz.
	   Owner Massimo Moratti basked after the win in Austria.
	   ``It was a very important evening, for three reasons,'' Moratti
said. ``Ronaldo returned and played well; Baggio scored a pretty
goal, the kind a great player like he can; and because we
qualified, with a beautiful win.''
	   It was the first victory for new Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu,
following a loss and a draw in Serie A.
	   ``I don't know whether to be happier about reaching the
quarterfinals or about finally being fit,'' Ronaldo said. ``The
knee did not hurt and I am confident I'll be able to get back to
full strength.''
	   Bookmakers Ladbrokes installed Inter Milan as the 3-1 favorite
to win the title with Juventus second at 7-2, Manchester United
third at 9-2 and Olympiakos the 20-1 outsider. But that will all
change after the draw.

Six killed, 16 wounded in bombing of Narus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese military aircraft bombed a
rebel-controlled town in southern Sudan for three days, killing six
people and wounding 16, an aid agency official said Thursday.
	   The deaths occurred Tuesday when a plane dropped 14 bombs on
various targets in Narus, 30 kilometers (15 miles) north of the
Kenyan border, said Dan Eiffie, a spokesman for Norwegian People's
Aid.
	   ``This is purely a civilian center and far from the front
line,'' Eiffie said.
	   He said the town has schools operated by the Roman Catholic
Church and a clinic run by Sudan Medical Care, a local relief
agency supported by the Norwegian organization.
	   Eiffie said the local agency told him by radio that the bombing
continued Wednesday and Thursday but no figures on casualties were
yet available. He did not know what the targets were.
	   Narus is about 270 kilometers (165 miles) east of Juba, the
largest town in southern Sudan still under government control and
about 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) south of the Sudanese capital
Khartoum.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from Sudanese
officials in Khartoum.
	   On Monday, a lone Antonov aircraft dropped six bombs on
Chuckudum, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Ugandan
border and 70 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Narus. No injuries
were reported.
	   The air force has bombed the hospital run by the Norwegians in
Yei at least six times in the past 20 months since the town was
captured by the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Yei is 160
kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Juba.
	   In 1983, the predominantly African, Christian and animist
southerners took up arms for the second time since Sudan's
independence in 1956 against the Muslim and Arabized north to press
for increased autonomy and development.

Communist partners resign from government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's Communist Party quit the ruling
coalition Thursday, depriving Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
of a parliamentary majority.
	   It was not clear if Koirala's Nepali Congress government would
would have to resign, since the opposition appeared too divided to
form a majority to replace it.
	   All 13 Cabinet members of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxist-Leninist) handed their resignations to Koirala at his
official residence, party officials said. The communists joined the
government in August.
	   Koirala refused to accept the communists' demand that the
government sack the country's police chief, include at least five
Communist Party members in the Cabinet and appoint their supporters
to head district administrations in some key areas.
	   But their main difference has been setting a date for the next
general election. Koirala wants an early election in April 1999
while the Communist group wanted balloting in November next year as
scheduled.
	   ``The Nepali Congress showed no political honesty. We decided to
withdraw from government after it showed no interest to fulfill our
demands,'' Central Committee Member Kiran Gurung said.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Nepali Congress.
	   In August, the party had joined the ruling Nepali Congress,
which then was running a minority government. With the help of 40
Communist members, the Nepali Congress came to control 127 votes in
the 205-seat House of Representatives, Nepal's lower house of
parliament.
	   With the resignation, the Nepali Congress is once again in a
minority with only 87 lawmakers.

 &UR; Solzhenitsyn at 80: still grumbling about Russia's rulers &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Solzhenitsyn celebrates his 80th
birthday Friday, his influence waning, but his grumpy voice still
railing against Russian leaders he denounces as foolish and
corrupt.
	   With his long gray beard and severe countenance, Solzhenitsyn
cultivates the image of a 19th-century sage, and his place in
history is assured by the monumental works that chronicled the
atrocities of the prison camp life during the Soviet era.
	   But today he is largely ignored in Russia, where many regard him
as a cranky old man whose words have little relevance amid the
country's current turmoil.
	   ``He played a great role in history, but not in literature,
because he has no followers in literature,'' said Russian writer
Vladimir Voinovich. ``His role is more historical now.''
	   Since returning to Russia in 1994 after 20 years in exile,
mostly in Vermont, Solzhenitsyn and his wife Natalya have
maintained a reclusive existence in a dacha on the outskirts of
Moscow.
	   However, his birthday has brought a temporary surge of public
attention.
	   He planned to visit the Swedish Embassy on Thursday evening,
where he and other Nobel laureates were to be feted. And Friday, he
planned to attend a play, ``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of
his novel ``The First Circle.''
	   Television networks have been running a series of documentaries
on Solzhenitsyn, though he forced the cancellation of one when he
complained that he had not been allowed to screen the film in
advance.
	   His most recent book, ``Russia in Collapse,'' was published this
summer with an initial print run of just 5,000. It sold better than
expected, and another 5,000 copies were ordered.
	   In his recent writings and speeches, Solzhenitsyn has bemoaned
Russia's disintegration and condemned the country's post-Soviet
leaders as no better than the communist rulers he so reviled.
	   ``The system of central power ... is just as uncontrollable,
lacking any public responsibility and immune from punishment as the
Communist power was,'' he wrote in a 1996 essay. ``As much as we
wish to, it cannot be called democracy.''
	   In modern Russia, serious writers have lost the elevated status
they had in Communist times, and Solzhenitsyn has lamented the fact
that his compatriots no longer read his work in large numbers.
	   His conservative and nationalist views have come under fire from
liberals, and he's also despised by hard-liners for his militant
anti-Communism.
	   Still, no one denies his enormous impact during the Soviet era.
	   ``The influence of Solzhenitsyn on Russian literature and, in
general, on Russian history was enormous _ incomparable to any
other writer in this century,'' said Yegor Gaidar, a former prime
minister and the grandson of a famous Russian writer.
	   ``He is a great writer, public figure and fighter,'' said writer
Faizal Iskander. ``His greatest role was in fighting and exposing
the totalitarian (Soviet) regime. There was no equal to him.''
	   In a country where the average man doesn't live to the age of
60, Solzhenitsyn still appears vigorous and lucid at 80, though he
did suffer a mild heart attack two years ago.
	   Solzhenitsyn said Russia's past decade of change has
accomplished little aside from tearing down communism.
	   ``I see no changes for the better,'' he said in a rare speech
last year. ``We are doing everything to destroy Russia. We have no
market, no democracy _ a wild predatory capitalism is being built
here.''
	   Solzhenitsyn had already laid bare the country's gulag, or
prison camp, system and achieved international renown when Soviet
authorities arrested and exiled him in 1974.
	   He settled in a rural compound in Vermont and maintained
monastic discipline, producing a multivolume saga of Russian
history entitled ``The Red Wheel.''
	   It was less successful than his best-known works _ ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago'' _ which portrayed the lives of Soviet citizens in
forced-labor camps.
	   Solzhenitsyn himself spent eight years in the camps for writing
a letter to friends that criticized Soviet leader Josef Stalin. The
``Gulag'' trilogy remains the most detailed published history of
how Stalin terrorized, murdered and imprisoned millions.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books still provide sustenance to women such as
Zoya Marchenko, 91, who spent more than 20 years in labor camps.
	   ``It seems to me that he is now fulfilling his duty to the
dead,'' she said. ``He knows how many young and talented people
were killed. For me, at any rate, Solzhenitsyn is a symbol of
bravery, honesty and truth.''

Russian Communist leader warns of emergency rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ President Boris Yeltin's powers should be
cut to avoid further chaos and stop the military from stepping in,
the leader of Russia's Communist Party said Thursday.
	   Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin should not be allowed to topple
governments without lawmakers' consent so that Premier Yevgeny
Primakov could rescue Russia's economy.
	   ``If the Primakov government does not make it, I believe the
(next) government of Russia will be made up of military officers
who will only have two aims, to safeguard Russia's territorial
integrity and keep its population alive'' by preventing a famine,
Zyuganov told reporters in Athens.
	   ``Primakov is a very intelligent and talented man, '' he said.
``But at any moment, Yeltsin can dissolve this government by
decree.'' Zyuganov proposed introducing legislation that would
prevent governments from being abolished without the approval of
Russia's two houses of parliament.
	   Zyuganov said Yeltsin's successive changes of government had
brought Russia to its knees. He described the president as a sick
and corrupt man who ``broke Russia's steering wheel while drunk''
and was personally responsible for the country's market melt-down
this summer.
	   ``Yeltsin tried to import a Mafia-like and criminal capitalism
that led to a great catastrophe and to a loss for him and his
country,'' he said. ``For about half the year, he works from
hospital or a convalescence home... Yeltsin's time is up.''
	   Here by invitation of the Greek Communist Party, Zyuganov was
applauded by Communists in the audience. But he tried to balance
his message, trying to appeal both to traditional Russian voters
and world powers.
	   Russia, he said, and would support investment drives and
free-market reforms similar to those implemented by fast-growing
Communist China.
	   He argued that his brand of Communism shared the ideals of
Christianity and said his party would defend Russia's
``geopolitical responsibility'' in Europe and Asia, which endured
throughout Czarist rule and the Soviet Union.
	   While in Greece, Zyuganov met with Parliament speaker Apostolos
Kaklamanis and top officials from the Greek Communist Party and
governing Socialist Party.
	   After his stop in Greece, Zyuganov is scheduled to travel to
Tunisia and Libya.

Chechen official shows video of hostage claiming to be British spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ One of four foreigners beheaded by
kidnappers in Chechnya claims in a videotape shown today that he
and his fellow hostages were British spies.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about it,
including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government
had it.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. One,
Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the
British secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their
mission was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
extremism in the region, he said in Russian.
	   The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined up
Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen
security forces were still searching today for the bodies.
	   The government has said it was trying to rescue the men at the
time of their deaths, which have outraged Britain and Russia.
	   But its possession of the tape was likely to increase suspicions
of a government link in the frequent kidnappings in Chechnya since
it won de facto independence from Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most
hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in
captivity.
	   Kennedy and his three colleagues _ Darren Hickey and Rudolf
Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were employees
of Britain's Granger Telecom.
	   They were reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in
Chechnya when they were abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in
Grozny.
	   In the tape, Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to
monitor phone calls.
	   Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia
Andrew Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but
any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on
Chechen territory.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Angry students on Thursday hurled
stones and bottles at Jakarta's police headquarters on one of the
biggest days of antigovernment protest since former President
Suharto quit in May.
	   Arms linked and marching in step, as many as 10,000 protesters
surged down the Indonesian capital's main thoroughfare in a show of
discontent with the pace of a political overhaul promised by
President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``Reform,'' the flag-waving protesters chanted as they marched
past embassies and five-star hotels, drawing cheers from office
workers who lined the sidewalks. Most of the marches were peaceful,
but there were several clashes with security forces.
	   Yet again, the students ignored an appeal to stop their
demonstrations from Habibie, who has failed to convince his critics
that he is sincere about democratic change. Even so, Indonesians
now have far more freedom than they did under Suharto.
	   Habibie has scheduled general elections for June 1999 and let
political parties form, but he has ignored key student demands that
the military be stripped of its prominent role in politics and that
Suharto be put on trial.
	   State prosecutors are investigating alleged corruption under
Suharto during his 32 years of authoritarian rule and questioned
him for four hours on Wednesday. The 77-year-old ex-army general
quit in May after a wave of student rallies and deadly riots eroded
his power.
	   Students fear the government, still packed with Suharto
appointees, is too beholden to the former president to scrutinize
the source of his wealth, estimated by Forces magazine at dlrs 4
billion. Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.
	   ``Try Suharto, bring down Habibie,'' read a banner hoisted by
one band of protesters.
	   Most of Thursday's rallies were joyous, with students swaying on
bus roofs, honking motorcycle horns, singing democracy anthems and
dancing to drum beats.
	   But students clashed with officers who flailed at them with
sticks in several places, including in front of the police
headquarters of the city of 11 million people.
	   ``Pigs!'' they shouted at police, jabbing at a wall of riot
shields with flag staffs. The officers retreated as a commander
raised his arms and shouted at his troops: ``Don't get angry.''
	   At least 30 students were injured, student leaders said.
	   Another group of several thousand protesters attempted to get to
the heavily guarded presidential palace but were blocked by troops
and small tanks about a kilometer (a half mile) away.
	   Soldiers stood silent as some students placed stickers on their
reinforced plastic shields and then peered over to read the slogan,
``Arrest Suharto right away.''
	   For days, activists had planned a massive turnout to mark the
50th anniversary of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Rallies were held despite a warning from Indonesia's
government that it would not tolerate violent protests.
	   ``If Habibie is a democrat, he has to hear the voice of the
people,'' said Burhanuddin, a student organizer.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas predicted that student
demonstrations would continue as Indonesia moves toward greater
democracy and tries to fix its shattered economy.
	   He said some unidentified groups have tried to manipulate
otherwise peaceful student protests to create unrest for their own
political purposes.
	   ``We will use acknowledged and recognized anti-riot gear ... but
not lethal weapons'' to quell unrest, he said at a news conference.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces opened fire on hundreds of student
protesters who tried to march on the Parliament. Nine protesters
were killed.
	   Outbreaks of riots and lawlessness have increased in recent
months as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years delivers
soaring inflation, mass unemployment and widespread poverty.
	   Religious tensions between the Muslim majority and the Christian
minority have resulted in deaths and attacks on dozens of mosques
and churches.
	   U.S. Sen. John Kerry wound up a brief fact-finding visit to
Jakarta just hours before the protests started on Thursday. During
his trip, he met Habibie and military commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   Kerry said the United States was watching events in Indonesia,
mindful that the sprawling Southeast Asian nation played an
important role in the region and had enormous potential as a
market.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The secretary-general of
NATO and the alliance's supreme commander arrived Thursday in
Sarajevo to meet with the newly elected Bosnian leaders and discuss
the peace process in the country.
	   During their one-day visit, Javier Solana and Gen. Wesley Clark
met with members of the Bosnian joint three-member presidency and
with parliamentary leaders and told them they would like to see in
next six months improvement in the implementation of the all
aspects of Dayton peace agreement.
	   Solana and Clark also met with top civilian and military
international officials who are working on the implementation of
the agreement which was signed in 1995 after 3 1/2 years of war.
	   ``I would like to say that all these countries that have forces
deployed now continue with the same commitment to help this country
to find stability and peace,'' Solana said.
	   This visit is coming just several days before the Peace
Implementation Council in Madrid, Spain, where ways of helping the
Bosnian peace and economic prosperity will be discussed.
	   On Tuesday, NATO foreign ministers agreed to leave NATO-led
peace troops in Bosnia at their current level of 32,000 in the
future.
	   ``NATO is prepared to meet the security challenged in this
region, absolutely,'' General Clark said.

	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serbs marched across
southwestern Kosovo to a rebel stronghold Thursday in a peaceful
protest against the disappearance of Serbs during the conflict in
the tense province.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' about half the estimated 400 marchers completed a
20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac to this KLA command post,
where their leader held cordial but unproductive talks with a
regional Albanian official.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have
been abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The rebels have released some of their hostages following
mediation by international officials. But they claim to be no
longer holding any, raising fears that many were killed.
	   A local official with ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army denied
knowledged of the Serb civilians' fate and said more than 1,500
Kosovo Albanians also are missing or believed kidnapped. .
	   ``You have come to the wrong address,'' Lulzim Paqarizi,
regional secretary of the Albanians' Council for Defense of Human
Rights and Freedoms, told the march leader. ``Our forces have never
attacked Serb civilians.''
	   ``We believe this is the correct address,'' Orahovac Mayor
Andeljko Kolasinac responded in the one-on-one meeting arranged
hastily by American peace verifiers now stationed in Dragobilje.
	   The two shook hands afterward and the Serbs were bused home
without incident.
	   The march organizer told reporters earlier that the ``peace
march'' was a symbol of solidarity for the families of the missing.
	   ``We want to tell the public what consequences terrorism had
here, and the tragedy of Orahovac,'' he said.
	   One elderly woman on the march was supported by her two
daughters, crying as she lamented: ``My life isn't worth anytyhing
without my son.''
	   A man whose two cousins have been missing for six months came
from a village near the town of Suva Reka to join the walk.
	   ``I came to protest because they are innocent,'' he said. ``Let
foreign countries see that we are for peace.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's splintered liberals on Thursday announced
an ambitious plan to unite against a perceived Communist threat,
but were still struggling to decide which of its powerful
personalities to anoint as leader.
	   Several key reformers stayed away from the alliance, raising
doubts about its viability.
	   ``The question is whether the nation will be able to preserve
democratic values and free market or roll back to the totalitarian
past,'' former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said. ``Facing such
a fundamental choice, we must forget about differences and personal
ambitions.''
	   Kiriyenko and a dozen other leading liberal politicians,
including Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais, Boris Nemtsov and Boris
Fyodorov, set up an organizing committee Thursday for a new
movement intended to confront the Communists in next year's
parliamentary elections.
	   The idea for the coalition has gathered strength since the
killing of outspoken liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova on Nov.
20. Some liberals pointed fingers at the Communists for her death,
although there was no evidence to back such claims.
	   The new movement, which doesn't have a name yet, will unite
``center-right'' parties opposing the Communists and their
hard-line allies, who heavily dominate the ``left'' of Russia's
chaotic political spectrum.
	   Organizers say the new movement is ready to embrace all those
who champion basic political freedoms and free-market values. But
they immediately received a blow from Grigory Yavlinsky, the
nation's leading liberal politician, who refused to join.
	   Nemtsov, a former deputy premier, voiced hope that the coalition
could still cooperate with Yavlinsky's Yabloko party.
	   ``We don't have major differences. The only obstacle is the
political ambitions of certain leaders,'' Nemtsov told a news
conference.
	   The immediate goal of the movement is to serve as an umbrella
group for liberals in the next parliamentary election, set for next
December 1999. In the last parliamentary vote in 1995, the
Communists and other hard-liners swept the vote, easily defeating
the divided pro-reform groups.
	   The liberal alliance unites those who lost the last elections
and several newly emerged groups that don't have a broad following.
	   Aside from Yabloko, the only other pro-reform faction in
parliament, Our Home Is Russia, is also avoiding the new coalition.
	   The liberals will face an uphill battle against the Communists
and parties formed by moderate Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
regional governor Alexander Lebed _ both of whom have strong
nationwide followings and are expected to run for president.
	   The new group, meanwhile, is still struggling to name its leader
and is relying on opinion polls to do so, Nemtsov said.
	   According to recent polls, the popularity of the alliance's
leaders remains in single digits, marred by popular resentment with
botched post-Soviet free-market reforms.
	   Reformers' ratings further plummeted after Kiriyenko's
government sharply devalued the ruble and defaulted on debts in
August, igniting the worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse.
	   ``We realize how difficult a task we face, how tired and
disappointed the people are,'' the alliance said in a statement
released Thursday. ``We know quite well that reformers are blamed
for social division, wage debts ... official graft and, of course,
the autumn crisis.''
	   Despite that, the liberals are still counting on
``sober-thinking'' Russians who don't want to ``return to lines,
rationing, censorship and the Communist Party's control over
everything,'' the statement said.

Excerpts of Nobel Peace Prize laureates' speeches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Nobel-Peace &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from the speeches of David Trimble and John Hume after
receiving the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday in Oslo, Norway.
	   ___
	    &UR; TRIMBLE:
	   In one sense, the singling of one or two persons for a peace
prize must always seem something of an injustice. In Northern
Ireland, I could name scores of people, unionist and nationalist,
who deserve this prize as well.
	   ___
	   We have a few fanatics who dream of forcing the Ulster British
People into a Utopian Irish state, more ideologically Irish than
its own inhabitants want. We also have fanatics who dream of
permanently suppressing northern nationalists in a state more
supposedly British that its inhabitants actually want.
	   ___
	   We go on all the better if we walk rather than run. If we put
aside fantasy and accept the flawed nature of human enterprises.
Sometimes we will stumble, but this need not matter.
	   ___
	   There are two traditions in Northern Ireland. There are two main
religious denominations. But there is only one true moral
denomination and it wants peace.
	   ___
	    &UR; HUME:
	   We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,
particularly those of the North of Ireland who have lived and
suffered the reality of our conflict.
	   ___
	   There's not two people in this room who are the same. Difference
is the essence of humanity. Difference is an accident of birth, and
it should therefore never be a source of hatred or conflict. The
answer to difference is to respect it.
	   ___
	   I want to see our Ireland _ North and South _ the wounds of
violence healed. I want to see it play its rightful role in Europe
that will, for all Irish people, be a shared bond or patriotism and
new endeavor ... as an example to men and women everywhere of what
can be achieved by living for ideals, rather than fighting or dying
for them.
	   ____
	   Today, as I have said, our world also commemorates the adoption
50 years ago of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To me
there is a unique appropriateness, a sort of poetic fulfillment, in
the coincidence that my fellow laureate and I, representing a
community long divided by the forces of a terrible history, should
jointly be honored on this day. I humbly accept this honor on
behalf of a people who, after many years of strife made a
commitment to a better future in harmony together.

Italy, Spain, Romania await World Cup draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Italy, Spain and Romania will know on
Friday which of the rugby union powerhouses they have to face in
next year's World Cup.
	   All three gained places in the 20-nation finals next October and
November by finishing runners up in their qualifying groups.
	   Italy narrowly lost to England 23-15 but beat the Netherlands
67-7, Romania was beaten 53-35 by Ireland but edged Georgia 27-23
and Spain got through by beating Portugal 21-17 despite going down
85-3 to Scotland.
	   Theoretically, all three qualifiers could wind up meeting the
same group winners again. The World Cup organizing committee has
made no provision to keep them separated from the teams they faced
in the final qualifying round, hence the draw.
	   Much of the groupings are already known.
	   South Africa and Scotland are in Group A along with one of the
teams in Friday's draw and a nation from the repechage matches
which involve the Netherlands, Georgia, Portugal, Uruguay, South
Korea, Tonga and Morocco.
	   Group B has New Zealand, England, another team from Friday's
draw and a repechage winner.
	   Group C is already decided with France, Canada, Namibia and Fiji
and so is Group D, which has Wales, Argentina, Western Samoa and
Japan.

China piles up gymnastics, shooting, diving golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gymnastics, shooting, other late golds &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese piled up eight gold medals in
gymnastics, completed a sweep of the diving events and broke
another world weightlifting record at the Asian Games Thursday, and
still found reason to be dissatisfied.
	   And that's not to mention seven golds from shooting, two from
judo, two from swimming, one from fencing, one from cycling and one
more _ without only an Asian record _ from weightlifting.
	   While the Chinese scored up 25 golds for the day, diving team
leader Xue Li was looking ahead to the 2000 Olympics, and
concluding her athletes still had a lot of work to do.
	   ``Winning these golds means nothing to us, for most of other
Asian countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving and we
Chinese divers mainly compete against ourselves in the games,'' she
said. ``But in the world major competitions such as the Olympics or
the world championships, there will be a galaxy of high-echelon
divers. Even a small error can cost you the gold when you compete
against them.''
	   After four days of medal competition, China had a runaway lead
with 50 golds. Japan had 21, South Korea 20 and Thailand and Taiwan
seven each after host Thailand won four Thursday, almost matching
the five each by Japan and South Korea.
	   Thais especially celebrated at the gymnastics hall and swimming
pool.
	   Winning the rings event, Thailand's Amornthep Unchai was one of
only three non-Chinese gold medalists in gymnastics.
	   South Korea's Yeo Hong-chul beat China's Li Xiaopeng by 0.038
point for gold in the men's vault. China's Xing Aowei had to share
his gold on the pommel horse with North Korea's Pae Kil Su, an
Olympic and world champion in that event.
	   China's women gymnasts, meanwhile, came out of these games
undefeated, adding four individual apparatus golds to their
all-around and team titles. With the men's all-around, team and
four apparatus titles, the Chinese got gold in 12 of the 14
competition events.
	   Japan has been holding off China in the swimming pool, leading
10-8 in golds after each nation won two races Thursday.
	   But some of the races went almost unnoticed as Thailand's Torlap
Sethsothorn won the men's 400-meter freestyle, taking the lead at
250 meters and setting a games record as he beat Japan's Masato
Hirano 3 minutes, 53.61 seconds to 3:54.13.
	   Japan's world silver medalist Ayari Aoyama had her best time
under new regulations for the 100-meter butterfly and Shunsuke Ito
anchored the men's 4x100 freestyle team to a narrow win over China.
	   Thailand just missed another swimming gold when China's Zhu Yi
edged Ratapong Sirisanont by a finger tip in the 200 breaststroke.
	   China's Li Wei won the women's 100 breaststroke in an Asian
Games record of 1 minute, 8.95 seconds.
	   In weightlifting, China's women weightlifters extended their
world record-breaking streak to four consecutive days.
	   In the 63-kilogram division, Lei Li broke records for both the
snatch and total lift as she finished 2.5 kilograms ahead of
India's Malleswari Karnam.
	   Her 107.5 in the snatch broke the record of 103 set by
compatriot Xiong Meiyin in September, and her 232.5 total beat the
mark of 230 set by China's Diao Weiwei in April.
	   China's Zhan Xugang won in the men's 77-kilogram division, but
with only Asian records.
	   In diving, China scored its fourth consecutive 1-2 sweep of
these games. Rising 14-year-old star Li Na narrowly missed beating
Cai Yuyan on the women's 10-meter platform, and Zhou Yilin came
from behind on his last dive to beat compatriot Yu Zhuocheng by
less than four points on the 3-meter springboard.
	   Gymnastics officials have banned anyone under 16 from competing
at international meets but diving is open to anyone 14 or over.
	   ``I started at 10 years old and I don't think I'm too young, I
think this is the best age,'' said Li.
	   Japan managed to come out on top in its native sport of judo,
splitting the final day's four gold medals with China. That left
Japan with five gold medals from 14 events. China and South Korea
each had three, Mongolia two and North Korea one.
	   Competition in South Korea's martial art also ended Thursday,
with that nation taking three golds and Taiwan one.
	   The South Koreans finished with 11 of the 16 golds awarded at
these games. Taiwan finished with three, and Vietnam and Iran had
one each.
	   South Korea's Lee Ji-yean and Lee Mi-young won the women's
doubles bowling, 17 pins ahead of a Thai pair.
	   They had taken the gold and silver in singles Wednesday night,
but the bronze was still in doubt. South Korea's Cha Mi-jung had
the third best score, but Malaysia insisted its fourth-place
bowler, Yap Mun-Yee, should get the bronze under games rules
limiting medals to two competitors from one country in any event.
South Korea asked for clarification, and the medal awards ceremony
still has not been scheduled.
	   Taiwan's Chen Chao-yu and Wang Yu-jen won the men's doubles,
just eight pins ahead of a Thai pair.
	   Taiwan gained another gold in the eight-ball pool event of
billiards and snooker, where Chao Fong-pang defeated Tan Boon of
Singapore 13-6 in the final.
	   Japan and Thailand split the day's two golds in the three-day
equestrian event, with Japan's Ikko Murakami taking individual
honors and Thailand winning the team event.
	   In cycling, Iran's Ghader Mizbani Iranagh won the men's
50-kilometer time trial race, and China's Zhao Haijuan won the
women's 25-kilometer race.

Hand transplant recipient prepares to return to Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEAN PERILHON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Hand transplant recipient Clint Hallam
prepared to return to Australia, appearing Thursday with doctors
who said his recovery was on track since the September operation.
	   Smiling and showing his new hand with no stitches, Hallam
thanked those ``who helped me realize the dream I've had since
1989,'' when doctors amputated his hand after a saw accident.
	   In the Sept. 23 operation, doctors at Edouard Herriot Hospital
attached an unidentified donor's hand to the arm of the 48-year-old
New Zealand-born businessman in the first such operation in
decades.
	   With the help of new anti-rejection drugs, Hallam has been able
to keep his new arm longer than the last known hand transplant
patient in Ecuador in the 1960s, who kept his new hand only two
weeks.
	   Hallam was released from the hospital in mid-October and had
been since convalescing with a family and undergoing checkups and
therapy at the hospital once a week.
	   ``Re-education has permitted a satisfactory motor recovery,''
including the ability to move his fingers and redevelop a sense of
touch, the doctors' statement said Thursday.
	   During the news conference, however, reporters saw no movement
in Hallam's hand.
	   Doctors had one scare, in the eighth and ninth weeks after the
operation, when Hallam's new hand developed skin lesions. The
statement said an increase in locally applied anti-rejection drugs
solved the problem.
	   The recovery, the doctors said, was similar to that of a patient
who's own arm was reattached, making for an upbeat prognosis.
	   Hallam was to leave France for Australia ``in the coming days,''
the doctors' statement said. He was to be monitored by doctors
including Earl Owen, one of the co-leaders of the transplant team,
in Perth.
	   The transplant recipient may have to face a judge next month
after returning home.
	   News reports say Hallam is to appear before an Australian court
in January on seven fraud-related charges, in connection with a
marketing investment scam allegedly worth dlrs 620,000.
	   Hallam has said he was fighting some of the charges, but did not
provide details.
	   The businessman was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New
Zealand when he lost his hand in a sawing accident in prison.

Israeli warplanes repeatedly break sound barrier over Beirut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with more flights, Lebanon seeking U.N.
help in lead, grafs 12-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over a nervous Beirut for the second day Thursday, prompting
Lebanon to seek U.N. help in ending the ``sonic bombardment'' of
the Lebanese capital.
	   Beirut _ still recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _
is on edge because Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power
plants and other utilities to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings and set off the alarms of vehicles on
Thursday.
	   The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people who were frightened by
similar deafening bangs a day earlier.
	   The Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday,
including the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking
cover for fear the city was under attack.
	   Many here still remember Israel's 1982 invasion of Beirut, when
the city came under heavy air and naval attack.
	   The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least
175 people.
	   During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gun ships rocketed
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two
power stations in hills overlooking the capital.
	   Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon
on Thursday.
	   Asked Wednesday about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman
said: ``We do not divulge movements of the air force.'' The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under Israeli rules, would not
comment further.
	   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   On Thursday, Hoss called on a special multinational committee
that monitors a 1996 truce to discuss the flights because they are
``terrifying the civilian population, especially children,'' Beirut
Radio reported.
	   Hoss also said Lebanon would ask U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to intercede with Israel.
	   He briefed diplomats representing the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Britain, France,
China and Russia _ on Lebanon's position, the radio said.
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper described the Israeli action in a
front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.''
	   The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fight to drive
Israeli troops and their allied militiamen from southern Lebanon,
where the Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in
1985 to protect its northern settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for most of the attacks on the Israeli soldiers last
month.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The British pharmaceutical company Glaxo
Welcome Inc. has bought the Egyptian drug firm Amon for about dlrs
120 million, Amon's director said Thursday.
	   The deal was signed in Cairo on Tuesday by Glaxo Welcome's local
chairman, Najad Shaarawi, and Amon's chairman and managing
director, Sarwat Bassily.
	   Bassily said in a telephone interview that the price was 400
million pounds (dlrs 117.5 million).
	   ``They bought my share which is 90.5 percent, or about 360
million pounds, and the rest (of the money) is for the shareholders
who will give up their shares and take what they are worth in
money.''
	   Bassily said Amon had 4.1 percent of the Egyptian market for
human medicines. A quarter of the company's output is veterinary
products.
	   He said that Amon's exports were worth 200 million pounds (dlrs
59 million) in 1997 and would amount to about 240 million pounds
(dlrs 70.6 million) this year.

Gun-battle near Hungarian-Yugoslav border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A car-smuggling operation resulted in a
gun-battle between smugglers and border guards near the
Hungarian-Yugoslav border, a border guards spokesman said Thursday.
	   The incident, that ended without injuries, occurred at Tompa,
160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Budapest, late Wednesday,
border guards spokesman Maj. Zoltan Nemeth was quoted by state news
agency MTI as saying.
	   An off-duty border guard spotted a suspiciously moving convoj of
five cars, driving towards the border, and alerted his colleagues,
Nemeth said.
	   When the border guards tried to stop them, they started to shoot
at them.
	   Amidst gunfire the chase went on, and finally the smugglers left
three cars behind, and fled to Yugoslavia by only two.
	   The three cars, two Mercedes-Benz and one Cherokee, were all
stolen, with fake number plates, the investigation that followed
the incident established.
	   Criminals engaged in car smuggling have recently become
increasingly agressive, and seem to be ready to use guns more
often, Nemeth said.

Jewish settlers say they want to leave West Bank settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from settler leadership in 10th, final
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Most of the residents of a Jewish West Bank
settlement surrounded by Palestinian-ruled areas said Thursday they
want to leave and return to Israel because they are afraid.
	   The demand by residents of the Ganim settlement for government
compensation for making the move stirred debate over the future of
the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Ganim settlers were
showing ``momentary weakness.''
	   He accused the opposition Labor Party of trying to encourage
settlers to leave, in hopes of undermining his policy of not
dismantling any Jewish settlements, even in a permanent peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Labor legislator Hagai Merom denied the charges, saying the
Ganim settlers had turned to him for help.
	   Merom said he would initiate legislation to make government
compensation available to them and other settlers who wish to
leave. Homes in Israel are far more expensive than those in the
West Bank, and homes in a settlement being deserted would have
little resale value.
	   Nearly all the 50 families in Ganim signed a petition seeking
compensation, said Miriam Deutsch, one of the residents. ``We want
out of here because we are afraid,'' Deutsch said.
	   On Monday, a resident of the nearby Jewish settlement of Kadim
was wounded in a drive-by shooting, apparently by a Palestinian
militant. Ganim and Kadim became isolated enclaves, surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled areas, when Israel withdrew troops in the
northern West Bank as part of the Wye River agreement.
	   Residents of Ganim and Kadim readily admit that they came to the
West Bank because a house with a garden is much cheaper in the
settlements than in Israel's crowded cities.
	   Settler leader Yehuda Harel expressed disappointment with those
eager to leave but said the settler movement would find Israelis to
move into the West Bank. ``We'll take care of helping others to
move in so that the area won't be abandoned. I hope that some of
those people will be willing to move into Ganim,'' he said.
	   In other West Bank settlements, the residents are religious Jews
who settled for ideological reasons, believing that Israel should
annex the West Bank because it is the heartland of the biblical
Land of Israel. These settlers would be more likely to stay in
their homes even in the face of attacks by Palestinians.
	   During the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation, ``when it was really impossible to move, we were being
hit by rocks every day and everyone thought we would leave but our
numbers tripled. I hope the same thing will happen in the future,''
Harel said.

Chinese women set world records for fourth consecutive day

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women weightlifters extended
their world record-breaking streak to four consecutive days
Thursday as Lei Li won the 63-kilogram division at the Asian Games.
	   Lei broke records for both the snatch and total lift as she
finished 2.5 kilograms ahead of India's Malleswari Karnam.
	   Her 107.5 in the snatch broke the record of 103 set by
compatriot Xiong Meiyin in September, and her 232.5 total beat the
mark of 230 set by China's Diao Weiwei in April.
	   Karnam's total was 230, matching the old record, after she
lifted 2.5 kilograms less than Lei in the snatch. Taiwan's Chen
Jui-lien won the bronze with 222.5.
	   Lei and Karnam both failed in efforts to jerk 132.5 kilograms,
four above the world record. They tied at 125.
	   ``I was relieved to see Karnam failing to hoist 132.5 kilograms
because I knew that I would not be able to lift that much as I have
lost weight to compete in this category,'' Lei said through an
interpreter.
	   Bhatia Balbir Singh, an Indian Olympic Committee official, said,
``If Karnam could lift 132.5 kilograms, she would have been the
winner. But she had done her best. Take a look at her points, the
same as old world records. We are so happy for her and our
nation.''
	   Chinese women also set world records on the previous three days
of weightlifting. On Wednesday, a North Korean woman and South
Korean man joined in the record-breaking blitz.
	   China's Olympic champion Zhan Xugang added another gold to his
country's tally with victory in the 77-kilogram division.
	   His total of 355 was an Asian record and his snatch of 160 was
also over the previous mark. The snatch record went instead to
bronze medalist Sergey Filimonov of Kazakstan, who also lifted 160
but weighs less than Zhan.
	   Iran's Mohammad Barkhah was awarded silver with a snatch of 155
and lifted 197.5 kilograms in clean and jerk, two kilograms better
than Zhan, to set an Asian record.
	   Iranian fans celebrated by the stage, taking pictures with the
medalist. ``We are very happy today and this is a very good sign,''
a supporter said. ``We hope for gold tomorrow, just wait and see.''
	   Filimonov was five kilograms ahead of Barkhah after the snatch
but was unable to hold on for the silver, lifting just 190 in the
clean and jerk, 7.5 kilograms less than Barkhah.
	   Barkhah finished with 352.5 to 350 for Filimonov.
	   Zhan was not happy with his performance despite winning the
gold. He won the 70-kilogram class at the 1996 Olympics, where he
set a record with 357.5 kilograms.
	   ``I am not satisfied with myself that I did not do any better,''
Zhan said through an interpreter.
	   He reasoned that it might have been because he has not yet
recovered from an exhaustion from the recent world championship
weightlifting competition in Finland.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Investors in Amsterdam's premier
soccer team were kicking themselves Thursday after the squad lost a
key match and its shares plunged.
	   A humiliating defeat Wednesday evening by Portugal's FC Porto
caused publicly traded shares in the Ajax team to plummet on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, driving the stock to a new all-time low.
	   Ajax's 3-0 loss to Porto subsequently got it kicked out of the
Champions League, the competition of national soccer champions.
	   Ajax shares hit their lowest level ever during Thursday's
trading, bottoming out at 17.70 guilders (dlrs 9.46) _ down nearly
10 percent from Wednesday's close _ before regaining some turf to
close down 3 percent at 19.30 guilders (dlrs 10.32).
	   The company listed on the Amsterdam bourse in May at an issue
price of 25 guilders (dlrs 13.36).
	   The declining stock price has closely followed the team's
performance _ no surprise to either investors or fans.
	   Ajax, which won the national championship 27 times, is currently
in third place in the league and will drop to fifth if other teams
win their matches.
	   Its performance on the field has resulted in fans and newspapers
calling for the dismissal of Ajax' Danish coach, Morten Olsen.
Several players, among them stars like the brothers Ronald and
Frank de Boer, will leave the club by the end of this season.
	   This has caused concern about the club's performance in the
coming season, another reason why the stock fell Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge driving efforts to bring former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, on
Thursday completed the criminal indictment of the aging general who
is currently detained in Britain pending extradition proceedings.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for genocide, terrorism
and torture allegedly committed during his virulently
anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began with a bloody coup
against elected president Salvador Allende.
	   Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets and for his continued detention in Britain to prevent him
skipping the country.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic on a
warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite
Pinochet.
	   Legal experts expect it will be several months or even years
before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be extradited.
	   Garzon's indictment document includes reference to evidence
gathered from two years of Spanish judicial probes into government
human rights abuses in Chile, among this an official Chilean report
blaming Pinochet's regime for over 3,000 people murders and
disappearances.
	   The bulk of the 300-page document is taken up by a list of
thousands of alleged victims, including Spaniards, Argentines,
Paraguayans, Bolivians and Mexicans.
	   In the indictment, due to be passed onto the British authorities
via diplomatic channels, Garzon argues that the amnesty law
approved during Pinochet's regime rules out a trial of the former
dictator in his native Chile.
	   But according to the judge, the gravity of the charges require
Pinochet to face trial either in Britain, where he was arrested, or
in Spain, that is seeking his extradition.
	   The document also attempts to show that the thousands of
killings, disappearances, and cases of torture it specifies amount
to genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Genocide because they were motivated by the desire to eliminate
the social group made up of Pinochet's political opponents.
Terrorism because Pinochet's regime undermined the constitutional
and international order, and torture because there is evidence of
over 500,000 cases of degrading treatment in detention.

 &UR; Air travel throughout Germany disrupted by snow and ice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Heavy snow disrupted air travel
Thursday morning at the Frankfurt airport, continental Europe's
biggest, with international delays and a quarter of domestic and
European flights canceled.
	   The situation improved later Thursday as the snowfall eased, and
all three runways were operating normally by mid-afternoon, said
Horst Aussem, an airport duty officer.
	   He said the closure of one runway alone during the morning
caused the cancellation of 170 arrivals and departures at the busy
airport, the hub for Germany's national carrier Lufthansa.
	   Long international flights outside Europe were given priority
during the worst of the weather, although there were delays,
Lufthansa spokesman Michael Lamberty said.
	   Schedules will not return to normal until the weather improves,
and forecasts for more snow and icy rain in Frankfurt suggested the
situation could worsen ahead of the weekend, Lamberty said.
	   Frankfurt is Europe's biggest airport after London's Heathrow.
	   Stuttgart and Munich airports also were affected by unseasonably
early and heavy snow overnight throughout large areas of Germany.
	   Dozens of accidents and kilometers (miles) of traffic jams were
reported on autobahns, mainly in the southern states of Hesse and
Bavaria.
	   In the Bavarian city of Wolfratshausen, a car slid into an
oncoming bus, killing the auto driver.
	   On the A3 autobahn near Niedernhausen, a truck driver was
seriously injured when two trucks collided early Thursday, creating
a traffic jam that reached 15 kilometers (9 miles) before it broke
up hours later.

Dispute over border creates cofusions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Local media in Sarajevo
reported tensions between Croatian border police and NATO at a
disputed part of Bosnia's border to Croatia on Thursday, but NATO
officials described it as a misunderstanding.
	   Bosnia and Croatia are currently negotiating to define the
border near Martin Brod, a small town in Bosnia, some 220
kilometers (150 miles) west of Sarajevo.
	   Martin Brod was considered in Bosnia before the 1991-1995 war
but since the fighting ended in this area, Croatian authorities
moved the border deeper into Bosnian territory.
	   When they returned into the area after fighting stopped, many of
the residents of Martin Brod found their homes or land being on the
other side of the border, in Croatia, and Croatian border police
preventing them to go there.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, sent a
letter to both countries saying till their border commissions don't
resolve the problem among themselves, he considers the old pre-war
border valid.
	   ``The position of the High Representative (Westendorp) that
Martin Brod is in Bosnia-Herzegovina, till the border commissions
do not resolve this issue,'' said Alexandra Stiglmayer,
Westendorp's spokeswoman in Sarajevo.
	   On Thursday, Bosnian radio reported about some tensions between
NATO-led peace troops deployed in Bosnia and the Croatian border
police, but Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a spokesman for the troops in
Sarajevo dismissed that report.
	   Canadian soldiers, deployed as part of the multinational
peacekeeping force, patrol the area as they always do, he said, and
some of their armored vehicles that have guns mounted on the top
were parked in direction to look towards Croatia.
	   Someone there was offended by this and claimed NATO had pointed
it's weapons on Croatia, but Chamberlain denied this saying the
troops ``were not pointing the weapon anywhere, they parked the
vehicles to look in that direction,'' he said.
	   The border is under the responsibility of the police, he said
and ``we are providing general area security.''
	   But he confirmed that NATO has received indications from
Westendorp's office of where the border now should be. So far, he
said, in patrolling, the troops considered it to be at the banks of
the Una river but ``there is a sugesstion the border is across the
river,'' he said.
	   With provoking incidents and increasing their presence in the
disputed part of territory, the Croatian authorities are trying to
extend their presence there, Mehmed Zilic, the interior minister of
the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation told Bosnian radio.
	   He also said he expects his own forced to enter that piece of
land soon together with NATO troops.

Poland's army puts high price on post-Warsaw Pact property
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ From shoestrings to military bunkers,
Poland's army is shedding off obsolete property and equipment as
the former Warsaw Pact nation prepares to join NATO in April.
	   But an auction Wednesday of military property around the country
indicated that some of the prices are too high.
	   Only one of eight properties sold _ a complex including a
garage, warehouse, gas station and workshop buildings in the
central city of Pulawy that attracted slightly above the opening
price of 8 million zlotys (dlrs 2.3 million).
	   ``It was a disillusionment because there were many potential
bidders,'' said Andrzej Jamrozek, chairman of the Military Property
Agency set up last year to sell the unneeded items. ``We see now
that the military property market is not so unusual.''
	   The idea is simple. With Poland having to change its military
structure and equipment to become a member of the Western alliance,
it can raise money to help pay for the required changes by selling
off the surplus.
	   Most of the proceeds _ 70 percent _ go to the Defense Ministry
and the rest helps fund Jamrozek's agency.
	   Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, appearing appropriately
prudent, said the money has yet to be designated for any specific
purpose. It could pay for any urgent or unexpected expenses as the
military prepares for NATO membership, he said.
	   Changes in communications and air defense systems are among the
requirements for joining NATO.
	   Previous sales of items such as shoe strings, construction
equipment, mobile electricity generators and kitchens have raised 2
million zlotys (dlrs 580,000) for the ministry, and Jamrozek hopes
to get it another 18 million zlotys (dlrs 5.2 million) this month.
	   He needs a better outcome than Wednesday, when the single sale
fell far short of his goal of raising at least 67 million zlotys
(dlrs 19.4 million).
	   Wlodzimierz Wapinski, a potential bidder who owns a chemical
company in southern Poland, complained the prices were ``too
high.'' He wanted to pay 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 58,000) for a laundry
house in Gliwice, but the opening price was 440,000 zlotys (dlrs
127,000).
	   Jamrozek blamed independent appraisers for the pricing and said
another auction of the unsold properties in January would start
with lower prices.
	   The agency expects more success Thursday, when it auctions off a
34-hectare (84-acre) plot in Gluchow Gorny, 350 kilometers (210
miles) southwest of Warsaw.
	   It includes an air-conditioned nuclear shelter 15 meters (50
feet) underground that formerly was a Warsaw Pact secret war
headquarters and now could be a nice wine cellar, the agency notes.
The opening bid price is 800,000 zlotys (dlrs 231,000).
	   Agency spokesman Wieslaw Rozbicki said some property sells well,
such as barracks and other buildings close to Poland's western
border with Germany. NATO membership means a reduction in Polish
bases along the border with its new ally.
	   Military airports don't sell, he said, because they often cannot
be subdivided or developed for other uses.
	   He also said some Soviet MIG jet fighters from the 1960s have
been sold as collectors' items, with an American buying three at
the scrap price of 20,000 zlotys (dlrs 5,700) each.

Russia test-fires ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has successfully test-fired a multi-warhead
strategic missile as part of a program to extend the lifetime of
its aging ballistic weapons, officials said Thursday.
	   An RS-22 missile was launched from the northern Plesetsk launch
site and its 10 warheads hit the designated targets on the far
eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, the Strategic Missile Force said in a
statement, cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The launch completed this year's program to extend the lifetime
of Russia's aging missiles. The program envisages periodic launches
to check missile performance.
	   The tests have shown that the missiles remain fully
combat-ready, the statement said.
	   At Plesetsk on Tuesday, Russia successfully test-fired a new
Topol-M missile that's expected to serve as the heart of the
country's long-range missile forces in coming decades. An earlier
launch attempt had failed.
	   ``The introduction of the new Topol-M missile system and the
extension of the service life of strategic missiles on duty meet
the aims of army reform, fully conform with the government's policy
for strategic armaments and reliably guarantee the security of
Russia,'' Strategic Missile Force commander Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev
said, according to the Interfax.

Russia test-fires ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has successfully test-fired a multi-warhead
strategic missile as part of a program to extend the lifetime of
its aging ballistic weapons, officials said Thursday.
	   An RS-22 missile was launched from the northern Plesetsk launch
site and its 10 warheads hit the designated targets on the far
eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, the Strategic Missile Force said in a
statement, cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The launch completed this year's program to extend the lifetime
of Russia's aging missiles. The program envisages periodic launches
to check missile performance.
	   The tests have shown that the missiles remain fully
combat-ready, the statement said.
	   At Plesetsk on Tuesday, Russia successfully test-fired a new
Topol-M missile that's expected to serve as the heart of the
country's long-range missile forces in coming decades. An earlier
launch attempt had failed.
	   ``The introduction of the new Topol-M missile system and the
extension of the service life of strategic missiles on duty meet
the aims of army reform, fully conform with the government's policy
for strategic armaments and reliably guarantee the security of
Russia,'' Strategic Missile Force commander Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev
said, according to the Interfax.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Gay activists joined robed lawyers and
international church groups on Thursday to protest human rights
violations in Zimbabwe on the anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Police boycotted the celebrations, refusing to play in a brass
band as planned and to escort the march of 400 people across the
main streets of Zimbabwe's capital.
	   The police were protesting the presence of gay activists,
according to an advocate for homosexual rights in Zimbabwe, where
sexual relations between men are illegal.
	   ``The police said they could not be seen to be going against
state policies against homosexuality,'' said Keith Goddard, head of
the small activist group, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe.
	   It was the first public demonstration by the small gay group
since President Robert Mugabe banned a gay rights exhibit at an
international Harare book fair in 1996.
	   The marchers included robed lawyers campaigning for
constitutional reform and Christian church groups attending an
international assembly of the World council of Churches.
	   The assembly that began Dec. 3 has grappled with controversy
over the recognition of homosexuality by churches.
	   ``This is a breath of fresh air in Zimbabwe,'' said Dr. Louie
Crew of Rutgers University, Newark, a delegate of the U.S.
Episcopal Church. ``It shows no-one can be left out of the Ark, not
even gays and lesbians.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations celebrated its
achievements Thursday while lamenting that millions of people are
denied basic rights and fundamental freedoms.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the declaration is ``the
moral core of all our efforts to promote peace and alleviate
poverty'' _ and he urged the world ``to go further and try harder
to achieve all human rights for all.''
	   ``Every day, in every part of the world, men are being tortured
or silenced, women are being abused or are denied their full
equality, and children are held in bondage and are losing their
chance to live a life of their own. Their suffering does not belong
to them alone. It belongs to us,'' he said in a videotaped
statement.
	   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, has
refrained from calling the anniversary a celebration, despite
significant achievements over the past 50 years. including most
recently the landmark agreement to create a permanent international
criminal court, rulings from the war crimes tribunals for former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and the arrest of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``We do have a big challenge, which is implementation,'' she
said.
	   The General Assembly was holding a special daylong session
Thursday to mark the anniversary of the most comprehensive and
widely recognized international standard for the protection of
human rights. Reflecting its importance, 115 countries signed up to
speak.
	   At the end of the session, the assembly was expected to adopt a
resolution reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations in
fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small.''
	   At the start of the General Assembly session, the secretary
general awards Human Rights Prizes to those struggling against
injustice.
	   This year's winners were former U.S. President Jimmy Carter;
Sunila Abeyesekera, executive director of the Sri Lanka human
rights organization INFORM; Angelina Acheng Atyam, a founding
member of the Concerned Parents Association in Uganda; Jose
Gregori, head of the National Secretariat for Human Rights in
Brazil and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic, a human rights
activist.
	   Celebrities Michael Douglas, Wynton Marsalis, Luciano Pavarotti
and Vanessa Redgrave were expected to take part in commemorations.
	   Annan and three U.N. Messengers of Peace _ Pavarotti, Douglas
and Italian journalist Anna Cataldi _ were to present newly
designed ``children's passports'' with the text of the universal
declaration printed inside. UNESCO plans to distribute these
passports to children to promote human rights awareness.
	   International Action for Human Rights, a coalition of
organizations representing human rights issues, was sponsoring a
rally and vigil outside the United Nations featuring prominent
dissident figures including Harry Wu from China, Hafsat Abiola from
Nigeria and Durdak Nyima from Tibet.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a
party office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told a news conference on the
steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,''
said the British spokesman Thursday, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt building behind
black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are outside, but
a party emblem sits above the door, and a large portrait of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stands near the main entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   Neither the state-run radio nor the official agency carried any
news of Jassim's statement at the Baath Party office.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as teams of experts that have arrived in past weeks. All
together, they number a little less than 200.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge driving efforts to bring former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, on
Thursday completed the criminal indictment of the aging general who
is currently detained in Britain pending extradition proceedings.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for genocide, terrorism
and torture allegedly committed during his virulently
anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began with a bloody coup
against elected president Salvador Allende.
	   Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets and for his continued detention in Britain to prevent him
skipping the country.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic on a
warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite
Pinochet.
	   Legal experts expect it will be several months or even years
before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be extradited.
	   Garzon's indictment document includes reference to evidence
gathered from two years of Spanish judicial probes into government
human rights abuses in Chile, among this an official Chilean report
blaming Pinochet's regime for over 3,000 people murders and
disappearances.
	   The bulk of the 300-page document is taken up by a list of
thousands of alleged victims, including Spaniards, Argentines,
Paraguayans, Bolivians and Mexicans.
	   In the indictment, due to be passed onto the British authorities
via diplomatic channels, Garzon argues that the amnesty law
approved during Pinochet's regime rules out a trial of the former
dictator in his native Chile.
	   But according to the judge, the gravity of the charges require
Pinochet to face trial either in Britain, where he was arrested, or
in Spain, that is seeking his extradition.
	   The document also attempts to show that the thousands of
killings, disappearances, and cases of torture it specifies amount
to genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Genocide because they were motivated by the desire to eliminate
the social group made up of Pinochet's political opponents.
Terrorism because Pinochet's regime undermined the constitutional
and international order, and torture because there is evidence of
over 500,000 cases of degrading treatment in detention.
	   Straw's Wednesday ruling said the extradition process should be
allowed to go ahead on the basis that the Spanish charges were
equivalent to British crimes of attempted murder, conspiracy to
murder, murder, torture, conspiracy to torture, hostage taking and
conspiracy to take hostages.
	   He ruled out extradition on the basis of genocide charges.

Referee stops fight after North Korean hit hard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A referee stopped a quarterfinal boxing
bout at the Asian Games Thursday after North Korea's Pek Young-chul
suffered fierce hits to head by Mongolia's T. Uitumen.
	   Halfway in the first round, Uitumen found Pek unprotected and
showered several blows, forcing him to retreat. Pek struggled to
keep standing and at this stage the referee stopped the fight.
	   Earlier in the day's quarterfinal matches, India's Jitender
Kumar lost in a close fought bout, as Thais, South and North
Koreans, Chinese, Kazakistan and Uzbekistan boxers advanced to the
semifinals.
	   Kumar lost in points against Kazakstan's Vyacheslav Burba 7-8,
ending India's hope for a medal in the 75-kilogram category.
	   Kumar, using his longer reach, troubled Burba, but failed to
score in the final round.
	   Host Thailand had mixed fortunes with two of the three boxers
advancing to the next round. Among those who advanced to the
semifinals were three South Koreans, one North Korean, one Chinese,
two Uzbeks, and one Mongolian.

Angolan President strengthens control over ruling party

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
tightened his grip on his governing MPLA Party when three of his
most influential rivals failed to win reelection to the party
leadership Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Franca van Dunem, MPLA Secretary-General Lopo do
Nascimento and former prime minister Marcolino Moco were voted off
the party's central committee at its annual congress.
	   They were replaced by three of Dos Santos' closest supporters _
Public Administration Minister Pitra Neto, Lisbon ambassador Jose
Patricio, and presidential aide Jose Leitao.
	   Neto was widely expected to replace Van Dunem as prime minister
in the coming weeks, while Patricio was tipped to be appointed
foreign minister in an expected year-end reshuffle.
	   Dos Santos, who has kept an iron grip on the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, since he took over its
leadership in 1979, was reelected as party leader. He was the only
candidate.
	   In his closing speech to the five-day congress, Dos Santos did
not refer to fighting in the central highlands between the
government army and rebel group UNITA which reportedly broke out
last week.
	   The battles apparently marked an end to the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace pact between the two sides which fought
a two-decade civil war following the southwest African country's
1975 independence from Portugal.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's president assured the new
Slovak prime minister Thursday that he supports expanding the
European Union to include Slovakia.
	   President Thomas Klestil told Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda
that Austria was pleased with the change of government in Slovakia
after the September elections and that Vienna supports Slovakia's
eventual membership.
	   ``Slovakia today is a new, different country,'' Dzurinda said,
referring to departure of his authoritarian predecessor, Vladimir
Meciar. The Western Europeans had distanced themselves from
Meciar's administration.
	   Dzurinda's government took office in October after an opposition
coalition won control of parliament.
	   Dzurinda came to Vienna on the eve of the EU summit to press his
case for the EU to take a fresh look at Slovakia. The EU opened
membership negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Estonia and Slovenia.
	   Preliminary talks with nations judged less-ready: Lithuania,
Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is expected to join
them.
	   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, among others, want to
bring Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first
group. Germany and France oppose that.
	   Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Klestil, Dzurinda
said Slovakia is hoping for a ``clear positive signal'' from the
two-day summit, which opens here Friday.
	   But he said Slovakia would not be disappointed if the EU
announces no fixed date for the start of membership negotiations.

Tourists attacked, robbed in southwestern Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAROK, Kenya (AP) _ Two unidentified hooded men attacked and
robbed tourists travelling in six vans to the world famous Maasai
Mara Game Reserve in southwestern Kenya, police said Thursday.
	   The first attack on four vans occurred at Fiaya Pei, 125
kilometers (75 miles) southwest of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi,
said Narok District police commander Francis Gichina.
	   All tourists in the vans were Britons, Gichina said, adding no
injuries were reported.
	   The second attack on the same road on two other vans carrying
Britons, a Yugoslav and a Portuguese occurred near Ewaso Ngiro, a
hamlet about 185 kilometers (115 miles) southwest of Nairobi,
Gichina said.
	   He said police believe both attacks were carried out by the same
duo. One attacker carried a Kalashnikov assault rifle and the other
a sword.
	   The attacks were the seventh and eighth against tourists in and
around the reserve this year.
	   It was not immediately possible to determine how many tourists
were involved, but the vans normally carry an average of seven
passengers.
	   All the vans are operated by Private Safaris, a Nairobi-based
tour company. Officials of the company could not be reached for
comment.
	   Narok District Commissioner Francis Sigei said security will be
tightened in and around the Mara to stop banditry, which he
described as ``alarming.''
	   ``It is too early to comment, but some security measures must be
put in place against these bandits,'' Sigei said.
	   Tourism is Kenya's second largest foreign currency earner after
tea exports.

EU marks rights declaration anniversary reaffirming to stand by

persecuted

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - The European Union marked the 50th
anniversary of the international human rights declaration with
musical tributes from around the world and pledging to stand by
those persecuted for their beliefs, creed or color.
	   The EU reaffirmed ``its commitment to realize all human rights
for all (and will) continue to take up violations wherever they
occur,'' the EU said in a statement issued by Austria, which holds
the union's presidency.
	   In an ornate former imperial palace, Austria staged a two-hour
show of musical tributes from different cultures and times _ from
Mozart to Gypsy music, from folk singer Joan Baez to Warsaw Ghetto
songs of the Second World War _ to stress the importance of
artistic freedom and tolerance.
	   Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, whose country is a
candidate EU member, said European history showed the full power of
the drive for freedom and respect for basic human rights.
	   ``Without that liberating drive of the nations of Central
Europe, the conditions for a unification of the continent would
have taken longer to materialize,'' he said.
	   He said the same was true for Franco-German reconciliation after
the Second World War. ``Or take Spain, Portugal and Greece where
the triumph of democracy'' over dictatorship gave them EU
membership, he said.
	   Geremek urged EU governments to press ahead with the union's
enlargement _ an issue that will dominate the summit.
	   He said that was good for Europeans, East and West. ``The
development of the union ... should not be allowed to deliver a
union turning its back on other European states,'' he said.

Thursday to reverse an earlier ruling that the former dictator does
not have immunity.
	   The grounds for the appeal were not immediately disclosed.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw on Wednesday ruled that Spain could
seek Pinochet's extradition on charges including torture and
conspiracy to murder, related to human rights abuses in Chile after
Pinochet took power in a military coup in 1973.
	   Two weeks ago, five justices sitting as Britain's highest court
of appeal ruled in a 3-2 vote that Pinochet was not entitled to
claim immunity from prosecution. Pinochet's supporters have
complained that one of the judges, Lord Hoffmann, was director of a
charity associated with Amnesty International.
	   In Madrid, Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a criminal indictment
against Pincohet for genocide, terrorism and torture allegedly
committed during his rule between 1973 and 1990. Straw had ruled
that Pinochet could not be extradited on a charge of genocide, but
let the other charges stand.
	   Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets and for his continued detention in Britain.
	   Chile denounced Straw's decision as a violation of its
sovereignty, and recalled its ambassador from Britain.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote to his Chilean
counterpart Jose Miguel Insulza, saying he wanted ``to do
everything possible to maintain'' the relationship between the
longtime allies.
	   But members of Straw's Labor Party could not hide their glee at
his decision, breaking into applause Wednesday evening when the
home secretary entered the House of Commons chamber.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.
	   Straw said he rejected allegations of bias against Hoffmann, one
of the three justices who voted against Pinochet. Straw also said
he did not find the 83-year-old general ``unfit to stand trial.''
	   Pinochet, who was arrested in his hospital bed Oct. 16 while
recuperating from back surgery in London, must now appear Friday
before a London magistrate.
	   Human rights groups, who had been lobbying Straw as had the
Chilean government and others, hailed Wednesday's decision as a
landmark ruling, especially coming as it did on the eve of the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   But the opposition Conservative Party condemned Straw's refusal
to consider Chile's request to send Pinochet home. The Chilean
government maintains that the crisis threatens the fragile
democracy set up after Pinochet stepped down, and that crimes
committed in Chile should be prosecuted in Chile.
	   Before relinquishing power, however, Pinochet gave himself
widespread immunity.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil for a trade
conference, appealed for calm and called on Pinochet's relatives to
``not be overtaken by passion.''

	   ORANIENBURG, Germany (AP) _ About 10,000 residents of the north
German town of Oranienburg were evacuated Thursday while experts
defused two 1,000-kilo (2,400-pound) bombs from World War II.
	   The bombs were unearthed in the center of Oranienburg, a town
just north of Berlin with a population of 29,000.
	   Two main roads into the town and the central rail station were
closed for nine hours while the bombs were detonated. Residents
returned afterward.
	   More than 60 bombs have been found and removed over the last
seven years in Oranienburg, which was heavily bombed by the Allies
because of its weapons industries and role as a transportation
crossroads.

Italian premier visits Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema arrived Thursday in this former Yugoslav country which is
seeking to become a member of the European Union.
	   Slovenia opened membership negotiations with the 15-nation EU in
March and it hopes to join in 2001.
	   Italy now supports Slovenia's bid to join the union after
blocking the young country's association deal with EU for two years
because of a dispute over property rights for ethnic Italians who
fled the former Yugoslav republic after World War II.
	   The dispute, however, has not been settled yet and will likely
be discussed during D'Alema's meetings with his Slovene counterpart
Janez Drnovsek and President Milan Kucan.
	   Slovenia has agreed to compensate Italians for their abandoned
property _ estimated at hundreds of houses and fields _ seized by
then-Yugoslav authorities. Slovenia proclaimed independence from
Yugoslavia in 1991.
	   By a 1983 accord, Yugoslavia was obliged to pay for the
property. Slovenia pledged to fulfill the inherited obligation.
	   Its government began depositing the money to an account in
Luxembourg _ now amounting to dlrs 35 million _ but Italy has not
collected it, seeking further negotiations on the issue.
	   Some Italian officials want to review the agreement. They also
said the recent survey show a larger number of Italians than
initially envisaged should be compensated.
	   Slovenia rejects changes in the agreement, but it might be
willing to compromise in order to clear its way to the full EU
membership.
	   D'Alema is coming to Slovenia for the first time since he was
appointed premier in October.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The judge driving efforts to bring Augusto
Pinochet to Spain to face trial in the deaths of 3,000 political
dissidents during his 17-year rule on Thursday indicted the Chile's
former dictator who was detained in Britain.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet for genocide, terrorism
and torture allegedly committed during his virulently
anti-Communist 1973-1990 regime that began with a bloody coup
against elected president Salvador Allende. The judge also
requested a freeze on the former dictator's assets and for his
continued detention in Britain to keep him in the country.
	   The indictment came the day after British Home Secretary Jack
Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against the general could
continue.
	   The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on Oct. 16 while
recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic on a
warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite
Pinochet.
	   Legal experts expect it will be several months or even years
before it is finally decided whether Pinochet will be extradited.
	   Garzon's indictment refers to evidence gathered during two years
of Spanish judicial probes into government human rights abuses in
Chile. A Chilean government report blames Pinochet's security
forces for more than 3,000 murders and disappearances.
	   Taking up most of the 300-page document is a list of alleged
victims _ Chileans, Spaniards, Argentines, Paraguayans, Bolivians
and Mexicans.
	   In the indictment, Garzon argues that the amnesty law approved
during Pinochet's regime rules out a trial of the former dictator
in his native Chile.
	   But according to the judge, the gravity of the charges require
Pinochet to face trial either in Britain, where he was arrested, or
in Spain, which is seeking his extradition.
	   The indictment attempts to show that the thousands of killings,
disappearances, and rights abuses amount to genocide, terrorism and
torture.
	   Garzon is arguing that Pinochet's desire to eliminate a social
group _ his political opponents _ constituted genocide; that
Pinochet's regime engaged in torture by undermining the
constitutional and international order; and cites more than 500,000
cases of mistreatment in detention to back up torture charges.
	   Straw's Wednesday ruling said the extradition process should
proceed on the basis that the Spanish charges were equivalent to
British crimes of attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, murder,
torture, conspiracy to torture, hostage taking and conspiracy to
take hostages.
	   He ruled out extradition on the basis of genocide charges.

EU leaders unlikely to heal budget rift at 2-day summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders open a two-day
summit Friday at which they will recommit to letting a dozen
countries into the EU. But on the summit's eve, it appeared
unlikely they would agree on how to finance their biggest expansion
ever.
	   ``The time isn't right'' for a deal, Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima said in an interview in Thursday's edition of the Vienna
daily Der Standard.
	   As summit chairman, Klima said he will ask the European leaders
to inject urgency into the debate so a budget overhaul can be
agreed in March.
	   The EU opened membership negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary
talks with nations judged less-ready: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is expected to join them.
	   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, among others, want to
bring Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first group. Germany
and France oppose that.
	   The leaders will meet in an ominous setting: the cavernous
Redoutensaal of the Hofburg Palace where Europe's aristocratic
leaders of 1815 redrew their continent's map and danced away the
memories of Napoleon's wars.
	   In its 20th-century version of building a better Europe, the EU
refuses to set entry dates just to keep candidates working apace on
their economic and political reforms to meet EU membership
requirements.
	   Apart from a squabble over how to fund their admission, Turkey
continues to trouble the West Europeans.
	   They have ruled it out as an immediate candidate. Ankara has
declined an invitation to come here Saturday to meet with leaders
of the EU, Cyprus and the East European candidates. Not helping
matters has been Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, arrested in Rome Nov. 15, to Turkey.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and France insist the
EU's annual budget _ 86 billion European currency units (dlrs 100
billion) this year _ must not rise beyond inflation in the
2000-2006 period when the first newcomers would be entering.
	   They oppose a proposal to link spending to economic growth that
would raise the budget by 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) by
2006.
	   Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal _ which get special EU aid _
want the budget expanded so they don't lose out when even poorer
east European nations join.
	   Germany and other northerners say they already pay far more into
the EU than they get back. Germany's net payment is 22 billion
marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year.
	   On the eve of the summit, Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, pledged to fight for a limit on Germany's payments to
the EU. Germany assumes the EU presidency next month.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in a
speech to the German parliament in Bonn. ``We cannot and we do not
want to solve Europe's problems with a German checkbook.''
	   In a related dispute, Britain's refuses to give up a refund it
has been getting since 1984 to compensate for its net payments
though it is better off today.
	   The EU budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from
15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   Key to its reform is an agreement to make deep cuts in farm
spending. Subsidies for EU farmers still eat up half of the budget.
	   The EU leaders will also discuss plans to cut Europe's
stubbornly high unemployment, the launch of a single currency in
January and plans to ensure the 11 nations adopting the euro will
speak with a one voice in international finance meetings.

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ Courtney Walsh moved past
Ian Botham for third place on test cricket's all-time wicket list
Thursday, taking three and leading the West Indies' bowling attack
that left South Africa at 182 for three at lunch on the second day
of their second test.
	   Walsh's trio gave him 385, two more than the legendary English
all-rounder who retired in 1992.
	   The West Indies won the toss and elected to bowl on a very
helpful wicket, and their decision was vindicated with four wickets
before lunch.
	   Co-opener Hershelle Gibbs _ a mixed-race batsman called to the
side after government complaints that the team was all white _ was
dismissed after only 3.6 overs for two, squeezing a Walsh delivery
onto his own stumps.
	   Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis stabilized the innings with a
46-run second wicket, but struggled on a grassy pitch and a
four-pronged West Indies pace attack.
	   But Kirsten gave Walsh the wicket to move past Botham, caught
down the legside by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs for 29.
	   The West Indies then replaced legspinner Rawl Lewis with Mervyn
Dillon, who quickly removed Darryll Cullinan with a yorker,
reducing South Africa to 67 for three.
	   Jacques Kallis was the other to go before the first break,
gloving a short ball from Walsh in an ill-advised hook shot after
scoring a well-struck 30.
	   After lunch, it was Curtly Ambrose who struck, removing Jonty
Rhodes for 17.
	   Shaun Pollock perished similarly for 28 and South Africa was 138
for six. South Africa's captain Hansie Cronje was run out for 21 on
a rash single and Mark Boucher went for 17 to leave Pat Symcox and
Allan Donald at the crease.

Mobile phone maker expects layoffs and poor results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications company LM Ericsson
AB, suffering from global financial troubles, expects to layoff as
many as 10,000 employees next year, chief executive Sven-Christer
Nilsson said Thursday.
	   Ericsson, Sweden's largest company, employs about 100,000 people
in its worldwide operations. It is a leading maker of cellular
telephones and also makes switching equipment and has an
''Infocom'' division for business with datacom and Internet service
providers and with public networks.
	   The latter business area has been especially hard-hit by the
global financial troubles sparked by the Asian crisis, Nilsson said
in a meeting with analysts about expectations for the company's
full 1998 results, which are to be reported at the end of January.
	   According to a company statement, Nilsson expects both income
and profit to be below market expectations.
	   ''The financial crisis in certain markets and the related
general economic uncertainty ... is affecting us and emphasizes
with renewed strength the need for a strengthening of the ongoing
rationalization programs,'' Nilsson said in the statement.
	   ''All together, this will involve substantial reductions in the
number of employees,'' he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported that Nilsson said up to
10,000 jobs could be cut.
	   Company spokesman Lars Staalberg said the cuts would take place
at operations around the world, but that he did not have further
details.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Attorneys for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, seeking to
prevent his extradition to Spain, appealed to the House of Lords on
Thursday to reverse an earlier ruling that the former dictator does
not have immunity.
	   Attorneys also said they might also seek permission to contest
Wednesday's decision by Home Secretary Jack Straw to permit
extradition proceedings.
	   Grounds for the appeal were not immediately disclosed.
	   ``Having carefully considered all the recent developments, we
can confirm we have lodged a petition with the House of Lords that
the decision of their Lordships that Senator Pinochet does not have
sovereign immunity should not be allowed to stand,'' said Michael
Caplan of the law firm Kingsley Napley.
	   ``We are also considering applying for leave to apply for
judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision,'' Caplan added.
	   Straw ruled that Spain could seek Pinochet's extradition on
charges including torture and conspiracy to murder, related to
human rights abuses in Chile after Pinochet took power in a
military coup in 1973.

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serbs marched across
southwestern Kosovo to a rebel stronghold in a peaceful protest
Thursday against the disappearance of Serbs during the conflict in
the tense province.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' about half the estimated 400 marchers completed a
20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac to this KLA command post,
where their leader held cordial but unproductive talks with a
regional Albanian official.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including 40 from
the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have been
abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The rebels have released some of their hostages following
mediation by international officials. But they claim to be no

Report: more than 1.9 million killed in Sudanese civil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Civil war in Sudan has caused the deaths
of more than 1.9 million people since 1983, a humanitarian agency
said Thursday.
	   The Washington D.C.-based U.S. Committee For Refugees said the
15-year war over control of the southern and central part of the
largest nation in Africa has killed one of five southern Sudanese,
either by warfare, war-induced famine or direct government or rebel
policies.
	   In the first six months of 1998, more than 70,000 people died, a
report issued by the agency said.
	   About 80 percent of southern Sudan's estimated five million
people have been displaced at one time or another since 1983 by
fighting between rebels from the animist and Christian south and
forces loyal to the government of the Arab and Islamic north for
control over southern Sudan, it said.
	   ``Sudan's civil war has been characterized by an incremental
ferocity that has left untouched practically no one ... in southern
Sudan,'' the report said.
	   It said about 4 million people are internally displaced by the
war and another 350,000 are living as refugees in neighboring
countries.
	   The report was compiled by consultant Millard Burr, a former
director of logistics for the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Sudan.
	   Jeff Drumtra, a senior policy analyst with the humanitarian
agency said by telephone from Washington that Burr gathered the
data from dozens of documents and internal reports by many of the
40 aid agencies operating in Sudan.
	   ``In his studies, he goes systematically through the main
conflict areas in Sudan and cites battles, attacks, atrocities on
almost a monthly basis year after year,'' Drumtra said.
	   ``No one pretends that this is precise; it's a working
document,'' he said. ``Whether the death toll is 1.9 million or 1.8
or 2 million, no one will ever know. This is a fairly conservative
estimate to put the scale of this on the table.''
	   Referring to the deaths as the result of genocide, the report
said that while both the government and the rebels have committed
atrocities against the southern Sudanese population, the scale of
government-induced killings far surpassed those carried out by any
other perpetrator.
	   The report said the government has systematically blocked food
assistance to southern Sudanese populations, has attacked villages
and has driven large population groups to areas where they could
not survive.
	   ``These are not people killed in crossfire,'' said Drumtra.
``It's a very deliberate strategy on the part of the government of
Sudan to depopulate large parts of southern Sudan.''
	   He said that while the report cites the government as the key
killer in Sudan's war, even those who don't agree should recognize
the horror of its scope.
	   ``What is going on in Sudan, and what has been going for the
past 15 years is virtually unprecedented in terms of the
devastation to human lives, property and society in the south,'' he
said.
	   ``Even by the standards of Africa, even by the standards of war
... this loss of life and destruction of economy and society is far
beyond the line.''

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serbs marched across
southwestern Kosovo to a rebel stronghold in a peaceful protest
Thursday against the disappearance of Serbs during the conflict in
the tense province.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our
Relatives Back,'' about half the estimated 400 marchers completed a
20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac to this KLA command post,
where their leader held cordial but unproductive talks with a
regional Albanian official.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including 40 from
the mixed-ethnic town of Orahovac, and are believed to have been
abducted by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The rebels have released some of their hostages following
mediation by international officials. But they claim to be no
longer holding any, raising fears that many were killed.
	   A local official with ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army denied
knowledged of the Serb civilians' fate and said more than 1,500
Kosovo Albanians also are missing or believed kidnapped.
	   ``You have come to the wrong address,'' Lulzim Paqarizi,

Angolan President strengthens control over ruling party

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's president tightened his grip on
his governing MPLA Party when three of his most influential rivals
failed to win reelection to the party leadership Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Franca van Dunem, MPLA Secretary-General Lopo do
Nascimento and former prime minister Marcolino Moco were voted off
the party's central committee at its annual congress.
	   They were replaced by three of Jose Eduardo dos Santos' closest
supporters _ Public Administration Minister Pitra Neto, Lisbon
ambassador Jose Patricio, and presidential aide Jose Leitao.
	   Neto was widely expected to replace Van Dunem as prime minister
in the coming weeks, while Patricio was tipped to be appointed
foreign minister in an expected year-end reshuffle.
	   Dos Santos, who has kept an iron grip on the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, since he took over its
leadership in 1979, was reelected as party leader. He was the only
candidate.
	   In his closing speech to the five-day congress, Dos Santos did
not refer to fighting in the central highlands between the
government army and rebel group UNITA which reportedly broke out
last week.
	   The battles apparently marked an end to the U.N.-brokered 1994
peace pact between the two sides which fought a two-decade civil
war following the southwest African country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.

WBC super-middleweight contest in February

	   LONDON (AP) _ Richie Woodhall's second defense of the WBC
super-middleweight championship against Italy's former titlist
Vincenzo Nardiello will now be at Newcastle on Feb. 13 on a
triple-header of world title fights organized by Frank Warren.
	   The other two contests will have Joe Calzaghe of Wales defending
his WBO super-middleweight title against former WBC titlist Robin
Reid and Herbie Hide putting his WBO heavyweight crown on the line
against Orlin Norris from Texas.
	   Woodhall, who took the title from South Africa's Thulane ``Sugar
Boy'' Malinga in March, should have fought Nardiello two months ago
but the Italian pulled out with a calf injury.
	   Instead the British fighter struggled to a points victory over
fellow countryman Glenn Catley and was convinced he had lost the
fight.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a
party office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told a news conference on the
steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he
said Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt building behind
black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are outside, but
a party emblem sits above the door, and a large portrait of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stands near the main entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday
that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.''
	   But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot
accept to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission
continuing to flood us with lies and secondary details which do not
accomplish the awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.''
	   ``They want sanctions to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted
as saying by the Iraqi news agency.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as teams of experts that have arrived in past weeks. All
together, they number a little less than 200.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

 &UR; Senior U.S. admiral inaugurates NATO mission in Macedonia

<TEXT>
	   KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) - A senior U.S. admiral on Thursday
officially activated NATO's rapid reaction force to assist
international monitors in Kosovo, by opening the command center in
a Macedonian border town.
	   Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief of NATO's Allied
Forces Southern Europe, and senior Macedonian officials attended a
ceremony in Kumanovo military base as few hundred French troops and
Macedonian soldiers lined up for a salute.
	   Ellis said the NATO extraction force ``must be seen for what it
is _ the last option to be used only as emergency measure when the
lives of the unarmed verifiers are in jeopardy.''
	   ``The deployment of the extraction force is a peaceful
gesture,'' he said adding ``the measure of success of this mission
will be if this force departs in some future time never having been
used.''
	   NATO's French-led force in Macedonia, which borders the tense
Kosovo province where some 2,000 international monitors are being
deployed to observe a shaky truce, will also include troops from
Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands.
	   The mission of some 1,800 NATO troops is still being assembled.
The bulk of it will be formed by French soldiers, 700 of them,
while other countries would provide the remaining troops.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reluctantly agreed to
accept the verifiers from Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe after he signed a U.S.-sponsored cease-fire agreement on
Kosovo on Oct. 12.
	   Yugoslavia has bitterly opposed the deployment NATO quick
reaction troops in Macedonia, saying they jeopardized the country's
safety. Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic which
seceded without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 1991.
	   Ellis said the troops mission ``is in no way to relieve the
government of Yugoslavia of its primary responsibility for the
safety and security of the unarmed teams deployed in Kosovo.''
	   ``Our hope and our intent us that this forces do not remain
(here) a day longer than it is absolutely necessary,'' said Ellis.
``We hope for a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   The Kosovo cease-fire is generally holding, but sporadic clashes
between Yugoslav government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels
continue as international officials push for a diplomatic solution.
	   Upon his arrival in Macedonia earlier Thursday, Ellis said that
the French-led force ``is well-equipped, well-trained, well-led and
fully capable to carry out this mission.''
	   ``The forces are here only as a reaction to the concern of all
the NATO countries which contributed members ... to ensure the
safety of unarmed men and women'' verifiers in Kosovo, Ellis said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ People around the world marked the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations' human rights charter Thursday by
protesting continued abuses, while some governments announced new
initiatives aimed at better rights protection.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights. The U.N. General Assembly scheduled a
special session to mark the anniversary.
	   But throughout the world, there were reminders of the many still
denied basic rights.
	   Thousands of student protesters marched to the U.N. building in
Indonesia's capital, demanding greater democracy and the
prosecution of former President Suharto on corruption charges.
	   And even as Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised to protect
human rights in a letter marking the anniversary, police ransacked
the homes of several dissidents in a widening crackdown.
	   Gays and lesbians picketed the Zimbabwean consulate in Cape
Town, while in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, a police band
withdrew from celebrations and officers refused to escort a march
by 400 human rights activists that included homosexuals, organizers
said.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe and carry a penalty of a
fine or imprisonment.
	   The Dalai Lama said in Paris that conditions for his fellow
Tibetans were worsening under Chinese rule, while scores of Tibetan
exiles in India burned the Chinese flag in protest of Beijing's
rule.
	   Black-clad demonstrators outside the U.S. embassy in Athens hung
an effigy of the Statue of Liberty to protest America's continued
use of capital punishment.
	   ``Today should be a day of shame for many governments,'' said
Pierre Sane, Secretary General of Amnesty International, at the
first world summit of human rights defenders in Paris. ``Poverty
affects hundreds of millions, while the torture, disappearances,
unfair trials and unlawful killings continue.''
	   He said 117 governments torture their citizens, at least 55
unlawfully kill them, at least 87 jail political and religious
opponents, 31 nations make their people ``disappear'' and at least
40 execute their citizens.
	   Pope John Paul II urged nations to persevere in securing basic
freedoms for all.
	   ``Let's make sure that the Declaration of Human Rights does not
become just a monument to admire, or worse, a document for the
archives,'' the pontiff said in a message to the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   In London, Amnesty International laid 3,197 white flowers _ one
for each of the people officially recognized as either murdered or
abducted under former Chilean President Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
regime. Pinochet is being held in London pending extradition to
Spain on charges of torture and conspiracy to murder.
	   In Myanmar, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi attended a
U.N.-sponsored ceremony with other officials of her opposition
National League for Democracy. No government officials took part.
	   The junta has never honored the 1990 election in which her party
won 392 of the legislature's 485 seats, and has never allowed the
freely elected Parliament to meet. In the past several months, the
military rulers have arrested nearly a thousand of her party
members.
	   South Africa, which staged several events, announced that it
would ratify several U.N. human rights conventions concerning civil
and political rights to mark the anniversary.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a review of all
people jailed for politically related crimes, and the Mozambique
government announced it plans to introduce human rights as part of
the school curriculum in 2000.
	   The 40-member Council of Europe committee of ministers called on
states to abolish the death penalty and establish independent
national institutions for the protection of human rights.
	   ``Three themes are of particular concern to us today: to secure
the abolition of capital punishment, to guarantee media freedom,
and the effective enjoyment of women's human rights,'' said Daniel
Tarschys, secretary-General of the council's human rights assembly.

After a hard day of peacemaking, saxaphone _ and more _ await

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Impeachment impending? Peace taking a plunge?
If Bill gets the blues during his Mideast tour, he can drown them
in diet cola, soak them in Dead Sea salts _ even blow them away on
a courtesy sax.
	   President Clinton is arriving Saturday for a three-day tour of
Israel and the Palestinian areas, as the Wye River accord he
brokered is collapsing under increasing violence _ and his hotel
wants to make sure that his nights, at least, are soothing.
	   The entire Jerusalem Hilton, overlooking Jerusalem's walled old
city, will be given over to Clinton, his family, and an entourage
of 600 people.
	   Omer Lany, his butler-to-be, showed off the alto saxophone
Thursday, clasping its mother of pearl keys delicately with
white-gloved hands. According to the Hilton, it's the same make the
president uses at home, a Proi E.M. Winston.
	   Also included in the loan are mouthpieces and a shoulder strap _
just in case Clinton forgets his own.
	   He can play it on the balcony, while contemplating a skyline
dotted with church spires, mosque domes, and red tiled roofs
peeking over the Old City walls.
	   He might want to ignore a reminder of one of the more
controversial items on the peace agenda _ three cranes overlooking
a building site. Jews and Arabs are scrambling to populate the city
they both claim.
	   If he prefers a cozier approach, he can coat himself in
complementary beauty products made from the muds surrounding the
Dead Sea. The outsize free-standing bath is surrounded by white
roses _ Clinton, the hotel has learned, is allergic to most other
flowers. The shower has jacuzzi jets.
	   The mini-bar is stocked with his favorite beverage _ Diet Cola.
	   Whatever he does, he won't be able to avoid the city he's in.
The walls are lined with 19th-century etchings of Jerusalem; the
amphoras and oil lamps are Roman-era knock-offs.
	   For bedtime reading, he has a range to choose from: biographies
of former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan; histories of Israel and the Jews; picture books showcasing
the city built by Kings David and Herod _ both men who let their
lust alter the course of world history ...
	   Then again, he may prefer ``The Book of Jewish Humor.''

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with more quotes from Iraqi official,
color from site, background, CHANGES byline. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-6
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be let into a party
office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' said Latif Nsayyif Jassim,
a member of the party's leadership.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,''
said the British spokesman Thursday, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt two-story stucco
building behind black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near
the Tigris River. Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs
are outside, but a party emblem sits above the door, and a large
portrait of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein stands near the main
entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   Neither the state-run radio nor the official agency carried any
news of Jassim's statement at the Baath Party office.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   There are about 200 inspectors and other weapons experts in
Iraq.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to reenter the
contentious Baath Party site.

Chechen official shows video of hostage claiming to be spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with four grafs to ADD it was not known whether hostage
spoke under duress. Pickup 4th graf pvs, 'The severed...'
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ One of four foreigners beheaded by
kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he
and his fellow hostages were British spies.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about it,
including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government
had it.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard. One,
Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the
British secret service to monitor telephone conversations.
	   Their mission was to gather information to stop the spread of
Islamic extremism in the region, he said in Russian. It was not
known whether he was speaking under duress.
	   The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined up
Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen
security forces were still searching today for the bodies.
	   The government has said it was trying to rescue the men at the
time of their deaths, which have outraged Britain and Russia.
	   But its possession of the tape was likely to increase suspicions
of a government link in the frequent kidnappings in Chechnya since
it won de facto independence from Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most
hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in
captivity.
	   Kennedy and his three colleagues _ Darren Hickey and Rudolf
Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were employees
of Britain's Granger Telecom.
	   They were reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in
Chechnya when they were abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in
Grozny.
	   In the tape, Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to
monitor phone calls.
	   Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia
Andrew Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but
any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on
Chechen territory.''

EU defends new aircraft noise rules against U.S. criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and the United
States on Thursday exchanged a new round of accusations of
protectionnism, this time over the use of hush-kits which act as
mufflers for plane engines.
	   The EU executive Commission proposed last March to phase-out the
use of aircraft equipped with hush kits by April 1, 1999. It argued
that hush kit-equipped planes now fall below the standards of newer
planes built with noise compliance in mind.
	   ``This is an environmental issue,'' said Sarah Lambert,
spokeswoman for the EU's Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   Lambert rejected U.S. accusations saying the new EU rule
violates international legislation on aircraft noise pollution
levels.
	   ``The U.S. complaint is a thinly-veiled form of commercial
protectionnism masquerading as environmental concern,'' Lambert
said.
	   But David Traynham, an official for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the EU move is ``less an environmental issue.
It has a market protection impact.''
	   ``They are looking for a new standard for the EU region,
different from the international standards,'' he told a news
conference, after two days of negotiations with EU officials.
	   The Commission proposal has been approved by the 15 EU countries
and is now being examined by the European Parliament. The new rule
won't affect aircraft registered prior to April 1.
	   Traynham said the United States is concerned because a majority
of hush kit manufacturers are non-European and virtually all hush
kit installations are for non-European manufactured aircrafts.
	   He said U.S. hush kit-equipped airplanes meet international
rules limiting aircraft noise levels and that these planes will
continue to fly ``indefinitely'' in the United States after the
year 2000.
	   The EU and the United States regularly squabble over trade
issues ranging from steel to bananas, with each side repeatedly
accusing the other of protectionnism.

Clinton to light local Christmas tree, says Bethlehem mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will
light a Palestinian-grown Christmas tree over the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, in a visit Palestinian officials characterized
Thursday as a boost to their claims of statehood.
	   A multi-million dollar face lift of the biblical city in
preparation for millennium celebrations has been sped up for
Clinton's visit there on Tuesday.
	   Renovation of Manger Square, in front of the Church of the
Nativity, where Clinton and his family are to light the Christmas
tree, will be almost completed when the president arrives, promised
Bethlehem Mayor Hanna J. Nasser. The church was built in the fourth
century over the area where Jesus is believed to have been born.
	   The Palestinians had been offered a giant Christmas tree from
Norway but reluctantly turned down the gift citing problems with
Israel over a similar offer last year from Finland.
	   Then, Israeli authorities refused to release the tree from their
port, claiming the imported trees might be carrying diseases. The
Palestinians do not have a port of their own and so a more modest
home-grown Palestinian tree will be used instead this year.
	   ``We do not want to break heads with the Israelis,'' Nasser told
members of the Foreign Press Association on a visit to his office
Thursday opposite the Church of Nativity.
	   Clinton's visit to the West Bank and Gaza will give recognition
to Palestinian aspirations for statehood, said the urbane, goateed
mayor, in a three-piece tweed suit and a red tie.
	   Clinton, who has visited Christian sites in the Holy Land in the
past, ``dreams to visit, with his wife and daughter, the place
where Jesus Christ was born,'' Nasser said, adding that for
security reasons, he had still not been fully briefed on the
president's itinerary in his city.
	   Nasser said donor nations have pledged dlrs 100 million for the
Bethlehem facelift, but another dlrs 222 million is still needed to
complete the work. He criticized ``Christian countries that have
not contributed. If they do not contribute now, when are they going
to?''
	   Meanwhile, construction workers in bright yellow rain suits
mixed cement and paved over the football-field-sized square, which
used to be the city's downtown parking lot under a light downpour.
	   Christmas decorations have not been hung yet and Nasser
acknowledged that most of the construction of the square and repair
work for the main roads will not be completed by Dec. 25th. But he
hoped that that would not keep away the 40,000 people expected to
celebrate there this year.
	   ``People coming to Manger Square do not need a road,'' he said.
``They are pilgrims who come to see the place where Jesus was
born.''

Hungary to request exemption for foreigners' arable land
</HEADLINE>
acquisition

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary will request a 10-year delay
from the European Union before allowing foreigners to purchase
farmland, the Finance Minister said Thursday.
	   There have been other precedents for such request, and the EU
usually accepts them, Zsigmond Jarai told reporters after the
regular weekly cabinet meeting.
	   Foreign land ownership has been a very delicate topic in
Hungary's EU accession issue, as many politicians and experts would
see free purchase as the looting of the country.
	   Arable land is very cheap in Hungary as compared to EU
standards, and hopefully prices will catch up with them before the
exemption period expires, Jarai said.
	   At present only Hungarians are allowed to buy arable land in the
country. Hungarian corporations are also excluded, in an attempt to
filter out any possibility for foreigners to gain even minority
shares.
	   The junior partners of the ruling coalition, the agrarian-based
Smallholders Party are against any foreign ownership at any time.
	   Hungary is among the first group of former communist countries,
along with Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia to
become full-fledged members of the EU in a few years' time.

Donors release funds for Uganda, give conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ International donor countries said
Thursday they are releasing funds to support Uganda's three-year
development program after receiving assurances that the government
will fight corruption and limit its defense expenditure to planned
budget allocations.
	   A statement read to reporters said nearly dlrs 2.2 billion will
be committed to Uganda through 2001.
	   Dlrs 830 million of the amount will be budget support for the
1998-99 fiscal year, the statement said.
	   A World Bank-led consultative group of donor nations and
multi-lateral lending agencies has been holding discussions in
Kampala since Monday.
	   Representatives of donor countries and lending agencies have
expressed concern about corruption and defense spending, but
according to the document, they are satisfied with commitment
expressed to address the two issues.
	   ``We came to the meeting concerned about corruption, attended
the meetings concerned and are leaving the meeting concerned but
convinced that the government has a time-bound program to fight
corruption,'' said World Bank director for Uganda and Tanzania
James Adams, who chaired the meeting.
	   ``Donors have become increasingly concerned that in many sectors
and at different levels of society, corruption remained a serious
problem that required urgent action. A number of projects have been
undermined by lack of financial discipline and weak procurement
practices,'' the donors' statement said.
	   On Thursday, President Yoweri Museveni, embarrassed by rampant
cases of corruption in which millions of dollars in donor funds
have disappeared in the hands of implementing officials _
particularly in the agriculture sector _ said he would fight
corruption to the extent of hiring foreign experts, including
judges.
	   Donor representatives reportedly expressed concern that Uganda's
involvement in the conflict in neighboring Congo could push defense
spending over budgeted limits.
	   ``While recognizing the regional and internal security issues
that confront Uganda, donors saw a risk that pressures for higher
defense spending could undermine Uganda's record of micro-economic
stability or divert government resources from priority expenditures
in education, health, roads and agricultural extension,'' the
statement said.
	   Uganda, which has been receiving aid to support more than 50
percent of its annual budget, has had an average growth rate of 6.2
percent over the past several years.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States plans to boost aid to areas
of Central America hit by Hurricane Mitch to dlrs 370 million while
asking Congress to forgive most of the debt owed by Honduras and
Nicaragua, White House officials said Thursday.
	   President Bill Clinton meets with leaders of five Central
American countries on Friday following a conference on
post-hurricane reconstruction they were attending Thursday at the
Inter-American Development Bank.
	   The United States already has given dlrs 250 million in
emergency aid to the region, which officials said amounts to about
65 percent of total relief so far. The hurricane, which struck in
late October, killed more than 9,000 people in Central America.
	   In Bonn, Germany, the Paris Club of creditor nations agreed
earlier Thursday to grant Nicaragua and Honduras a moratorium on
repayment of government-to-government debt until 2001 because of
devastation caused by the hurricane.
	   White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
total debt relief to the two countries could exceed dlrs 1 billion.
The Paris Club, which includes the United States and 17 other rich
countries as well as Russia, called on the International Monetary
Fund to work out programs for increased debt relief for both
countries.
	   The U.S. debt relief package, if approved by Congress, would
write off up to 90 percent of Nicaragua's dlrs 94 million debt to
the U.S. government and 67 percent of the Honduras dlrs 144 million
debt, the officials said. The debt includes mostly agriculture,
military and trade loans.
	   El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica, whose leaders also were
in Washington seeking assistance, have not asked for debt relief.
	   Cllinton also will propose to Congress an additional U.S.
contribution to the Central American Emergency Trust Fund or a
similar fund to help countries meet their obligations to
multilateral banks, one official said.
	   Officials say U.S. and other assistance has gone to reopen
roads, support disease prevention, restore drinking water and
replant crops.
	   Overall, the plan is to ``cover the estimated shortfall in
financing during reconstruction period, provide assistance for the
reconstruction effort and to reduce the outstanding stock of debt
to help Nicaragua and Honduras achieve sustained growth over the
longer term,'' the official said.
	   Attending the meeting at the Inter-American Bank were Honduran
President Carlos Flores, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, El
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Costa Rican President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez and Guatemalan Vice President Luis Alberto
Flores.

Royal/Dutch Shell announces further restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Royal/Dutch Shell on Thursday unveiled management
changes designed to enable the company to react more quickly to
changing market conditions.
	   ``We have entered a new period where executive decisions have to
be made rapidly and business accountability must be absolutely
clear,'' Mark Moody Stuart, chairman of the committee of managing
directors said at a London business conference.
	   Speaking at a conference in London, Moody Stuart said that each
of Shell's five business areas will have its own chief executive
officer and executive committee.
	   Shell's gas and coal unit, its chemicals and renewables unit and
international services unit already have their own chief executive
officers.
	   The company is now introducing the structure to its other two
businesses, oil products division and the exploration and
production group.
	   Shell spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor said the change was part of an
``ongoing harmonizing of the structure,'' of the company which
began during 1995.
	   Analyst Richard Griffith from investment bank Robert Fleming and
Co. Ltd. said that the change was unconnected to either the falling
price of oil or mergers amongst energy companies.
	   Royal Dutch/Shell had been under-performing in recent years,
Griffith said, and the restructuring was an attempt to sharpen its
collegiate management structure.
	   ``There's been a been lot of window dressing so far,'' said
Griffith, describing Shell's management as ``the closest thing you
will get to a civil service.''
	   In September, Moody Stuart offered a gloomy assessment of the
oil business and announced the closure of four of Shell's big
European offices. In November, the company announced a 56 percent
fall in profits, sharper than analysts expected.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a videotape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   The hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in Russian that
he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the British
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission
was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in the region, he claimed in the video.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard in the
tape.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency reported that the tape indicated that
all four were spying for Britain, the United States, Germany and
Israel.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Kennedy said the group's purported mission of helping install a
telephone system for a private company was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
press conference in Grozny. He refused to answer any questions
about the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or
why the government had it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
questions about the possible role of Chechen officials, long
rumored to be linked to Chechnya's wave of kidnappings.
	   The father of one of the hostages insisted his son was not
spying.
	   ``Darren was not a spy,'' Eamon Hickey said in Surrey, England.
``These confessions have obviously been forced out of them after
they have been threatened.''
	   The company the men worked for, Britain's Granger Telecom, also
blasted the spy claim.
	   ``There is no truth whatsoever to the suggestion that the former
telecommunication engineers had any association with any U.K.
intelligence organizations,'' a company spokesman said in England.
	   British Ambassador to Russia Andrew Wood said, ``We don't
comment on these things in general but any reasonable analysis
would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory,'' according
to spokesman Mike Haddock.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ has caused outrage in Russia and Britain.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said.
	   The men were working with Chechnya's communications firm,
Chechen Telecom, to set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-96 war for independence from
Russia.
	   The Chechen Telecom office was attacked Wednesday by assailants
using grenade launchers. One guard was wounded. Several Chechen
Telecom employees have been kidnapped in recent days.
	   It was unclear whether there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   There have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya were
seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   Since the end of an independence war against Russia, Chechnya
has been running its own affairs. But it has been plagued by
criminal gangs and there are frequent kidnappings for ransom. Most
hostages have been released unharmed, though dozens remain in
captivity.

Second trial for murder of British tourist now set for Feb.4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Justice Daniel Aganyanya on Thursday
postponed to Feb. 4 the opening of the second trial for the murder
of British tourist Julie Ward a decade ago in a game reserve.
	   ``In view of elaborate submissions before me by both the
prosecution and the defense, I shall grant the prosecution
application to adjourn the hearing to Feb. 4,'' Aganyanya said at a
hearing.
	   The opening date had been set for Monday.
	   Salim Dhangi, a private attorney hire by the office of the
Attorney General to prosecute the case, said he needed time to
peruse the evidence documents and to call more suspects and arrange
for air tickets for witnesses out of the country.
	   Former game warden Simon Makallah has been charged with the
September 1988 murder.
	   Defense attorney Pravin Bowry objected to the postponement as
unfair and unjust.
	   Makallah, who appeared as a witness for the prosection in the
first trial, is represented by five attorneys.
	   On Nov. 4, Chief Justice Zachaeus Chesoni named Judge Aganyanya
to preside and set the date of the trial for Dec. 14, but the state
argued it did not have a prosecutor for the case.
	   Dhangi was appointed Wednesday.
	   Makallah has pleaded not guilty to charges that he murdered
Julie Ward in the Maasai Mara game reserve between Sept. 6 and 13,
1988.
	   Makallah, 49, is currently an assistant director at the Kenya
Wildlife Service. He was a game warden in the Maasai Mara at the
time of Ward's death.
	   The first trial ended in the acquittal of two park rangers
charged with the death.
	   In June 1992, Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police
for conducting a flawed investigation.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in the reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.

Syria opposes any attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Habibi-Assad, joint committee meetings, grafs 7-9

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria opposes attempts by the United
States and Britain to overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Syrian
Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam said Thursday.
	   Such moves would ``serve Israel's design to disintegrate the
Arab and Islamic world,'' Khaddam said after receiving his Iranian
counterpart, Hassan Habibi, at Damascus airport.
	   The United States has granted dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
opposition groups. British and American officials hosted meetings
in London last month of 16 Iraqi dissident groups in a bid to
promote cooperation among them.
	   ``This is a very dangerous issue ... No state in the world has
the right to interfere in the internal affairs of any other
country,'' Khaddam said.
	   Habibi, who is making a three-day visit to Syria, said the Iraqi
and Palestinian questions were of great concern to Iran and Syria:
``There should be coordination between the two countries over these
issues.''
	   The official Iranian news agency, IRMA, said the Iraqi and
Palestinian issues would be the focus of talks between Habibi and
Khaddam at the meeting of the Syrian-Iranian Supreme Committee.
	   The committee, which met Wednesday afternoon, convenes
biannually to promote cooperation in foreign affairs, trade and
technology.
	   Habibi, who is accompanied by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, met Syrian President Hafez Assad later Wednesday.
	   A Syrian presidential spokesman said they discussed regional
developments and Israel's activity in Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes repeatedly broke the sound barrier over Beirut
on Wednesday and Thursday in what Lebanese people regarded as a
warning about guerrilla attacks in south Lebanon. Guerrillas killed
seven Israeli troops last month in south Lebanon.
	   Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian
state during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 14-15 with Iraqi foreign minister saying
``few things'' to be solved. No pickup.
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-6
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a
party office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told a news conference on the
steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he
said Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt building behind
black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are outside, but
a party emblem sits above the door, and a large portrait of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stands near the main entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also said the site was
insignificant and downplayed the importance of the incident.
	   ``There are few things to be solved, but that's all,'' he said.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday
that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.''
	   But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot
accept to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission
continuing to flood us with lies and secondary details which do not
accomplish the awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.''
	   ``They want sanctions to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted
as saying by the Iraqi news agency.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as teams of experts that have arrived in past weeks. All
together, they number a little less than 200.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

Mobile phone maker expects layoffs and poor results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications company LM Ericsson
AB, suffering from global financial troubles, expects to layoff as
many as 10,000 employees next year, chief executive Sven-Christer
Nilsson said Thursday.
	   Ericsson, Sweden's largest company, employs about 100,000 people
in its worldwide operations. It is a leading maker of cellular
telephones and also makes switching equipment and has an
``Infocom'' division for business with datacom and Internet service
providers and with public networks.
	   The latter business area has been especially hard-hit by the
global financial troubles sparked by the Asian crisis, Nilsson said
in a meeting with analysts about expectations for the company's
full 1998 results, which are to be reported at the end of January.
	   According to a company statement, Nilsson expects both income
and profit to be below market expectations.
	   ``The financial crisis in certain markets and the related
general economic uncertainty ... is affecting us and emphasizes
with renewed strength the need for a strengthening of the ongoing
rationalization programs,'' Nilsson said in the statement.
	   ``Altogether, this will involve substantial reductions in the
number of employees,'' he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported that Nilsson said up to
10,000 jobs could be cut.
	   Company spokesman Lars Staalberg said the cuts would take place
at operations around the world, but that he did not have further
details.

Pressing leftist program, German lawmakers undo social cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Forging ahead with a left-leaning program,
lawmakers voted Thursday to overturn cuts in sick pay and
retirement benefits made by the previous government of Helmut Kohl.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who ousted Kohl in September
elections, had promised during his campaign to undo the trims in
Germany's costly social welfare state, calling them unfairly harsh.
	   The measures, which have wide backing among labor unions, passed
by a vote of 375-236 in the lower house of parliament. Upper house
approval is expected Dec. 18.
	   The new law bumps sick pay back up to 100 percent of an
employee's wages from 80 percent, a move experts say will benefit
about 6 million workers. It also wipes out an easing of strict
German firing rules that was intended to encourage hiring of
short-term workers.
	   Planned reductions in federally mandated retirement benefits are
to be suspended for the next two years.
	   ``This package repairs the social safety net in places where it
threatened to rip,'' said Social Democratic lawmaker Adolf
Ostertag.
	   Kohl's conservative government triggered huge demonstrations
when it pushed through the cuts in 1996, hoping to spur the economy
and lower stubbornly high unemployment largely by reducing business
costs.
	   The ruling Social Democratic-led coalition argued the measures
failed to make a significant dent in joblessness, currently just
above 10 percent.
	   Opposition lawmakers branded the new law an ``old left'' recipe
that masked the coalition's confusion about how to fight
unemployment.
	   ``You always knew what you don't want, but you can't say what
you do want,'' charged Irmgard Schwaetzer of the pro-business Free
Democrats. ``That's not enough for a government.''
	   The legislation also contains new rules to combat the use of
cheap foreign labor on German building sites. And it makes it
harder for people to claim they are self-employed, which allows
them to skirt Germany's hefty social security taxes.

Taiwan men, Korean women win doubles bowling golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Ji-yean won her
second gold medal in Asian Games bowling Thursday, teaming with Lee
Mi-young for the women's doubles title.
	   Taiwan's Wang Yujen and Cheng Chao-yu won the men's doubles by
just eight pins over Thailand's Prasert Panturat and Jeri
Knitchawat.
	   Lee Mi-young, the silver medalist behind Lee Ji-yean in the
previous day's singles, was the stronger partner in the doubles,
contributing a 229 average as the pair knocked down a total of
2,583 pins for six games. Lee Mi-young had 1,374 and Lee Ji-yean
1,209.
	   Thailand's Pani Butsaracum and Cathi Suparon took silver with
2,566, and Taiwan's Tseng Su-fen and Chou Miao-lin won bronze with
2,509.
	   ``I'm just too happy. There were many Koreans who came to
support us. They were a great help and I loved it,'' said Lee
Mi-young, who had a high game of 258 but a low of 190 in the last
game.
	   Thailand's women outscored the Koreans 430 to 393 in the last
game, but still came 17 pins short of the gold.
	   Taiwan's men pulled ahead with a 449-409 margin in the last game
against the Thais.
	   Wang, averaging 232, contributed 1,392 to their 2,660 total,
while Cheng had 1,268. The Thais took silver with 2,652, and South
Korea's Kim Myung-jo and Park Young-su won bronze with 2,633.
	   ``I was never once doubtful,'' said Cheng. ``The day after
tomorrow when I came back, I will win another gold medal.''
	   Both trios and team competition is scheduled Saturday.

Police unveil plan for Clinton security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Thousands of policemen will be deployed across
Israel to secure U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit to
the region, the police said Thursday.
	   National Police Commissioner Yehuda Vilk said that security
efforts will be coordinated between the Israeli police, the secret
service, the army, and U.S. security officials.
	   Clinton arrives Saturday for a visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas as the Wye River accord he brokered in October is
collapsing under increasing violence.
	   In addition to protecting the president, the 10,000 police on
call will also crack down on street violence, Vilk said.
	   Police plan preventive arrests in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, and a heavy security presence will be in force in the
area starting Friday.
	   ``We believe some Palestinian elements will make an effort to
cause disturbances but the Israeli police, especially in Jerusalem,
will work to prevent them,'' Vilk told reporters.
	   Five hundred policemen will be posted at the Jerusalem Hilton,
where Clinton's family and an entourage of 600 staff will be based
during the visit.
	   Residents of the area have been told not to park their cars near
their home throughout the visit.

St. Lucia governor general suggests legal aid program

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ St. Lucia's governor general on
Thursday urged the country to establish a program to provide free
legal assistance to citizens.
	   ``It would be a tangible and enduring way of demonstrating our
commitment to the promotion and recognition of the human rights to
which our own citizens are entitled,'' Gov. General Pearlette
Louisy said during an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights.
	   She said the service would guarantee that residents can defend
their civil rights in court.
	   Louisy also praised the Caribbean Community, of which St. Lucia
is a member, for a 1997 human rights charter that calls for free
expression, free elections, respect for civil rights, free exercise
of religion and transparency in government.
	   She suggested that both the U.N. declaration and the Caribbean
Community document be taught in schools so that children would
``lead us and the whole of humanity to the universal peace to which
we all aspire.''

Chirac, Annan celebrate 50th anniversary of rights declaration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chirac, Annan, Suu Kyi, Havel quotes;
Albright cancellation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac, surrounded by
human rights activists and dignitaries, feted the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Thursday in a ceremony
that linked Paris by satellite with the United Nations.
	   It was in France that the human rights charter was signed Dec.
10, 1948.
	   ``In France and outside our borders, we need the vigilance and
courage of human rights activists more than ever,'' Chirac said,
speaking in a linkup with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Annan called the declaration ``the moral core of all our efforts
to promote peace and alleviate poverty.''
	   A host of human rights figures _ including South African
President Nelson Mandela _ took part in the Paris ceremony.
	   One key participant was missing, however. U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, visiting Paris Thursday, had planned to
attend but canceled due to pressing business back home, according
to the U.S. Embassy press office.
	   A video message came from Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar.
	   ``As H.G. Wells said, the only real nationality is that of
humanity,'' the human rights leader said. ``There cannot be peace
and happiness in a society where citizens live in uncertainty,
precariousness and fear.''
	   Czech President Vacav Havel, also speaking by video, said the
world had made ``real progress'' in the last 50 years in the field
of human rights.
	   Later, Amnesty International was sponsoring a blockbuster
concert with Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Alanis Morisette,
Tracy Chapman and Radiohead, among others.
	   Earlier Thursday, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin handed out
human rights prizes to, in his words, ``support a raising of
consciences and to encourage collective action.''
	   Among the winners was Ibrahim Rugova, president of the Kosovo
Democratic League, for his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis in Serb-ruled Kosovo province.
	   The Dalai Lama, in Paris for the anniversary, issued a statement
saying some governments _ a clear reference to China _ treat the
principles in the rights declaration as ``products of Western
civilization, that don't apply to Asia or other parts of the Third
World.
	   ``I don't share that point of view and am certain that the
majority of people don't either,'' said the Tibetan spiritual
leader. The principles ``are a kind of natural law,'' he said.

	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ Courtney Walsh passed Ian
Botham for third place on test cricket's all-time wicket list, but
a late rally spoiled the West Indies chances of bowling out South
Africa on Thursday, the first day of their second test.
	   Pat Symcox and Allan Donald remained at the wicket with an
unbeaten ninth-wicket stand of 48 that rescued South Africa from
175 for eight just before tea to 223, when fading light forced
stumps to be drawn at St. George's Park.
	   Earlier, Walsh moved past Botham by taking three wickets before
lunch. Walsh's trio gave him 385 for his career, two more than the
legendary English all-rounder who retired in 1992.
	   The West Indies won the toss and elected to bowl on a very
helpful wicket, and their decision was vindicated with four wickets
before lunch.
	   Co-opener Hershelle Gibbs _ a mixed-race batsman called to the
side after government complaints that the team was all white _ was
dismissed after only 3.6 overs for two, squeezing a Walsh delivery
onto his own stumps.
	   Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis stabilized the innings with a
46-run second wicket, but struggled on a grassy pitch and a
four-pronged West Indies pace attack.
	   But Kirsten gave Walsh the wicket to move past Botham, caught
down the legside by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs for 29.
	   The West Indies then replaced legspinner Rawl Lewis with Mervyn
Dillon, who quickly removed Darryll Cullinan with a yorker,
reducing South Africa to 67 for three.
	   Jacques Kallis was the other to go before the first break,
gloving a short ball from Walsh in an ill-advised hook shot after
scoring a well-struck 30.
	   After lunch, it was Curtly Ambrose who struck, removing Jonty
Rhodes for 17.
	   Shaun Pollock perished similarly for 28 and South Africa was 138
for six. South Africa's captain Hansie Cronje was run out for 21 on
a rash single and Mark Boucher went for 17 to seemingly put South
Africa in peril.
	   But Symcox (30 not out), with able support by Donald (27 not
out), reversed the trend.
	   Donald, a fast bowler, was just six runs short of his best test
innings, achieved in the 1995-1996 season against Zimbabwe in
Harare.

Russian Cabinet presents next year's tight budget

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government approved a draft 1999 budget
Thursday that hinges Russia's economy on two major concessions by
foreign creditors that none are yet willing to grant _ more loans
and the restructuring of nearly half the country's mammoth foreign
debt.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters.
	   The draft calls for dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans, and
provides for repaying only dlrs 9.5 billion in foreign debts next
year, Zadornov said.
	   Russia, facing its worst economic downturn since the 1991 Soviet
collapse, owes dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt payments in 1999,
and the budget draft means the government will press for
restructuring dlrs 8 billion of that.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors on
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The government plans to work unspecified minor suggestions into
the draft and submit it the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, on Friday night, Zadornov said.
	   Primakov said he hopes for a quick approval of the trimmed-down
budget because his Cabinet enjoys broad support in the Duma.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that is very austere,'' Primakov
said at a Cabinet meeting where leaders hashed out the draft.
``And, the essential thing is that it is honest. We didn't include
spending that can't be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov also said the expected revenues would cover all of
Russia's domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia would need
to restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet
Union. The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what
Russia owes next year.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on rescheduling with the Paris Club of creditor
nations. But the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The prospects for Russia's bid for more foreign loans are
equally hazy.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since Russia defaulted
on some of its debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and has specifically warned the Cabinet
against factoring in foreign credits which are yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that it would simply print money
_ which would send inflation soaring _ if it doesn't get foreign
aid.
	   The government already intends to print about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) next year, according to the draft budget, to
cover part of the 101 billion ruble (dlrs 5 billion) deficit.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues of 475 billion rubles (dlrs
29 billion at Thursday's exchange rate), and spending of 575
billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion), officials said.
	   Many private economists predict the deficit will be even larger
because the government's estimates of the average ruble rate of
21.5 to the dollar and inflation of 30 percent next year may be
unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.
	   Russia also appears to be taking a gamble on next year's
revenues. The Cabinet plans to overhaul the tax system with the
hope of stimulating production _ but even some government
officials, including Zadornov, warn that the plan may not pay off.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For most of those who received Nbel
Prizes in the Swedish capital on Thursday, science is a way of
improving the human condition, but for one it's a means of
describing it.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago of Portugal often uses eerie,
almost-credible scientific events as metaphors for addressing
philosophical issues. In his most-recent novel ``Blindness,''
people suddenly and inexplicably go blind in an allegory of social
disintegration.
	   '''The Stone Raft'' from 1986 posits the Iberian Peninsula
snapping off from the rest of the European continent and floats
into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical search for identity away
from the standardizing nature of the European Union.
	   Saramago and winners of the physics, chemistry, medicine and
economics prizes were presented their prizes by King Carl XVI
Gustaf in a solemn afternoon ceremony at Stockholm's imposing
Konserthuset hall.
	   Then they headed for the castle-like city hall for a banquet
with more than 1,200 people.
	   The prizes are given every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor
of dynamite who established the prizes in his will.
	   It's probably not a day too soon if any of the laureates are
interested more in the prize's money than in its prestige. The
Swedish krona has consistently fallen since the prizes were
announced in October; the 7.6-million-kronor prizes were worth
about dlrs 978,000 two months ago, but at Thursday's exchange rate
the value had dropped to dlrs 943,000.
	   The medicine prize is shared by Americans Robert Furchgott of
the State University of New York, Louis Ignarro of the University
of California-Los Angeles and Ferid Murad of the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston, for their work in discovering how
nitric oxide does its life-saving work of dilating blood vessels.
	   Nitric oxide also plays a role in the working of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra and the laureates say it is likely to
have wide new applications in counteracting asthma and coronary
disease.
	   Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar, won the economics prize for his
work in examining the causes behind famines and other catastrophes.
He is a specialist in welfare economics, the discipline that tries
to establish quantitative ways of assessing quality of life.
	   The physics prize went to Robert Laughlin of Stanford
University, Horst Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel Tsui of
Princeton University for discovering how electrons can change
behavior and act more like fluid than particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions. Kohn did not come to Stockholm because of an illness in
his family; he plans to come for the 1999 ceremony, according to
the Nobel Foundation.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, also received their prizes on Thursday, in
ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The attempt to divert an Egyptian airliner
to Libya was to break the U.N. air embargo, making it the first
Arab plane to do so, passengers said Thursday.
	   They said Wednesday's failed hijacking was orchestrated by the
Libyan government, which chartered the plane that took off from
San`a, the Yemeni capital.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo for
refueling and then back to Yemen.
	   ``The plan was to break the air embargo so that it would be the
first Arab airliner to break the sanctions,'' one of the passengers
told The Associated Press in Yemen. He spoke on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Yemeni authorities did not apprehend the two masked men who
tried to divert the plane to Libya after it landed in Yemen
Thursday. The two men _ a Libyan diplomat and a Yemeni _ were
upported by the rest of the 96 passengers who tried to divert the
plane to Libya.
	   Egyptian officials had earlier said there were 150 passengers on
board.
	   Five of the passengers were Libyan diplomats working at the
Libyan Embassy in Yemen, including the masked man, officials in
San`a said Thursday. The rest were Yemeni members of Parliament and
trade union activists.
	   No reason was give as to why the two men were not apprehended in
Yemen, or in Tunisia and Cairo.
	   Tunisia's Civil Aviation Department denied in a statement
Thursday that there had been an attempt to hijack the plane and
said the passengers refused to get off the plane when it landed in
Jerba.
	   The passengers argued that their ``charter contract was to
Tripoli,'' Libya, the statement said.
	   ``There is... no question of a hijacking,'' it added.
	   The Egyptian pilot, Mounes Luka, also denied the two men had
tried to hijack the plane and said they were only trying to
persuade him to fly to Libya instead of Tunisia.
	   ``I told them it is impossible because Libya is under air
embargo,'' Luka told reporters at Cairo Airport late Wednesday
after the plane landed briefly for refueling.
	   None of the passengers or crew were reported injured.
	   Egypt's Al-Akhbar newspaper quoted the owner of the Egyptian
company that chartered the plane as saying that one of the
passengers was carrying a shotgun when he boarded the plane in
Sana' Wednesday.
	   The paper did not identify him or give any other details.
	   The United Nations imposed sanction on Libya in 1992 to force it
to turn over two suspects wanted for the bombing of an Pan Am jet
over Scotland in 1988.

German court orders former East German justice officials retried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Four former communist East German judges
and prosecutors must be retried on charges of perverting justice in
going after a prominent dissident in the 1970s, a court ruled
Thursday.
	   The Federal Court of Justice ruled the four acquittals in
September 1997 by a state court in eastern Germany were legally
faulty.
	   The two former judges and two former prosecutors were tried for
their roles in prosecuting anti-communist dissident Robert
Havemann. He was sentenced to house arrest and a heavy fine in
1976.
	   In its acquittal, the lower court said it was not proven that
the officials were acting on instructions of the East German secret
police, instead of in accordance with East German law.
	   The federal court rejected that argument. Judge Heinrich
Laufhuette said the verdicts against Havemann were scripted by
secret police, political leaders and justice officials.
	   Havemann, who died in 1982, was considered an enemy of the state
by East German authorities for his criticisms of the regime, which
were smuggled out and published in West Germany.
	   The initial trial had seven defendants, but prosecutors decided
not to appeal the acquittals of three other judges due to
insufficient evidence.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In the first U.N. case to focus
exclusively on rape as a war crime, a Bosnian Croat paramilitary
chief was convicted Thursday of letting a subordinate sexually
assault a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced Anto Furundzija, 29,
to 10 years in prison, ruling that his failure to stop the rape
made him a ``fellow perpetrator'' guilty of two war crimes counts.
	   ``In such situations, the fellow perpetrator plays a role every
bit as grave as the person who actually inflicts the pain and
suffering,'' the judges wrote in a 100-page ruling.
	   Furundzija's attorney said he would appeal the conviction and
sentence.
	   ``Our position is one of true shock,'' said Luka Misetic. ``We
firmly, unequivocally state that our client is not guilty.''
	   Furundzija appeared unmoved when he heard the verdicts and
sentence. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   The case against Furundzija was based almost exclusively on the
closed-door testimony of the alleged victim, identified by the
tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Defense attorneys tried to have her testimony thrown out,
claiming it was unreliable because she was suffering post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). They also accused prosecutors of trying to
conceal her psychological problems.
	   In light of the claims, the three-judge panel led by presiding
Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia had taken the unprecedented step of
reopening the trial so the victim could be cross-examined again and
to hear evidence about her mental state.
	   But on Thursday, the judges rejected the argument that her
testimony was flawed.
	   ``The trial chamber ... accepts Witness A's testimony that she
has sufficiently recollected the material aspects of the relevant
events,'' Mumba said. She added that ``expert evidence demonstrates
that even when a person is suffering from PTSD, she or he may still
be a reliable witness.''
	   If Furundzija's appeal fails, he will be jailed in either
Norway, Finland or Italy.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The Jokers''
which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked Muslim villages in
central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija.
	   The judges deplored Furundzija's role in her ordeal.
	   ``A woman was brought into detention, kept naked and helpless
before her interrogators and treated with the utmost cruelty and
barbarity,'' their ruling said.
	   ``The accused, far from preventing these crimes, played a
prominent part in their commission.''
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in the central Bosnian
Lasva Valley. Eight others are on trial in three separate cases for
their alleged involvement in the purge.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal has
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.

Italy rejects ambitious floodgate project to safeguard Venice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's government said no Thursday to an ambitious
barrier project to shield Venice from the rising Adriatic, calling
it too drastic for Venice's fragile lagoon.
	   Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said the rejection by an
environmental impact committee was the last word on the floodgate
project, ending more than 10 years and roughly dlrs 150 million of
planning and studies.
	   The project would have had ``irreversible and very considerable
effects on the lagoon,'' said Maria Rosa Vittadini, head of the
government-appointed environmental panel.
	   Backers had called the project the only real option to safeguard
sinking Venice from high water, which floods majestic St. Mark's
Square and other low-lying areas of the canal city dozens of times
a year.
	   Flooding of 80 cms (32 inches) or more hit Venice a record 101
times in 1996, threatening historic treasures and the tourism
industry that depends upon them.
	   The project would have placed 30-meter-high (98 feet) barriers
on the seabed at three entrances to the lagoon. The top of the
barriers would jut 2 meters (6 feet) above the waves during
flooding, shielding the city.
	   Vittadini said the barriers might have gone up many more times a
year than supporters envisioned, risking making the lagoon a turbid
guagmire. The project also underestimated the extent to which water
rising from below ground was responsible for the flooding,
something that was best dealt with by raising Venice's pavements,
she said.
	   Supporters of the gates said anything but the mobile barriers
would be a stopgap measure, inadequate to protect the city as the
Adriatic rises ever higher, pushed on by global warming.
	   Many of the city's tourist-dependent merchants had backed the
4.4 trillion lire (dlrs 2.6 billion) project. City leaders had been
dubious at best, dreading the potential for bungling and
corruption.
	   With Thursday's sinking of the floodgate project, Italy's next
step should be restoring the ecological equilibrium of the lagoon _
barring heavy shipping, dismantling artificial fish farms, and
other measures, said John Millerchip, a leader of a Venice-based
umbrella organization of international groups for the city's
preservation.
	   Only then, he said, can Venice's protectors get a clear idea of
the best way to deal with high water, said Millerchip, counting
himself among those unconvinced about the flood barriers.
	   ``They're not for Venice sinking,'' he said. ``They're for
action, but they're for doing the right thing _ not the wrong
thing.''

Six-time all-star announces retirement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dennis Eckersley, third on U.S. Major League
Baseball's career saves list, retired Thursday after 24 years.
	   ``It's hard to walk away,'' Eckersley said, as he fought back
tears. ``It's been a major part of my life since I was 8 years
old.''
	   Eckersley, 44, said he decided to retire after the Boston Red
Sox did not offer him the option of salary arbitration on Monday,
making him ineligible under American baseball rules to re-sign with
the club until May 1. He became a free agent after the season but
said if Boston had offered arbitration, he probably would have
played next year.
	   The right-handed relief pitcher, who spent seven years with
Boston before moving on to the Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics and
St. Louis Cardinals, had returned to the team last December
intending to finish his career in Boston.
	   Eckersley, a six-time All-Star and the winner of the 1992 AL Cy
Young Award winner as the best pitcher in the American League, has
390 saves, trailing only Lee Smith (478) and John Franco (397) on
the career list.
	   Eckersley broke into Major League Baseball in 1975 with the
Cleveland Indians, and pitched for the Red Sox from 1978-84. He was
20-8 with a 2.99 ERA in '78, his best year as a starter, but his
production diminished over the next six years.
	   After going 6-11 with the Cubs in 1986, Eckersley was traded to
the Athletics, who turned him into a reliever and gave him a second
career.
	   From 1988-1993, he averaged 43 saves per season. In 1990, he had
48 saves and a 0.63 earned run average for one of three of the
Athletics' consecutive pennant winners he played on.
	   Eckersley was 4-1 with one save and a 4.76 ERA in 50 relief
appearances this year.

EU defends new aircraft noise rules against U.S. criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union and the United
States on Thursday exchanged a new round of accusations of
protectionism, this time over the use of hush kits which act as
mufflers for plane engines.
	   The EU executive Commission proposed last March to phase-out the
use of aircraft equipped with hush kits by April 1, 1999. It argued
that hush kit-equipped planes now fall below the standards of newer
planes built with noise compliance in mind.
	   ``This is an environmental issue,'' said Sarah Lambert,
spokeswoman for the EU's Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   Lambert rejected U.S. accusations saying the new EU rule
violates international legislation on aircraft noise pollution
levels.
	   ``The U.S. complaint is a thinly veiled form of commercial
protectionism masquerading as environmental concern,'' Lambert
said.
	   But David Traynham, an official for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the EU move is ``less an environmental issue.
It has a market protection impact.''
	   ``They are looking for a new standard for the EU region,
different from the international standards,'' he told a news
conference, after two days of negotiations with EU officials.
	   The Commission proposal has been approved by the 15 EU countries
and is now being examined by the European Parliament. The new rule
won't affect aircraft registered prior to April 1.
	   Traynham said the United States is concerned because a majority
of hush- kit manufacturers are non-European and virtually all
hush-kit installations are for non-European manufactured aircraft.
	   He said U.S. hush kit-equipped airplanes meet international
rules limiting aircraft noise levels and that these planes will
continue to fly ``indefinitely'' in the United States after the
year 2000.
	   The EU and the United States regularly squabble over trade
issues ranging from steel to bananas, with each side repeatedly
accusing the other of protectionism.

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with approval. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's ruling executive committee
Thursday unanimously approved the structure for a revamped
Champions League and UEFA Cup to start next summer, said a key
official of the European soccer body.
	   ``They also agreed in principle to the distribution of money,''
but some points still need to be discussed over the next few weeks,
said Guido Tognoni, UEFA's head of national teams competitions.
	   Plans for the new competitions have been drawn up by the
European governing body to counter a breakaway Super League.
	   The decision means the end of the Cup Winners Cup competition
after the current season.
	   ``We will make a fine tuning, but we are very confident that
next season ... we will start with the new competition,'' said
Tognoni. ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top soccer clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved by the executive committee.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would help boost annual revenues for
Europe's leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the top
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players opting into the League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European soccer competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
around three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot,
UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups would
advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second round before the
quarterfinal stage.
	   Third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering the competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it replaces.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a
party office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, said .
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he
said Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a two-story, stucco building behind
black gates in the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the
Tigris River. Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are
outside, but a party emblem sits above the door, and a large
portrait of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein stands near the main
entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also said the site was
insignificant and downplayed the importance of the incident.
	   ``There are few things to be solved, but that's all,'' he said.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday
that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.''
	   But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot
accept to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission
continuing to flood us with lies and secondary details which do not
accomplish the awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.''
	   ``They want sanctions to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted
as saying by the Iraqi news agency.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   There are nearly 200 inspectors and experts working with the
team in Iraq.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For most of those who received Nobel
Prizes in the Swedish capital on Thursday, science is a way of
improving the human condition, but for one it's a means of
describing it.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago of Portugal often uses eerie,
almost-credible scientific events as metaphors for addressing
philosophical issues. In his most-recent novel ``Blindness,''
people suddenly and inexplicably go blind in an allegory of social
disintegration.
	   '''The Stone Raft'' from 1986 posits the Iberian Peninsula
snapping off from the rest of the European continent and floats
into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical search for identity away
from the standardizing nature of the European Union.
	   Saramago and winners of the physics, chemistry, medicine and
economics prizes were presented their prizes by King Carl XVI
Gustaf in a solemn afternoon ceremony at Stockholm's imposing
Konserthuset hall.
	   Then they headed for the castle-like city hall for a banquet
with more than 1,200 people.
	   The prizes are given every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor
of dynamite who established the prizes in his will.
	   It's probably not a day too soon if any of the laureates are
interested in the prize's money as much as its prestige. The
Swedish krona has consistently fallen since the prizes were
announced in October; the 7.6-million-kronor prizes were worth
about dlrs 978,000 two months ago, but at Thursday's exchange rate
the value had dropped to dlrs 943,000.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The attempt to divert an Egyptian airliner
to Libya was to break the U.N. air embargo, making it the first
Arab plane to do so, passengers said Thursday.
	   They said Wednesday's attempt to reroute the plane was
orchestrated by the Libyan government, which chartered the plane
that took off from San`a, the Yemeni capital.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo for
refueling and then back to Yemen.
	   ``The plan was to break the air embargo so that it would be the
first Arab airliner to break the sanctions,'' one of the passengers
told The Associated Press in Yemen, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Yemeni authorities did not apprehend the two masked men who
tried to divert the plane to Libya after it landed in Yemen
Thursday. The two men _ a Libyan diplomat and a Yemeni _ were
supported by the rest of the 96 passengers who tried to divert the
plane to Libya.
	   Egyptian officials had earlier said there were 150 passengers on
board.
	   Five of the passengers were Libyan diplomats working at the
Libyan Embassy in Yemen, including the masked man, officials in
San`a said Thursday. The rest were Yemeni members of Parliament and
trade union activists.
	   No reason was give as to why the two men were not apprehended in
Yemen, or in Tunisia and Cairo.
	   Tunisia's Civil Aviation Department denied in a statement
Thursday that there had been an attempt to hijack the plane and
said the passengers refused to get off the plane when it landed in
Jerba.
	   The passengers argued that their ``charter contract was to
Tripoli,'' Libya, the statement said.
	   ``There is... no question of a hijacking,'' it added.
	   The Egyptian pilot, Mounes Luka, also denied the two men had
tried to hijack the plane and said they were only trying to
persuade him to fly to Libya instead of Tunisia.
	   ``I told them it is impossible because Libya is under air
embargo,'' Luka told reporters at Cairo airport late Wednesday
after the plane landed briefly for refueling.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured.
	   Egypt's Al-Akhbar newspaper quoted the owner of the Egyptian
company that chartered the plane as saying that one of the
passengers was carrying a shotgun when he boarded the plane in
San`a Wednesday.
	   The paper did not identify him or give any other details.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 in an
attempt to force it to turn over two suspects wanted for the
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.

Northern Ireland's unfulfilled peace accord faces critical weeks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Nobel-Peace &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ This week, Northern Ireland's
leaders have been lavished with peace awards in Boston, Washington
and Norway. Back home, their peace process is flirting with
disaster.
	   Thursday's Nobel Peace Prize honorees _ Protestant leader David
Trimble and Catholic leader John Hume _ can't rest on their
laureates: The coming weeks could determine whether April's
historic agreement succeeds or fails.
	   The Good Friday accord sketched out a future for Northern
Ireland that reflected Hume's vision of compromise.
	   British Protestants and Irish Catholics are to share power in a
multi-party administration, and cooperate with the neighboring
Irish Republic in policy-making committees.
	   Just as importantly, the Irish Republican Army's affiliated Sinn
Fein party can join that administration, so long as their leaders
demonstrate commitment to ``exclusively peaceful means.''
	   The accord laid down key principles, but left vague some of the
most bitterly disputed specifics _ including what consitutes
evidence of ``exclusively peaceful means'' and when, if ever, the
outlawed IRA must start disarming.
	   Had these and a few other issues been nailed down in April, it
would have made impossible what was already hard enough _ winning
support from both Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose party's support among Catholics
has reached new heights.
	   In their only important decision, the members of Northern
Ireland's new Belfast-based Assembly picked Trimble and Hume's
deputy in the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Seamus Mallon, to
lead formation of the new administration.
	   Then Northern Ireland suffered a horrific summer that
illustrated the fragility of the prevailing paramilitary
cease-fires: Three Catholic boys burned to death in a sectarian
firebombing in July, and 29 people were slaughtered by IRA
dissidents the next month.
	   The Assembly has vowed to make the accord reality, but each
party is seeking its own terms in an atmosphere of suppressed
anger.
	   The biggest sticking point: Trimble insists Sinn Fein can't join
the administration unless the IRA starts destroying its weapons
stockpiles as proof of ``exclusively peaceful means.''
	   Adams says the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire should be enough, but
Trimble says society won't tolerate an ``armed peace.'' The
deadlock means no administration at all, when it was supposed to
have been appointed in October.
	   If the parties don't break the impasse by Christmas, the British
and Irish governments _ which are attempting to jump-start
negotiations _ say they'll run out of time to hand over power to
the new institutions by February, the accord's target.
	   Mallon and Hume say both sides must swallow their pride
simultaneously _ likely to prove the most complicated maneuver of
all.

Le Pen says Megret `coup' has failed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with party member giving count of signatures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A day after ousting his longtime lieutenant in a
bitter leadership struggle, National Front boss Jean-Marie Le Pen
accused Bruno Megret Thursday of plotting a ``commando operation''
to replace him _ and said he'd failed.
	   ``From the outside, he prepared a commando operation to try to
replace me and take the controls,'' Le Pen said on France Inter
radio.
	   ``The putsch he has attempted has obviously failed,'' Le Pen
said.
	   For his part, Megret demanded that his boss retract comments
implying Megret was racist and extremist.
	   ``It's an accusation that's extremely grave, because it's the
same accusation our adversaries make against us,'' Megret told RTL
radio.
	   Last weekend, Le Pen had described Megret as being backed by a
group of ``racists and extremists'' _ terms widely used in the
outside world to describe the National Front itself.
	   Megret lost his job as general delegate Wednesday, exactly two
hours after he appeared before a packed news conference to demand
an urgent congress of all members nationwide.
	   Though he wouldn't say it, the aim of such a congress would
implicitly be to reconsider leadership of the National Front.
	   Megret called his firing ``without significance,'' and renewed
his call for the party congress on Thursday.
	   ``If we don't have that congress, what do we do? Do we continue
to cut off heads?''
	   Later Thursday, party member Serge Martinez, who was the first
to call for a congress, told a news conference he already had 7,000
signatures in support of his call. According to Megret's side, only
10,000 signatures are needed to meet the required 20 percent of
party members to call the congress.
	   Le Pen, 70, leader of the National Front for a quarter-century,
took the opportunity of a TV interview Wednesday night to criticize
not only Megret but also his eldest daughter, Marie-Caroline, whose
companion is one of Megret's top aides, Philippe Olivier.
	   ``My daughter is linked to a chief of sedition,'' Le Pen said.
``I am used to family betrayals.''

Ukraine's parliament gives initial approval to 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Thursday gave
preliminary approval to the country's 1999 budget draft after
drastically raising projected revenues and spending despite intense
objections from the government.
	   Just hours before the vote, President Leonid Kuchma called
parliament's version of the budget draft ``populist and
destructive.''
	   ``The parliament itself does not want to answer for it,'' Kuchma
said in a speech to regional officials in Kiev.
	   The 450-seat Verkhovna Rada voted 288-25 to approve the first
reading of the budget, which provides for a zero deficit and
revenues of 33.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 9.75 billion at the present
rate), nearly 50 percent more than the figure proposed by the
Cabinet.
	   The draft now goes back to the government, which must submit it
for the second reading by Dec. 22, when lawmakers are to vote on
each individual figure in the document.
	   The heated debate over the draft reflected sharp differences
over 1999 revenues between the Cabinet and parliament's budget
committee, with both sides vowing to stick to their version of the
document.
	   ``We cannot agree with figures that are only based on
suppositions and are too high and unrealistic,'' Finance Minister
Ihor Mitiukov told lawmakers.
	   In particular, he criticized the lawmakers' proposal to raise an
extra 10.9 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.3 billion) in revenues by
imposing higher taxes on the energy sector, namely from
transportation and sales of oil and gas. The legislators also
raised spending levels.
	   The budget committee and its supporters met Mitiukov's remarks
with accusations that the government intentionally wants to conceal
part of the revenues.
	   Some suggested the government would use the money in the
presidential elections, scheduled for October 1999.
	   ``The impression is that the government needs only the right to
arbitrarily distribute budget funds,'' said Socialist faction
leader Oleksandr Moroz.
	   But neither the government nor the budget committee appeared to
have a clear majority of supporters, which might signal even tenser
debate in future discussions of the document.
	   In a sign that parliament would still insist on the higher
revenue target, deputies formed an investigative commission to look
at Ukraine's gas and oil market and determine whether it is capable
of producing the extra money the budget committee counted on.
	   The legislators also asked their Russian counterparts to help
investigate if any money had been raised illegally from what they
called ``overpriced'' supplies of Russian gas to Ukraine in
previous years.
	   The budget draft must pass three readings in parliament before
final approval, and many deputies have said the legislators still
have a chance of approving it by the end of the year.
	   Many analysts believe, however, that the worsening state of
Ukraine's economy, which has remained largely unreformed since the
1991 Soviet collapse, would make it impossible to implement any of
the proposed budget drafts.
	   The government raised only 50.8 percent of its projected annual
revenues in the first nine months of this year. The dwindling
revenues forced the government to default on wage and pension
payments, bringing these debts to more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs
1 billion).

Clinton to light local Christmas tree, says Bethlehem mayor
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will
light a Palestinian-grown Christmas tree over the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, in a visit Palestinian officials characterized
Thursday as a boost to their claims of statehood.
	   A multimillion-dollar face lift of the biblical city in
preparation for millennium celebrations has been sped up for
Clinton's Tuesday visit there.
	   Renovation of Manger Square, in front of the Church of the
Nativity, where Clinton and his family are to light the Christmas
tree, will be almost complete when the president arrives, promised
Bethlehem Mayor Hanna J. Nasser. The church was built in the fourth
century over ground where Jesus is believed to have been born.
	   The Palestinians had been offered a giant Christmas tree from
Norway but reluctantly turned down the gift citing problems with
Israel over a similar offer last year from Finland.
	   Then, Israeli authorities refused to release the tree from their
port, claiming the imported trees might be carrying diseases. The
Palestinians do not have a port of their own and so a more modest
homegrown Palestinian tree will be used instead this year.
	   ``We do not want to break heads with the Israelis,'' Nasser told
members of the Foreign Press Association on a visit to his office
Thursday opposite the Church of Nativity.
	   Clinton's visit to the West Bank and Gaza will give recognition
to Palestinian aspirations for statehood, said the urbane, goateed
mayor, in a three-piece tweed suit and a red tie.
	   Clinton, who has visited Christian sites in the Holy Land in the
past, ``dreams to visit, with his wife and daughter, the place
where Jesus Christ was born,'' Nasser said, adding that for
security reasons, he had still not been fully briefed on the
president's itinerary in his city.
	   Nasser said donor nations have pledged dlrs 100 million for the
Bethlehem facelift, but another dlrs 222 million is still needed to
complete the work. He criticized ``Christian countries that have
not contributed. If they do not contribute now, when are they going
to?''
	   Meanwhile, construction workers in bright yellow rain suits
mixed cement and paved over the football-field-sized square, which
used to be the city's downtown parking lot under a light downpour.
	   Christmas decorations have not been hung yet and Nasser
acknowledged that most of the construction of the square and repair
work for the main roads will not be completed by Dec. 25th. But he
hoped that that would not keep away the 40,000 people expected to
celebrate there this year.
	   ``People coming to Manger Square do not need a road,'' he said.
``They are pilgrims who come to see the place where Jesus was
born.''

City have been identified as the city's oldest known synagogue, an
Israeli archaeologist said Thursday.
	   Eilat Mazar, whose grandfather helped excavate the site over 25
years ago, said archaeological and documentary evidence prove that
the two-story stone structure located near the site of the First
and Second Temple, was used as a synagogue and house of study from
A.D. 638 into the 8th century.
	   Known as the ``House of Menorot'' because of the paintings of
Jewish seven-branched candelabras that decorate its walls, the
structure was first used by Christians as a public building during
the Byzantine era, destroyed after the Persian conquest in A.D.
614, and then rebuilt after the Moslem conquest of the city.
	   In a press statement, Mazar, an archaeologist at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University, said excavations revealed an abundance of Jewish
symbols, including the candelabras and indentations in the interior
doorways where Jews would have put glass lamps to light the study
hall and mezuzot _ miniature encased scrolls containing Biblical
passages.
	   ``All of these elements together point to the building's use as
a Jewish house of prayer and study,'' according to Mazar.
	   She said that documents from Cairo show that Caliph Omar Ibn
Ahlahtav, who ruled from A.D.634-644 granted permission to 70
Jewish families to settle in the area of Jerusalem where the
synagogue was uncovered.
	   The earliest previously known synagogue in Jerusalem was the
Ramban Synagogue in the Jewish quarter of the Old City, dating from
the 13th century.
	   Mazar was to present her results at an archaeological conference
at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv later Thursday.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In the first U.N. case to focus
exclusively on rape as a war crime, a Bosnian Croat paramilitary
chief was convicted Thursday of letting a subordinate sexually
assault a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced Anto Furundzija, 29,
to 10 years in prison, ruling that his failure to stop the rape
made him a ``fellow perpetrator'' guilty of two war crimes counts.
	   ``In such situations, the fellow perpetrator plays a role every
bit as grave as the person who actually inflicts the pain and
suffering,'' the judges wrote in a 100-page ruling.
	   Furundzija's attorney said he would appeal the conviction and
sentence.
	   ``Our position is one of true shock,'' said Luka Misetic. ``We
firmly, unequivocally state that our client is not guilty.''
	   Furundzija appeared unmoved when he heard the verdicts and
sentence. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   ``The sentence imposed sends a powerful message that war crimes
of this nature will not be tolerated,'' prosecutors said in a
written statement.
	   They added that the verdict was important ``because it
demonstrates that acts of rape will be dealt with seriously.''
	   The case, 7th graf pvs.

New Zealand vaulter stripped of Commonwealth Games silver medal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pole vaulter Denis Petouchinski was stripped of
his Commonwealth Games silver medal and banned from the next games
in 2002 on Thursday after a the Games Federation found him guilty
of taking performance enhancing steroids.
	   The Russian-born vaulter, who competes for New Zealand, took his
case to the Commonwealth Games Federation in London for a hearing
after he tested positive for stanozolol at the Games in Kuala
Lumpur in September.
	   The A urine sample tested positive two days after the closing
ceremony and the B sample, tested in November, as found to contain
the metabolics of the same substance.
	   A CGF statement said that he had broken the regulations
concerning prohibited substances and that he would be eliminated
from the 1998 Commonwealth Games and suspended from the 2002 event
in Manchester, England.
	   The Federation will notify the New Zealand track federation and
the the sport's world governing body, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, to carry out any further action necessary.
	   Thursday's action means that Australia's Paul Burgess is
elevated from the bronze to the silver medal position and
fourth-place finisher Kersley Gardenne of Mauritius gets the
bronze, his country's only athletics medal of the '98 Games. South
Africa's Riaan Botha won the gold medal.
	   Petouchinski, who contended that banned substances must have
entered his system during an appendix operation in June, was
allowed a Federation hearing because the tests results were known
after the 1998 Games had ended. That did not allow the athlete the
chance to attend a Medical Commission during the Games.

No progress reported on WTO leadership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more comment from meeting; byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization is set to miss its
mid-December target of choosing a new leader to guide it into the
next century because of indecision by the United States and
European Union.
	   Amid growing frustration, diplomats charged with trying to forge
a consensus among WTO members said Thursday they had made no
progress in narrowing down the list of four candidates.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub are widely regarded as the
front-runners, ahead of former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren
and former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore.
	   But the European Union remains internally divided over its
choice and the United States has not yet declared its position.
Japan and other Asian countries are backing Supachai. Abouyoub is
expected to pick up support from developing countries.
	   ``There is only a limited possibility that all members of the
organization will declare their positions by Dec. 18,'' said
ambassadors Celso Lafer and William Rossier.
	   Renato Ruggiero, the current incumbent, wants to step down in
April. The WTO had set itself a mid-December deadline to make the
final choice.
	   Lafer, from Brazil, and Rossier, from Switzerland, are charged
with trying to mold a consensus among the 132 WTO members. So far
about 90 countries have indicated their preferences.
	   ``It's one thing to have problems to reach agreement on one
candidate. But it's quite a different matter not to be able to work
toward such a decision because certain members haven't let us know
their choice,'' the diplomats said, in veiled reference to
Washington and Brussels.
	   ``The current state of flux can't be maintained for much
longer,'' they said in a report to the WTO council.
	   There will be another meeting Dec. 18 to try to move the process
forward.
	   But with Washington distracted by the impeachment debate and the
EU focusing on its looming monetary union, it is uncertain whether
that will make any progress.
	   At Thursday's session many trade diplomats voiced their
unhappiness that the United States and European Union were holding
up the selection process.
	   Egypt proposed moving to a vote, but this would go against WTO
traditions that everything must be decided by consensus.
	   The indecision comes at a time when the WTO and the open trade
system it champions is under pressure as a result of the global
economic crisis. There have been calls, especially in Asia, for
some form of protection to curb excesses of the free market.
	   The WTO is struggling to come up with a trade agenda for the
turn of the century, amid big differences between rich and poor
countries over environmental and labor issues.
	   All four candidates say they want to speed long-running
accession talks and bring China and Russia into the international
trading order as quickly as possible.
	   The silence of the United States and European Union is in
contrast to their unseemly public fight in the last leadership
contest, when the EU pushed Ruggiero and the United States wanted
former Mexican president Salinas de Gortari.

Belarusians demand human rights on universal rights declaration

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several rallies were held across the
Belarusian capital on Thursday to demand that the government free
political prisoners and respect human rights.
	   There were no reports of arrests or violence during the Thursday
rallies, which marked the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Protesters held signs demanding freedom for political prisoners
and handed out leaflets with the text of the declaration during the
rallies, organized by the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and human
rights groups Charter-97 and Spring-96.
	   Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko insists
that there are no political prisoners in this former Soviet
republic. But Charter-97 said five people are in prison, and two
more on trial for their political convictions.
	   Several Belarusian opposition leaders have been granted
political asylum in the United States, France and other countries
recently because of persecution by the Belarusian government.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch sent a message to
Belarusian authorities Thursday urging the release from jail of a
75-year-old former agriculture official, who is on trial in the
eastern town of Kirovsk.
	   Vasily Starovoitov, a former collective farm director, has
suffered two mini-strokes in pre-trial detention, where he has
remained since November 1997 despite lawyers' pleas for his
release.
	   Starovoitov is charged with embezzlement and bribery, but many
people believe he is being persecuted for publicly clashing with
Lukashenko.
	   ``Considering the non-violent nature of the offenses he is
charged with, the term that he has spent in pre-trial detention _
more than a year _ plus his age and health condition, we are
appealing to you to interfere in this case,'' Human Rights Watch
said in the Russian-language letter.
	   Hearings against Starovoitov were adjourned Wednesday and
Thursday because he was suffering an acute bout of bronchitis, his
lawyer Vera Stremkovskaya said.
	   The temperature in Starovoitov's cell is 6 C (43 F), but
lawyers' request to release him to let him recover have been
denied, Stremkovskaya told The Associated Press.
	   Lukashenko has persecuted independent media and disbanded a
popularly elected parliament and replaced it with a group of his
supporters. His police often club and arrest participants at
rallies.
	   Leading international human rights organizations routinely list
Belarus among countries with the most severe human rights
violations.
	   But the Belarusian government insists its observance of human
rights should be commended.
	   ``I categorically object to the saying that Belarus occupies
some kind of a low place in the list of countries observing this
(human rights) declaration,'' Belarusian foreign minister and
former KGB colonel, Ural Latypov, said Thursday.
	   ``Belarus occupies an honorable place in terms of observing
human rights.... When we are put into some kind of a list, that is
unfair. Belarus doesn't deserve that.''

Senate ratifies IMF aid package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian Senate on Thursday
ratified the dlrs 41.5 billion aid package put together by the
International Monetary Fund to help Brazil's ailing economy.
	   The endorsement authorizes Brazil to sign the financial aid
agreements, announced last month, with the IMF and the Bank for
International Settlements, which is coordinating the bilateral
contributions to the credit line.
	   The rescue package makes the dlrs 41.5 billion available to
Brazil over the next three years. About dlrs 37 billion will be on
tap if needed in the next 12 months.
	   The IMF will put up dlrs 18 billion, while other international
aid agencies will chip in dlrs 9 billion. The remaining dlrs 4.5
billion will come from industrial countries in North America,
Europe and Asia. The United States will contribute dlrs 5 billion.
	   Amaury Bier, the finance ministry's economic policy director,
told reporters the government will inform the IMF later Thursday of
its intention to draw its first allotment of the funds made
available.
	   According to the O Estado news agency Bier said the first
tranche from the IMF will total dlrs 5.3 billion.
	   Combined with funds other lenders, the first disbursement could
reach dlrs 9.8 billion.
	   The government has said it will use the funds to boost the
country's international reserves, which have plummeted to about
dlrs 40 billion from more than dlrs 70 billion just before Russia's
default in mid-August.
	   The default sent investors fleeing emerging markets worldwide.
The government has said the money will be used to shore up the
country's international reserves, which have fallen to around dlrs
40 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July.
	   The IMF board of directors gave its final stamp of approval to
the aid package last week.
	   Brazil has pledged to pursue a series of belt-tightening
measures aimed at trimming the country's public deficit to 4.7
percent of gross domestic product by the end of 1999.
	   Official figures released earlier this week, showed that the
deficit for the the first nine months of year stood at 7 percent of
GDP.

Danish bank takeover of Norway's Fokus Bank appears set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Denmark's largest commercial bank, Den
Danske Banke, was set to take over Norway's commercial Fokus Bank
after more than 90 percent the of Norwegian bank's shareholders
accepted an offer by a Thursday deadline.
	   However the roughly 5.8 billion kroner (dlrs 770 million) deal
for Norway's third-largest commercial lender still requires
Norwegian government approval. The Danish bank said it would apply
for that permission within two weeks.
	   Den Danske Bank said 93.4 percent of Fokus' shareholders
accepted a bid of 80 Norwegian kroner (dlrs 10.67) per share. The
acceptance rate was over the 90-percent minimum the Danish bank set
as a condition of the deal.
	   ``Den Danske Bank is very glad so many shareholders, including
major Norwegian and foreign shareholders, have chosen to accept the
bank's offer,'' the bank said in a written statement.
	   Last month, the Danish bank won a bidding match for Fokus
against Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken, the Nordic countries'
largest lending institution.
	   Fokus, based in the central Norway city of Trondheim, has 70
branch offices, about 1,000 employees and 39 billion kroner (dlrs
5.2 billion) in assets.

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee on
Thursday unanimously approved the revamped Champions League and
UEFA Cup to start next summer, a key official of the European
soccer body said.
	   ``They also agreed in principle to the distribution of money,''
but some points still need to be discussed over the next few weeks,
said Guido Tognoni, UEFA's head of national teams competitions.
	   The competitions were restructured to counter the threat of the
breakaway ``Super League.''
	   The ratification means this current season will be the last for
the European Cup Winners Cup, which has been contested annually
since 1961.
	   ``We will make a fine tuning, but we are very confident that
next season ... we will start with the new competition,'' Tognoni
said. ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved by the Executive Committee.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by the
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would boost annual revenues for Europe's
leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the leading
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players who joined the Super League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European club competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised
revenues, UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups would
advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second round before the
quarterfinal stage.
	   Third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering that competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it will replace.

French skiers lead one-and-two in downhill training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ French skiers led one-and-two
Thursday in a downhill training run, as unheralded Antoine Deneriaz
edged Olympic champion and teammate Jean-Luc Cretier by 0.12
seconds.
	   Deneriaz, a member of France's backup team, surprised the field,
covering the classic Oreiller-Killy course in the fastest time of 2
minutes, 1.84 seconds.
	   Cretier set the target of 2:01.96 before Deneriaz stole the
spotlight despite a late start number in 34th.
	   Cretier, fifth in Wednesday's training run, is still seeking his
first career World Cup win and is looking to confirm his Olympic
gold on Saturday, in his first downhill on home soil since the
Nagano Games.
	   Kristian Ghedina of Italy, who has nine career wins, crossed
third, 0.14 back.
	   Austria's Fritz Strobl, first in Wednesday's training, clocked
the fourth fastest time of 2:02.12, followed by Italy's Werner
Perathoner, tied for fifth with Austria's Stephan Eberharter in
2:02.19.
	   Though Austrian skiers failed to make the top three, they
nevertheless had four skiers in the top ten, while Italy had three.

Dane found guilty of distributing child porn, abusing daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Dane was sentenced Thursday to five
years' jail for making pornographic videos with his six-year-old
daughter which he distributed through the Internet.
	   The man, who used the name ``Goldilocks'' on Internet, was
arrested in November 1997 in what police then said was the biggest
child pornography case ever investigated in Denmark.
	   A tip from Belgian police, who were investigating a pedophile
scandal, led Danish police to the man believed to be at the center
of the ring with ties to 19 countries, including the United States,
Canada, France, Germany and Italy.
	   Danish police said they found 20,000 pornographic photos of
children stored on his computer, as well as videotapes of him
sexually abusing his 6-year-old daughter.
	   During the three-day trial, the defendant burst out into tears
several times when the jury viewed some of the videotapes. t in
Copenhagen also found the man guilty of distributing the material,
and possession of pornography involving those under age 15. The
sentences in both convictions were included in the five year's
imprisonment.

U.N. celebrates human rights achievements and laments failures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from secretary-general, Mary Robinson,
British minister, U.S. ambassador, adoption of resolution,
presentation of awards; updates with 126 speakers &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations marked its
achievements Thursday while lamenting that millions of people are
denied basic rights and fundamental freedoms.
	   ``Today, we honor the highest of human aspirations and renew our
promise to conquer the worst of human cruelty,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told a special session of the General
Assembly. ``We pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of
these human rights, and to the memory of those who died for them.''
	   The anniversary marked a day of reflection _ rather than
celebration _ of five decades that have witnessed wars, mass
killings, widespread poverty and starvation as well as the adoption
of international treaties protecting human rights and the
establishment of tribunals to punish those who abuse them.
	   As Annan said, ``it is a day for those who are still denied
their human rights to dream again of asserting them, and to know
that their dream is our dream _ the dream of all human rights for
all.''
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said the
challenge is to implement that dream _ ``to close the gap between
rhetoric and reality'' _ and ensure that the declaration's
principles are adhered to by all nations.
	   But she said the international community's record in responding
to gross human rights abuses, ``does not give grounds for
encouragement.''
	   ``Despite all the legislation, procedures and mechanisms that
are in place, millions are still routinely deprived of their basic
rights,'' she told the General Assembly.
	   ``Millions of refugees and internally displaced persons cannot
return to their homes. ... Religious and ethnic minorities are
persecuted; opposition to oppressive regimes is met with brutal
force; those who speak in defense of human rights are silenced,
imprisoned, killed,'' she said.
	   Robinson called it ``shameful'' that 20 percent of the world's
population own in excess of 80 percent of the world's wealth and
consume 80 percent of its resources while over a billion people are
denied the most basic needs _ adequate food and shelter, clean
water, education and health care.
	   Echoing the same theme, Britain's Secretary for International
Development Clare Short called the denial of rights to the world's
poor ``a moral outrage'' and said the declaration didn't just mean
``freedom from fear but freedom from want.''
	   She urged all nations to mark the 50th anniversary by making a
commitment to meet the U.N. target of cutting the number of people
living in abject poverty by half by the year 2015.
	   By the time the day-long General Assembly began, 126 countries
had signed up to speak, a reflection of the importance of the
issue.
	   By consensus, delegates adopted a resolution reaffirming ``the
faith of the United Nations in fundamental human rights, in the
dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men
and women and of nations large and small.''
	   At the start of the session, the secretary general awarded Human
Rights Prizes to those struggling against injustice.
	   This year's winners were former U.S. President Jimmy Carter;
Sunila Abeyesekera, executive director of the Sri Lanka human
rights organization INFORM; Angelina Acheng Atyam, a founding
member of the Concerned Parents Association in Uganda; Jose
Gregori, head of the National Secretariat for Human Rights in
Brazil and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic, a human rights
activist.
	   Celebrities Michael Douglas, Wynton Marsalis, Luciano Pavarotti
and Vanessa Redgrave were taking part in commemorations.
	   Annan and three U.N. Messengers of Peace _ Pavarotti, Douglas
and Italian journalist Anna Cataldi _ were to present newly
designed ``children's passports'' with the text of the universal
declaration printed inside. UNESCO plans to distribute these
passports to children to promote human rights awareness.

Killing of Real Sociedad fan to be remembered in next League round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The memory of a Real Sociedad supporter
stabbed to death outside Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium
will be honored by all Spanish first division clubs in this
weekend's 14th-round.
	   Aitor Zabaleta, 28, died from stab wounds allegedly inflicted by
a radical rival fan before Atletico beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in a
UEFA Cup match Tuesday.
	   ``No genuine supporter of Atletico is happy today... classifying
for the UEFA Cup quarter finals matters little when there is a
death involved,'' a statement issued Thursday by Atletico's main
supporters' organization said.
	   A minute's silence will be held in all Spanish stadiums this
weekend to remember the tragedy, while players from Real Sociedad
and Real Madrid will unfurl a banner against soccer violence they
face each other Sunday.
	   ``We are going to pay homage to his (Zabaleta's) family because
we want to be by their side,'' said Madrid's Italian midfielder
Christian Panucci.
	   ``There is a point when people will no longer go to games to
enjoy themselves but rather to let loose their adrenaline built up
in their personal lives and I don't think soccer should be used for
that,'' Panucci said, confessing nervousness at taking his own son
to a match.
	   Languishing at No. 7, six points behind league leader Mallorca
that has 25 points, Real Madrid needs a victory to restore its
domestic league reputation.
	   Delighted by advancing to the quarterfinals of the Champions
League and winning the Intercontinental Cup, the white-clad
superteam has yet to make its mark at home this season.
	   In a more serious situation is the teams traditional rival
Barcelona. Out of European soccer and joint on 19 points with
Madrid but one place behind at No.8 - the Catalan powerhouse is in
deep crisis.
	   The waters have been somewhat calmed by Wednesday's 1-0
compensation victory over Danish side Brondby in its last match of
the Champions League, but Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal will still be
under great pressure at Sunday's match at home against first
division newcomer Villarreal Sunday.
	   League leader Mallorca with a 7-4-2 record also plays Sunday
against No.6 Zaragoza.
	   Mallorca will be looking to its iron defense that has let in
only five goals so far this season compared to Zaragoza's 18.
Zaragoza has scored 18 which is four more than the top club.
	   Two points behind Mallorca in second place, Deportivo de la
Coruna has a chance to leapfrog to No. 1, confident from its
victory over Barcelona last week just seconds before the whistle.
	   For this to happen Deportivo must defeat Athletico de Bilbao on
Sunday, and the current top dog coached by Argentine Hector Cuper
must lose against Zaragoza.
	   	   In other games Sunday Celta, the little-known team from the
northwestern port city of Vigo, is jubilant about kicking both
English soccer legend Liverpool and current league leader Aston
Villa out of the UEFA Cup against Liverpool.
	   Currently at No. 3 with 22 points, Celta will meet 17th-placed
Espanyol.
	   In Saturday's only match, No. 5 Atletico will travel south to
Seville to meet midtable Betis.
	   Yugoslav striker Vladimir Jugovic is out of the match due to a
ripped muscle that could keep him of the pitch for up to one month.
	   Club favorite Francisco ``Kiko'' Narvaez is also doubtful.
	   In the remaining 14-round matches, all Sunday: Fourth-placed
Valencia welcomes struggling Salamanca, Valladolid hosts Alaves in
a lower-half battle, Racing de Santander takes on Tenerife for a
similar match up and last placed Extremadura hosts midtable Oviedo.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar joined fans, players
and officials to condemn the killing of Zabaleta and demanded a
greater effort to avoid soccer violence.

Pinochet's lawyers challenge House of Lords ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Attorneys for Gen. Augusto Pinochet went back to
the House of Lords on Thursday, seeking to stop Spain's effort to
extradite the former Chilean dictator to stand trial for murder and
other human rights abuses.
	   Their plea to overturn a ruling by the highest court of appeal
apparently is unprecedented in English law. It came a day before
Pinochet was due for his first court appearance in what is likely
to be a long and costly extradition battle.
	   Pinochet's attorneys argued, once again, that he is entitled to
sovereign immunity for any actions committed while a head of state.
That argument was rejected two weeks ago in a 3-2 decision by a
House of Lords tribunal.
	   The 83-year-old general's attorneys also said they might also
seek permission to contest Wednesday's decision by Home Secretary
Jack Straw to permit extradition proceedings.
	   ``Having carefully considered all the recent developments, we
can confirm we have lodged a petition with the House of Lords that
the decision of their lordships that Senator Pinochet does not have
sovereign immunity should not be allowed to stand,'' said Michael
Caplan of the law firm Kingsley Napley.
	   Grounds for the appeal were not immediately disclosed.
	   Straw ruled that Spain could seek Pinochet's extradition on
charges including torture and conspiracy to murder, related to
human rights abuses in Chile after Pinochet took power in a
military coup in 1973.
	   Pinochet's supporters have complained that Lord Hoffmann, one of
the judges who voted against Pinochet's appeal, was director of a
charity associated with Amnesty International.
	   Amnesty International said Thursday that Lord Bingham, the Lord
Chief Justice who voted for Pinochet's appeal, had joined Lord
Hoffmann in a public appeal to build a new headquarters for the
human rights organization.
	   Moreover, the group said, Pinochet's law firm, Kingsley Napley,
had donated 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,660) to that cause.
	   In Madrid on Thursday, Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a
criminal indictment against Pincohet for genocide, terrorism and
torture allegedly committed during his rule between 1973 and 1990.
Straw had ruled that Pinochet could not be extradited on a charge
of genocide, but let the other charges stand.
	   Most of the 300-page indictment lists thousands of alleged

assets and for his continued detention in Britain.
	   Chile's government, which says the case threatens to destablize

overthrew the elected president Salvador Allende.
	   The general was arrested in his hospital bed Oct. 16 while
recuperating from back surgery in London.
	   Straw rejected allegations of bias against Hoffmann, and also
said he did not find Pinochet ``unfit to stand trial.''

Archaeologist identifies Jerusalem's oldest-known synagogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The remains of a seventh-century stone building
and courtyard found within the ancient walls of Jerusalem's Old
City have been identified as the city's oldest known synagogue, an
Israeli archaeologist said Thursday.
	   Eilat Mazar, whose grandfather helped excavate the site more
than 25 years ago, said archaeological and documentary evidence
prove that the two-story stone structure located near the site of
the First and Second Temple, was used as a synagogue and house of
study from A.D. 638 into the 8th century.
	   Known as the House of the Menorahs because of the paintings of
Jewish seven-branched candelabras that decorate its walls, the
structure was first used by Christians as a public building during
the Byzantine era, destroyed after the Persian conquest in A.D.
614, and then rebuilt after the Moslem conquest of the city.
	   In a press statement, Mazar, an archaeologist at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University, said excavations revealed an abundance of Jewish
symbols, including the candelabras and indentations in the interior
doorways where Jews would have put glass lamps to light the study
hall and mezuzot _ miniature encased scrolls containing Biblical
passages.
	   ``All of these elements together point to the building's use as
a Jewish house of prayer and study,'' according to Mazar.
	   She said that documents from Cairo show that Caliph Omar Ibn
Ahlahtav, who ruled from A.D.634-644 granted permission to 70
Jewish families to settle in the area of Jerusalem where the
synagogue was uncovered.
	   The earliest previously known synagogue in Jerusalem was the
Ramban Synagogue in the Jewish quarter of the Old City, dating from
the 13th century.
	   Mazar was to present her results at an archaeological conference
at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv later Thursday.

Sheik Zayed donates funds to Arab League projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The cash-strapped Arab League has received a
dlrs 500,000 donation from the president of the United Arab
Emirates, a league statement said Thursday.
	   The league's secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, received the
check from the Emirates president, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan, it said.
	   The statement said the money would be put in a special ``Sheik
Zayed Fund'' for projects that contribute to Arab unity. It gave no
other details.
	   The 22-member league has suffered financial problems for years
because many members are behind in paying their dues.

SAfrica says rebels must be admitted to Congo talks next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo on Thursday insisted Congolese rebels be
admitted to peace talks in Zambia next week.
	   The statement continued to put South Africa at logger heads with
the Congolese government over settling civil war in the central
African country formerly known as Zaire.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila has refused to sign a
cease-fire or speak to the rebels until two countries he says are
backing them _ Rwanda and Uganda _ withdraw from Congo.
	   The Congolese ambassador to Kenya, Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza, repeated
Congo's stance in Nairobi on Thursday.
	   The conflict has drawn at least five African countries,
including Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola that are supporting Kabila,
into battle in the vast mineral-rich country.
	   Nzo said it would be ``shortsighted'' to pretend that Tuesday's
meeting in Zambia _ the next in a series of summits _ had any
purpose without direct participation of rebels, according to
foreign affairs spokesman Marco Boni.
	   ``This in no way suggests that South Africa is favoring the
rebels,'' Boni said in a telephone interview.
	   Boni refused to say if South Africa would attend the talks.
	   ``South Africa is emphasizing the point that it would be futile
to expect the talks to produce any progress if we continue to avoid
the central issue,'' Boni said.
	   Heads of state from the Southern African Development Community,
a 14-nation group that includes Congo, hope to firm up a proposed
cease-fire negotiated late last month at a Franco-African summit in
Paris.
	   Foreign and defense ministers are to meet on Monday in Zambia's
capital, Lusaka, a day before the summit, SADC said.
	   Kabila has met with the Rwandan and Ugandan presidents at past
summit talks.
	   Kabila condemned South Africa as ``puppets of the aggressors''
in an interview with SABC-TV broadcast on Wednesday from the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa.

German poll finds majority favors euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Supporters of a single European
currency outnumbered opponents in Germany for the first time in a
poll released less than a month before the euro is to be
introduced.
	   The Psephos Institute poll, to be published in Friday's editions
of the German business daily Handelsblatt, found 43 percent in
favor and 41 percent opposed.
	   Last January, the institute found 58 percent opposed and 30
percent in favor of joining a currency union with other European
Union countries.
	   No margin of error or other data was given about the poll.
	   Eleven EU countries will begin Jan. 1 with the process of
abandoning their national currencies in favor of a common euro.

Nobel peace laureates push for movement in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
accords &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Leads throughout to recast and reorganize, update with
torch-light parade. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Protestant David Trimble, in accepting the
Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic John Hume Thursday, said Northern
Ireland's militants must lay down their arms to prove that a dream
of peace on the troubled island is finally coming true.
	   Trimble, 54, and Hume, 61, won the coveted prize for helping
bring about an April peace accord, now called the Good Friday
Agreement. They hope to end 30 years of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   At a gala ceremony at the Oslo City Hall, where 4,000 children
had gathered outside in a parade for the laureates, both men vowed
to see the peace process through, despite what might be a rough
road ahead.
	   After accepting their awards, which include gold medals,
diplomas and a shared 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943
million), both laureates vowed before a crowd of 1,000 to carry out
the peace process. Later in evening, hundreds of Norwegians honored
them with a torch-light parade.
	   ``We shall overcome,'' said longtime peace activist Hume,
quoting an earlier Nobel Peace laureate, slain American civil
rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Hume leads the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman
Catholic party.
	   One of the first things they must overcome is a rising crisis in
the peace process. The outlawed Irish Republican Army, nearly 17
months into a truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its
secret stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   Trimble's party last week demanded at least a symbolic
disarmament before the IRA's political ally, Sinn Fein, can join a
new government body set up under the accords.
	   ``I have not insisted on precise dates, quantities and manner of
decommissioning. All I have asked for is a credible beginning. All
I have asked for is that they say the so-called `war' is over,''
said Trimble in his Nobel speech.
	   ``A further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn
Fein are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or is still
drinking from the dark stream of fascism,'' he added.
	   In his acceptance speech, Hume said they owed it to the people
of Ireland to succeed because ``too many lives have already been
lost.''
	   ``I want to see our Ireland _ North and South _ ... as an
example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by
living for ideals, rather than fighting or dying for them,'' he
said.
	   Although many were involved in the process that led up to the
peace accord _ including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and U.S. President Clinton _ the
five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee deemed Hume and Trimble as
the key players.
	   ``The circle of violence is broken,'' said committee chairman
Francis Sejersted. ``We know that difficult tasks remain. Our
comfort is that you will continue to lead the peace process.''
	   The Nobel committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a mixed Protestant-Catholic peace
movement.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians to form a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May.
	   ``We have started. And we will go on. ... Sometimes we will
stumble, but this need not matter,'' said Trimble, a member of the
British Parliament and expected to become Northern Ireland's prime
minister.
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes are always presented on
the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death. The peace prize, which
last year went to International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its
American coordinator, Jody Williams, is awarded in Oslo.
	   The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden on the
same day. This year's winners: Jose Saramago of Portugal for
literature; Americans Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid
Murad, for medicine; Indian scholar Amartya Sen for economics;
American researchers Robert Laughlin, Horst Stormer, and Daniel
Tsui for physics, and Walter Kohn and John Pople, both U.S.-based,
for chemistry.

Anti-government protesters clash with police in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Anti-government protesters clashed with
police in the Georgian capital on Thursday after the demonstrators
tried to block traffic on a central street.
	   Several police officers and demonstrators suffered light
injuries, said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Maya Musidze.
	   The protesters were followers of former President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, who was ousted in 1992 and died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994.
	   His supporters said the rally was staged to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Between 300 and 400 people took part in the protest, which was
headed by the ex-president's widow, Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia's followers remain bitterly opposed to President
Eduard Shevardnadze and claim his government is illegal.
Gamsakhurdia supporters staged a mutiny against Shevardnadze at a
military garrison this fall, but the revolt failed after one day
and soldiers returned to their base.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In the first U.N. case to focus
exclusively on rape as a war crime, a Bosnian Croat paramilitary
chief was convicted Thursday of letting a subordinate sexually
assault a Muslim woman in 1993.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced Anto Furundzija, 29,
to 10 years in prison, ruling that his failure to stop the rape
made him a ``fellow perpetrator'' guilty of two war crimes counts.
	   ``In such situations, the fellow perpetrator plays a role every
bit as grave as the person who actually inflicts the pain and
suffering,'' the judges wrote in a 100-page ruling.
	   Furundzija's attorney said he would appeal the conviction and
sentence.
	   ``Our position is one of true shock,'' said Luka Misetic. ``We
firmly, unequivocally state that our client is not guilty.''
	   Furundzija appeared unmoved when he heard the verdicts and
sentence. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   ``The sentence imposed sends a powerful message that war crimes
of this nature will not be tolerated,'' prosecutors said in a
written statement.
	   They added that the verdict was important ``because it
demonstrates that acts of rape will be dealt with seriously.''

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ After months of discussion, UEFA's
executive committee Thursday unanimously approved the structure for
a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup to start next summer.
	   ``The financial distribution has still to be fine tuned but the
basic principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary Gerhart
Aigner told reporters.
	   These would be finalized in the next two to three months, he
said.
	   The move _ which was drawn up to counter a breakaway Super
League _ means the end of the Cup Winners Cup competition after the
current season.
	   ``We are very confident that next season ... we will start with
the new competition,'' said Guido Tognoni, head of national teams
competitions.
	   ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top soccer clubs had already endorsed plans for a new
32-team Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup to merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions had to be approved by the executive committee.
	   It is hoped the Champions League will generate some 800 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million), around three-quarters of the
proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot,
UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would help boost annual revenues for
Europe's leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the top
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players opting into the League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European soccer competitions.
	   Under the new format the Champions League will be expanded from
24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups would
advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second round before the
quarterfinal stage.
	   Third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering the competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it replaces.

Prosecutor: crime boss wanted to disrupt national order
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense arguments grafs 4-5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss prosecutor said Thursday that alleged
Russian mafia boss Sergei Mikhailov posed a real threat to western
society and should be found guilty of charges of belonging to an
illegal organization.
	   Speaking at the end of a two-week trial, Jean-Louis Crochet
praised all the witnesses who had dared to testify against
Mikhailov, some under heavy protection.
	   ``If you find him guilty you will have said he has tried to
disrupt national order and infiltrate himself into Switzerland,''
Crochet told the jury of six. ``We will have succeeded in putting
an end sufficiently early to the gangrene for western society which
organized crime represents.''
	   Defense lawyer Xavier Magne said his client should be acquitted
because the charges against him were without foundation.
	   Magne said that Mikhailov was a pawn in the fight against
organized crime in Switzerland, even though nobody had filed for
his extradition.
	   Mikhailov, 40, is charged with being a member in a criminal
organization and lesser charges of forgery and violating
Switzerland's property laws.
	   In a four-hour summation, Crochet pointed to the evidence of
witnesses from half a dozen countries about Mikhailov's activities.
	   He highlighted the testimony of retired FBI special agent Robert
Levinson, who described the structure of the Solntsevskaya mafia
organization, of which Mikhailov is allegedly the leader, and links
to the United States.
	   Crochet also praised the courage of witnesses who told the court
they had been subject to threats and beatings from Solntsevskaya.
	   ``Organized crime has the aim of taking control of the economy
and exerting influence over politics. The rule of silence is the
golden rule,'' he said.
	   Mikhailov, who has been in custody in Switzerland for two years,
denies the charges against him and claims he is an ordinary
businessman, though he admits to being ``very, very rich.''
	   The verdict is expected Friday or Saturday. If convicted,
Mikhailov faces a maximum of 7 1/2 years in jail.

Tunisian activists launch democratic forum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Tunisian pro-democracy activists
said Thursday they had set up a forum to promote free and fair
elections.
	   Calling themselves the National Council for Freedoms in Tunisia,
the activists are led by Mouncef El-Merzouki, a Tunis-based doctor
and former head of the Tunisian Human Rights Committee, who was
once detained and had his passport confiscated by the authorities.
	   Tunisia has been dominated by one party since independence in
1956. Human rights groups have accused the government of President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of manipulating election results and
systematic violations of civil rights.
	   In a fax received by The Associated Press in Cairo, the group
said Tunisia was ``in the grip of political system which ignores
democracy and basic freedoms.''
	   ``This situation is not compatible with the yearning of our
people for democracy and respect of civil rights,'' the statement
said.
	   Among 28 signatories to the statement were the well-known
Tunisian journalist Siham Bin Sidrin, university professor and
medical doctor Moustafa Bin Jaffer and deputy chairman of the
Tunisian Human Rights Committee, Khadija el-Sherif.
	   The group said it was calling for a national debate about
Tunisia's political problems, free and fair elections, and the
division of executive and legislative powers as these were now
concentrated in the president's hands.
	   The government has frequently detained activists who criticized
its policies and urged democratic reforms.

 &UR; Businessman Nelson Skalbania goes to jail &LR;  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (CP) _ Vancouver businessman Nelson Skalbania is
behind bars two years after he was sentenced to a year in jail for
theft.
	   The B.C. Court of Appeal turned down Skalbania's appeal of the
sentence today. The former owner of the B.C. Lions football team
was taken immediately to a jail cell at the Vancouver Law Courts
building.
	   Skalbania's legal troubles began following a 1991 venture in
which he accepted $100,000 from investor Gordon Gooch.
	   Skalbania was supposed to put the money into a trust account,
but instead used part of it to cover an overdraft in his real
estate firm, plus personal and family expenses.
	   He repaid Gooch in full three months later with interest.
	   A 1995 trial acquitted Skalbania of the theft charge because the
judge had doubts he intended to steal the money.
	   That verdict was overturned in September 1996 by the B.C. Court
of Appeal which imposed the year-long sentence.
	   But Skalbania's lawyer took the case to the Supreme Court of
Canada, arguing the appeal court was wrong to overturn the
acquittal. 
	   Skalbania also challenged a section of the Criminal Code that
gives the appeal court the right to substitute the verdict of
acquittal in a case decided by judge alone.
	   However, the high court justices didn't agree and rejected the
appeal, paving the way for today's decision to jail Skalbania.
	   Skalbania's lawyers had hoped the appeal court would agree to a
fine and probation today instead of jail.

New Swiss president wants new debate with U.S., Jewish groups

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's first Jewish president says she will
use her new role to be more outspoken toward the United States and
Jewish organizations on the Swiss role in World War II, she said in
interviews Thursday.
	   Ruth Dreifuss, whose father lost his job in 1942 for helping
people fleeing the Holocaust, said she also will be speak more
openly to the Swiss about their past.
	   The election gives her ``a great chance'' to contribute to the
debate about the neutral Switzerland's actions in the war and its
current efforts to repair any wrongdoing, she said.
	   Dreifuss, the interior minister responsible for social and
health affairs, told the daily Le Temps that she had kept a low
profileon the wartime issue previously in part because it wasn't
her role in government.
	   She said she also didn't want to be seen as a ``token Jew'' to
shield the government from attacks from Jewish organizations.
	   ``It will be different in my role as president, which gives me
much clearer legitimacy,'' Dreifuss said. ``It's an opportunity I
intend to seize both in this country and abroad.''
	   Dreifuss was elected by parliament Wednesday to the one-year
presidency for 1999. The largely ceremonial job rotates among
members of the seven-member coalition Cabinet, which she joined as
a representative of the Social Democratic party in 1993.
	   During the search for the assets of Holocaust victims in Swiss
banks during the past 3 1/2 years, Switzerland has come under heavy
criticism from international Jewish organizations and the U.S.
government.
	   Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust than the
other members of the Cabinet, and that her personal and family
history had given her special insights.
	   Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon after the outbreak of World War
II, to a Swiss Jewish family. She said in an interview in the
weekly L'Hebdo published Thursday that her early memories included
the constant fear that Germany would invade Switzerland.
	   Her father lost his job in textile imports and exports when he
was caught in a network helping falsify documents for refugees so
that they could enter Switzerland.
	   She said she could empathize both with the 27,000 Jewish
refugees allowed into Switzerland and the 30,000 who were turned
back during the war.
	   Dreifuss has said she thinks the Swiss government should
compensate Jews who were sent back. The Nazis sent many of the
returnees straight into concentration camps.
	   A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come
next spring when an international panel of historians appointed by
the Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy,
Dreifuss said.
	   ``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she
said. ``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish
organizations where they are totally justified and legitimate in
their demands and where they are less so. I think I will be able to
do a lot and I don't have any complexes with Jewish
representatives.''
	   She said she knows the United States and the way the
international Jewish community functions better than her
colleagues.
	   Dreifuss, also the first Swiss woman to be president, said,
``the election of a Jewish female president of the confederation
demonstrates that what would have been impossible just a few years
ago has become normal.''

Poland's death toll from fierce cold hits 100
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost four weeks of
sub-freezing temperatures in Poland has reached 100, almost double
the total from all of last winter, police said Thursday.
	   The latest victim, a 68-year-old man, died Wednesday night when
he passed out from alcohol on the way home from a bar in Kamionki
Stare, near Czestochowa, some 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of
Warsaw.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
	   While the homeless have an especially tough time, police
spokesman Pawel Biedziak said most of the victims are ``men aged
between 40 and 60, with a permanent home, who were drinking alcohol
before death.''
	   Police say 54 cold-related deaths were recorded in all of last
winter.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight convicted kidnappers, on a hunger
strike to pressure the government to release them, on Thursday
seemed closer to death than freedom.
	   After going 25 days without eating, the five Chileans, two
Argentines and one Brazilian, ``made a decision that brought them
one step closer to death,'' said Breno Altman, president of the
Committee to Free Political Prisoners.
	   The prisoners, who abducted a supermarket magnate in 1989,
decided to no longer take sodium and potassium salts to ward off
heart failure and convulsions, he said.
	   ``They're determined to die if their demands are not met,''
Altman said by phone.
	   The eight are hospitalized at Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas.
	   Dr. Abrao Jose Cury said that by refusing to take sodium and
potassium salts the prisoners' immunological system could collapse
``leading to death.''
	   ``And if they stop drinking water, they'll quickly lose
consciousness, which is when we will start feeding them
intravenously because no doctor will stand still and let someone
commit suicide,'' he added.
	   To end their fast, the prisoners want the government to expel
the foreigners and pardon the Brazilian. Two Canadians convicted,
David Lamont and Christine Spencer, with them were transferred to a
Vancouver prison on Nov. 20.
	   At their trial, the 10 claimed to be political prisoners because
they belonged to a group that planned to funnel the dlrs 30 million
ransom they were demanding to El Salvador's leftist guerrillas.
	   Although the Supreme Court agreed their crime was politically
motivated, they were charged under a harsher code for common
criminals because their act never endangered national security.
	   They were sentenced to between 26 years and 28 years for
abducting Abilio Diniz, the owner of Brazil's largest supermarket
chain. Police freed him unharmed six days later.
	   The kidnappers' lawyers argue that they are eligible for
work-release since they have already served one-sixth of their time
and are first-time offenders. Work-release would trigger the
non-Brazilians' expulsion.
	   Sao Paulo Judge Otavio Augusto Machado de Barros said the
prisoners were not placed in a work-release program because ``they
all failed their psychological evaluations.''
	   ``None of them felt any guilt or expressed any regret for the
crime they committed,'' Barros said by phone. ``They have cold and
calculating personalities, which impedes their reintegration into
society.''
	   ``Their fate is now in the hands of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso who can, if he wants, sign the expulsion and pardon
decrees,'' Altman said.
	   Cardoso has given no indication that he will intervene.
	   Public sentiment is about evenly divided between those who say
the prisoners have suffered enough and those who think their
release would set a dangerous precedent, especially among the more
than 1,000 foreigners being held in Brazilian prisons.
	   The prisoners stopped eating on Nov. 16, claiming that
authorities reneged on the agreement that ended their 16-day hunger
strike in April, Altman said.
	   The prisoners say they were to have been transferred to a
minimum-security prison and allowed to participate in work-release.
	   Judge Barros, however, has said that the only agreement made was
a promise to review their sentences and study the possibility of
placing them in a work-release program. A criminal court is
scheduled to review the sentences on Dec. 15.

Last IRA prisoners in England going to Ireland by Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The last five Irish Republican Army convicts in
English prisons will be transferred to Ireland by Christmas, the
British government confirmed Thursday.
	   The decision was called long overdue by the IRA-affiliated Sinn
Fein party, which has agitated for years to have all IRA prisoners
serve sentences near their relatives.
	   IRA members convicted in connection with bomb attacks in England
are supposed to serve their sentences there. But more than 40
already have been transferred to prisons in British-ruled Northern
Ireland or the Irish Republic partly in reward for IRA cease-fires
in 1994 and 1997.
	   The last five awaiting transfer include prisoners convicted of
bombing Harrods department store, firing mortar shells at London's
Heathrow Airport, and trying to bomb various civilian targets.
	   Though facing long sentences, they all are likely to be paroled
by mid-2000 under terms of April's peace accord.
	   Also Thursday, three Dublin judges convicted a former Irish
soldier of trying to smuggle a car bomb to Britain in April and
gave him a 15-year sentence.
	   Larry Keane, 41, pleaded guilty to transporting a 980-pound
(445-kg) bomb inside a stolen BMW on behalf of IRA dissidents
opposed to the cease-fire.
	   Police said the car bomb, seized at Dun Laoghaire ferry port
south of Dublin, was destined for England and twice the size of the
Aug. 15 bomb that killed 29 people and wounded 370 in the Northern
Ireland town of Omagh.

Arsenal parts company with long-time sponsor JVC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal said Thursday its 17-year sponsorship deal
with Japanese electronics giant JVC would end this season.
	   Arsenal players have worn the JVC logo on their jerseys since
1981 and it has brought around 20 million pounds (dlrs 33 million)
income to the English club.
	   Arsenal, seeking funds for a new stadium development at
Highbury, is upping the amount it wants from the sponsor. JVC,
diverting funds to sponsor the 2002 Japan-South Korea World Cup,
bowed out of the bidding.
	   ``There is no animosity,'' said Arsenal vice chairman David
Dein. ``JVC have decided to channel their energies elsewhere. It
has been a marvelous partnership over 18 years and we have both
wished each other well.''
	   Managing director Ken Friar said the club was seeking a
successor to JVC and said there would be no shortage of candidates
although he declined to name them.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran's Embassy on Thursday denied a report that it
has actively recruited Russian scientists who previously worked on
Russia's germ warfare program.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had successfully
lured five Russian scientists, and was trying to attract more from
research centers in Russia and Kazakstan.
	   In a statement, Iran's Embassy said that the Iranian government
``has not and will not try under any circumstances to get access to
such types of (biological) arms.''
	   Iran is conducting peaceful biological research programs that
are ``directed at combating AIDS and lung diseases, tuberculosis in
particular,'' the statement added.
	   The statement said that the relationship between Russia and Iran
is fully open, and both countries were meeting their commitments
concerning the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
called Thursday for tightened control over the export of equipment
and expertise to Iran.
	   After meeting with visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, Maslyukov said the United States had expressed
concern about apparent unauthorized supplies of Russian missile
expertise and equipment to Iran.
	   Maslyukov demanded specific evidence before Russia would take
any action, but added that ``control over exports should be
tightened,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear reactor, and both
countries insist the reactor will only be used to generate power.
	   However, the United States and Israel say that the technology
may help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no plans to
develop such weapons.
	   The United States also has been providing aid to Russian
scientists in recent years in hopes that they will not be tempted
to sell their expertise to countries that want to build weapons of
mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury
urged Arab states Thursday to move toward an Arab common market to
counter trade blocs.
	   The prime minister spoke to reporters after arriving in Jordan
for talks with his counterpart, Fayez Tarawneh, on setting up a
free trade zone between Egypt and the kingdom.
	   ``We are working together to establish a free trade zone and
hope to establish an Arab common market like the European Union,''
he said.
	   ``An Arab common market is the best way to challenge
international blocs,'' he said.
	   He said previous attempts to set up a pan-Arab market had failed
because the moves were too hasty.
	   The right way, he said, was to start with a free trade zone and
expand it to a customs union and then, ultimately, create a common
market for all the 21 Arab states and the Palestinian territories.
	   Egypt already has free trade zones with Morocco, Lebanon and
Tunis, el-Ganzoury said.
	   Later, in a joint news conference with Tarawneh, El-Ganzoury
said regional economic prosperity will not be achieved as long as
no Arab-Israeli settlement is achieved.
	   He said Israel also ``will not live in peace'' if there is no
settlement with the Arabs.
	   El-Ganzoury, who arrived earlier in the day, met with Crown
Prince Hassan and discussed Middle East peacemaking and economic
ties, the state-run Jordan Radio reported. Hassan is acting as
regent while King Hussein is away.
	   Later, el-Ganzoury and Tarawneh chaired meetings of the Joint
Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, which promotes cooperation in
various fields.
	   A communique issued at the end of the meeting said the two prime
ministers signed 13 economic agreements, most significant among
them was to establish a joint free trade zone.
	   Under the accord, Jordan and Egypt will reduce customs duties on
each other's goods next month by 25 percent and work for an
abolition of all such levies by 2005, the communique said.
	   Jordan imported 275 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 387 million)
worth of Egyptian goods in 1997 and exported to Egypt goods worth
14.5 million dinars (dlrs 20 million).
	   El-Ganzoury was scheduled to return home on Friday after a tour
of the Dead Sea to inspect Jordanian investment projects in the
lowest point on earth.

High Winds Jedi wins desert endurance race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ American star Valerie
Kanavy on High Winds Jedi regained the title of World Endurance
Champion Thursday after the defending champion, her daughter
Danielle, retired after her horse took a tumble in the Dubai
desert.
	   The younger Kanavy, who won the title on Peirez four years ago
in Kansas, dropped out after her 16-year-old grey gelding, Peirez,
took a tumble 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the first veterinary
checkpoint in the dlrs 300,000 race.
	   No fewer than 174 riders set off at the crack of dawn at the Abu
Dhabi town of Ghantoot and endured high temperatures as they
steered their mounts along the 160-kilometer (99-mile) course.
	   ``I am delighted to regain the world title, which also makes up
a bit for the disappointments of my daughter on our favorite horse,
Peirez,'' said Valerie Kanavy, 52, after cantering home in front of
a huge crowd of sheiks and fans at Seyh Al Salam arena.
	   ``The biggest problem I had was with the high temperatures which
made me suffer. But my horse is wonderful,' Valerie said.
	   Valerie and Danielle Kanavy have both won the world championship
on Peirez before.
	   Danielle, 27, was more worried about the condition of her
beloved Peirez than her withdrawal.
	   ``Peirez took a tumble about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from the
first vet gate and though he looked okay, we decided not to risk
him,'' she said.
	   Her mother's win maintains the American hold on the championship
since the first competition in 1986.
	   Fausto Fioricci, a medical doctor from Italy, surprised the
strong field by taking second place on Faris Jabar, another grey
gelding. He finished about 50 meters (165 feet) behind Kanavy.
	   Japan's Daisuke Yasunaga, who trained for the race in Australia,
finished third.
	   No official timings were released by the organizers. A computer
failure during the race caused confusion as the riders were left
without waiting periods for the next stages.
	   The Emirates, which expected its riders to be among the top
three, had to be content with fourth and fifth places through
Mohammed Ali Al Shaffar, on Abrock Theodore, and Sheik Hamdan bin
Mohammed Al Maktoum, who rode Ratzia D'Alauze.
	   Dubai's Crown Prince, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, saw
his hopes disappear when his horse, Nelson I, was eliminated by the
veterinarians after failing an examination at the fourth check
point.
	   The sheik's eldest son, Sheik Rashid bin Mohammed, also had to
retire.

Danish police arrest 15 people in cigarette smuggling case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Police raided two Latvian-registered
ships and arrested 15 people Thursday on suspicion of attempting to
smuggle millions of cigarettes into Denmark.
	   Police in the port of Frederikshavn boarded the vessel
Valentina, which had run aground near Denmark's northern tip, early
Thursday. They arrested three Latvians and five Danes found
unloading pallets of cigarettes.
	   Later Thursday, police raided a second Latvian-flagged ship and
arrested seven Latvians in a port near Frederikshavn, 275
kilometers (170 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. Even though police
found no illegal tobacco on board, they suspect it of operating
together with the Valentina.
	   Police refused to identify the suspects or give further details,
except that three million cigarettes labeled as the Danish-made
Prince brand were seized.
	   Due to high tobacco taxes in Denmark, cigarettes cost about 30
kroner (dlrs 4.80) per pack of 20, while the same brands cost 5
kroner (dlrs 0.80) a pack in Latvia.
	   The number of cigarettes smuggled into Denmark appears to be
increasing sharply. In the first 10 months of this year, Danish
officials seized 22.5 million smuggled cigarettes, compared to
nearly 12 million cigarettes for all of 1997.

 &UR; Nobel peace laureates push for movement in Northern Ireland
accords &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Leads throughout to recast and reorganize, update with
torch-light parade. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Protestant David Trimble, in accepting the
Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic John Hume Thursday, said Northern
Ireland's militants must lay down their arms to prove that a dream
of peace on the troubled island is finally coming true.
	   Trimble, 54, and Hume, 61, won the coveted prize for helping
bring about an April peace accord, now called the Good Friday
Agreement. They hope to end 30 years of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   At a gala ceremony at the Oslo City Hall, where 4,000 children
had gathered outside in a parade for the laureates, both men vowed
to see the peace process through, despite what might be a rough
road ahead.
	   After accepting their awards, which include gold medals,
diplomas and a shared 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943
million), both laureates vowed before a crowd of 1,000 to carry out
the peace process. Later in evening, hundreds of Norwegians honored
them with a torch-light parade.
	   ``We shall overcome,'' said longtime peace activist Hume,
quoting an earlier Nobel Peace laureate, slain American civil
rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Hume leads the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman
Catholic party.
	   One of the first things they must overcome is a rising crisis in
the peace process. The outlawed Irish Republican Army, nearly 17
months into a truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its
secret stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   Trimble's party last week demanded at least a symbolic
disarmament before the IRA's political ally, Sinn Fein, can join a
new government body set up under the accords.
	   ``I have not insisted on precise dates, quantities and manner of
decommissioning. All I have asked for is a credible beginning. All
I have asked for is that they say the so-called `war' is over,''
said Trimble in his Nobel speech.
	   ``A further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn
Fein are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or is still
drinking from the dark stream of fascism,'' he added.
	   In his acceptance speech, Hume said they owed it to the people
of Ireland to succeed because ``too many lives have already been
lost.''
	   ``I want to see our Ireland _ North and South _ ... as an
example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by
living for ideals, rather than fighting or dying for them,'' he
said.
	   Although many were involved in the process that led up to the
peace accord _ including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and U.S. President Clinton _ the
five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee deemed Hume and Trimble as
the key players.
	   ``The circle of violence is broken,'' said committee chairman
Francis Sejersted. ``We know that difficult tasks remain. Our
comfort is that you will continue to lead the peace process.''
	   The Nobel committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a mixed Protestant-Catholic peace
movement.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians to form a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May.
	   ``We have started. And we will go on. ... Sometimes we will
stumble, but this need not matter,'' said Trimble, a member of the
British Parliament and expected to become Northern Ireland's prime
minister.
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes are always presented on
the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death. The peace prize, which
last year went to International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its
American coordinator, Jody Williams, is awarded in Oslo.
	   The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden on the
same day. This year's winners: Jose Saramago of Portugal for
literature; Americans Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid
Murad, for medicine; Indian scholar Amartya Sen for economics;
American researchers Robert Laughlin, Horst Stormer, and Daniel
Tsui for physics, and Walter Kohn and John Pople, both U.S.-based,
for chemistry.

Solzhenitsyn at 80: still grumbling about Russia's rulers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB108-109 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Solzhenitsyn celebrates his 80th
birthday Friday, his influence waning but his grumpy voice still
railing against Russian leaders he denounces as foolish and
corrupt.
	   With his long gray beard and severe countenance, Solzhenitsyn
cultivates the image of a 19th-century sage. His place in history
is assured by his monumental works chronicling the atrocities of
Soviet-era prison camp life.
	   But today he is largely ignored in Russia, where many regard him
as a cranky old man whose words have little relevance amid the
country's current turmoil.
	   ``He played a great role in history, but not in literature,
because he has no followers in literature,'' said Russian writer
Vladimir Voinovich. ``His role is more historical now.''
	   Since returning to Russia in 1994 after 20 years in exile,
Solzhenitsyn and his wife Natalya have maintained a reclusive
existence on the outskirts of Moscow.
	   However, his birthday has brought a temporary surge of public
attention.
	   He planned to visit the Swedish Embassy on Thursday evening,
where he and other Nobel laureates were to be feted. And Friday, he
planned to attend a play, ``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of
his novel ``The First Circle.''
	   His most recent book, ``Russia in Collapse,'' was published this
summer with an initial run of just 5,000. It sold better than
expected, and another 5,000 copies were ordered.
	   In his recent writings and speeches, Solzhenitsyn has bemoaned
Russia's disintegration and condemned the country's post-Soviet
leaders as no better than the communist rulers he so reviled.
	   ``The system of central power ... is just as uncontrollable,
lacking any public responsibility and immune from punishment as the
communist power was,'' he wrote in 1996. ``As much as we wish to,
it cannot be called democracy.''
	   In modern Russia, serious writers have lost the elevated status
they had in communist times, and Solzhenitsy has lamented that his
compatriots no longer read his work in large numbers.
	   His conservative and nationalist views have come under fire from
liberals, and he's also despised by hard-liners for his militant
anti-communism.
	   Still, no one denies his enormous impact during the Soviet era.
	   ``The influence of Solzhenitsyn on Russian literature and, in
general, on Russian history was enormous _ incomparable to any
other writer in this century,'' said Yegor Gaidar, a former prime
minister.
	   ``He is a great writer, public figure and fighter,'' said writer
Fazil Iskander. ``His greatest role was in fighting and exposing
the totalitarian (Soviet) regime. There was no equal to him.''
	   In a country where the average man doesn't live to 60,
Solzhenitsyn still appears vigorous and lucid at 80, although he
did suffer a mild heart attack two years ago.
	   Solzhenitsyn maintains Russia's past decade of change has
accomplished little aside from tearing down communism.
	   ``I see no changes for the better,'' he said in a rare speech
last year. ``We are doing everything to destroy Russia. We have no
market, no democracy _ a wild predatory capitalism is being built
here.''
	   Solzhenitsyn had already laid bare the country's gulag, or
prison camp system, and achieved international renown when he was
arrested by Soviet authorities and exiled in 1974. He settled in
rural Vermont and maintained monastic discipline, producing a
multi-volume saga of Russian history, ``The Red Wheel.''
	   It was less successful than his best-known works _ ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago'' _ his portrayals of life in Soviet forced-labor
camps, where he spent eight years for writing a letter criticizing
Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books still have meaning for Zoya Marchenko, 91,
who spent more than 20 years in labor camps.

dead,'' she said. ``He knows how many young and talented people

Court upholds seizure of former East German communist funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A federal court ruled Thursday that the government
was right to seize millions of marks the former East German
communists transferred to a private group just before their assets
were frozen.
	   The Federal Administrative Court ruled the money _ some 37.5
million marks (dlrs 23 million) _ rightfully belonged to the
government, which intends to distribute it to social-service
organizations in eastern Germany.
	   The Party for Democratic Socialism, successor to the toppled
East German communists, donated the money to an Islamic group on
May 31, 1990 _ one day before a law freezing party assets took
effect.
	   After unification on Oct. 3, 1990, the federal agency charged
with privatizing East German state assets seized the money from the
group.
	   The agency charged the PDS was trying to hide assets, noting
that the Islamic group had been founded only two months before
getting the check and its leader had had business ties to communist
officials.
	   The group challenged the seizure as improper and won in two
lower courts. But the federal court said the federal agency was
right to claim it, since the group had waited until June 6, 1990,
to cash the check _ after the ban had taken effect.
	   The PDS made hundreds of millions of marks of donations of party
assets before unification, including other private groups and
Berlin's Humboldt University.

Dane found guilty of distributing child porn, abusing daughter

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Dane was sentenced Thursday to five
years' jail for making pornographic videos with his six-year-old
daughter which he distributed through the Internet.
	   The man, who used the name ``Goldilocks'' on Internet, was
arrested in November 1997 in what police then said was the biggest
child pornography case ever investigated in Denmark.
	   A tip from Belgian police, who were investigating a pedophile
scandal, led Danish police to the man believed to be at the center
of the ring with ties to 19 countries, including the United States,
Canada, France, Germany and Italy.
	   Danish police said they found 20,000 pornographic photos of
children stored on his computer, as well as videotapes of him
sexually abusing his 6-year-old daughter.
	   During the three-day trial, the defendant burst out into tears
several times when the jury viewed some of the videotapes.
	   The Eastern High Court in Copenhagen also found the man guilty
of distributing the material, and possession of pornography
involving those under age 15. The sentences in both convictions
were included in the five year's imprisonment.

Palestinians convene to scrap calls for Israel's destruction

National Council meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Under Israel's watchful eye,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat convened senior officials and
legislators Thursday to revoke clauses of the PLO charter calling
for Israel's destruction.
	   The meeting is an interim step ahead of Monday's session of the
Palestine National Council, where the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile is to reaffirm the move in U.S. President Bill
Clinton's presence.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he
has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a
``firm hand,'' and said he would not go ahead with a West Bank
troop pullback he promised under the Wye River peace agreement
unless Arafat met a list of demands.
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that Clinton's visit to the
region, which starts late Saturday, is fomenting unrest rather than
calming the already tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.
	   The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his
address Monday to the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian groups in Gaza City.
	   Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this
session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.
	   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the
Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less
than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success
without it. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with
its future,'' Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he
would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue.
	   Arafat said the procedure during the PNC session was an internal
Palestinian matter. ``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he
said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five
percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his
decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally
declare a state in May.
	   The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse
after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a
very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down
the government in the event of another troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the
accord. On Thursday, 105 of the 124 members of Palestinian Central
Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on
whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
	   A simple majority of 63 members was required, and a vote was
expected later Thursday evening.
	   The council has not met for years and was revived specifically
for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegates, members of the
Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,
among others.

Serb police block start of exhumations in Kosovo

 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The head of a European forensics
team accused Serb authorities of obstructing a probe into wartime
atrocities Thursday after police blocked the experts from reaching
the graves of massacred civilians in central Kosovo.
	   The move by police, in armored vehicles, prevented a 19-member
Finnish team from beginning work at six sites in Kosovo containing
the bodies of victims of this year's conflict.
	   The standoff came on a day when hundreds of Serbs marched to a
rebel stronghold to protest the disappearance of civilians, and a
newly established international verification force inaugurated its
first regional center.
	   The Finnish team was scheduled to start digging on the makeshift
graves of 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians at Gornje Obrinje in the
central Drenica region, a breakthrough in investigative work into
atrocities in this war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   But a Serb police contingent _ consisting of four armored
personnel carriers and about two dozen policemen in flak jackets
and carrying automatic rifles _ stopped the convoy on the road
between Pristina and the site.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. Her team spent more than two hours at the roadblock
before turning back, and it was unclear when the team might try to
return.
	   The Serb police insisted on escorting the Finns to the
exhumations site to protect a Serb legal team accompanying them, a
condition rejected by the forensic team because the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which controls the surrounding territory, said the
police could not enter the area.
	   Rebel forces wearing black or camouflage uniforms were visible
in force along the surrounding dirt roads and the countryside.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations, including Gornje Obrinje where a frozen
hillside is believed to contain the mutilated bodies of men, women
and children from a single family.
	   Ranta said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic immunity
of the Finnish ambassador for human rights. She said a Serb
policeman grabbed a camera from a Finnish TV cameraman in the
ambassador's convoy and took out a film.
	   Two hours of subsequent talks with Serbian Justice Minister
Dragoljub Jankovic back in Pristina did not immediately resolve the
problem, she said later Thursday, without elaborating.
	   The September killings in a forest near Gornje Obrinje, 40
kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina were among the most gruesome
during the Serb forces' seven-month offensive against separatists
in Kosovo.
	   The massacre prompted worldwide outrage and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to end the crackdown.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   In Kosovo's southwest, several hundred Serbs held a protest
march Thursday to a rebel stronghold to call attention to the
disappearance of about 200 Serbs during the conflict _ many
believed abducted by the rebels.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' about half the 400 marchers completed the
20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac to the KLA stronghold of
Dragobilje.
	   Orahovac Mayor Andeljko Kolasinac held a cordial but
unproductive meeting with an ethnic Albanian representative that
was mediated by British and American peace verifiers. The Albanian,
Lulzim Paqarizi, who blamed the violence on the Serbian regime and
said more than 1,500 Kosovo Albanians also are missing or believed
kidnapped.
	   ``You have come to the wrong address,'' Paqarizi said. ``Our
forces have never attacked Serb civilians.''
	   The march organizer told reporters the ``peace march'' was a
symbol of solidarity for the families of the missing.
	   About 500 unarmed international verifiers are now working in
Kosovo as part of a force expected to reach 2,000 by the end of
January.
	   The Kosovo Verification Mission, created under the October peace
agreement, inaugurated its first regional center Thursday in the
town of Prizren, adding 60 new personnel to diplomatic observers
already in place.
	   ``We can now say that KVM has got people on the ground and is
operational,'' said spokesman Duncan Bullivant of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which operates the mission.
``Today marks a major step forward in the whole KVM operation.''

Government, hoping for debt relief, draws up 1999 austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government drew up an austerity budget
for 1999 on Thursday but the bid to repair Russia's decrepit
economy requires massive debt restructuring that foreign creditors
have so far been unwilling to grant.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters.
	   The draft budget that was approved by the government Thursday
calls for $7.2 billion in new foreign loans, and provides for
repaying only $9.5 billion in foreign debt next year, Zadornov
said.
	   That means Russia, in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, will seek restructuring
of $8 billion of the $17.5 billion it is due to pay in 1999.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who holed up in a country residence this
week after more than two weeks in a hospital for treatment of
pneumonia.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris Club of
creditor nations.
	   But so far the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The government will submit the draft budget on Friday to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Zadornov said. Primakov,
who enjoys broad support in the Duma, is counting on quick
approval.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that it is very austere,'' Primakov
told his cabinet as leaders hashed out the draft. ``The essential
thing is that it is honest. We didn't include spending that can't
be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov said expected revenues would cover all of Russia's
domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia needs to
restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet Union.
The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what Russia
owes next year.
	   But creditors have been unwilling to rework the debts Russia
already has, and the prospects for more foreign loans are equally
hazy.
	   A $22.6 billion loan package put together by the International
Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt default and ruble
devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign credits that had yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that if it does not get foreign
aid, it would simply print money _ which would send inflation
soaring.
	   The government already intends to print about $1.7 billion worth
of rubles next year, according to the draft budget, to cover part
of a deficit equivalent to around $5 billion.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues worth $29 billion, by
Thursday's exchange rate for the ruble, and spending of around $24
billion, officials said.
	   Many economists predict the deficit will be even larger because
the government's estimates of an average ruble rate of 21.5 to the
dollar and 30 percent next year may be unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.

dream of peace on the troubled island.
	   Trimble, 54, and Hume, 61, won the coveted prize for helping to
bring about an April peace accord, now called the Good Friday
Agreement. They hope to end 30 years of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   At a gala ceremony at the Oslo City Hall, where 4,000 children
had gathered outside in a parade for the laureates, both men vowed
to see the peace process through, despite what could be a rough
future.
	   After accepting their awards, which include gold medals,
diplomas and a shared 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943
million), both laureates vowed before a crowd of 1,000 to carry out
the peace process. Later in evening, hundreds of Norwegians honored
them with a torch-light parade.
	   ``We shall overcome,'' said longtime peace activist Hume,
quoting an earlier Nobel Peace laureate, slain American civil
rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Hume leads the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman
Catholic party.
	   One of the first things they must overcome is a rising crisis in
the peace process. The outlawed Irish Republican Army, nearly 17
months into a truce, is insisting that it won't destroy any of its
secret stockpiles of weaponry, a goal contained in the accord.
	   Trimble's party last week demanded at least a symbolic
disarmament before the IRA's political ally, Sinn Fein, can join a
new government body set up under the accords.
	   ``I have not insisted on precise dates, quantities and manner of
decommissioning. All I have asked for is a credible beginning. All
I have asked for is that they say the so-called `war' is over,''
said Trimble in his Nobel speech.
	   ``A further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn
Fein are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or is still
drinking from the dark stream of fascism,'' he added.
	   In his acceptance speech, Hume said they owed it to the people
of Ireland to succeed because ``too many lives have already been
lost.''
	   ``I want to see our Ireland _ North and South _ ... as an
example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by
living for ideals, rather than fighting or dying for them,'' he
said.
	   Although many were involved in the process that led up to the
peace accord _ including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and U.S. President Clinton _ the
five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee deemed Hume and Trimble as
the key players.
	   ``The circle of violence is broken,'' said committee chairman
Francis Sejersted. ``We know that difficult tasks remain. Our
comfort is that you will continue to lead the peace process.''
	   The Nobel committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a mixed Protestant-Catholic peace
movement.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians to form a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May.
	   ``We have started. And we will go on. ... Sometimes we will
stumble, but this need not matter,'' said Trimble, a member of the
British Parliament and expected to become Northern Ireland's prime
minister.
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes are always presented on
the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death. The peace prize, which
last year went to International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its
American coordinator, Jody Williams, is awarded in Oslo.
	   The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden on the
same day. This year's winners: Jose Saramago of Portugal for
literature; Americans Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid
Murad, for medicine; Indian scholar Amartya Sen for economics;
American researchers Robert Laughlin, Horst Stormer, and Daniel
Tsui for physics, and Walter Kohn and John Pople, both U.S.-based,
for chemistry.

Divers find Australian WWI submarine off Turkish coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Divers said Thursday they have found the
wreck of an Australian submarine that was the first to break
through Turkish defenses in the World War I battle of Gallipoli,
scuttled in the Marmara Sea off Gallipoli's bloody battlefields.
	   Divers have been searching for the AE2 for years. A Turkish team
found it 72 meters (237 feet) deep, apparently intact despite its
more than eight decades underwater, said Selcuk Kolay, the
expdition's leader.
	   ``We found marks that match exactly the information we have
about the AE2,'' Kolay told The Associated Press.
	   The AE2 made history when it managed to cross the narrow
Dardanelles Straits in April 1915, opening the way for other Allied
submarines in the battle.
	   Its fortunes turned just a few days later when it was forced to
emerge close to a Turkish gunboat during heavy fire. The captain
sank the submarine while his crew was being captured by the Turks.
	   Newly released information from Turkish authorities gave more
precise coordinates from logs of the day, helping the search, said
Mark Fraser, spokesman for the Australian Embassy.
	   Turkish and Australian authorities now have to decide what to do
with the wreck, considered Turkish property because it lies in
Turkish waters.
	   ``What we would like is to raise it and have it displayed at our
museum,'' said Kolay, who is director of a museum owned by the Koc
Holding, Turkey's largest conglomerate.
	   He said the Koc foundation was willing to fund most of the dlrs
100 million cost.
	   One million men fought on both sides of the 1915-16 battle of
Gallipoli, an unsuccessful attempt by the Allies to knock Germany's
ally, Turkey, out of the war. The battle helped determine the
future of Turkey and Australia's national character.
	   Australia and the other Allies recorded 55,000 killed, 10,000
missing and 21,000 dead of disease, mainly dysentery. Turkish
casualties are estimated at 250,000.

Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New for AMs; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England announced a third key interest
rate drop in as many months Thursday to ward off the risks of
recession and deflation, prompting complaints from manufacturers,
union leaders and some analysts that it was too little too late.
	   The bank voted to reduce its base lending rate for loans to
commercial banks from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent, after cutting
its lending rate 0.5 percent in November and 0.25 percent in
October.
	   That still leaves Britain's interest rates at about twice the
level of those of the 11 European countries that are introducing a
single European currency, the euro, on Jan. 1. Earlier this month,
those countries coordinated a base rate drop to 3 percent.
	   Continental Europe's interest rates are lower, analysts say,
because economies there have been weaker in the past few years than
Britain's, and unemployment higher.
	   Following the bank's announcement, British building societies
and banks immediately announced a half-percentage point drop in
mortgage rates.
	   Analyst Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors,
an influential think tank representing businesses, predicted
British interest rates would drop to 5.5 percent or lower by late
spring, pressuring the pound to fall against the dollar and the
euro and helping British exporters.
	   ``I think the bank misread the economy in the summer, and is
worried about a recession,'' she said. ``Rates could go down to 4.5
percent.''
	   Union representatives criticized the rate cut, and called for a
full one-point fall to avoid further job losses, following a series
of high-profile factory closures since the summer.
	   The rate reduction was a ``pathetic response,'' union leader
John Edmonds said, adding that the bank's monetary committee
members ``seem to be living in a parallel universe. They should
come into the real world.''
	   Bankers are divided over how the pound will respond next year to
the introduction of the euro and the melding of 11 European
economies.
	   On Wednesday, investor George Soros told a House of Commons
committee that the pound could be vulnerable to speculators if
Britain didn't join the single currency, while most economists say
the new currency is unlikely to make an immediate difference.
	   Pro-single currency supporters said higher interest rate cuts
would put pressure on Britain to join.
	   ``Even after today's cut, British interest rates are over twice
the level of our European competitors and sterling is still about
10 percent overvalued,'' said Malcolm Bruce from the Liberal
Democrat Party, which supports closer European integration.

Russia talks with Deere on billion-dollar equipment deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government is holding talks with U.S.
farm machine giant Deere and Co. on an equipment leasing deal worth
nearly dlrs 1 billion, the agriculture minister said Thursday.
	   The government is planning to set up a leasing company with John
Deere that would allow Russian farmers to upgrade outdated
equipment, the Interfax news agency quoted Viktor Semyonov as
saying.
	   Cash-strapped Russian farmers cannot buy new machinery without
credit financing.
	   ``We will have no tools to harvest fodder and grain in two or
three years unless we find a way to supply machinery to farmers,''
Semyonov said at a news conference in St. Petersburg, the Interfax
news agency.
	   The number of tractors used by Russian farmers dropped by 33
percent between 1991 and 1997, and the number of other farm
machines dropped as much as 55 percent Semyonov said.
	   Russia is also holding talks with other unspecified foreign
companies to build agricultural machinery plants in Russia,
Semyonov said.
	   Already facing a serious economic downturn, Russia also saw its
worst harvest in more than four decades this year and turned to the
U.S. and European Union for food aid.

Solzhenitsyn at 80: still grumbling about Russia's rulers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB108-109 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Solzhenitsyn celebrates his 80th
birthday Friday, his influence waning but his grumpy voice still
railing against Russian leaders he denounces as foolish and
corrupt.
	   With his long gray beard and severe countenance, Solzhenitsyn
cultivates the image of a 19th-century sage. His place in history
is assured by his monumental works chronicling the atrocities of
Soviet-era prison camp life.
	   But today he is largely ignored in Russia, where many regard him
as a cranky old man whose words have little relevance amid the
country's current turmoil.
	   ``He played a great role in history, but not in literature,
because he has no followers in literature,'' said Russian writer
Vladimir Voinovich. ``His role is more historical now.''
	   Since returning to Russia in 1994 after 20 years in exile,
Solzhenitsyn and his wife Natalya have maintained a reclusive
existence on the outskirts of Moscow.
	   However, his birthday has brought a temporary surge of public
attention.
	   He planned to visit the Swedish Embassy on Thursday evening,
where he and other Nobel laureates were to be feted. And Friday, he
planned to attend a play, ``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of
his novel ``The First Circle.''
	   His most recent book, ``Russia in Collapse,'' was published this
summer with an initial run of just 5,000. It sold better than
expected, and another 5,000 copies were ordered.
	   In his recent writings and speeches, Solzhenitsyn has bemoaned
Russia's disintegration and condemned the country's post-Soviet
leaders as no better than the communist rulers he so reviled.
	   ``The system of central power ... is just as uncontrollable,
lacking any public responsibility and immune from punishment as the
communist power was,'' he wrote in 1996. ``As much as we wish to,
it cannot be called democracy.''
	   In modern Russia, serious writers have lost the elevated status
they had in communist times, and Solzhenitsy has lamented that his
compatriots no longer read his work in large numbers.
	   His conservative and nationalist views have come under fire from
liberals, and he's also despised by hard-liners for his militant
anti-communism.
	   Still, no one denies his enormous impact during the Soviet era.
	   ``The influence of Solzhenitsyn on Russian literature and, in
general, on Russian history was enormous _ incomparable to any
other writer in this century,'' said Yegor Gaidar, a former prime
minister.
	   ``He is a great writer, public figure and fighter,'' said writer
Fazil Iskander. ``His greatest role was in fighting and exposing
the totalitarian (Soviet) regime. There was no equal to him.''
	   In a country where the average man doesn't live to 60,
Solzhenitsyn still appears vigorous and lucid at 80, although he
did suffer a mild heart attack two years ago.
	   Solzhenitsyn maintains Russia's past decade of change has
accomplished little aside from tearing down communism.
	   ``I see no changes for the better,'' he said in a rare speech
last year. ``We are doing everything to destroy Russia. We have no
market, no democracy _ a wild predatory capitalism is being built
here.''
	   Solzhenitsyn had already laid bare the country's gulag, or
prison camp system, and achieved international renown when he was
arrested by Soviet authorities and exiled in 1974. He settled in
rural Vermont and maintained monastic discipline, producing a
multi-volume saga of Russian history, ``The Red Wheel.''
	   It was less successful than his best-known works _ ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago'' _ his portrayals of life in Soviet forced-labor
camps, where he spent eight years for writing a letter criticizing
Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books still have meaning for Zoya Marchenko, 91,
who spent more than 20 years in labor camps.
	   ``It seems to me that he is now fulfilling his duty to the
dead,'' she said. ``He knows how many young and talented people
were killed. For me, at any rate, Solzhenitsyn is a symbol of
bravery, honesty and truth.''

	   The decision was taken by the Palestinian Central Council, a
124-member leadership body. In the vote, the 105 members present
were asked whether they approved an Arafat letter to Clinton in
which the offending PLO charter clauses are declared revoked.
	   Of those present, 81 voted for, seven voted against and seven
abstained, according to Salim Zanoun, the chairman of the Palestine
National Council.
	   This paved the way for Monday's gathering of the larger PNC,
that is to be attended by Clinton.
	   Under the Wye accord, the PNC and delegates of other Palestinian
groups are to reaffirm the Arafat letter on Monday, thus completing
the process of revoking the charter.
	   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority, said the PLO charter has been an anachronism for years.
	   The charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction ``have not
been valid since the day we signed'' the first peace agreement with
Israel in 1993.

London share prices lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices fell slightly on the London Stock
Exchange on Thursday, despite the Bank of England's announced cut
in the base lending interest rate from 6.75 percent to 6.25
percent.
	   The blue chip Financial-Times Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed at 5,660.3, down 8.8 points, or 0.15 percent.
	   The cut, the central bank's third key interest rate drop in as
many months, was an attempt to ward off the risks of recession and
deflation.
	   Traders said the move had been widely anticipated and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average's decline of more than 100 points in
opening trade pulled London shares down at the close.

	   The decision was taken by the Palestinian Central Council, a
124-member leadership body. In the vote, the 105 members present
were asked whether they approved an Arafat letter to Clinton that
declares revoked the offending PLO charter clauses.
	   Of those present, 81 voted for, seven voted against and seven
abstained, according to Salim Zanoun, the chairman of the Palestine
National Council.
	   This paved the way for Monday's gathering of the larger PNC,
which Clinton is to attend.

the process of revoking the charter.
	   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority, said the PLO charter has been an anachronism for years.

SAfrica launches action plan to celebrate Human Rights day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Thursday
launched a national action plan to promote and protect human rights
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
	   The plan mapped out the long road the country must yet travel in
overcoming the legacy of poverty after decades of oppression under
white minority rule, said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at a human
rights celebration in Johannesburg.
	   Justice Minister Dullah Omar also said refugees from all
countries _ especially those that helped the anti-apartheid
movement _ were entitled to human rights protection under U.N.
conventions.
	   Parliamentarians in neighboring Mozambique on Thursday pushed
for a declaration condemning South Africa's treatment of illegal
immigrants. South African immigration officials apprehend up to 600
illegal immigrants a week and return them via train to Mozambique.
	   Mbeki recalled that it had been 50 years since the beginning of
apartheid, a system of racial segregation that the ruling African
National Congress overthrew in democratic elections in 1994.
	   ``In our own country (in 1948) ... another form of barbarism
began to take root,'' said Mbeki in a speech in Johannesburg.
	   He said because of the anti-apartheid struggle, South Africa's
majority could celebrate human rights ``instead of the former
oppressors celebrating 50 years of apartheid rule.''
	   ``Our National Action Plan is also a sober reminder for all of
us of what still has to be done before all our people can enjoy,
fully, all the fundamental freedoms and human rights in our
Constitution and our Bill of Rights,'' Mbeki said.
	   South Africa on Thursday ratified several human rights
conventions addressing civil and political rights, the elimination
of all forms of racial or degrading treatment or punishment, and
the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.
	   South Africa was one of the few countries to have adopted a
national action plan at the government level, a United Nations
spokesman said.

French garment industry, under threat, promises higher quality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French garment industry, threatened by Italian
ready-to-wear manufacturers, is promising new measures aimed at
improving the quality of its clothes and better informing
consumers.
	   The French Garment Industries Guild and other fashion
associations say they will provide higher quality through stricter
quality control and better labeling _ including specific washing
instructions.
	   At a Paris news conference Wednesday, the head of the Garment
Industries Union, Philippe Adec, noted that France's reputation for
quality clothes may be an image rather than a reality, citing a
recent survey showing that only half of the French respondents
considered a ``Made in France'' label better than any other.
	   Underlying the promotional activity is a realization that
Italian ready-to-wear has pulled ahead of French labels in terms of
world prestige.
	   Italy has more flexible work rules and cheaper labor in the
garment industry, ``plus a tradition of high quality,'' said Adec.
	   To counter the trend, he said the industry needs to take a more
active role in educating consumers.
	   But he added that smaller manufacturers and labels in Italy are
not immune to the problems facing the French industry.
	   ``The big names like Gucci and Armani have huge profit margins
and live off their marketing campaigns, making it difficult for
smaller companies to compete in marketing and still maintain
quality,'' he said.
	   In the low-price range, Adec said that strict labor laws in
France, along with the new mandatory 35-hour week, will mean that
manufacturing is ``effectively finished in France,'' and will
likely move to Morocco, Tunisia and even Russia.
	   The garment industry representatives also said they want to
address French consumers' complaints over quality.
	   A survey of 1,000 French consumers by CTCOE, a textile-economic
survey firm, revealed that just over 50 percent are often
disappointed by the quality of the clothing.
	   The consumers cited shrinkage, non-colorfast fabrics, unraveling
hems, and lousy buttons and zippers.
	   French consumers do not usually complain, however, and they are
rarely allowed exchanges _ much less their money back.

	   In April 1996, the PNC held a vote on revoking the charter
clauses. Israel's dovish government at the time accepted the
outcome as satisfactory.
	   However, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power a
month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed their task
and demanded that the PNC be called together again.
	   Even though the Palestinians have agreed to the demand, the two
sides disagree over procedure for Monday's session.
	   Netanyahu said he will not settle for anything less than a vote
by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say the Wye agreement
only requires approval by acclamation.
	   The Israeli leader said Thursday that he would stick to his
position even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without
a vote. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with its
future,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Zanoun said no vote would be taken.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He said Thursday that he would not change his decision
unless the PNC took a vote and Arafat publicly dropped plans to
unilaterally declare a state in May.
	   Netanyahu also said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with
Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that Clinton's visit to the
region is fomenting unrest rather than calming the tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

Pre-Ramadan death toll rises to 200; 20 women kidnapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, raises monthly death toll to 200
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ In the bloodiest night of massacres in
nearly a year, Muslim militants killed 81 people in a western
mountain region, officials said Thursday, bringing to 200 the
number of people killed this month.
	   Residents recounted how the attackers slashed and mutilated
infants and killed or kidnapped women in a new wave of bloodshed
from a nearly 7-year-old insurgency.
	   Despite repeated claims by the government that the insurgency
was under control, the same murderous cycle as in previous years
has reappeared before the holy month of Ramadan that begins Dec.
20.
	   Armed groups overnight Tuesday descended on three mountain
villages near Tadjena, 170 kms (100 miles) southwest of Algiers.
	   The groups killed 24, 26 and 31 people in the villages along the
route between Tenes and Chlef, torturing, slashing and mutilating
their victims, hospital officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was the bloodiest night of massacres since militants killed
400 people in two Algiers suburbs in January, during Ramadan. It
also boosted the month's death toll from militant attacks and
bombings to 200.
	   A government statement on Wednesday had put the death toll at 45
from a single attack in the Tadjena area overnight Tuesday.
	   With hit lists of their victims, the militants attacked families
that have relatives in civil defense forces, witnesses said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Members of the Boumaza family, who declined to give their first
names, said attackers slashed the throats of children, cutting the
arms and legs off one of them and throwing the body in a boiling
pot.
	   More than 20 women were kidnapped, the hospital officials said.
Militants have kidnapped and raped women in the past before killing
them.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts Dec. 20 this
year, has seen an intensification of the insurgency. The trend
appeared to confirm itself this year, with the approach of Ramadan.
	   Meanwhile, authorities retrieved the remains of 16 people from a
well outside Algiers where militants dumped their victims, raising
the total found to 62, a civil defense official said on customary
anonymity.
	   Officials expected to find more remains in the 70-meter-deep
(230-foot-deep) well, with work crews having reached a depth of 47
meters (150 feet).
	   The well at the Hafiz farm is in the southern Algiers suburb of
Mefta, in an area now referred to as the ``Triangle of Death'' for
the widespread attacks there during the insurgency.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in seven years of violence in
this North African nation after the military-backed government
canceled January 1992 the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to
win.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The head of a European forensics
team accused Serb authorities of obstructing a probe into wartime
atrocities on Thursday after police blocked the experts from
reaching the graves of massacred civilians in central Kosovo.
	   The move by police, in armored vehicles, prevented a 19-member
Finnish team from beginning work at six sites in Kosovo containing
the bodies of victims of this year's conflict.
	   The standoff came on a day when hundreds of Serbs marched to a
rebel stronghold to protest the disappearance of civilians, and a
newly established international verification force inaugurated its
first regional center.
	   The Finnish team was scheduled to start digging into the
makeshift graves of 22 slaughtered ethnic Albanians at Gornje
Obrinje in the central Drenica region, a breakthrough in
investigative work into atrocities in this war-ravaged Serbian
province.
	   The massacre prompted worldwide outrage and stepped up
international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who agreed Oct. 12 to end the crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   Before the team could begin work Thursday, however, a Serb
police contingent _ consisting of four armored personnel carriers
and about two dozen policemen in flak jackets and carrying
automatic rifles _ stopped the convoy on the road between Pristina
and the site.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said Finnish team leader
Helena Ranta. Her team spent more than two hours at the roadblock
before turning back, and it was unclear when the team might try to
return.
	   The Serb police insisted on escorting the Finns to the
exhumations site to protect a Serb legal team accompanying them, a
condition rejected by the forensic team because the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which controls the surrounding territory, said the
police could not enter the area.
	   Rebel forces wearing black or camouflage uniforms were visible
in force along the surrounding dirt roads and the countryside.
	   The Finns had received permission from government authorities to
carry out the exhumations, including Gornje Obrinje where a frozen
hillside is believed to contain the mutilated bodies of men, women
and children from a single family.
	   Ranta said the Serb action also violated the diplomatic immunity
of the Finnish ambassador for human rights. She said a Serb
policeman grabbed a camera from a Finnish TV cameraman in the
ambassador's convoy and took out a film.
	   Two hours of subsequent talks with Serbian Justice Minister
Dragoljub Jankovic back in Pristina did not immediately resolve the
problem, she said later Thursday, without elaborating.
	   The September killings in a forest near Gornje Obrinje, 40
kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina, were among the most
gruesome during the Serb forces' seven-month offensive against
separatists in Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo's southwest, several hundred Serbs held a protest
march Thursday to a rebel stronghold to call attention to the
disappearance of about 200 Serbs during the conflict _ many
believed abducted by the rebels.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' about half the 400 marchers completed the
20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from Orahovac to the KLA stronghold of
Dragobilje.
	   Orahovac Mayor Andeljko Kolasinac held a cordial but
unproductive meeting with an ethnic Albanian representative that
was mediated by British and American peace verifiers. The Albanian,
Lulzim Paqarizi, who blamed the violence on the Serbian regime and
said more than 1,500 Kosovo Albanians also are missing or believed
kidnapped.
	   ``You have come to the wrong address,'' Paqarizi said. ``Our
forces have never attacked Serb civilians.''
	   The march organizer told reporters the ``peace march'' was a
symbol of solidarity for the families of the missing.
	   About 500 unarmed international verifiers are now working in
Kosovo as part of a force expected to reach 2,000 by the end of
January.
	   The Kosovo Verification Mission, created under the October peace
agreement, inaugurated its first regional center Thursday in the
town of Prizren, adding 60 new personnel to diplomatic observers
already in place.
	   ``We can now say that KVM has got people on the ground and is
operational,'' said spokesman Duncan Bullivant of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which operates the mission.
``Today marks a major step forward in the whole KVM operation.''

	   ``You have come to the wrong address,'' Paqarizi said. ``Our
forces have never attacked Serb civilians.''
	   The march organizer told reporters the ``peace march'' was a
symbol of solidarity for the families of the missing.
	   About 500 unarmed international verifiers are now working in
Kosovo as part of a force expected to reach 2,000 by the end of
January.
	   The Kosovo Verification Mission, created under the October peace
agreement, inaugurated its first regional center Thursday in the
town of Prizren, adding 60 new personnel to diplomatic observers
already in place.
	   ``We can now say that KVM has got people on the ground and is
operational,'' said spokesman Duncan Bullivant of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which operates the mission.
``Today marks a major step forward in the whole KVM operation.''

	   In April 1996, the PNC held a vote on revoking the charter
clauses. Israel's dovish government at the time accepted the
outcome as satisfactory.
	   However, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power a
month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed their task
and demanded that the PNC be called together again.
	   Even though the Palestinians have agreed to the demand, the two
sides disagree over procedure for Monday's session.
	   Netanyahu said he will not settle for anything less than a vote
by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say the Wye agreement
only requires approval by acclamation.
	   The Israeli leader said Thursday that he would stick to his
position even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without
a vote. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with its
future,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Zanoun said no vote would be taken.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He said Thursday that he would not change his decision
unless the PNC took a vote and Arafat publicly dropped plans to
unilaterally declare a state in May.
	   Netanyahu also said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with
Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that Clinton's visit to the
region is fomenting unrest rather than calming the tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

European Union considers new homes for ambassadors to Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The European Union may look for new homes
for its ambassadors to Belarus, who were evicted by the government
from their former residences, according to an agreement released
Thursday.
	   The agreement, signed by the EU and Belarus on Wednesday, calls
for EU nations to start looking for new homes for their
ambassadors, and for Belarus to pay as-yet-undetermined sums in
compensation to the embassies.
	   Earlier this year, President Alexander Lukashenko's government
said it needed to repair the plumbing and sewage system in the
Drozdy diplomatic compound on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk,
and the ambassadors had to move.
	   The United States and several European countries recalled their
ambassadors to protest the move. They said it violated the Vienna
convention, which states that ambassadors' residences, like embassy
buildings, are considered the territory of their nations.
	   The Belarusian government had no right to evict them for any
reason, ambassadors said.
	   In the agreement, the Belarusian government promised to allow
embassy staff limited access to the ambassadors' former homes as
they prepare to ``vacate'' them _ but requires the embassies to
notify the Belarusian government at least 24 hours in advance about
such visits.
	   ``It is a good-will gesture on the part of Belarus and European
Union,'' said Belarus' Foreign Minister Ural Latypov. ``We hope
very much that the ambassadors of European countries return here as
soon as possible.''
	   Belarus is still holding talks with the United States on the
dispute but no agreement has been reached, Latypov said.
	   The European Union and nearly a dozen other countries imposed
travel restrictions on Belarusian officials over the dispute, which
has only heightened tensions between Belarus and the West, long
critical of Lukashenko's authoritarian policies.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization is set to miss its
mid-December target of choosing a new leader to guide it into the
next century because of indecision by the United States and
European Union.
	   Amid growing frustration, diplomats charged with trying to forge
a consensus among WTO members said Thursday they had made no
progress in narrowing down the list of four candidates.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub are widely regarded as the
front-runners, ahead of former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren
and former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore.
	   But the European Union remains internally divided over its
choice and the United States has not yet declared its position.
Japan and other Asian countries are backing Supachai. Abouyoub is
expected to pick up support from developing countries.
	   There is only a limited possibility that all members of the
organization will declare their positions by Dec. 18, said
ambassadors Celso Lafer and William Rossier.
	   Renato Ruggiero, the current incumbent, wants to step down in
April. The WTO had set itself a mid-December deadline to make the
final choice.
	   Lafer, from Brazil, and Rossier, from Switzerland, are charged
with trying to mold a consensus among the 132 WTO members. So far
about 90 countries have indicated their preferences.
	   ``It's one thing to have problems to reach agreement on one
candidate. But it's quite a different matter not to be able to work
toward such a decision because certain members haven't let us know
their choice,'' the diplomats said, in veiled reference to
Washington and Brussels.
	   ``The current state of flux can't be maintained for much
longer,'' they said in a report to the WTO council.
	   There will be another meeting Dec. 18 to try to move the process
forward.
	   But with Washington distracted by the impeachment debate and the
EU focusing on its looming monetary union, it is uncertain whether
that will make any progress.
	   At Thursday's session, many trade diplomats voiced their
unhappiness that the United States and European Union were holding
up the selection process.
	   Egypt proposed moving to a vote, but this would go against WTO
traditions that everything must be decided by consensus.
	   The indecision comes at a time when the WTO and the open trade
system it champions is under pressure as a result of the global
economic crisis. There have been calls, especially in Asia, for
some form of protection to curb excesses of the free market.
	   The WTO is struggling to come up with a trade agenda for the
turn of the century, amid big differences between rich and poor
countries over environmental and labor issues.
	   All four candidates say they want to speed long-running
accession talks and bring China and Russia into the international
trading order as quickly as possible.
	   The silence of the United States and European Union is in
contrast to their unseemly public fight in the last leadership
contest, when the EU pushed Ruggiero and the United States wanted
former Mexican President Salinas de Gortari.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 26-29 with Thursday's inspections. &QL;

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party
declared Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a
party office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told a news conference on the
steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under
U.N. resolutions to search any site without conditions. The United
States has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he
said Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt building behind
black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are outside, but
a party emblem sits above the door, and a large portrait of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stands near the main entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also said the site was
insignificant and downplayed the importance of the incident.
	   ``There are few things to be solved, but that's all,'' he said.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday
that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.''
	   But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot
accept to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission
continuing to flood us with lies and secondary details which do not
accomplish the awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.''
	   ``They want sanctions to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted
as saying by the Iraqi news agency.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as teams of experts that have arrived in past weeks. All
together, they number a little less than 200.
	   ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their normal
activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman.
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.''
	   Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine.
	   ``There is no reason why we should stop,'' she said.
	   She declined to say whether U.N. teams would try to re-enter the
contentious Baath Party site.
	   The Iraqi news agency said eight teams made surprise visits to
12 sites Thursday. It said a team headed by Australian Roger Hill
visited a site related to the national security and a residential
home.
	   ``A woman and her children looked bewildered as two women
inspectors entered their home,'' the agency quoted Gen. Hussam
Amin, head of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, as saying.
	   ``This behavior will always be a shame on the Special Commission
and those who lead it,'' he added.
	   He said a biological team, headed by Briton David Kelly and
seven inspectors, arrived in Iraq Thursday replacing another team
which left after ending their duties.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

Libyan leader urges OPEC to stop production in winter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called on
OPEC countries to completely halt production during the winter
season to boost record-low prices, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   ``It is illogical that the prices of commodities we buy as
consumers double at the time oil prices continuously go down.''
MENA quoted Gadhafi as saying in a letter sent to the members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   The agency gave no other details.
	   Oil prices have reached record-low due to a glut in the market
and depressed demand in recession-hit Asia and a warm winter in the
West.

Captain Jack gives U.S. team added incentive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Ask the International team why this
Presidents Cup is so much more meaningful than the first two and
the answer lies within the rugged terrain of Royal Melbourne,
thousands of miles from the American shore.
	   Ask the Americans why these matches are special and they simply
point to their captain.
	   Seven players on the U.S. team weren't even born when Jack
Nicklaus won the first of his 18 major championships, but all 12 of
them grew up watching him set a standard against which golf might
forever be measured.
	   ``There is a presence that Jack Nicklaus carries. There is a
charisma about him,'' said Phil Mickelson. ``A certain relationship
develops between the players and the captain that wasn't there
before. And that relationship is exciting for me and the other
players because we are sharing that with the greatest player of all
time.''
	   That much was clear during the opening ceremonies Thursday
morning, about 16 hours before the first ball was struck in the
opening round of alternate-shot matches.
	   The U.S. team quickly rose to their feet when their captain was
introduced, and Peter Thomson urged his International team to
follow suit. Before long, all of the 5,000 people who braved
searing temperatures and the playing of eight national anthems
joined them for a long, loud standing ovation.
	   ``This is quite an event,'' Nicklaus said, his voice cracking
slightly.
	   Nicklaus has seen both sides of the Ryder Cup. He produced one
of the greatest gestures of sportsmanship in golf in 1969 when he
conceded a 2-foot putt to Tony Jacklin, which resulted in a tie of
their matches and the cup. And he was captain of the first U.S.
Ryder Cup team to lose on American soil, in 1987 at his own
Muirfield Village.
	   It was that Ryder Cup that turned the matches into a rivalry so
fierce that players have been known to cry on the beach after
losing a match _ Mark O'Meara said recently he felt more pressure

Masters.
	   Nicklaus has never been one to back away from competition, but
he doesn't
	   want the Presidents Cup to turn into a war.
	   ``I'm probably not the world's greatest captain, simply because
I think the competition is an international goodwill event,'' he
said. ``They should be honored to represent their country and it
should be fun. They should have a good time.

themselves,'' he said. ``But I'll try to make it as little as

Palestinians vote to scrap document seeking Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Keeping a promise to Israel and the
United States, a group of senior Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat
voted overwhelmingly Thursday to declare clauses of the PLO charter
calling for Israel's destruction null and void.
	   The vote was an interim step ahead of Monday's session of the
Palestine National Council which is to reaffirm the move in the
presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The decision was taken by the Palestinian Central Council, a
124-member leadership body. In the vote, the 105 members present
were asked whether they approved an Arafat letter to Clinton that
declares revoked the offending PLO charter clauses.
	   Of those present, 81 voted for, seven voted against and seven
abstained, according to Salim Zanoun, the chairman of the Palestine
National Council.
	   This paved the way for Monday's gathering of the larger PNC,
which Clinton is to attend.
	   In April 1996, the PNC held a vote on revoking the charter
clauses. Israel's dovish government at the time accepted the
outcome as satisfactory.
	   However, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power a
month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed their task
and demanded that the PNC be called together again.
	   Even though the Palestinians have agreed to the demand, the two
sides disagree over procedure for Monday's session.
	   Netanyahu said he will not settle for anything less than a vote
by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say the Wye agreement
only requires approval by acclamation.
	   The Israeli leader said Thursday that he would stick to his
position even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without
a vote. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with its
future,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Zanoun said no vote would be taken.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He said Thursday that he would not change his decision
unless the PNC took a vote and Arafat publicly dropped plans to
unilaterally declare a state in May.
	   Netanyahu also said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with
Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   In heavy rain, several dozen Palestinians broke away from the
procession and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas,
but the confrontation ended after half an hour.
	   The recent violence raised concern that Clinton's visit to the
region is fomenting unrest rather than calming the tense situation.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Share prices fell slightly on the London Stock
Exchange on Thursday, despite the Bank of England's announced cut
in the base lending interest rate from 6.75 percent to 6.25
percent.
	   The blue chip Financial-Times Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed at 5,660.3, down 8.8 points, or 0.15 percent.
	   Provisional volume was 933.9 million shares, compared with 824
million on Wednesday.
	   The cut, the central bank's third key interest rate drop in as
many months, was an attempt to ward off the risks of recession and
deflation.
	   Traders said the move had been widely anticipated and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average's decline of more than 100 points in
opening trade pulled London shares down at the close.

Killing of Real Sociedad fan to be remembered at weekend matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Stands as 1st Ld-Writethru to some lines to edit. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Hoping to call attention to violence
surrounding soccer, Spanish stadiums will fall silent this weekend,
if only for a moment, to honor a Real Sociedad fan stabbed to death
outside Vicente Calderon before a UEFA Cup match on Tuesday.
	   Aitor Zabaleta, 28, died from stab wounds allegedly inflicted by
a rival fan before Atletico beat Real Sociedad 4-1 to reach the
quarterfinals.
	   ``No genuine supporter of Atletico is happy today... qualifying
for the UEFA Cup quarterfinals matters little when there is a death
involved,'' a statement issued Thursday by Atletico's main
supporters' organization said.
	   Pime Minister Jose Maria Aznar joined fans, players and
officials in condemning the killing of Zabaleta and demanded a
greater effort to avoid soccer violence.
	   A minute's silence will be held in all Spanish stadiums to
remember the tragedy, while players from Real Sociedad and Real
Madrid will unfurl a banner protesting soccer violence. prior to
the match when they face each other Sunday.
	   ``There is a point when people no longer go to games to enjoy
themselves but rather to let loose adrenaline built up in their
personal lives, and I don't think soccer should be used for that,''
Madrid's Italian midfielder Christian Panucci said, adding that the
increase in violence has made anxious about taking his own son to
matches.
	   On the field, Real Madrid is six points behind league leader
Mallorca and needs a victory to restore its domestic reputation.
	   After advancing to the quarterfinals of the European Champions
League and winning the Toyota Cup, the white-clad team has yet to
make its mark at home this season.
	   Madrid's traditional rival Barcelona is in a more dire
situation. The Catalan powerhouse is in deep trouble having been
eliminated from the European Champions Cup and sitting in eighth
place with 19 points, same as Real but behind on goal difference.
	   The howls of derision have calmed somewhat with Wednesday's 1-0
victory over Danish side Brondby in its final Champions League
match. However, Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal still faces Sunday's
match at home against Villarreal.
	   In other games, Mallorca also plays Sunday against Zaragoza with
Deportivo la Coruna only two points back in second place and
confident it can take over the lead coming off its late victory
last week against Barcelona.
	   To ascend to the top of the standings, Deportivo must defeat
Athletico Bilbao on Sunday.
	   In other games Sunday, Celta, a previously little-known team
based in the northwestern port city of Vigo, tries to regain the
momentum that saw it climb to the top of the table only weeks ago.
Having already eliminated English legend Liverpool and Premier
League leader Aston Villa from the UEFa Cup, Celta has a seemingly
easy task against lightly regarded Espanyol.
	   In Saturday's only match, Atletico Madrid will travel south to
Seville to meet Betis.
	   Yugoslav striker Vladimir Jugovic is out of the match due to a
torn muscle that could keep him out for one month.
	   Club favorite Francisco ``Kiko'' Narvaez is also doubtful.
	   The remaining matches are scheduled for Sunday. Valencia
welcomes struggling Salamanca, Valladolid hosts Alaves, Racing
Santander takes on Tenerife and last-placed Extremadura hosts
Oviedo.

Strike's end in sight after most conductors agree to return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking train conductors across most of France
agreed Thursday to return to work, signaling the end to a walkout
that has snarled rail traffic for two weeks.
	   Out of 17 regions still striking, workers in 12 will return to
work Friday, according to the SNCF national rail authority. Train
workers in Bordeaux and in the alpine Chambery region voted to
continue the strike, while a remaining three regions had not yet
decided late Thursday.
	   Traffic on Friday was expected to be back to normal in most of
France, the SNCF said. Most high-speed trains were seen running on
schedule, with only regional traffic disruptions expected.
	   Train workers, who had asked for an additional 600 employees,
were returning to work because they are largely satisfied with the
government's response, union officials said.
	   ``The strike allowed us to have an effect on the question of
jobs and the (SNCF) budget for 1999,'' said Patrick Chameret, head
of the rail federation at the Communist-backed General Workers'
Confederation.
	   In addition, union officials applauded a 200-franc (dlrs 36)
increase in a monthly bonus for conductors, boosting the amount to
1,400 francs (dlrs 250) a month for 1999.
	   Louis Gallois, head of the SNCF, has promised to increase
employee numbers in 1999, but has declined to provide figures.

Libyan leader urges OPEC to stop production in winter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called on
OPEC countries to completely halt production during the winter
season to boost record-low prices, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported on Thursday.
	   ``It is illogical that the prices of commodities we buy as
consumers double at the time oil prices continuously go down.''
MENA quoted Gadhafi as saying in a letter sent to the members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   The agency gave no other details.
	   Oil prices have reached record-low due to a glut in the market
and depressed demand in recession-hit Asia and a warm winter in the
West.

German parliament passes controversial health care reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament passed a controversial reform of
the national health care system late Thursday despite sharp
criticism from doctors, who fear the cuts will hurt them in the
pocketbook.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's left-leaning government argued
the cuts, expected to total up to 4 billion marks (dlrs 2.4
billion) next year, are needed to avoid an increase in already high
contributions to the national health insurance system.
	   The reforms include limiting annual increases in doctors fees
starting Jan. 1 to average raises in other fields, and cutting
payments for prescription medicine, which have been rapidly rising.
	   The government argued the law also helps patients by lowering
deductibles on prescription drugs.
	   But thousands of doctors took to the streets this week to
protest the fee caps.
	   German medical association president Karsten Vilmar told German
radio the reforms would lead to health care rationing and more
patient deaths _ a charge Health Minister Andrea Fischer called
``sheer impudence.''

High Winds Jedi wins desert endurance race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new placing for third place in grafs 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ American star Valerie
Kanavy on High Winds Jedi regained the title of World Endurance
Champion Thursday after the defending champion, her daughter
Danielle, retired after her horse took a tumble in the Dubai
desert.
	   The younger Kanavy, who won the title on Peirez four years ago
in Kansas, dropped out after her 16-year-old grey gelding, Peirez,
took a tumble 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the first veterinary
checkpoint in the dlrs 300,000 race.
	   No fewer than 174 riders set off at the crack of dawn at the Abu
Dhabi town of Ghantoot and endured high temperatures as they
steered their mounts along the 160-kilometer (99-mile) course.
	   ``I am delighted to regain the world title, which also makes up
a bit for the disappointments of my daughter on our favorite horse,
Peirez,'' said Valerie Kanavy, 52, after cantering home in front of
a huge crowd of sheiks and fans at Seyh Al Salam arena.
	   ``The biggest problem I had was with the high temperatures which
made me suffer. But my horse is wonderful,' Valerie said.
	   Valerie and Danielle Kanavy have both won the world championship
on Peirez before.
	   Danielle, 27, was more worried about the condition of her
beloved Peirez than her withdrawal.
	   ``Peirez took a tumble about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from the
first vet gate and though he looked okay, we decided not to risk
him,'' she said.
	   Her mother's win maintains the American hold on the championship
since the first competition in 1986.
	   Fausto Fioricci, a medical doctor from Italy, surprised the
strong field by taking second place on Faris Jabar, another grey
gelding. He finished about 50 meters (165 feet) behind Kanavy.
	   Japan's Daisuke Yasunaga, who trained for the race in Australia,
finished third, but he was eliminated after the finish because his
horse failed a vet check.
	   Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum's Ratzia D'Alauze, from the
Emirates, was elevated to third place in place of Daisuke Yasunaga.
	   No official timings were released by the organizers. A computer
failure during the race caused confusion as the riders were left
without waiting periods for the next stages.
	   The Emirates took fourth and fifth places through Mohammed Ali
Al Shaffar, on Abrock Theodore, and Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al
Maktoum, who rode Ratzia D'Alauze.
	   Dubai's Crown Prince, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, saw
his hopes disappear when his horse, Nelson I, was eliminated by the
veterinarians after failing an examination at the fourth check
point.
	   The sheik's eldest son, Sheik Rashid bin Mohammed, also had to
retire.

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee on
Thursday unanimously approved the revamped Champions League and
UEFA Cup to start next summer, a key official of the European
soccer body said.
	   ``The financial distribution has still to be fine tuned but the
basic principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary Gerhart
Aigner told reporters.
	   These would be finalized in the next two to three months, he
said.
	   The competitions were restructured to counter the threat of the
breakaway ``Super League and ratification means this current season
will be the last for the European Cup Winners Cup, which has been
contested annually since 1961.
	   ``We will make a fine tuning, but we are very confident that
next season ... we will start with the new competition,'' Tognoni
said. ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved by the Executive Committee.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by the
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would boost annual revenues for Europe's
leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the leading
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players who joined the Super League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European club competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised
revenues, UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups would
advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second round before the
quarterfinal stage.
	   Third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering that competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it will replace.

Palestinians vote to scrap document seeking Israel's destruction

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A group of senior Palestinians led
by Yasser Arafat voted overwhelmingly Thursday to declare clauses
of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void _
but continued to reject Israel's demand to bring the matter to a
vote before a larger body.
	   The vote was an interim step ahead of Monday's session of the
Palestine National Council which is to reaffirm the move in the
presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In announcing Thursday's decision by the Palestine Central
Council, a 124-member leadership body, Selim Zanoun said the matter
would not come to a vote before the PNC. Instead, the PNC session
would convene only to affirm the speeches by Clinton and Arafat.
	   The meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' Zanoun
said. It was not clear how the affirmation would manifest itself.
	   In Thursday's vote, the 105 members present were asked whether
they approved an Arafat letter to Clinton in which the offending
PLO charter clauses are declared revoked.
	   Of those present, 81 voted for, seven voted against and seven
abstained, according to Salim Zanoun, the chairman of the Palestine
National Council.
	   Under the Wye accord, the PNC and delegates of other Palestinian
groups were to reaffirm the Arafat letter on Monday, thus
completing the process of revoking the charter.
	   Israel continued to insist on a vote.
	   ``We expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote
in an unequivocal matter... if there is to be further
implementation,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In April 1996, the PNC held a vote on revoking the charter
clauses. Israel's dovish government at the time accepted the
outcome as satisfactory.
	   However, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power a
month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed their task
and demanded that the PNC be called together again.
	   Even though the Palestinians have agreed to the demand, the two
sides disagree over procedure for Monday's session.
	   The Israeli leader said Thursday that he would stick to his
position even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without
a vote. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with its
future,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Deputy State Department spokesman James Foley was avasive on
whether the Clinton administration wanted a vote.
	   ``The procedures need to be ckear enough that nullification has
taken place,'' he said in Washington.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He said Thursday that he would not change his decision
unless the PNC took a vote and Arafat publicly dropped plans to
unilaterally declare a state in May.
	   Netanyahu also said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with
Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

Guatemalan judge who sentenced Swiss men dismissed for harassment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A judge who ordered three Swiss men,
including a former Nestle executive, to prison on drug charges has
been removed from the bench for sexually harassing the men's
lawyer, the Guatemalan Supreme Court said Thursday.
	   Defense lawyer Lea Marie de Leon accused Judge Herberto Zapata,
of sexually harassing her and threatening to kill her one week
before her clients were sentenced.
	   A court investigation found that Zapata and Leon had gone
together to a restaurant in Puerto Barrios, 160 miles (260 kms)
northeast of Guatemala City, on Sept. 17. They returned to de
Leon's hotel, where the judge tried to force his way into her room.
	   De Leon said the court's decision was ``a precedent for other
colleagues and women, particularly victims of this type of
offense.''
	   Zapata said he was innocent and called his dismissal ``unjust.''
He said he would appeal.
	   The court made no comment about whether the dismissal would
affect the cases of the Swiss men, who have appealed their
sentences.
	   On Sept. 24, Zapata ordered former Nestle executive Andreas
Heanggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison and a fine of dlrs
77,000, for his role in a case known as the ``German Connection,''
which involved dlrs 100 million shipments of cocaine sent from
Guatemala to Europe, hidden in containers and ornamental plants.
	   His son, Nicholas Heanggi Chalandrian, 22, was sentenced to 20
years and fined dlrs 155,000, as was Swiss citizen Silvio
Giovanoli, 30.
	   The Swiss Foreign Ministry had criticized the sentences as
``extremely hard and disproportionate.''
	   Two other men also were sentenced in the case: German hotel
manager Joachin Frank Schilling, 52, was ordered to serve five
years and pay dlrs 15,000; a former Guatemalan police commander,
Jose Luis Zebadua Salazar, 35, was sentenced to 12 years and a dlrs
77,000 fine for having protected the shipments.

UEFA gives final approval to new Champions League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, FIXES format of Champions League second round. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ After months of discussion, UEFA's
executive committee Thursday unanimously approved the structure for
a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup to start next summer.
	   ``The financial distribution has still to be fine tuned but the
basic principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary Gerhard
Aigner told reporters.
	   These would be finalized in the next two to three months, he
said.
	   The move _ which was drawn up to counter a breakaway Super
League _ means the end of the Cup Winners Cup competition after the
current season.
	   ``We are very confident that next season ... we will start with
the new competition,'' said Guido Tognoni, head of national teams
competitions.
	   ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top soccer clubs had already endorsed plans for a new
32-team Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup to merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions had to be approved by the executive committee.
	   It is hoped the Champions League will generate some 800 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million), around three-quarters of the
proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot,
UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which promised
increased revenue for top clubs through pay-per-view TV rights.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the top
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players opting into the League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European soccer competitions.
	   Under the new format the Champions League will be expanded from
24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   Assured of places in the first stage are the league champions
and runners-up from Italy, Germany, Spain, England, France and the
Netherlands, as well as the title holder.
	   The champions of Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic are
also guaranteed a berth. Other teams will have to go through at
least one of three qualifying phases.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups advance to a
second round with teams playing in four groups of four, followed by
knockout quarterfinals.
	   Teams that finish third in the first phase will get another
chance in the UEFA Cup, entering the competition in its third
round.
	   The UEFA Cup will start with 96 teams, the same number as the
two competitions it replaces.
	   ``We are still working in the task force, but there is no
crucial question on which we feel the clubs must give their
opinion,'' Aigner said.

Army kills nine militants in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ India's army killed nine Muslim militants
close to its disputed border with Pakistan in two gunbattles that
were part of its new ``winter offensive,'' a spokesman said
Thursday.
	   Five militants said to belong to the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen
guerrilla outfit were killed Thursday in the Rajouri region in the
northern Jammu-Kashmir state, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of
the state's winter capital Jammu, the spokesman said. He spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Four militants were killed in another gunbattle in the same area
on Wednesday night, the spokesman said.
	   Army columns have fanned out in the thickly forested mountainous
area in the winter offensive, an attempt to stop alleged intrusion
of militants from Pakistan into India which India says is stepped
up in the winters.
	   India accuses Islamabad of arming and funding the nine-year-old
rebellion by nearly a dozen guerrilla groups for independence or a
merger with Pakistan.
	   The frontier region of Kashmir is divided between the two
nations. India controls two-thirds of its territory, and Pakistan
the rest.
	   Both claim the whole territory, over which they have fought two
wars in the last 50 years.

deputy defense minister since 1997. Before that, he worked in the
Interior Ministry. An army veteran, he was also a policeman earlier

	   Armenia, a former Soviet republic in the Caucasus Mountains, has
seen a sharp increase in crime in recent years.

Belgrade court again punishes independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In an ongoing purge of Serbia's
independent media, a Belgrade court fined an independent daily and
its chief editor the equivalent of dlrs 45,000 Thursday for
allegedly libeling a top official.
	   This was the second hefty fine slapped against Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraph) since October when a restrictive media law, which
effectively banned criticism of state officials and their policies,
was adopted in Serbia.
	   On Nov. 9, the popular daily was fined the equivalent of dlrs
120,000. Later, its property was impounded and it had to move to
Montenegro, the small republic which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia,
to resume publishing.
	   Early Thursday, the court acted on charges filed by Milovan
Bojic, the deputy Serbian prime minister and a leading
neo-communist official, who said the Dnevni Telegraf newspaper

	   During brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers
unsuccessfully tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be
implemented for newspapers that are published in Montenegro.
	   Its chief editor Dragan Novakovic said he won't pay the fine and
that authorities won't be able to impound his property as they did

bitterly criticized by Western powers.

Delta Airlines Boeing aborts takeoff because of plane on runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Delta Airlines Boeing 767 had to
abort a takeoff from Schiphol airport Thursday because a KLM Boeing
747 was being towed across the runway.
	   Nobody was injured in the incident and the Delta plane was able
to take off for Atlanta, Ga. a few hours later. Aviation
authorities immediately launched an investigation into the
incident.
	   The Delta plane's pilot, who had been cleared for takeoff by air
traffic controllers, was able to stop well ahead of the KLM jet,
according to a press release issued by Air Traffic Control
Netherlands. The release did not give more precise details of the
incident, which happened Thursday morning.
	   The number of passengers and crew aboard the Atlanta-bound plane
were not immediately available. The KLM plane had one crew member
aboard.
	   The incident happened in misty conditions at the busy airport on
the outskirts of the Dutch capital. Staff in Schiphol's air traffic
control tower were unable to see the spot where the incident
happened but were using ground radar to monitor the runways,
according to Air Traffic Control Netherlands. No more details were
immediately available.

Palestinians vote to scrap document seeking Israel's destruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to show no further vote planned; ADDS fresh
Israeli, U.S. comment. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A group of senior Palestinians led
by Yasser Arafat voted overwhelmingly Thursday to declare clauses
of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction null and void _
but continued to reject Israel's demand to bring the matter to a
vote before a larger body.
	   The vote was an interim step ahead of Monday's session of the
Palestine National Council, which is to reaffirm the move in the
presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton as an important symbolic
step in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
	   In announcing Thursday's decision by the Palestine Central
Council, a 124-member leadership body, Selim Zanoun said the matter
would not come to a vote before the PNC, as Israel has demanded.
Instead, the PNC session is to convene only to affirm the speeches
by Clinton and Arafat.
	   The meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' Zanoun
said. It was not clear how the affirmation would be demonstrated.
	   In Thursday's vote, the 105 members present were asked whether
they approved an Arafat letter to Clinton in which the offending
PLO charter clauses are declared revoked.
	   Of those present, 81 voted for, seven voted against and seven
abstained, according to Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestine
National Council.
	   Under the Wye accord, the PNC and delegates of other Palestinian
groups were to reaffirm the Arafat letter on Monday, thus
completing the process of revoking the charter.
	   Israel continued to insist on a vote.
	   ``We expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote
in an unequivocal matter... if there is to be further
implementation,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In April 1996, the PNC held a vote on revoking the charter
clauses. Israel's dovish government at the time accepted the
outcome as satisfactory.
	   However, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power a
month later, he said the Palestinians had not completed their task
and demanded that the PNC be called together again.
	   Even though the Palestinians have agreed to the demand, the two
sides disagree over procedure for Monday's session.
	   The Israeli leader said Thursday that he would stick to his
position even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without
a vote. ``It is Israel which determines issues connected with its
future,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Deputy State Department spokesman James Foley was evasive on
whether the Clinton administration wanted a vote.
	   ``The procedures need to be clear enough that nullification has
taken place,'' he said in Washington.
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what
he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace
accord. He said Thursday that he would not change his decision
unless the PNC took a vote and Arafat publicly dropped plans to
unilaterally declare a state in May.
	   Netanyahu also said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with
Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Solzhenitsyn celebrates his 80th
birthday Friday, his influence waning but his grumpy voice still
railing against Russian leaders he denounces as foolish and
corrupt.
	   With his long gray beard and severe countenance, Solzhenitsyn
cultivates the image of a 19th-century sage. His place in history
is assured by his monumental works chronicling the atrocities of
Soviet-era prison camp life.
	   But today he is largely ignored in Russia, where many regard him
as a cranky old man whose words have little relevance amid the
country's current turmoil.
	   ``He played a great role in history, but not in literature,
because he has no followers in literature,'' said Russian writer
Vladimir Voinovich. ``His role is more historical now.''
	   Since returning to Russia in 1994 after 20 years in exile,
Solzhenitsyn and his wife Natalya have maintained a reclusive
existence on the outskirts of Moscow.
	   However, his birthday has brought a temporary surge of public
attention.
	   He visited the Swedish Embassy on Thursday evening, where he and
other Nobel laureates were feted. And Friday, he planned to attend
a play, ``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The
First Circle.''
	   His most recent book, ``Russia in Collapse,'' was published this
summer with an initial run of just 5,000. It sold better than
expected, and another 5,000 copies were ordered.
	   In his recent writings and speeches, Solzhenitsyn has bemoaned
Russia's disintegration and condemned the country's post-Soviet
leaders as no better than the communist rulers he so reviled.
	   ``The system of central power ... is just as uncontrollable,
lacking any public responsibility and immune from punishment as the
communist power was,'' he wrote in 1996. ``As much as we wish to,
it cannot be called democracy.''
	   In modern Russia, serious writers have lost the elevated status
they had in communist times, and Solzhenitsy has lamented that his
compatriots no longer read his work in large numbers.
	   His conservative and nationalist views have come under fire from
liberals, and he's also despised by hard-liners for his militant
anti-communism.
	   Still, no one denies his enormous impact during the Soviet era.
	   ``The influence of Solzhenitsyn on Russian literature and, in
general, on Russian history was enormous _ incomparable to any
other writer in this century,'' said Yegor Gaidar, a former prime
minister.
	   ``He is a great writer, public figure and fighter,'' said writer
Fazil Iskander. ``His greatest role was in fighting and exposing
the totalitarian (Soviet) regime. There was no equal to him.''
	   In a country where the average man doesn't live to 60,
Solzhenitsyn still appears vigorous and lucid at 80, although he
did suffer a mild heart attack two years ago.
	   Solzhenitsyn maintains Russia's past decade of change has
accomplished little aside from tearing down communism.
	   ``I see no changes for the better,'' he said in a rare speech
last year. ``We are doing everything to destroy Russia. We have no
market, no democracy _ a wild predatory capitalism is being built
here.''
	   Solzhenitsyn had already laid bare the country's gulag, or
prison camp system, and achieved international renown when he was
arrested by Soviet authorities and exiled in 1974. He settled in
rural Vermont and maintained monastic discipline, producing a
multi-volume saga of Russian history, ``The Red Wheel.''
	   It was less successful than his best-known works _ ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the three-volume ``The Gulag
Archipelago'' _ his portrayals of life in Soviet forced-labor
camps, where he spent eight years for writing a letter criticizing
Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books still have meaning for Zoya Marchenko, 91,
who spent more than 20 years in labor camps.
	   ``It seems to me that he is now fulfilling his duty to the
dead,'' she said. ``He knows how many young and talented people
were killed. For me, at any rate, Solzhenitsyn is a symbol of
bravery, honesty and truth.''

EU leaders unlikely to heal budget rift at 2-day summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes and details throughout. Trims.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders open a two-day
summit Friday at which they will recommit to letting a dozen
countries into the EU. But on the summit's eve, it was unlikely
they'll agree on how to fund their biggest expansion ever.
	   Ahead of the summit, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar were at odds over the EU's
future financing. Schroeder said Germans were tiring of being the
EU paymaster and Aznar, seeing EU aid for poorer EU members going
eastward, insisted on raising EU membership fees.
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he will ask the leaders to
inject urgency into the finance debate so a budget deal can be
agreed in March.
	   ``I hope we can come to an agreement'' Aznar told reporters.
``But I don't agree with (keeping national contributions) at 1.27
percent of GNP or freezing spending.''
	   The EU opened membership negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary
talks with nations judged less-ready: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is expected to join them.
	   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, among others, want to
bring Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first group. Germany
and France oppose that.
	   The leaders will meet in a historic setting: the cavernous
Redoutensaal of the Hofburg Palace where Europe's aristocratic
leaders of 1815 redrew their continent's map and danced away the
memories of Napoleon's wars.
	   In its 20th century version of building a better Europe, the EU
refuses to set entry dates in order to keep candidates working
apace on their economic and political reforms to meet EU membership
requirements.
	   Turkey, too, continues to trouble the West Europeans. They have
ruled it out as an immediate candidate. Ankara has declined an
invitation to come here Saturday to meet with leaders of the EU,
Cyprus and the East European candidates.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and France insist the
EU's annual budget _ 86 billion European currency units (dlrs 100
billion) this year _ must not rise beyond inflation in 2000-2006
when the first newcomers would join.
	   They also reject letting spending rise in line with economic
growth which would add some 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) by
2006.
	   Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal _ which get special EU aid _
want that so they don't lose out when even poorer east European
nations join.
	   Germany and other northerners say they already pay far more into
the EU than they get back. Germany's net payment is 22 billion
marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in
Bonn. ``We cannot and we do not want to solve Europe's problems
with a German checkbook.''
	   Separately, Britain's refuses to give up a refund it has been
getting since 1984 to compensate for its net payments, even though
it is better off today than when the payments started.
	   The EU budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from
15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   Key to its reform is an agreement to make deep cuts in farm
spending. Subsidies for EU farmers still eat up half of the budget.
	   The EU leaders will also discuss plans to cut Europe's
stubbornly high unemployment, the launch of a single currency in
January and plans to ensure the 11 nations adopting the euro will
speak with a one voice in international finance meetings.

New Swiss president wants new debate with U.S., Jewish groups

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's first Jewish president said in
interviews published Thursday she will use her new role to be more
outspoken toward the United States and Jewish organizations on the
Swiss role in World War II.
	   Ruth Dreifuss, whose father lost his job in 1942 for helping
people fleeing the Holocaust, said she also will speak more openly
to the Swiss about their past.
	   The election gives her ``a great chance'' to contribute to the
debate about neutral Switzerland's actions in the war and its
current efforts to repair any wrongdoing, she said.
	   Dreifuss, the interior minister responsible for social and
health affairs, told the daily Le Temps that she had kept a low
profile on the wartime issue previously in part because it wasn't
her role in government.
	   She said she also didn't want to be seen as a ``token Jew'' to
shield the government from attacks from Jewish organizations.
	   ``It will be different in my role as president, which gives me
much clearer legitimacy,'' Dreifuss said. ``It's an opportunity I
intend to seize both in this country and abroad.''
	   Dreifuss was elected by parliament Wednesday to the one-year
presidency for 1999. The largely ceremonial job rotates among
members of the seven-member coalition Cabinet, which she joined as
a representative of the Social Democratic party in 1993.
	   During the search for the assets of Holocaust victims in Swiss
banks during the past 3 1/2 years, Switzerland has come under heavy
criticism from international Jewish organizations and the U.S.
government.
	   Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust than the
other members of the Cabinet, and that her personal and family
history had given her special insights.
	   Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon after the outbreak of World War
II, to a Swiss Jewish family. She said in an interview in the
weekly L'Hebdo published Thursday that her early memories included
the constant fear that Germany would invade Switzerland.
	   Her father lost his job in textile imports and exports when he
was caught in a network helping falsify documents for refugees so
that they could enter Switzerland.
	   She said she could empathize both with the 27,000 Jewish
refugees allowed into Switzerland and the 30,000 who were turned
back during the war.
	   Dreifuss has said she thinks the Swiss government should
compensate Jews who were sent back. The Nazis sent many of the
returnees straight into concentration camps.
	   A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come
next spring when an international panel of historians appointed by
the Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy,
Dreifuss said.
	   ``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she
said. ``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish
organizations where they are totally justified and legitimate in
their demands and where they are less so. I think I will be able to
do a lot and I don't have any complexes with Jewish
representatives.''
	   She said she knows the United States and the way the
international Jewish community functions better than her
colleagues.
	   Dreifuss, also the first Swiss woman to be president, said,
``the election of a Jewish female president of the confederation
demonstrates that what would have been impossible just a few years
ago has become normal.''

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts crossed a
new threshold into the international space station today, turning
on the lights and preparing the outpost for future assembly crews.
	   Shuttle commander Robert Cabana and Russian cosmonaut Sergei
Krikalev floated side by side into Unity, the American-made piece
of the seven-story station, after opening a series of hatches
leading from the shuttle Endeavour. They carried lanterns to see
inside; the 36-foot cylindrical chamber was pitch-black, so their
first official act was to flip on the lights.
	   The six crew members shared the moment with the world: They took
in cameras to provide everyone back on Earth with the first look
inside the 250-mile-high space station.
	   ``This is a very significant and almost momentous event,'' said
NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle.
	   It was slow going to get through the three hatches leading from
Endeavour into Unity. The astronauts, wielding checklists and
wrenches, had to make sure the air pressure was constant from one
area to the next before moving on.
	   ``This is our goal _ building a space station and setting the
pace for the future,'' Cabana said earlier in the day. ``When you
get to look out the window and see Zarya and Unity joined together,
and knowing that you get to go inside ... it's pretty awesome.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian had plenty of work to do
inside, beginning with the routing of air ducts from Endeavour into
Unity.
	   Cabana and astronaut Jerry Ross had to wire up a communications
system inside Unity. The others were to continue on into the
Russian-built Zarya control module, where Krikalev was to replace a
charging component on a faulty battery.
	   Other duties include transferring tools from the shuttle to the
space station for later use. The astronauts will even leave behind
clothes for the first permanent station crew, scheduled to arrive
in January 2000.
	   The work will continue through Friday, when the astronauts will
exit the space station and close the hatches to get ready for
Tuesday's return to Earth.
	   On Wednesday, in preparation for their journey inside the
station, Ross and astronaut James Newman ventured out on a
seven-hour spacewalk and attached two 100-pound antennas to the
outside of Unity.
	   The antennas are part of the communications system to be wired
up today. Once activated, the system will provide a direct,
virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and
Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to
rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations.
	   In a tense and meticulously planned operation, Newman also pried
open a stuck antenna on Zarya. After several pokes with a 10-foot
pole, the 4-foot strip antenna shot out.
	   ``There it goes! It's gone!'' Ross shouted.
	   ``You got it deployed. All right,'' Mission Control radioed up.
	   Other spacewalking chores completed by Ross and Newman included
erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity
and covering three of four protruding pins on the chamber with
thermal blankets.
	   Unfortunately for Ross, the thermal cover for the fourth pin got
loose and floated away; he lost two tools during Monday's
spacewalk. ``I don't believe this,'' he groaned.
	   It was the second time this week that Ross and Newman floated
out to work on the 35-ton station taking shape in the shuttle's
cargo bay. During a 7{-hour spacewalk on Monday, they connected
electrical and data cables to Unity, enabling it to be powered up.
	   One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission. On
Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out
a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna.

UEFA meets to seal Champions League reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS format for Champions League in grafs 14-16. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee on
Thursday unanimously approved the revamped Champions League and
UEFA Cup to start next summer, a key official of the European
soccer body said.
	   ``The financial distribution has still to be fine tuned but the
basic principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary Gerhart
Aigner told reporters.
	   These would be finalized in the next two to three months, he
said.
	   The competitions were restructured to counter the threat of the
breakaway ``Super League and ratification means this current season
will be the last for the European Cup Winners Cup, which has been
contested annually since 1961.
	   ``We will make a fine tuning, but we are very confident that
next season ... we will start with the new competition,'' Tognoni
said. ``It was a very good day for European football.''
	   Europe's top clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge the existing
UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved by the Executive Committee.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by the
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would boost annual revenues for Europe's
leading clubs.
	   As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the leading
clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened
to suspend clubs and players who joined the Super League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European club competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised
revenues, UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   Assured of places in the first stage are the league champions
and runners-up from Italy, Germany, Spain, England, France and the
Netherlands, as well as the defending champion.
	   The league champions of Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic
also are guaranteed a berth. Other teams will have to go through at
least one of three qualifying phases.
	   The first- and second-placed teams from each groups advance to a
second round with teams playing in four groups of four, followed by
knockout quarterfinals.
	   While the top two in each of the second-round groups advance,
the third-placed teams would be given another chance in the UEFA
Cup, entering that competition in its third round.
	   The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number
as the two competitions it will replace.
	   ``We are still working in the task force, but there is no
crucial question on which we feel the clubs must give their
opinion,'' Aigner said.

Pilot from Canada's elite aerobatics team killed in jet crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOOSE JAW, Saskatchewan (AP) _ A jet from Canada's elite
military aerobatics team crashed Thursday after touching another
plane during a training exercise, killing the pilot.
	   It was the third fatal crash in the past 10 years involving the
Snowbirds, who perform aerobatic routines at air shows across North
America.
	   Air force officials said the accident occurred during a maneuver
by a six-plane formation from the military air base at Moose Jaw.
	   They said there was contact between two of the jets, prompting
one to crash while the other was able to land safely.
	   The pilot of the crashed plane _ the only person aboard _ was
pronounced dead shortly after transfer to a hospital. His name was
not released pending notification of relatives.
	   The military immediately opened an inquiry into the accident.
	   The Snowbirds _ a unit of 11 pilots _ were formed in 1971 and
since then have performed before an estimated 85 million
spectators.
	   The crashed jet was a Canadair CL-141 Tutor jet, a two-seater
training plane built in the 1960s.

Russia seeks UN aid to fight drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is seeking United Nations aid to fight drug
trafficking and drug-related crimes, a news report said Thursday.
	   The Russian government has been working with the U.N.
secretariat on an agreement under which the United Nations would
help provide communications equipment, train Russian law
enforcement officers and carry out studies on drug trafficking in
Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The aid would also help Russia develop ways to destroy illegal
drug plantations and combat drug addiction, ITAR-Tass said, citing
a government statement.
	   It did not say how much the assistance would be worth or give a
timetable.
	   The government says annual income from the illegal drug trade in
Russia exceeds dlrs 1.5 billion. More than 2 million Russians use
drugs regularly, according to official estimates.
	   The United Nations has expressed concern over the rise in drug
trafficking across Russia and central Asia since the collapse of
the Soviet Union's police-state internal controls.

EU leaders unlikely to heal budget rift at 2-day summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes and details throughout. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders open a two-day
summit Friday at which they will recommit to letting a dozen
countries into the EU. But on the summit's eve, it was unlikely
they'll agree on how to fund their biggest expansion ever.
	   Ahead of the summit, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar were at odds over the EU's
future financing. Schroeder said Germans were tiring of being the
EU paymaster and Aznar, seeing EU aid for poorer EU members going
eastward, insisted on raising EU membership fees.
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said he will ask the leaders to
inject urgency into the finance debate so a budget deal can be
agreed in March.
	   ``I hope we can come to an agreement'' Aznar told reporters.
``But I don't agree with (keeping national contributions) at 1.27
percent of GNP or freezing spending.''
	   The EU opened membership negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary
talks with nations judged less ready: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is expected to join them.
	   Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, among others, want to
bring Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first group. Germany
and France oppose that.
	   The leaders will meet in a historic setting: the cavernous
Redoutensaal of the Hofburg Palace where Europe's aristocratic
leaders of 1815 redrew their continent's map and danced away the
memories of Napoleon's wars.
	   In its 20th-century version of building a better Europe, the EU
refuses to set entry dates in order to keep candidates working
apace on their economic and political reforms to meet EU membership
requirements.
	   Turkey, too, continues to trouble the West Europeans. They have
ruled it out as an immediate candidate. Ankara has declined an
invitation to come here Saturday to meet with leaders of the EU,
Cyprus and the East European candidates.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and France insist the
EU's annual budget _ 86 billion European currency units (dlrs 100
billion) this year _ must not rise beyond inflation in 2000-2006
when the first newcomers would join.
	   They also reject letting spending rise in line with economic
growth which would add some 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) by
2006.
	   Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal _ which get special EU aid _
want that so they don't lose out when even poorer east European
nations join.
	   Germany and other northerners say they already pay far more into
the EU than they get back. Germany's net payment is 22 billion
marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to continue a policy that seeks
to buy our neighbors' good will with net payments that become an
unbearable budget burden in our own country,'' Schroeder said in
Bonn. ``We cannot and we do not want to solve Europe's problems
with a German checkbook.''
	   Separately, Britain's refuses to give up a refund it has been
getting since 1984 to compensate for its net payments, even though
it is better off today than when the payments started.
	   The EU budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from
15 member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product.
	   Key to its reform is an agreement to make deep cuts in farm
spending. Subsidies for EU farmers still eat up half of the budget.
	   The EU leaders will also discuss plans to cut Europe's
stubbornly high unemployment, the launch of a single currency in
January and plans to ensure the 11 nations adopting the euro will
speak with a one voice in international finance meetings.

Efforts to release four German hostages in Yemen fail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Efforts to mediate the release of four
German hostages have failed because the government has not live up
to its pledges, tribal sources said Thursday.
	   The Germans, including three women, were abducted Monday by
three gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Serwah, in Marib
province.
	   Marib is 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital
San'a.
	   Security officials said Tuesday the tribe abducted the Germans
to force the government to pay them for the land on which it built
a dam.
	   The tribal sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that mediation efforts had failed because the abductors
want the government to fulfill pledges it made when members of the
same clan kidnapped British hostages in April.
	   The Britons were released after the government promised to build
more roads in the area and return a four-wheel drive vehicle that
was seized from them in March.
	   But the government will not hold talks with the tribe on its
previous pledges before the Germans are released, government
sources said Thursday. They spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   More than 250 troops in armored vehicles are still circling the
mountainous area where the Germans are believed held and security
forces detained several members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe in a bid
to gain leverage in negotiations with tribal elders.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. The hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually well treated and are
released unhurt.

Serb police block start of exhumations of Kosovo mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PRI101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ European experts accused Serbia of
trying to prevent a probe into wartime atrocities after police
barred them Thursday from exhuming a mass grave containing the
bodies of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   A police roadblock with armored vehicles blocked the 19-member
Finnish team as it headed to the first of six sites in Kosovo
containing the bodies of civilians massacred in the seven-month
conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   ``We see this as clear obstruction,'' said the Finns' leader
Helena Ranta. Her team of forensic experts spent more than two
hours at the roadblock before turning back, and it was unclear when
they might try to return.
	   The exhumations, for which Serb authorities had given
permission, were seen as a breakthrough in investigations into
atrocities in the war-ravaged Serbian province.
	   Serbian police reportedly insisted they be allowed to escort the
forensic team to the site in order to protect a Serbian legal team
accompanying the Finns.
	   But the main ethnic Albanian rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which controls the territory surrounding the dig site,
refused to allow Serbian police into the area.
	   The Finnish team had been heading from the Kosovo capital of
Pristina to its first site, a frozen hill near Gornje Obrinje that
is believed to contain the bodies of 22 ethnic Albanians massacred
by Serb troops in September.
	   That massacre, in which all the victims were thought to be
members of the same family, was among the most gruesome during the
Serb offensive and prompted worldwide outrage. Under world
pressure, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic end the crackdown
in October and reached a truce.
	   Some two dozen Serb policemen in flak jackets and carrying
automatic weapons, along with four armored personnel carriers,
stopped the Finnish convoy on the road.
	   A Serb policeman took film from a Finnish TV cameraman, Ranta
said, while forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army wearing black or
camouflage uniforms were visible along surrounding dirt roads and
the countryside.
	   Ranta spoke for two hours with Serbian Justice Minister
Dragoljub Jankovic in Pristina but the impasse over entering the
area was not resolved, she said.
	   Her mission, created by the European Union, is due to visit
other sites in Kosovo where Serbian civilians are said to be
buried, as well as more ethnic Albanians.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Kosovo, a
southern province in Serbia populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians, and up to 300,000 were forced from their homes.
	   Meanwhile, several hundred Serbian residents of Kosovo marched
Thursday to a rebel stronghold to protest the disappearance of
about 200 Serbs during the conflict _ many believed abducted by the
rebels.
	   Carrying banners reading ``Stop terrorism'' and ``Bring our
relatives back,'' the marchers walked 12 miles from the town of
Orahovac to the rebel stronghold of Dragobilje in southwest Kosovo.
	   The march came as the Kosovo Verification Mission, created under
the October agreement that ended fighting, set up its first
regional center in the town of Prizren.
	   Some 500 unarmed international observers are working in Kosovo
to verify adherence to peace deals, part of a force expected to
reach 2,000 by the end of January.

 &UR; Tiny worm is first animal to have entire genetic code mapped &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. and British scientists for the first time
have mapped the entire gene pattern of an animal, a tiny worm that
already is providing clues to human problems such as cancer, aging
and Alzheimer's disease.
	   Experts called the achievement an important advance in the
ambitious effort to map the human gene structure and to someday use
that knowledge to find the causes and cures of human disease.
	   The worm, a type of nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans, is
as common as dirt. A handful of garden soil contains thousands.
	   But the animal provides a crucial keyhole view of the vast world
of genetics, said Robert H. Waterston, leader of a Washington
University, St. Louis, team that joined with British scientists to
find the worm's genes.
	   ``This worm is really an animal just as we are,'' said
Waterston. ``It has muscles and many different kinds of cells. And
it also ages, just as we do. By and large, it uses the same genes
that we do.''
	   By studying genes shared by worm and human, researchers will
learn at a molecular level what can go wrong and how to fix it.
Such microscopic studies are virtually impossible in humans.
	   Waterston's team and a group at the Sanger Centre in Cambridge,
England, worked together for eight years to identify the worm's
20,000 genes. To do this, they had to find and sequence about 97
million DNA base pairs, a task that required labs to work around
the clock.
	   ``This is an important leap forward,'' said Dr. Francis Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. He said
the achievement could ``profoundly'' affect medical science.
	   ``Most of the major pathways that involve life and death and
interaction between cells are pretty much (the same) between these
worms and humans,'' Collins said.
	   By understanding what happens in the worm cells, researchers
also learn what happens in human cells. Of the 5,000 best-known
human genes, 75 percent have matches in the worm, Collins said.
	   The human genetic pattern, or genome, has 80,000 genes arranged
in 3 billion DNA molecule pairs. About 7 percent of the human
genome has been mapped, Collins said.
	   The worm is a clear-skinned creature whose biological functions
can be easily monitored by microscope. A dozen of the animals could
perch on a pinhead, but within each is a complex world of genes
that perform the same functions as in humans.

Bosnian paramilitary chief found guilty of allowing rape

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In the first U.N. case to focus
exclusively on rape as a war crime, a Bosnian Croat paramilitary
chief was convicted Thursday of letting a subordinate sexually
assault a Muslim woman.
	   Anto Furundzija, 29, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal found him guilty of two counts of
war crimes for failing to stop the rape.
	   ``In such situations, the fellow perpetrator plays a role every
bit as grave as the person who actually inflicts the pain and
suffering,'' the judges wrote in a 100-page ruling.
	   Furundzija's attorney said he would appeal.
	   ``Our position is one of true shock,'' said Luka Misetic. ``We
firmly, unequivocally state that our client is not guilty.''
	   Furundzija appeared unmoved when he heard the verdicts and
sentence. Prosecutors had asked for a minimum of five years, but he
had faced a maximum life sentence.
	   The case against Furundzija was based almost exclusively on the
closed-door testimony of the alleged victim, identified by the
tribunal only as ``Witness A.''
	   Defense attorneys tried to have her testimony thrown out,
claiming it was unreliable because she was suffering post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). They also accused prosecutors of trying to
conceal her psychological problems.
	   In light of the claims, the three-judge panel led by presiding
Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia had taken the unprecedented step of
reopening the trial so the victim could be cross-examined again and
to hear evidence about her mental state.
	   But on Thursday, the judges rejected the argument that her
testimony was flawed.
	   If Furundzija's appeal fails, he will be jailed in either
Norway, Finland or Italy.
	   Furundzija was the commander of a paramilitary unit, known as
``The Jokers,'' that took part in a campaign by Bosnian Croat
forces to drive Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley
in 1993.
	   The rape victim was taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by an unidentified soldier in the presence of Furundzija.
	   The judges deplored Furundzija's role in her ordeal.
	   ``A woman was brought into detention, kept naked and helpless
before her interrogators and treated with the utmost cruelty and
barbarity,'' their ruling said.
	   ``The accused, far from preventing these crimes, played a
prominent part in their commission.''
	   Furundzija is the first Bosnian Croat to be convicted of
participating in a brutal purge of Muslims in Lasva Valley. Eight
others are on trial in three separate cases for their alleged
involvement.
	   Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal
previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian
Croats for war crimes.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The attempt to divert an Egyptian airliner
to Libya was to break the U.N. air embargo, making it the first
Arab plane to do so, passengers said Thursday.
	   They said Wednesday's attempt to reroute the plane was
orchestrated by the Libyan government, which chartered the plane
that took off from San`a, the Yemeni capital.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo for
refueling and then back to Yemen.
	   ``The plan was to break the air embargo so that it would be the
first Arab airliner to break the sanctions,'' one of the passengers
told The Associated Press in Yemen, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Yemeni authorities did not apprehend the two masked men who
tried to divert the plane to Libya after it landed in Yemen
Thursday. The two men _ a Libyan diplomat and a Yemeni _ were
supported by the rest of the 96 passengers who tried to divert the
plane to Libya.
	   Egyptian officials had earlier said there were 150 passengers on
board.
	   Five of the passengers were Libyan diplomats working at the
Libyan Embassy in Yemen, including the masked man, officials in
San`a said Thursday. The rest were Yemeni members of Parliament and
trade union activists.
	   However, The official Libyan news agency said Thursday that
there had been no Libyans on the plane.
	   ``Libya had nothing to do with this plane,'' said the JANA news
agency.
	   It said Libya had even decided not to allow the plane fly into
its airspace or give it landing permission when the aircraft
arrived in neighboring Jerba.

Baath Party says office off limits to U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thursday's inspections. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-6
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N.
weapons inspectors, an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party said
Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter a party
office they tried to inspect a day earlier.
	   If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a
member of the party's leadership, told a news conference on the
steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad.
	   The U.N. inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of
searches in Baghdad and elsewhere, say U.N. resolutions give them
the right to search any site without conditions. The United States
has threatened to attack Iraq unless it complies.
	   A team of 12 inspectors was turned back Wednesday from the
regional office of the party _ one of four in the capital. The team
was asked for a written declaration of what they sought, said the
Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the premises, it said.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, condemned the
move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has said it
remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.''
	   ``Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response
so far is not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he
said Thursday, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The office in contention is a slightly unkempt building behind
black gates in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
Its windows are barred with iron grates. No signs are outside, but
a party emblem sits above the door, and a large portrait of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stands near the main entrance.
	   Jassim, in black beret and olive uniform, insisted that the
office was private property and it was his decision on whether
anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political matters
_ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors are
seeking.
	   ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a party
member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad.
	   If they try to return, he said, ``the answer will be the same.''
	   ``There is no justification,'' Jassim said. ``Nor will you find
by entering anything inside that is banned or prohibited.''
	   Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed signals coming out of
the leadership in the Iraqi capital.
	   Just a day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed
Rashid, who has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts
were wrong in declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest
the U.N. team should not have been barred.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also said the site was
insignificant and downplayed the importance of the incident.
	   ``There are few things to be solved, but that's all,'' he said.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried the official agency report on the
incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in
editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of inspectors.
	   In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday
that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.''
	   But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot
accept to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission
continuing to flood us with lies and secondary details which do not
accomplish the awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.''
	   ``They want sanctions to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted
as saying by the Iraqi news agency.
	   Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as teams of experts that have arrived in past weeks. All
together, they number a little less than 200.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and
programs to build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift
an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS names of hunger strikers in last graf
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight convicted kidnappers, on a hunger
strike to pressure the government to release them, on Thursday
seemed closer to death than freedom.
	   After going 25 days without eating, the five Chileans, two
Argentines and one Brazilian, ``made a decision that brought them
one step closer to death,'' said Breno Altman, president of the
Committee to Free Political Prisoners.
	   The prisoners, who abducted a supermarket magnate in 1989,
decided to no longer take sodium and potassium salts to ward off
heart failure and convulsions, he said.
	   ``They're determined to die if their demands are not met,''
Altman said by phone.
	   The eight are hospitalized at Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas.
	   To end their fast, the prisoners want the government to expel
the foreigners and pardon the Brazilian. Two Canadians convicted,
David Lamont and Christine Spencer, with them were transferred to a
Vancouver prison on Nov. 20.
	   At their trial, the 10 claimed to be political prisoners because
they belonged to a group that planned to funnel the dlrs 30 million
ransom they were demanding to El Salvador's leftist guerrillas.
	   Although the Supreme Court agreed their crime was politically
motivated, they were charged under a harsher code for common
criminals because their act never endangered national security.
	   Public sentiment is about evenly divided between those who say
the prisoners have suffered enough and those who think their
release would set a dangerous precedent, especially among the more
than 1,000 foreigners being held in Brazilian prisons.
	   The prisoners stopped eating on Nov. 16, claiming that
authorities reneged on an agreement that ended their 16-day hunger
strike in April, Altman said.
	   The hunger strikers are: Ulisses Acervedo, Maria Marchi Badilla,
Pedro Lembach, Sergio Urtubia and Hector Ramon Tapia of Chile;
Humberto and Horacio Paz of Argentina; and Brazilian Raimundo
Freire.

Chirac, Annan celebrate 50th anniversary of rights declaration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details, Rigoberta Menchu quote, ADDS byline
 &UR; By Nicole Chavranski &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac, surrounded by
human rights activists and dignitaries, feted the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Thursday in a ceremony
that linked Paris by satellite with the United Nations.
	   It was in France that the human rights charter was signed Dec.
10, 1948.
	   ``In France and outside our borders, we need the vigilance and
courage of human rights activists more than ever,'' Chirac said,
speaking in a linkup with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Annan called the declaration ``the moral core of all our efforts
to promote peace and alleviate poverty.''
	   After the ceremony, Amnesty International was sponsoring a
blockbuster concert with Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Alanis
Morisette, Tracy Chapman and Radiohead, among others.
	   As activists gathered for the Paris ceremony, archive footage of
the charter's signing brought back memories of its founders,
Eleanor Roosevelt et Rene Cassin.
	   Emotional pleas for international compassion brought a human
face to rights abuses. One young woman told of her fellow Afghans
``put in cages'' by the Taliban militia. Another, from Kosovo,
spoke in a trembling voice of the stench of charred bodies in
villages devastated by the Serbs.
	   A host of human rights figures _ including South African
President Nelson Mandela _ took part in the ceremony.
	   Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel laureate, called for a
continued fight against ``insensitivity and silence'' and cheered
Britain's decision to let Spain begin extradition proceedings
against Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``There is no more beautiful example,'' she said.
	   A video message came from Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar.
	   ``As H.G. Wells said, the only real nationality is that of
humanity,'' the human rights leader said. ``There cannot be peace
and happiness in a society where citizens live in uncertainty,
precariousness and fear.''
	   Czech President Vacav Havel, also speaking by video, said the
world had made ``real progress'' in the last 50 years in the field
of human rights.
	   One key participant was missing from the ceremony. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Paris Thursday, had
planned to attend but canceled due to pressing business back home,
according to the U.S. Embassy press office.
	   Earlier Thursday, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin awarded a
human rights prize to Ibrahim Rugova, president of the Kosovo
Democratic League, for his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis in Serb-ruled Kosovo province.
	   The Dalai Lama, in Paris for the anniversary, issued a statement
saying some governments _ a clear reference to China _ treat the
principles in the rights declaration as ``products of Western
civilization, that don't apply to Asia or other parts of the Third
World.
	   ``I don't share that point of view and am certain that the
majority of people don't either,'' said the Tibetan spiritual
leader. The principles ``are a kind of natural law,'' he said.

Mobile phone maker Ericsson expects layoffs following poor results

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications company LM Ericsson
AB, hit hard by the Asian financial crisis, expects disappointing
year-end results that could force it to eliminate some 10,000 jobs.
	   Ericsson, Sweden's largest company, employs about 100,000 people
in its worldwide operations, including about 8,000 in the United
States. It is a leading maker of cellular telephones and equipment
for wired and mobile phone systems, and for data and telecom
networks.
	   Chief executive Sven-Christer Nilsson said Thursday in a meeting
with analysts that 1998 results, to be announced Jan. 28, are
likely to be below market expectations, both in terms of profits
and sales.
	   ``The financial crisis in certain markets and the related
general economic uncertainty ... is affecting us and emphasizes
with renewed strength the need for a strengthening of the ongoing
rationalization programs,'' Nilsson said, according to a statement
released by the company.
	   ``All together, this will involve substantial reductions in the
number of employees,'' he said.
	   Company spokesman Lars Staalberg said the cuts would take place
at operations around the world, but he did not have further
details.
	   Nilsson's statement said Ericsson was hit especially hard in its
public networks business, but that its mobile phone business also
was suffering. In recent months, demand has been highest for the
most basic models of mobile phones, which have lower profit
margins.
	   Ericsson's main competitors at the top of the cellular phone
business are U.S.-based Motorola and Finland's Nokia, which are
having very different years.
	   Nokia reported a dlrs 1.9 billion profit for the third quarter
and claims to have overtaken Motorola as the world's biggest maker
of mobile phones. Motorola, which also makes microchips, this year
announced layoffs of 15,000 people worldwide and a third-quarter
loss of dlrs 42 million.

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ San Diego Chargers interim head coach June
Jones has accepted the head football coaching job at the University
of Hawaii, The Associated Press has learned.
	   Jones told his players of his decision in a team meeting this
morning, a team source said. Jones was to make the decision
official after Thursday's practice.
	   Hawaii officials worked late into the night Wednesday to
finalize a contract with Jones, a former Hawaii player and
assistant coach.
	   Hawaii was believed to be offering a three-year contract with
rollover clauses, but Jones was said to have wanted a five-year
deal. Reports say the school will pay Jones about dlrs 250,000 a
season.
	   The school last week fired Fred vonAppen after he compiled a
5-31 record over three seasons, including 0-12 this season. The
winless season tied an NCAA record for the worst single-season mark
in Division I-A and is part of an 18-game losing streak, longest in
the United States.
	   Jones became the front-runner to replace vonAppen after Utah
coach Ron McBride withdrew from consideration, saying the process
was taking too long.
	   Although the move may seem odd, going from an National Football
League job to a school that has lost 18 straight games, Jones has
ties to Hawaii.
	   He said while he loves San Diego and the situation with the
Chargers, he's had a lifelong dream to return to Hawaii, where he
played at quarterback in 1974 and served as an assistant coach in
1983.
	   Even after Jones became a strong candidate for the Hawaii job,
the Chargers said they would wait until after the season to decide
whether to give Jones their head coaching job on a permanent basis.
	   Jones is expected to coach the Chargers' final three games.
	   Jones replaced the fired Kevin Gilbride on Oct. 13. The Chargers
are 3-4 since Jones took over and 5-8 overall.

IOC opens probe into alleged `bribes'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC opened a high-level
investigation Thursday into what one top Olympic official described
as ``bribes'' paid by the Salt Lake City bid committee to help
secure the 2002 Winter Games.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
ordered a probe into the scholarship payments made to relatives of
IOC members in the lead-up to the vote for the games.
	   ``This is quite clearly a matter to investigate,'' IOC director
general Francois Carrard said.
	   The investigation will be led by Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a former
World Court judge who heads the IOC's commission dealing with legal
and ethical issues.
	   ``The president sent me a letter asking me to carry out an
investigation and report to the executive board,'' Mbaye said. ``We
will start immediately.''
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 ``humanitarian aid'' project was an effort to buy key IOC
members' support in the four years between the IOC votes on the
1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the program was
begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002
Games in the 1995 vote.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``It's not wrong to say it's a bribe _ it is a bribe,'' said IOC
executive board member Marc Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the
oversight panel for the Salt Lake Olympics. ``It's a bribe, yes.''
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' he said.
	   Hodler suggested that, in different circumstances, there might
have been grounds to consider taking the games away from the Utah
capital.
	   ``Can we take the games away from Salt Lake City?'' he said.
``Does that make sense? I can't propose it because in that case
people will say Sion will get it free of charge. I'm a Swiss and
Sion was No. 2 (in the vote).''
	   Pressed on the issue, he said, ``That's very difficult. I don't
see anyone who could take the games in three years and make it
successful. Also, the chairman (of the Salt Lake committee) has
changed and you might be punishing the wrong man.''
	   Asked if irregularities were common in the Olympic bidding
process, Hodler said, ``I had thought we had a very small
percentage of (IOC) members exposed to such things. Apparently
there are more.''
	   ``I just came back from a Sion meeting and they're very proud
people and said they can do it without bribes,'' he said.
	   Following allegations of bribery and other influence peddling in
previous Olympic votes, the IOC assigned Hodler to draw up new
rules and restrictions to weed out the possibility of corruption.
	   ``The rules are very clear: gifts should not be higher than dlrs
100,'' he said. ``If (the Salt Lake scholarship fund) is a gift,
that gift is irregular. If it would be connected with the voting,
of course, it's corruption.''
	   As a result of the Salt Lake controversy, Hodler said he will
propose that only the 11-member IOC executive board and leaders of
sports federations select Olympic cities _ rather than the full IOC
assembly.
	   Hodler said he pushed through a similar change when he was
president of the International Ski Federation, where, he said,
``there was also a lot of corruption.''
	   Hodler said he would also propose that any IOC member found
guilty of accepting favors should be expelled from the
organization.
	   The payments controversy is bound to overshadow the routine
progress report which the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) is
scheduled to make to the IOC board this weekend. SLOC president
Frank Joklik and his team are scheduled to arrive Friday.
	   ``It is clearly disappointing and this is an issue that can only
be described as disruptive at a critical time of importance for
Salt Lake City,'' said John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of
the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``I would hope whatever the IOC and
president Samaranch decide, this is resolved quickly so people
charged with organizing the games can get back to business.''
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Joklik, in outlining an audit of the program for reporters
Tuesday, refused to identify the other IOC relatives who received
scholarships.

Not everybody knows what Vargas knows

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Fernando Vargas is unbeaten,
but he's had only 14 pro fights and wouldn't appear ready to
challenge Yory Boy Campas, the IBF junior middleweight champion.
	   The 21-year-old Vargas, of course, isn't buying that.
	   ``That (comparing records) is for people who don't know,'' he
said Thursday at a news conference for the fight Saturday night at
the Trump Taj Mahal. ``They will say `new' (champion) one time and
`still' (champion) every time after that.''
	   Of the 27-year-old Campas' 72 wins in 74 bouts, 62 have been
achieved inside the scheduled distance.
	   But, said Vargas, of Oxnard, California, who has won all his
fights by knockout, ``Yory Boy Campas is made for me. He's a
straight-ahead fighter, who takes 100 punches to land 10. I can
punch, too.''
	   The title fight will be the first half of an HBO doubleheader,
with the telecast to begin at 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT Sunday).
	   The other bout will be 10-round rematch between Arturo Gatti of
Jersey City, New Jersey and Ivan Robinson of Philadelphia. Their
first meeting, was a 10-round brawl Aug. 22, which Robinson won on
a split decision.
	   ``I think he's going to be a better fighter than the first
time,'' said Robinson (26-2, 10 knockouts).
	   He wasn't alone.
	   ``This time, I will be the fighter I was supposed to be the
first time in August,'' said Gatti (29-3, 24 knockouts), a former
IBF junior lightweight (130 pounds (58 kgs)) champion.
	   The contract weight for the fight is 136 pounds (61-kilogram), a
pound over the lightweight limit, and the official weigh-in will be
held Friday. Gatti, however, said he expects to weigh about 150
pounds (67.5-kg) by fight time, and Robinson said he could weigh
142-143 pounds (64 kgs), showing how bogus weigh-ins are a day or
two before a fight.
	   Campas and Vargas, of course, could each weigh quite a bit above
the 154-pound (70-kg) junior middleweight limit.
	   Should Vargas win, he would become the second member of the 1996
U.S. Olympic boxing team to win a world title. Floyd Mayweather is
WBC super featherweight champion, and is scheduled to defend that
title against Angel Manfredy on Dec. 9 at Miami.
	   Vargas, beaten in the quarterfinals in Atlanta, naturally is
disappointed about not winning a gold medal, knowing well how much
quick money that can mean to a fighter.
	   ``I don't even like to dwell on that,'' he said. ``I picked
myself up. I'm happy where I am.''
	   Campas won the IBF title by stopping Raul Marquez in the eight
round Dec. 6, 1997. He has defended it with three
technical-knockout wins this year.''
	   ``I know the best fighter is going to win,'' Campas said through
an interpreter.
	   No translation was needed to find out who Campas thinks that is.

Brazil plans to sue big tobacco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The government is planning to sue
cigarette manufacturers operating in Brazil to recuperate money
spent on tobacco related illnesses, a health ministry official said
Thursday.
	   Health Minister Jose Serra met recently with U.S. lawyers to
discuss a 40 billion real (dlrs 34 billion) lawsuit modeled after a
similar dlrs 206 billion agreement recently worked out between
tobacco and 46 U.S. states.
	   ``Although there is nothing official yet, the minister intends
to sue,'' said a health ministry official who declined to be
identified.
	   Serra plans to bring suit in the U.S. because that is where most
major tobacco companies have their headquarters, the official said.
	   Serra is expected to announce details of the plan in the next 10
days.
	   It was not immediately clear if the suit would protect tobacco
companies from future claims, as is the case with the U.S. accord.
	   According to data from Brazil's National Institute of Cancer,
the country has approximately 31 million smokers, or 33 percent of
the population over age 15. The institute estimates that smoking
kills 80,000 people each year and is responsible for 90 percent of
lung cancer deaths.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a videotape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   The hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in Russian that
he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the British
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission
was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in the region, he claimed in the video.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard in the
tape. It was unclear whether Kennedy was speaking under duress.
	   Russian news reports said the tape indicated that all four were
spying for Britain, the United States, Germany and Israel.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Kennedy said the group's purported mission of helping install a
telephone system for a private company was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
press conference in Grozny. He refused to answer any questions
about the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or
why the government had it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
questions about the possible role of Chechen officials, long
rumored to be linked to Chechnya's wave of kidnappings.
	   Later Thursday, Arsanov blamed Russian secret services for the
killings in a statement carried on local television, the Interfax
news agency reported. He gave no evidence or other details.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Attorneys for Gen. Augusto Pinochet went back to
the House of Lords Thursday, seeking to stop Spain's effort to
extradite the former Chilean dictator to stand trial on charges of
murder and other human rights abuses.
	   Their plea to overturn a ruling by the highest court of appeal
is extremely unusual in English law. It came a day before Pinochet
was due in court to begin an extradition battle that is likely to
be long and costly.
	   Pinochet's attorneys argued, once again, that he was entitled to
sovereign immunity for any actions while he was head of state.
	   That argument was rejected two weeks ago in a 3-2 decision by
law lords sitting as Britain's highest court of appeal.
	   Attorneys also said they might also seek permission to contest
Wednesday's decision by Home Secretary Jack Straw to permit
extradition proceedings.
	   Grounds for the appeal were not immediately disclosed, and it
was not immediately clear how much success such an appeal could
have.
	   ``Having carefully considered all the recent developments, we
can confirm we have lodged a petition with the House of Lords that
the decision of their lordships that Sen. Pinochet does not have
sovereign immunity should not be allowed to stand,'' said Michael
Caplan of the law firm Kingsley Napley.
	   ``We are also considering applying for leave to apply for
judicial review of the home secretary's decision,'' Caplan added.
	   Straw ruled that Spain could seek Pinochet's extradition on
charges including torture and conspiracy to murder, related to
human rights abuses in Chile after Pinochet took power in a
military coup in 1973.
	   Pinochet's supporters have complained that Lord Hoffmann, one of
the judges who voted against Pinochet's appeal, was director of a
charity associated with Amnesty International.
	   Amnesty International said Thursday that Lord Bingham, the Lord
Chief Justice who had voted for Pinochet's appeal, had joined Lord
Hoffmann in a public appeal to build a new headquarters for the
human rights organization.
	   Moreover, Amnesty International said, Pinochet's law firm,
Kingsley Napley, had donated 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,660) to that
cause.
	   In Madrid, Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a criminal indictment
against Pincohet for genocide, terrorism and torture allegedly
committed during his rule between 1973 and 1990. Straw had ruled
that Pinochet could not be extradited on a charge of genocide, but
let the other charges stand.
	   Most of the 300-page indictment lists thousands of alleged
victims including Spaniards, Argentines, Paraguayans, Bolivians and
Mexicans.
	   Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world
assets and for his continued detention in Britain.
	   Chile's government, which says the case threatens to destablize
democracy, denounced Straw's decision and recalled its ambassador
from Britain.
	   At a trade summit in Brazil, the governments of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, plus associate members Bolivia and
Chile, released a statement rejecting the idea that one country can
apply its laws to another. At the same time, it supports the
progress in holding violators accountable for human rights crimes.
	   Chile claims England trampled on its rights by arresting
Pinochet and allowing Spain to begin extradition proceedings, and
at the final session of the Mercosur trade bloc on Thursday,
Chilean President Eduardo Frei won support for his claim that the
decision is a slap at Chile's legal sovereignty.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew the elected president Salvador Allende, in 1973.
	   Straw rejected allegations of bias against Lord Hoffmann, one of
the three justices who voted against Pinochet. Straw also said he
did not find the 83-year-old general ``unfit to stand trial.''
	   Pinochet was arrested in his hospital bed Oct. 16 while
recuperating from back surgery in London.

Feyenoord rolls on unhindered

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord met no resistance from a
nine-man RKC Waalwijk Thursday, won 5-0 and is starting to look
like the Dutch champion elect after less than half the season.
	   Feyenoord (13-2-1) regained its six-point lead with a game in
hand lead over Vitesse (11-2-4). The top two meet Sunday. Ajax
(9-5-3) is third on 32 points and plays fourth-placed Heerenveen
the same day.
	   Patrick Paauwe traded passes with Julio Ricardo Cruz, skipped
past keeper Rob van Dijk and made it 1-0 on 20 minutes from a tight
angle.
	   Adri Bogers' second yellow card came on 31 minutes as he
body-checked a goalbound Jon Dahl Tomasson just outside the penalty
area.
	   Then a horrible error from van Dijk, who completely missed a
corner, presented Cruz with a tap-in for the second.
	   It just wasn't RKC's day. Captain Maarten Schops' lunging
challenge on Ulrich van Gobbel was also his second yellow card
offense and the Waalwijkers were down to nine men at the half.
	   RKC's constant offside trap worked well for 20 minutes in the
second half but Tomasson notched the third and a clean-through
Bonaventure Kalou toe-poked the fourth.
	   Paul Bosvelt's accurate side-footer into the top corner made it
5-0.
	   Vitesse's new Ghanean striker Mamadou Zongo produced two
clinical finishes to give the Arnhem side a 2-0 victory at NAC
Breda Wednesday.
	   It was Vitesse's second straight away win after three months
without a victory on the road, and was achieved without five
injured first-string players.
	   The Vitesse defense looked a mess throughout the game but NAC is
second to bottom and its strikers never looked likely to score.
	   NAC defender Jeffrey van As was sent off near the end for
punching Vitesse's Michel Kreek.

Chechen official shows video of slain hostage claiming to be

British spy &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES in new 10th graf with Chechen official blaming Russian
secret services for the killings. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a videotape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   The hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in Russian that
he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the British
secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Their mission
was to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in the region, he claimed in the video.
	   The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard in the
tape. It was unclear whether Kennedy was speaking under duress.
	   Russian news reports said the tape indicated that all four were
spying for Britain, the United States, Germany and Israel.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Kennedy said the group's purported mission of helping install a
telephone system for a private company was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
	   The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a
press conference in Grozny. He refused to answer any questions
about the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how or
why the government had it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
questions about the possible role of Chechen officials, long
rumored to be linked to Chechnya's wave of kidnappings.
	   Later Thursday, Arsanov blamed Russian secret services for the
killings in a statement carried on local television, the Interfax
news agency reported. He gave no evidence or other details.

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Five people were slightly injured in a
small explosion outside the house of a Spanish civil guard early
Thursday. Authorities linked the attack to groups connected to the
Basque separatist group ETA.
	   A top government official from the northern Basque province,
Enrique Villar, said on National Spanish Radio that the explosion
was evidence of ``a breakout of lightweight terrorism,'' by groups
of young radicals who support ETA.
	   ETA has been observing a cease-fire since Sept. 18. The truce
triggered talk of possible peace negotiations with the government
aimed at ending 30 years of Basque fighting and campaigning for an
independent country.
	   ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, said the explosion does
not hold up the peace process in the Basque region and called it an
isolate incident.
	   ``They are exaggerating the attack, which caused some material
damage but practically nothing else,'' said Herri Batasuna member
Santi Kiroga.
	   The early morning explosion at the Pamplona home of a Spanish
civil guard was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline, Interior
Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said.
	   ETA includes the province of Navarra, the capital of which is
Pamplona, in its vision of an independent Basque state, despite its
location south of the current definition of the Basque province.
	   An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and Liberty, ETA has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began its campaign for
an independent state straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   The Civil Guard was created in the 19th century to patrol
Spain's vast countryside, but now also serves as national highway
police, coast guard, and has a special anti-terrorist unit. Basque
separatists view the Civil Guard as an occupying force in a Basque
homeland.

Audrey Hepburn photos, letters sold at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A family photo album and a collection of letters
that actress Audrey Hepburn wrote to her father were sold at
Christie's auction house on Thursday for more than 70,000 pounds
(dlrs 117,000).
	   An autograph dealer paid 24,150 pounds (dlrs 40,300) for 64
family photos, including snapshots of the actress as a child, in
her school uniform, of her two sons, and herself with family and
friends. Many of the pictures are inscribed on the back to her late
father, Anthony Hepburn-Ruston.
	   The actress' stepmother, Fidelma Hepburn-Ruston, wife sold the
photos, as well as affectionate letters and postcards written by
the star between 1964 and 1990, which went to an unidentified
private collector for 45,500 (dlrs 75,500).
	   The Oscar-winning actress, famous for her roles in ``Roman
Holiday,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' died
in January 1993 at the age of 63.
	   She was born in Belgium, daughter of Hepburn-Ruston, an English
and Irish banker, and Ella van Meemstra, a Dutch baroness. Her
parents divorced when she was a child.

Palestinians vote to nullify calls for Israel's destruction,
</HEADLINE>
address violence &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMS recast with fresh quotes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership on
Thursday scrapped constitutional clauses rejecting Israel's
existence and said it would try and stem a wave of violence that
has jeopardized the peace _ moves that may smooth President Bill
Clinton's troubled visit to the region.
	   A group of senior Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat voted
overwhelmingly to declare clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction null and void, a key condition of the
Clinton-brokered Wye River talks two months ago.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, said the
Palestinian Authority would take steps to stem a wave of riots
sparked by Israel's refusal to release prisoners jailed on
anti-Israel charges.
	   Selim Zanoun, who announced the decision by the Palestine
Central Council to nullify the offending passages, , said that the
larger Palestine National Council would not take up the same vote
when it hosts Clinton on Monday.
	   The meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' Zanoun
said.
	   Clinton is arriving Saturday night for a three-day visit that
was meant to celebrate Wye, but that has turned into an effort to
salvage it.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended
Thursday's vote, but said that a failure to vote on Monday could
scupper the agreement.
	   ``We expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote
in an unequivocal matter... if there is to be further
implementation,'' said David Bar-Illan.
	   The Palestinians have said that the meeting Monday will
``affirm'' the annulment of the offensive passages, but have not
said what that exactly means.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Zanoun said the vote among the 105 PCC members _ out of 124 _
who were present was 81 for, seven against and seven abstaining.
They reaffirmed a letter that Arafat had sent Clinton, declaring
the articles null and void.
	   White House spokesman David Leavy described that as ``an
important and welcomed step toward implementing the Wye accords.''
	   Immediately after the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank
is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu, who has frozen the pullback over what he claimed were
systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord, said
Thursday he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian
riots with a ``firm hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the
funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   Netanyahu says the Palestinian leadership is responsible for the
riots, a charge the Palestinians have strongly denied _ although
Rajoub, the security chief, acknowledged that the Clinton
administration had also pressured the authority to take control of
the streets.
	   ``The Americans want the situation to calm down,'' he said.
``It's in their interest with President Clinton's visit to the
area.''
	   He said that he was taking steps ``to calm the situation.''
	   Then riots erupted after Israel released its first batch of
prisoners, as agreed under Wye _ and most were common criminals
instead of ``security prisoners.''
	   Netanyahu has said he will not release killers or members of
militant Islamic groups. Up to 900 of the 2,000 Palestinians in
Israeli jails are neither.
	   Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Thursday that the
Palestinians had accepted a compromise worked out by Clinton's
envoy to the region: all three sides going through the list of
security prisoners one by one.
	   Erekat said he told Dennis Ross that solving the prisoners issue
was crucial to keeping peace.
	   ``The success of (Clinton's) trip is connected with stability
and quiet,'' he said. ``But for stability you need a convincing
equation, to solve the issue of the prisoners.''
	   Another Netanyahu adviser did not count that out _ as long as
the Palestinians explicitly agreed that killers and militants would
not be released.
	   ``If the Palestinians accept this principle, that Israel is the
one to determine the categories ... I believe we can move ahead,''
Danny Naveh said.
	   Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said
Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian
areas.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Protestant David Trimble, in accepting the
Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic John Hume, said Thursday that
Northern Ireland's militants must lay down their arms to fulfill a
dream of peace on the troubled island.
	   Trimble, 54, and Hume, 61, won the coveted prize for helping to
bring about an April peace accord, now called the Good Friday
Agreement. They hope to end 30 years of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We do have a peace today in Ireland. But it is still something
of an armed peace,'' said Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   At a gala ceremony at the Oslo City Hall, where 4,000 children
had gathered outside in a parade for the laureates, both men vowed
to see the peace process through, despite what could be a rough
future.
	   After accepting their awards, which include gold medals,
diplomas and a shared 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 943,000),
both laureates vowed before a crowd of 1,000 to carry out the peace
process. Later in evening, hundreds of Norwegians honored them with
a torch-light parade.

UN praises human rights vision, but shamed by continued abuses

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations marked the anniversary
Thursday of the world's most comprehensive human rights declaration
with praise for the half-century-old vision that shaped it and
shame that the goals have not yet been met.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the top U.N. human rights
official, Mary Robinson, government ministers and human rights
defenders from around the world delivered the same message: The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights is indeed universal and must
be implemented in full by every government.
	   ``Human rights are foreign to no culture and native to all
nations,'' Annan declared at a special daylong General Assembly
session held in tandem with ceremonies in Paris, where the
declaration was adopted Dec. 10, 1948.
	   Fifty years later, and despite the ratification of 60 treaties
inspired by the declaration, hundreds of millions of people in all
parts of the globe are still deprived of their most basic
political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights.
	   ``It is shameful,'' Robinson said, that 20 percent of the
world's population consumes 80 percent of the world's resources
while over a billion people live without proper food, shelter,
water and education.
	   Britain's Secretary for International Development, Clare Short,
echoed her outrage, saying the declaration didn't just mean
``freedom from fear but freedom from want.''
	   Thursday's anniversary marked a day of reflection rather than
celebration as it recalled the horror of five decades of wars,
genocides, poverty and starvation that came after a declaration
inspired by the massive rights violations of World War II.
	   ``Today we honor the highest of human aspirations and renew our
promise to conquer the worst of human cruelty,'' Annan said. ``We
pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of these human
rights, and to the memory of those who died for them.''
	   The abuses recalled Thursday covered the scope of the
declaration _ women and girls denied access to education and health
care in Afghanistan, ethnic groups subject to torture and mass
killings in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, even the victims of Gen.
Augusto Pinchet, whose landmark arrest was highlighted by several
speakers.
	   The special assembly session, with 126 nations signed up to
speak, began with Annan awarding Human Rights Prizes to those in
the front-line struggle against injustice.
	   This year's winners were former U.S. President Jimmy Carter;
Sunila Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka, Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda,
Jose Gregori of Brazil and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic.
	   A sixth prize honored ``all human rights defenders all over the
world.''
	   Celebrities Michael Douglas, Wynton Marsalis, Mia Farrow,
Luciano Pavarotti and Vanessa Redgrave were taking part in the
commemorations.
	   Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi delivered an address to
delegates via a videotape smuggled out of military-controlled
Myanmar, saying ``the struggle for democracy has become synonymous
with the struggle for human rights.''
	   The General Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution
reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations in fundamental human
rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal
rights of men and women and of nations large and small.''
	   In Paris, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt recalled the intentions of the
original proponents of the declaration _ one of whom was her
grandmother, the former American first lady.
	   ``Human rights begins in the small places, close to home,'' she
said, quoting her grandmother. ``If we remember to respect our
neighbor, our coworker, our children ... we will understand how to
give strength to peoples who live far away, who perhaps we will
never know.''

Audrey Hepburn photos, letters sold at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A family photo album and a collection of letters
that actress Audrey Hepburn wrote to her father were sold at
Christie's auction house on Thursday for more than 70,000 pounds
(dlrs 117,000).
	   An autograph dealer paid 24,150 pounds (dlrs 40,300) for 64
family photos, including snapshots of the actress as a child, in
her school uniform, of her two sons, and herself with family and
friends. Many of the pictures are inscribed on the back to her late
father, Anthony Hepburn-Ruston.
	   The actress' stepmother, Fidelma Hepburn-Ruston, wife sold the
photos, as well as affectionate letters and postcards written by
the star between 1964 and 1990, which went to an unidentified
private collector for 45,500 (dlrs 75,500).
	   The Oscar-winning actress, famous for her roles in ``Roman
Holiday,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' died
in January 1993 at the age of 63.
	   She was born in Belgium, daughter of Hepburn-Ruston, an English
and Irish banker, and Ella van Meemstra, a Dutch baroness. Her
parents divorced when she was a child.

Libyan Parliament can't decide on suspects, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIRTE, Libya (AP) _ Libya's Parliament is not empowered to rule
on local and foreign issues, said the official Libyan news agency
Thursday _ suggesting the assembly will not make a decision on the
handover of two Libyans wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   The Basic Popular Conferences, which is a decision making body,
will be authorized to make the decision, said the agency without
specifying the issues to be decided on. Also, it did not say when
the conferences would make a decision.
	   Libyan media suggested last week that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi does not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the General
People's Congress, or Parliament.
	   The congress on Tuesday began its annual five-day meetings in
the coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the
Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   It has been discussing wide-ranging issues, including the
handover of the two suspects.
	   ``The General Peoples' Congress has no power to make any
decisions,'' JANA said. It can only draft and compile proposals, it
added.
	   Libya has accepted in principle to a trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in
Libya.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.
	   Some 270 people were killed on board and on ground when the
jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21,
1988.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to force
it to hand over the suspects for trial.
	   The sanctions included a ban on air travel from and to Libya,
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil
equipment.

Market flashes a yellow card at Dutch soccer team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Investors in Amsterdam's premier
soccer team were kicking themselves Thursday after the squad lost a
key match and its shares took a tumble.
	   A humiliating defeat Wednesday evening by Portugal's FC Porto
caused publicly traded shares in the Ajax team to plummet on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, driving the stock to a new all-time low.
	   Ajax's 3-0 loss to Porto subsequently got it kicked out of the
Champions League, the competition of national soccer champions.
	   Ajax shares hit their lowest level ever during Thursday's
trading, bottoming out at 17.70 guilders (dlrs 9.46) _ down nearly
10 percent from Wednesday's close _ before regaining some turf to
close down 3 percent at 19.30 guilders (dlrs 10.32).
	   The company listed on the Amsterdam bourse in May at an issue
price of 25 guilders (dlrs 13.36).
	   The declining stock price has closely followed the team's
performance _ no surprise to either investors or fans.
	   Ajax, which won the national championship 27 times, is currently
in third place in the league and will drop to fifth if other teams
win their matches.
	   Its performance on the field has resulted in fans and newspapers
calling for the dismissal of Ajax' Danish coach, Morten Olsen.
Several players, among them stars like the brothers Ronald and
Frank de Boer, will leave the club by the end of this season.
	   This has caused concern about the club's performance in the
coming season, another reason why the stock fell Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton will be dodging
diplomatic potholes and security hazards on his path through the
Holy Land this weekend, but he said Thursday he is determined to go
ahead.
	   Clinton acknowledged the difficult circumstances he will
encounter on the three-day trip that starts Saturday. He told a
White House ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights that he is committed to pushing for
peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.
	   ``Palestinians and Israelis are struggling to bridge mutual
distrust to implement the Wye accords,'' Clinton said, referring to
the breakthrough agreement he helped forge in October at the Wye
River Plantation in Maryland between Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The trip, which was agreed as part of the Wye negotiations,
comes as Israel's peacemaking with the Palestinians is on hold,
Israeli internal politics is in turmoil and Palestinian-Israeli
violence is on the rise.
	   Members of Netanyahu's Cabinet have publicly called on Clinton
to stay home, and even Netanyahu, the reluctant host, asked, ``What
am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come?'' In the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank, clashes with Israeli troops are
the most widespread in months.
	   Yet presidential aides insist it still makes sense for Clinton
to visit Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Thursday that
Clinton believes it is important that he carry through on a
commitment that was ``an important part'' of the Wye agreement in
which Israel pledged further withdrawals from the West Bank in
exchange for firmer Palestinian security assurances.
	   Analysts outside the administration said it would be a mistake
for Clinton to back out now.
	   ``What he is doing is valuable precisely because it isn't
popular with many people'' in the Middle East, said Anthony
Cordesman, a professor of national security studies at Washington's
Georgetown University.
	   Meanwhile, Clinton's proposal for financial aid to support the
Wye River deal drew criticism Thursday from key congressional
Republicans. Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston of Louisiana and
the incoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep.
Bill Young of Florida, protested that Congress was not consulted in
advance about the request.
	   The administration has pledged dlrs 900 million over five years
in U.S. economic aid to the Palestinians.
	   The idea for Clinton's trip was conceived as a way for him to
witness a Dec. 14 meeting of the Palestine National Council in Gaza
City, where the assembly is to void all clauses in its charter that
call for the destruction of Israel. Clinton's presence was meant to
reassure Israel, yet some now see it as conveying tacit recognition
of Palestinian statehood.
	   The Clinton administration's position is that the question of
Palestinian sovereignty is a matter to be settled in what are
called ``final status'' talks with Israel, which are supposed to be
completed by May 1999.
	   In addition to Jerusalem and Gaza City, Clinton also is
scheduled to visit Manger Square in Bethlehem, the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town, and Masada, the fortified
plateau on the Dead Sea.

DiMaggio's lungs drained after congestion worsens slightly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHEL LA CORTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Doctors treated a persistent infection
in American baseball great Joe DiMaggio's lungs Thursday, hoping to
relieve congestion that grew worse overnight and clouded his
overall health picture once again.
	   Still, despite a low-grade fever and the increased congestion,
DiMaggio was in stable condition after the procedure, and his blood
pressure, heart and kidneys were all performing well, his doctor
said.
	   ``It's not necessarily a turn for the worse, but it clearly
would be better if he didn't have this,'' said Dr. Earl Barron, who
has treated DiMaggio for five years.
	   Doctors drained infected material from his lungs _ a procedure
that helped DiMaggio rally on Monday, after he was described as
near death.
	   DiMaggio, who battled back from a fever and low white blood-cell
count during the weekend, remains on a respirator at Memorial
Regional Hospital, a wing of which is named for the 84-year-old
Hall of Famer.
	   Barron said DiMaggio's prognosis is guarded and day-to-day.
	   ``I'm not going to tell you he's not going to survive,'' the
doctor said. ``I'm not going to say any of those things because he
can still turn around and survive beautifully.''
	   The hope is to get him to breathe on his own, but with the
increased congestion DiMaggio will not be taken off the respirator
anytime soon, Barron said.
	   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's attorney and longtime friend, said
he had asked Barron to rate the former New York Yankees center
fielder on a scale of 0-to-10, with zero being the worst and 10 the
best.
	   ``On Monday, the doctor said he was 0.5,'' Engelberg said.
``Then on Tuesday, he rallied and it was 2. Today, he told me it
was 1. That scared me.
	   ``It's a roller-coaster ride. He's in deep trouble. He's very
sick.''
	   DiMaggio, who entered the hospital Oct. 12, had a cancerous
tumor removed from his right lung two days later. He is fighting
recurring pneumonia in his left lung and an intestinal infection.
	   DiMaggio is not strong enough to have chemotherapy for the
cancer. ``It's the pneumonia, not the cancer, that is the
problem,'' Engelberg said.
	   Besides treatment with three antibiotics, fluid also was drained
from DiMaggio's lungs several times. His blood pressure dropped so
rapidly on Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was summoned to
administer last rites.
	   Barron said it's impossible to predict how long DiMaggio will
remain in the hospital, where he has been kept sedated so he can
rest and hopefully heal.

	   Der Taggespiegel, Berlin, on verdict against former East German
coach who gave swimmers steroids:
	   Yesterday was the end of the pilot trial against state doping in
the former East Germany, and still a couple of observers falsely
assert that it was a political trial. The West, so goes the
accusation, avenges its victory over East Germany before the court.
Seldom has the argument been more absurd. Doctors and coaches were
before the court because they played unscrupulously with the health
of minors. ... More meaningful than the degree of the sentences is
that there was a verdict at all. That made clear that the criminal
methods used by the top East German functionaries has been punished
in court.

	   Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland, on elections in St.
Petersburg, Russia:
	   The city elections in St. Petersburg have attracted the
attention of the whole world.
	   This is partly because the assembly which is being elected, in
Russia's second city, has powers of control over the mayor, which
is still unusual in Russia.
	   But it is also because of the recent assassination of lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova, which highlights the dangerous state of
Russian politics, even in the most pro-western areas. ...
	   Once again, the West asks itself whether it should despair of
Russia ever adapting itself to the model of democracy and trade

question of the unraveling of the political system in all of Latin

worsening social conditions that have not improved under

	   Venezuela began its democracy forty years ago with an unusual
pact between the two of the country's principal parties that
guaranteed an institutional stability not known in the region at
that time.
	   But, at the same time, the leaders of the country never

on its oil revenues.
	   As a result, the Venezuelan economy is highly susceptible to the
world market's price fluctuations and has not diversified enough to
create jobs and allow for funds for programs of social support to
combat the rising unemployment and levels of poverty in the
country.
	   Chavez's victory also reflects the growing discontent with
Venezuela's traditional political system. But it also demonstrates
a phenomenon that is happening in other parts of the continent

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Palestinian prisoners:
	   The increasingly explosive issue of the release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails is threatening to spill over following
a decision by more than 2,000 prisoners to go on hunger strikes and
increased street protests in the occupied territories.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a typical display
of selective memory and abstinence, is set against releasing any
prisoner with `blood on his hands.' The problem here is that
Netanyahu has deliberately chosen not to recall the numerous
incidents in which Israelis, including his own foreign minister,
Ariel Sharon, have much blood to answer for themselves.
	   At the very least, a joint Palestinian-Israeli commission should
be established in order to consider each case on an individual
basis. Political prisoners, without `blood on their hands,' who are
being detained in Israel should be freed. In addition, Israel must
begin taking tougher action against its citizens, especially
settlers, accused of murdering or injuring Palestinians.
	   In order to keep any momentum of the Wye River deal going,
Israel should stop insulting the PNA and Palestinians by releasing
common criminals while those who stood up against the occupation
rot in jail.

hope. True, the bad news seems endless. In the latest installment
we have learnt that in the three months to September, the economy
shrank by 2.6 percent on an annualized basis, the fourth quarterly
contraction in a row. In the first half of the financial year
ending Sept. 30, corporate profits fell by almost half, despite
relatively buoyant overseas sales, and unemployment climbed to a
post-war record of 4.3 percent. ...
	   But analysts, for most part, remain skeptical Typical is the
response of the Japan Economic Research Center, a private
think-tank, which forecasts that the economy will continue to
shrink till 2002. The main reason for the lukewarm reception to the
package is that it's old sake in a new bottle. The cynics point out
that this is the government's ninth economic stimulus package since
1992, and that despite having pumped a total of some 100 trillion
yen into the economy over the last six years, the government has
little to show for it.

	   Der Taggespiegel, Berlin, on verdict against former East German
coach who gave swimmers steroids:
	   Yesterday was the end of the pilot trial against state doping in
the former East Germany, and still a couple of observers falsely
assert that it was a political trial. The West, so goes the
accusation, avenges its victory over East Germany before the court.
Seldom has the argument been more absurd. Doctors and coaches were
before the court because they played unscrupulously with the health
of minors. ... More meaningful than the degree of the sentences is
that there was a verdict at all. That made clear that the criminal
methods used by the top East German functionaries has been punished
in court.

	   Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland, on elections in St.
Petersburg, Russia:
	   The city elections in St. Petersburg have attracted the
attention of the whole world.
	   This is partly because the assembly which is being elected, in
Russia's second city, has powers of control over the mayor, which
is still unusual in Russia.
	   But it is also because of the recent assassination of lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova, which highlights the dangerous state of
Russian politics, even in the most pro-western areas. ...
	   Once again, the West asks itself whether it should despair of
Russia ever adapting itself to the model of democracy and trade
which it has been recommending for ten years. ...

Marxism, and the Russian pupil, it seems the wrong knowledge was

	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on Taiwan elections:
	   The election results show that voters have chosen political
stability on the island, shunning a hasty debate over independence,
which would only intensify tensions with China. The island's
political parties must now reexamine their policies as a result of
the voters' verdict Saturday.
	   Taiwan residents apparently did not want to see tensions grow
with China, which had become more assertive since (U.S. President
Bill) Clinton's announcement in June that he would not support
Taiwan's independence from China. The Nationalist Party's strategy
took advantage of this sentiment.
	   (President) Lee Teng-hui, who helped the island attain its
current prosperity and stability by promoting its uniqueness and
democratization, is expected to retire in 2000. Whatever its
result, the ensuing presidential election will prompt mainland
China to become more forceful with Taiwan.
	   What voters on the island demonstrated in the weekend elections
was their desire for a stable political framework that will not be
overwhelmed by the debate over whether Taiwan should seek
unification with China or independence, as Lee's term draws to and
end.

	   Le Figaro, Paris, on the far-right National Front party:
	   After much disillusionment, the ordinary voter put his faith in
the National Front. The shouts of his adversaries, the cascade of
denunciations, the vengeful parades, all this comforted his
fidelity. We only hate what we fear.
	   The chief of the National Front used Joan of Arc as a symbol,
for her courage, her intelligence and her purity. And reflections
from her armor shined like gold on the face of our national
populist chief.
	   Suddenly, it was finished. The magic image exploded; the myth
disappeared. The Front was not, of course, a virtuous league. Some
(Front politicians) maneuvered to have a good spot in the European
elections. Others, convinced that the charismatic chief _ as they
say _ was aging, tried to escort him gallantly out the door. As a
result, the prince slapped at his rebellious children. Certainly,
he had taught them the art of conspiracy. But he never dreamed that
his own barons would turn his arms against him.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Guardian, London, on the cloning of human embryos:
	   It was asked to answer one of the most challenging questions of
scientific ethics ever set, and it has probably got it right _
though of its nature we won't truly know for many years to come. A
working group of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and Human
Fertilization and Embryology Authority has recommended the
government to ban the cloning of humans, but to authorize _ for
very precise purposes _ new research using cloning techniques into
human embryos. If endorsed by the government, it could lead to a
revolution allowing replacement skin, muscle, and even nerve tissue
to be nurtured in the laboratory.
	   Faced at one end of the scale with such dazzling prospects _
that could enrich and prolong the lives of millions _ and at the
other end with the macabre prospect of cloning an entire human
begin, it was always going to be difficult for the committee to
decide where to draw the line. It can't play God so it has played
pragmatist instead.
	   It is difficult to make sense of a voyage of discovery when we
don't know what lies at the end.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph, London, on Chechnya's gruesome discovery:
	   The discovery of the severed heads of three Britons and a New
Zealander in a sack by a road in Chechnya is horrendous. Yet their
fate is not entirely surprising in a republic which has for long
been a cockpit of violence. Tsarist genocide in the 19th century,
wholesale deportation under Stalin and a brutal, incompetent
attempt to crush rebellion in the 1990s have been Moscow's
contributions to this dismal balance.
	   There are two obvious lessons to be drawn from the murders ...
The first is that Chechnya is an exceptionally dangerous place.
Foreign companies must weigh very carefully the prospective gain of
contracts there against the safety of their staff.
	   The second lesson is that deals with kidnappers merely make the
situation worse. It is difficult not to believe that the spate of
hostage-taking in the republic has been fed by the willingness of
those seeking the victims' release to pay ransoms.
	   The West had sympathy for the Chechens in their 21-month war of
independence. Having achieved that status in all but name, they
have rapidly turned the republic into a place to be shunned.
	    &UR; ___
	   Deming Headlight, Deming, New Mexico, on impeachment hearings:
	   President Clinton deserves all the criticism he's been getting
over lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. He has degraded
the office of the presidency.
	   But Congress should refrain from impeaching Clinton. Such a
decision would set a terrible precedent for the United States.
	   What Clinton did was not an abuse of power or a threat to the
republic. His misdeeds don't rise to the constitutional impeachment
standard of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
	   So far, the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings
have been marred by partisanship.
	   The committee's votes have consistently been along party lines.
History shows the pitfalls of impeachment probes guided by
partisanship. ...
	   During Watergate, both Democrats and Republicans seemed ready to
impeach President Nixon, who resigned in the nick of time. Nixon
clearly had abused his power many times.
	   The lack of agreement in Clinton's case indicates that
impeachment is not the right course. In fact, it's a dangerous one,
possibly igniting a partisan war for years to come.
	   Unless new evidence emerges, the better course would be to
censure Clinton for his actions, which would forever stain his
administration.

 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There is an old adage in American foreign
policy that politics and partisanship stop at the water's edge,
that critics fall silent when the president travels overseas to do
the nation's business.
	   But no longer. Certainly not for President Bill Clinton.
	   As Air Force One streaks across the Atlantic to the Mideast on
Saturday, the House Judiciary Committee will be staging a historic
vote on articles of impeachment, the first step toward possibly
evicting the president from office.
	   As Clinton opens a diplomatic mission to rescue the Wye River
land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians, he'll
face the more momentous _ and embarrassing _ challenge to save his
own presidency. His grave domestic problems likely will limit his
international clout.
	   It will be a short trip to Israel and the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip and West Bank _ only 3 1/2 days. But by the time he heads
home, the 435 members of the House will be turning from holiday
cheer to return to Washington for the deadly serious business of
voting on impeachment.
	   That cloud will hang over Clinton as he tries to salvage the
agreement he brokered with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in October.
	   ``Clearly it can't help,'' said Richard Haass, a Mideast expert
and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution. ``It's got to be distracting him. It can't strengthen
his hand. To put it bluntly, he's got to be careful about staking
out any controversial position that could lose him votes in the
House.
	   ``I would think Mr. Netanyahu knows this and it's hard to see
how this situtation enhances Clinton's leverage,'' Haass said.
``Any disposition he may have had to lean on Netanyahu has probably
been curtailed.''
	   Netanyahu himself is in political jeopardy and fighting for
survival, attacked by hawks for approving the Wye agreement and
assailed by doves for balking at implementing it. In dealing with
Clinton, the president's trouble ``probably increases his
disposition to hang tough,'' Haass said.
	   Overseas trips are supposed to enhance a president's image,
demonstrating global leadership and strengthening his hand at home.
Richard Nixon, the last president to face impeachment, tried to
boost his standing with a journey to the Soviet Union. Battered
politically and ailing physically with phlebitis, Nixon arrived in
Moscow in June 1974.
	   An editorial cartoon pictured Nixon sobbing at the airport on
the shoulder of Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet leader asking, ``Is
it really that bad?''
	   It was. Two months later, Nixon resigned.
	   Recalling the tradition that Congress tends to avoid weighty
actions or statements affecting the president while he is overseas,
Sen. James Inhofe, urged the president to delay his trip until
after the full House votes next week.
	   Inhofe said that would allow the House to finish work ``without
concern that its deliberations might be considered inappropriate at
a time that the president is conducting official business outside
the country.''
	   The White House said Clinton will leave on schedule. ``He's
doing it in the best interest of the peace process,'' spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.

Chechen video shows slain hostage claiming to be British spy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The Chechen government showed a videotape
Thursday of a kidnapped foreigner claiming to be a British spy
before he and three other victims were beheaded.
	   Chechen officials refused to say how the video was obtained, and
the victims' families and employers dismissed the ``confession'' as
forced.
	   On the tape, the hostage, identified as Peter Kennedy, said in
Russian that he and his colleagues had been sent to Chechnya by the
British secret service to monitor telephone conversations.
	   Their mission was to gather information to stop the spread of
Islamic fundamentalism in the region, he said.
	   All four hostages were visible in the tape, looking haggard and
wearing heavy beards.
	   The heads of the four hostages were found Tuesday after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security
forces were still searching Thursday for the men's bodies.
	   The victims _ Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ had been abducted by
gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny. Their killers remain at large.
	   Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov played the tape at a news
conference in Grozny, but he refused to answer any questions about
the tape, including where or when it was filmed and how the
government got it.
	   The government's possession of the tape was likely to raise
oft-repeated rumors that Chechen officials are linked to Chechnya's
wave of kidnappings.
	   The father of hostage Darren Hickey insisted the victims were
not spies. ``These confessions have obviously been forced out of
them after they have been threatened,'' Eamon Hickey said in
Surrey, England.
	   The hostages' employers, Britain's Granger Telecom, which has a
contract to set up a mobile phone service in Chechnya, also blasted
the spy claim.
	   ``There is no truth whatsoever to the suggestion that the former
telecommunication engineers had any association with any U.K.
intelligence organizations,'' a company spokesman said in England.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Russia, Mike Haddock,
refused direct comment, but said: ``Any reasonable analysis would
show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.''
	   On the tape, Kennedy said the group's purported mission of
helping install a telephone system was a front and the men were
using the equipment to monitor phone calls.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There is an old adage in American foreign
policy that politics and partisanship stop at the water's edge,
that critics fall silent when the president travels overseas to do
the nation's business.
	   But no longer. Certainly not for President Bill Clinton.
	   As Air Force One streaks across the Atlantic to the Mideast on
Saturday, the House Judiciary Committee will be staging a historic
vote on articles of impeachment, the first step toward possibly
evicting the president from office.
	   As Clinton opens a diplomatic mission to rescue the Wye River
land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians, he'll
face the more momentous _ and embarrassing _ challenge to save his
own presidency. His grave domestic problems likely will limit his
international clout.
	   It will be a short trip to Israel and the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip and West Bank _ only 3 1/2 days. But by the time he heads
home, the 435 members of the House will be turning from holiday
cheer to return to Washington for the deadly serious business of
voting on impeachment.
	   That cloud will hang over Clinton as he tries to salvage the
agreement he brokered with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in October.
	   ``Clearly it can't help,'' said Richard Haass, a Mideast expert
and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution. ``It's got to be distracting him. It can't strengthen
his hand. To put it bluntly, he's got to be careful about staking
out any controversial position that could lose him votes in the
House.
	   ``I would think Mr. Netanyahu knows this and it's hard to see
how this situtation enhances Clinton's leverage,'' Haass said.
``Any disposition he may have had to lean on Netanyahu has probably
been curtailed.''
	   Netanyahu himself is in political jeopardy and fighting for
survival, attacked by hawks for approving the Wye agreement and
assailed by doves for balking at implementing it. In dealing with
Clinton, the president's trouble ``probably increases his
disposition to hang tough,'' Haass said.
	   Overseas trips are supposed to enhance a president's image,
demonstrating global leadership and strengthening his hand at home.
Richard Nixon, the last president to face impeachment, tried to
boost his standing with a journey to the Soviet Union. Battered
politically and ailing physically with phlebitis, Nixon arrived in
Moscow in June 1974.
	   An editorial cartoon pictured Nixon sobbing at the airport on
the shoulder of Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet leader asking, ``Is
it really that bad?''
	   It was. Two months later, Nixon resigned.
	   Recalling the tradition that Congress tends to avoid weighty
actions or statements affecting the president while he is overseas,
Sen. James Inhofe, urged the president to delay his trip until
after the full House votes next week.
	   Inhofe said that would allow the House to finish work ``without
concern that its deliberations might be considered inappropriate at
a time that the president is conducting official business outside
the country.''
	   The White House said Clinton will leave on schedule. ``He's
doing it in the best interest of the peace process,'' spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Six astronauts jubilantly swung
open the doors to the new international space station and flipped
on the lights Thursday, becoming the first guests aboard the
250-mile-high outpost.
	   ``It's fantastic. I can't say how much this means to all of
us,'' radioed down Robert Cabana, commander of the attached shuttle
Endeavour.
	   Mission Control replied: ``You've opened the doors to a whole
new era in spaceflight.''
	   Cabana and Russia's Sergei Krikalev were the first to enter the
space station. Cabana beckoned for the cosmonaut to join him in
crossing the threshold of the U.S.-Russian complex. They floated in
side by side.
	   In addition to flipping on the lights, the astronauts installed
air ducts and fans and also planned to bring aboard clothes and
other supplies for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in 2000.
	   For the five Americans and one Russian _ and hundreds of flight
controllers below _ it was a moment for which they and their
countries had been striving for years.
	   The space station consists of only two rooms so far and is still
more than five years from completion. Its first permanent residents
_ Krikalev and two other men _ won't even move for another year.
But for the first time in nearly 25 years, NASA has a space station
of its own, with people on board.
	   ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' proclaimed
flight director Bob Castle.
	   The astronauts excitedly unlocked the three hatches leading from
Endeavour's crew cabin into Unity, the American-built chamber
launched aboard the shuttle one week ago. It was slow going; the
astronauts had to use wrenches to unbolt the tightly sealed hatches
and wait for the air pressure to equalize.
	   Unity was dark inside and so the astronauts took along
flashlights and lanterns. Upon entering, they flipped on the three
light switches.
	   ``We remember when Unity was just an aluminum shell,'' Cabana
said, admiring the spotless white and yellow walls. ``It's just so
nice inside. It's really nice to be in a new home.''
	   Then they set about opening the three remaining hatches leading
from Unity into Zarya, the Russian-made control module, and
squeezed into that portion, too, with Cabana and Krikalev again
leading the way.
	   At the top of their agenda once all the doors were opened:
installing electronics for Unity's antennas and replacing a faulty
battery charger inside Zarya. The astronauts also had to remove
hundreds of bolts and panels that were used to reinforce the
components for launch.
	   A third and final spacewalk to wrap up work outside the station
is scheduled for Saturday. The next component of the space station
is due to arrive late next summer from Kazakstan.
	   ``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,''
said Cabana. ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's
just a small beginning and it's only going to grow.''

Palestinians nullify clause on Israel's destruction, discuss
</HEADLINE>
violence &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with fresh quotes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership on
Thursday scrapped constitutional clauses rejecting Israel's
existence and said it would try to stop the latest spate of
violence _ moves that may smooth President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   Senior Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat voted overwhelmingly to
delete clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction,
a key condition of the Clinton-brokered Wye River talks two months
ago.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, said the
Palestinian Authority would take steps to stop attacks sparked by
Israel's refusal to release prisoners jailed on anti-Israel
charges.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive Saturday for a three-day visit
that had been designed to celebrate Wye, but that has now become an
effort to save the agreement.
	   The Palestinians have said that a meeting on Monday they will
``affirm'' the annulment of the offensive passages.
	   Zanoun said the vote among the 105 Palestine Central Council
members _ out of 124 _ who were present was 81 for, seven against
and seven abstaining. They reaffirmed a letter that Arafat had sent
Clinton, declaring the articles null and void.
	   The PCC is the executive arm of the Palestinians organization
and its second highest body. On Monday the highest body, the larger
Palestinian National Council, will discuss the issue.
	   Israel wants the PNC to formally vote to scrap the clause, while
the Palestinian side feels an ``affirmation'' of the scrapping by
the legislative body is enough.
	   At Wye, both sides agreed both PCC and PNC must delete the
clause.
	   White House spokesman David Leavy described Thursday's decision
by the PCC as ``an important and welcomed step toward implementing
the Wye accords.''
	   Immediately after Monday's PNC session, five percent of the West
Bank is to be transferred from Israeli control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu, who froze the pullback over what he said were
Palestinian violations of the accord, said Thursday he has ordered
the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a ``firm
hand.''
	   The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in
recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched on Thursday in
the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stonemason, Jihad Iyad, who
was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.
	   Netanyahu says the Palestinian leadership is responsible for the
riots, a charge the Palestinians have strongly denied _ although
Rajoub, the security chief, acknowledged that the Clinton
administration had also pressured the authority to control the
streets.
	   ``The Americans want the situation to calm down,'' he said.
``It's in their interest with President Clinton's visit to the
area.''
	   He said that he was taking steps ``to calm the situation.''
	   A recent spat came when Israel released its first batch of
prisoners, as agreed under Wye. Most were common criminals, rather
than people jailed for politically motivated violence of actions
against Israel.
	   Netanyahu has said he will not release killers or members of
militant Islamic groups. Up to 900 of the 2,000 Palestinians in
Israeli jails are neither.
	   Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Thursday that the
Palestinians had accepted a compromise worked out by Clinton's
envoy to the region: all three sides going through the list of
security prisoners one by one.
	   On Thursday, signs reading ``Clinton go home'' were strung along
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. Posters
showing a photo montage of Clinton wearing a checkered headdress, a
symbol of Palestinian nationalism, were plastered on some walls.

Americans end up on opposite sides of Israeli-Palestinian conflict

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ What do an Israeli peace activist, an adviser
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a suspected Islamic militant
and a Palestinian human rights lawyer have in common?
	   They are all Americans.
	   About 100,000 U.S. citizens, either American-born or
naturalized, have left the Land of the Free for the Holy Land to
form one of the largest expatriate communities in the world.
	   They have ended up on opposite sides of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, and President Bill Clinton's arrival on a peace mission
is bringing those differences into sharp relief.
	   ``He is personally trying to force Israel into a situation which
could threaten Israeli security and its existence as a state,''
said David Wilder, who moved to Israel from Cleveland and now lives
in the West Bank city of Hebron. ``Clinton should stay home.''
	   Some expatriates who support peacemaking, however, hope Clinton
can rescue the Wye River accord he helped negotiate. Jeremy
Ben-Ami, a former senior Clinton adviser who moved to Israel, said
the president faced a difficult task.
	   ``I think it's really hard to imagine this visit coming at a
worse time,'' Ben-Ami said of the daily recriminations between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority over implementation of the
peace accord.
	   ``I'm not even sure someone of Clinton's talents can make
something out of this really bad situation,'' he said.
	   Many Americans came to Israel in a rush of pride after its
victory in the 1967 war. Some sought to practice their Zionist and
religious beliefs. Some just fell in love with Jerusalem's stony
hills.
	   Most of the tens of thousands of Palestinian-American
expatriates were born in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and left after
1967 to escape Israeli occupation. They returned with U.S.
passports and a greater sense of freedom.
	   Janet Aviad, who leads the Peace Now group in Israel, said she
absorbed her belief in equality while growing up in Philadelphia.
	   ``All kids have heroes and mine was (Abraham) Lincoln,'' said
Aviad, who has often protested Israeli human rights abuses in the
West Bank and faced down Israeli soldiers.
	   Other Americans saw themselves as modern pioneers.
	   One-sixth of the 420 settlers living in heavily fortified
enclaves in the divided town of Hebron are Americans. The community
is considered one of the most militant, with settlers frequently
engaged in friction with Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu himself spent a large part of his childhood and
student years in the United States, and is known for the excellent
English and media-savvy ways he picked up in America.
	   His senior policy adviser, David Bar-Illan, is one of five top
aides to Netanyahu who are native or naturalized Americans.
	   On the other side of the issues is Jonathan Kuttab, a
Palestinian human rights lawyer who spent 10 years in Virginia and
New York. That time, he said, helped him understand why Americans
are generally more sympathetic to Israel than to the Palestinians.
	   ``Most Americans are ignorant of the situation'' in the Middle
East and Israel does a better job presenting its case, Kuttab said.

Irking U.S., Canadian lawmakers urge review of NATO nuclear
</HEADLINE>
strategy &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ In a report that irked U.S. officials, a Canadian
parliamentary committee Thursday recommended that NATO reduce the
alert status of its nuclear arsenal and re-examine its nuclear
strategy.
	   The report, requested by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, is the product of two years of hearings and research
reassessing Canada's policies on disarmament, arms control and
nuclear nonproliferation.
	   The challenge for the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee
was to address a fundamental contradiction in Canadian foreign
policy: Canada seeks to be loyal member of NATO yet also is
committed to global nuclear disarmament.
	   The committee urged Canada to ``argue forcefully'' that NATO
should include nuclear policy in a current review of its strategic
mission. The United States opposes this.
	   ``It's a little bit strange that one would want to start opening
up a debate in NATO on something like this when there's no
compelling need to do so,'' said a U.S. official who reacted to the
report on condition of anonymity.
	   He said such a debate ``risks being quite divisive.''
	   The committee also went against U.S. policy by calling for the
``de-alerting'' of all nuclear weapons, including NATO's. This
would involve de-coupling warheads from their missiles
	   The American official said the United States already has taken
steps to reduce the chance of an inadvertent nuclear launch, and
opposed de-alerting for a variety of reasons, including concern
over security for storing warheads.
	   The committee's 15 recommendations now go to the government of
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, which has up to 150 days to decide
which, if any, to accept as official policy.
	   Axworthy urged the committee to consult experts with a wide
range of views, though he has a long-term personal interest in
disarmament.
	   In a speech at this week's NATO foreign ministers' meeting in
Brussels, he said any discussion of NATO use of nuclear weapons _
even in retaliation _ ``raises very difficult questions of means,
proportionality and effectiveness that causes us significant
concern.''
	   He cautioned that NATO might be providing excuses to would-be
nuclear powers if its policy suggested a belief that possession of
nuclear weapons carries political and diplomatic clout.
	   The U.S. official said Washington would be satisfied with some
parts of the Canadian report, but he found the overall tone
objectionable.
	   ``The most troubling thing about it is a mistaken intellectual
premise that nothing much is happening on disarmament, that the
nuclear powers are all standing around twiddling their thumbs,'' he
said. ``That is not supported by the facts.''
	   Within the committee, there was some disagreement among the four
opposition parties. Two left-of-center parties wanted the report to
go farther and urge NATO to abandon the option of first-use of
nuclear weapons.
	   The conservative Reform Party warned against ``naive and
idealistic'' disarmament efforts that might leave the world
vulnerable to terrorists and rogue states.

CORRECTS figure of PCC members to 95 sted 105 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership on
Thursday scrapped constitutional clauses rejecting Israel's
existence and said it would try and stem a wave of violence that
has jeopardized the peace _ moves that may smooth President Bill
Clinton's troubled visit to the region.
	   A group of senior Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat voted
overwhelmingly to declare clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction null and void, a key condition of the
Clinton-brokered Wye River talks two months ago.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, said the
Palestinian Authority would take steps to stem a wave of riots
sparked by Israel's refusal to release prisoners jailed on
anti-Israel charges.
	   Selim Zanoun, who announced the decision by the Palestine
Central Council to nullify the offending passages, , said that the
larger Palestine National Council would not take up the same vote
when it hosts Clinton on Monday.
	   The meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' said
Zanoun, who chairs the PNC.
	   Clinton is arriving Saturday night for a three-day visit that
was meant to celebrate Wye, but that has turned into an effort to
salvage it.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended
Thursday's vote, but said that a failure to vote on Monday could
scupper the agreement.
	   ``We expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote
in an unequivocal matter... if there is to be further
implementation,'' said David Bar-Illan.
	   The Palestinians have said that the meeting Monday will
``affirm'' the annulment of the offensive passages, but have not
said what that exactly means.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Zanoun said the vote among the 95 PCC members _ out of 124 _ who
were present was 81 for, seven against and seven abstaining. They
reaffirmed a letter that Arafat had sent Clinton, declaring the
articles null and void.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord met no resistance from a
nine-man RKC Waalwijk Thursday, won 5-0 and is starting to look
like the Dutch champion elect after less than half the season.
	   Feyenoord (13-2-1) regained its six-point lead with a game in
hand lead over Vitesse (11-2-4). The top two meet Sunday. Ajax
(9-5-3) is third on 32 points and plays fourth-placed Heerenveen
the same day.
	   Patrick Paauwe traded passes with Julio Ricardo Cruz, skipped
past keeper Rob van Dijk and made it 1-0 on 20 minutes from a tight
angle.
	   Adri Bogers' second yellow card came on 31 minutes as he
body-checked a goalbound Jon Dahl Tomasson just outside the penalty
area.
	   Then a horrible error from van Dijk, who completely missed a
corner, presented Cruz with a tap-in for the second.
	   It just wasn't RKC's day. Captain Maarten Schops' lunging
challenge on Ulrich van Gobbel was also his second yellow card
offense and the Waalwijkers were down to nine men at the half.
	   RKC's constant offside trap worked well for 20 minutes in the
second half but Tomasson notched the third and a clean-through
Bonaventure Kalou toe-poked the fourth.
	   Paul Bosvelt's accurate side-footer into the top corner made it
5-0.
	   Vitesse's new Ghanean striker Mamadou Zongo produced two
clinical finishes to give the Arnhem side a 2-0 victory at NAC
Breda Wednesday.
	   It was Vitesse's second straight away win after three months
without a victory on the road, and was achieved without five
injured first-string players.
	   The Vitesse defense looked a mess throughout the game but NAC is
second to bottom and its strikers never looked likely to score.
	   NAC defender Jeffrey van As was sent off near the end for
punching Vitesse's Michel Kreek.

Iran's Parliament speaker condemns attack on Americans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line speaker of Parliament said
Thursday that last month's attack on a group of American visitors
was ``inappropriate,'' the official news agency reported.
	   But Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said a failure to explain the purpose
of the visit also provoked ``suspicion'' about the delegation.
	   Vigilantes, wielding iron bars and throwing stones smashed the
windows of a bus carrying 13 foreigners, mostly Americans, on its
way through Tehran.
	   ``From what I have read, the members of the delegation were
businessmen, who traveled in the name of tourists,'' the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted Nateq-Nouri as saying.
	   ``We need sympathy and cooperation from all the officials,''
Nateq-Nouri added, stressing the need to refrain from any
provocation.
	   ``Violence has always been condemned and if it continues, it
will lead to anarchy,'' he said.
	   It was the first time that a conservative within the ruling
clerical hierarchy has spoken against the Nov. 21 attack.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate reformer who is engaged
in a power struggle with hard-liners, condemned the attack as a
national disgrace and ``an insult to the government.''
	   A radical Muslim group, Fedayeen Islam, claimed responsibility
for the attack, saying it was directed at ``U.S. spies'' and those
``who invited them'' _ an apparent reference to Khatami's call for
cultural exchanges between Iran and the United States.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly after the
1979 revolution.

Volkswagen workers agree to wage cuts to avoid dismissals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Faced with the specter of unemployment,
workers at the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen, the country's
largest automaker, Thursday approved the company's proposal to
slash wages and reduce the work week.
	   The press office of the Metalworkers Union in Sao Bernardo do
Campo, the Sao Paulo industrial suburb where Volkswagen's plant is
located, said the proposal was ``overwhelmingly approved.''
	   Volkswagen said the measures were necessary to avoid firing
close to 8,000 of its 26,000 workers.
	   Under the proposal, workers earning more than 2,416 reals (dlrs
2,000) a month, will have their wages reduced by 15 percent. This
will affect about 3,400 workers.
	   A 2.98 percent wage increase, agreed to previously, and the
2,100 reals (dlrs 1,750) in profit sharing earnings will be paid
over a 12-month period.
	   An early retirement program was also introduced and retired
workers who were rehired will be dismissed.
	   Brazilian legislation permits companies to rehire workers who
have met retirement requisites. These workers then receive part of
their social security pension payments as well as a monthly salary.
	   Volkswagen, did not say how many workers would be affected by
these two measures.
	   The company also reduced the work week from 42 to 35 hours.
	   Volkswagen expects the measures will result in savings of about
200 million reals (dlrs 166 million) in 1999.
	   Brazil's auto industry has seen sales plummet since late last
year when the effects of the first Asian crisis reached the
country.
	   Inventories of unsold cars today stand at 200,000 vehicles
parked in factory yards and in dealers.
	   Figures compiled by the National Association of Vehicle
Manufacturers show that January-to-November sales plunged 29
percent compared to the first 11 months of 1997.

Pragmatic and fanciful, Nobel laureates receive their prizes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Leads throughout to UPDATE with Saramago quotes from
banquet &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nine Nobel Prize winners received their
awards Thursday for work ranging from investigating the behavior of
infinitesimal electrons to pondering the huge issues of human
existence.
	   The literature, physics, chemistry, medicine and economics
prizes _ each worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 943,000) _ were
presented in a solemn ceremony at Stockholm's main concert hall by
King Carl XVI Gustaf, after which the laureates and some 1,200
other people gathered for a banquet at the castle-like city hall.
	   The banquet is an elaborate and lengthy affair of processions
and toasts. Servers delivered each course with quasi-military
precision, with the dessert course an especial spectacle,
delievered with the halls's lights dimmed and the each serving
plate cleverly lit so that the ice cream glowed red.
	   There's more show than talk. Speeches _ one for each prize _ are
limited to two minutes apiece.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago, who won the prize for his
ability at combining fancy and social commentary, concentrated on
his serious side, noting that Thursday also marked the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ''It is not to be expected that governments in the next 50 years
will do what they did not accomplish during the 50 years we now
celebrate. Let us common citizens therefore speak out,'' he said.
	   Saramago's works include 1986's '''The Stone Raft,'' in which
the Iberian Peninsula snaps off from the rest of the European
continent and floats into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical
search for identity, and ''Blindness,'' in which an inexplicable
epidemic of blindness is a metaphor for social decay.
	   While Saramago uses fanciful science to lead readers to think
about human issues, physics co-laureate Robert Laughlin used whimsy
to explain science.
	   ''Babies have a natural oneness with nature that makes them a
natural vehicle for even the most abstruse concepts of our field,''
he told the banquet. ''It is an experimental fact that time runs
slower in the vicinity of babies, especially at night.''
	   Laughlin, of Stanford University, shares the prize with Horst
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel Tsui of Princeton
University for discovering how electrons can change behavior and
act more like fluid than particles.
	   The medicine prize is shared by Americans Robert Furchgott of
the State University of New York, Louis Ignarro of the University
of California-Los Angeles and Ferid Murad of the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston, for their work in discovering how
nitric oxide does its life-saving work of dilating blood vessels.
	   Nitric oxide also plays a role in the working of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra and the laureates say it is likely to
have wide new applications in counteracting asthma and coronary
disease.
	   Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar, won the economics prize for his
work in examining the causes behind famines and other catastrophes.
He is a specialist in welfare economics, the discipline that tries
to establish quantitative ways of assessing quality of life.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions. Kohn did not come to Stockholm because of an illness in
his family; he plans to come for the 1999 ceremony, according to
the Nobel Foundation.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, also received their prizes on Thursday, in
ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.

Astronauts swing open doors, flip on lights of `fantastic' new

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Six astronauts jubilantly swung
open the doors to the new international space station and flipped
on the lights Thursday, becoming the first guests aboard the
250-mile-high outpost.
	   ``It's fantastic. I can't say how much this means to all of
us,'' radioed down Robert Cabana, commander of the attached shuttle
Endeavour.
	   Mission Control replied: ``You've opened the doors to a whole
new era in spaceflight.''
	   Cabana and Russia's Sergei Krikalev were the first to enter the
space station. Cabana beckoned for the cosmonaut to join him in
crossing the threshold of the U.S.-Russian complex. They floated in
side by side.
	   In addition to flipping on the lights, the astronauts installed
air ducts and fans and also planned to bring aboard clothes and
other supplies for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in 2000.
	   For the five Americans and one Russian _ and hundreds of flight
controllers below _ it was a moment for which they and their
countries had been striving for years.
	   The space station consists of only two rooms so far and is still
more than five years from completion. Its first permanent residents
_ Krikalev and two other men _ won't even move for another year.
But for the first time in nearly 25 years, NASA has a space station
of its own, with people on board.
	   ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' proclaimed
flight director Bob Castle.
	   The astronauts excitedly unlocked the three hatches leading from
Endeavour's crew cabin into Unity, the American-built chamber
launched aboard the shuttle one week ago. It was slow going; the
astronauts had to use wrenches to unbolt the tightly sealed hatches
and wait for the air pressure to equalize.
	   Unity was dark inside and so the astronauts took along
flashlights and lanterns. Upon entering, they flipped on the three
light switches.
	   ``We remember when Unity was just an aluminum shell,'' Cabana
said, admiring the spotless white and yellow walls. ``It's just so
nice inside. It's really nice to be in a new home.''
	   Then they set about opening the three remaining hatches leading
from Unity into Zarya, the Russian-made control module, and
squeezed into that portion, too, with Cabana and Krikalev again
leading the way.
	   At the top of their agenda once all the doors were opened:
installing electronics for Unity's antennas and replacing a faulty
battery charger inside Zarya. The astronauts also had to remove
hundreds of bolts and panels that were used to reinforce the
components for launch.
	   A third and final spacewalk to wrap up work outside the station
is scheduled for Saturday. The next component of the space station
is due to arrive late next summer from Kazakstan.
	   ``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,''
said Cabana. ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's
just a small beginning and it's only going to grow.''

CORRECTS figure of PCC members to 95 sted 105 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership on
Thursday scrapped constitutional clauses rejecting Israel's
existence and said it would try and stem a wave of violence that
has jeopardized the peace _ moves that may smooth President Bill
Clinton's troubled visit to the region.
	   A group of senior Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat voted
overwhelmingly to declare clauses of the PLO charter calling for
Israel's destruction null and void, a key condition of the
Clinton-brokered Wye River talks two months ago.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, said the
Palestinian Authority would take steps to stem a wave of riots
sparked by Israel's refusal to release prisoners jailed on
anti-Israel charges.
	   Selim Zanoun, who announced the decision by the Palestine
Central Council to nullify the offending passages, said that the
larger Palestine National Council would not take up the same vote
when it hosts Clinton on Monday.
	   The meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' said
Zanoun, who chairs the PNC.
	   Clinton is arriving Saturday night for a three-day visit that
was meant to celebrate Wye, but that has turned into an effort to
salvage it.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended
Thursday's vote, but said that a failure to vote on Monday could
scupper the agreement.
	   ``We expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote
in an unequivocal matter... if there is to be further
implementation,'' said David Bar-Illan.
	   The Palestinians have said that the meeting Monday will
``affirm'' the annulment of the offensive passages, but have not
said what that exactly means.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   It is unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such
a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit,
to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, has failed.
	   Zanoun said the vote among the 95 PCC members _ out of 124 _ who
were present was 81 for, seven against and seven abstaining. They
reaffirmed a letter that Arafat had sent Clinton, declaring the
articles null and void.

Pinochet's fate overshadows South American summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The shadow of Chile's former
dictator Augusto Pinochet loomed over a trade summit here, forcing
leaders to come to grips with an often-uncomfortable past.
	   Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a political exile
in the 1960s, spoke of his ``horror'' of dictators. Bolivian
President Gen. Hugo Banzer, a former dictator, was notably silent.
	   In the end, leaders of the Mercosur trade bloc _ Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, plus associate members Bolivia and
Chile _ struggled to produce a statement that both supported Chile
and implicitly condemned Pinochet.
	   The statement, released Thursday, rejects the idea that one
country can apply its laws to another. At the same time, it
supports the progress in holding violators accountable for human
rights crimes.
	   Chile claims England trampled on its rights by arresting
Pinochet and allowing Spain to begin extradition proceedings.
Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon wants to try Pinochet for torture,
genocide and kidnapping.
	   Members had hoped to avoid the issue. British minister Jack
Straw was expected to decide on Pinochet's fate on Friday, after
the two-day summit would have ended.
	   Instead, he decided on Wednesday, and the issue immediately took
center stage.
	   At the final session Thursday, Chilean President Eduardo Frei
won support for his claim that the decision is a slap at Chile's
legal sovereignty.
	   Among the most indignant was President Carlos Menem of
Argentina, Chile's historic rival. Menem, who pardoned the leaders
of Argentina's vicious 1976-83 dictatorship, suggested that Garzon
should go after the henchmen of the late Spanish dictator Francisco
Franco instead of Pinochet.
	   ``I would like to ask (Garzon) if he has tried just one, just
one of Franco's'' men, Menem said. ``But his guy now gets involved
with one of ours. This is intolerable.''
	   Menen said that three years ago, in Rome, he had proposed
creating international courts to try human rights violations, but
the idea was shot down. Among the opponents was the United States,
he said.
	   Although Argentina's former dictator Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla
now is under house arrest, a Swiss attempt to extradite him was
rejected.
	   ``We Argentines will not permit the violation of our
sovereignty,'' Menem said.
	   Cardoso, who fled to Chile to escape Brazil's 1964-85
dictatorship, straddled the fence.
	   ``Dictatorships and dictators cause me horror, even more those
who torture and kill,'' he said. ``I have no reason to defend
(Pinochet). But Chile should be allowed to make its own
decisions.''
	   Cardoso praised Frei for making tough decisions ``when it
appears that one is defending what is indefensible.'' But he added:
``We are dealing with principles, with actions of judges who have
no mandate to try people beyond their borders.''
	   Brazil also granted an amnesty to former military rulers,
although Cardoso's administration has approved cash payments to
many victims of the regime.
	   Almost silent were Banzer and Paraguayan President Raul Cubas,
who recently pardoned a general who led a coup attempt in 1996.
Banzer, who ruled for seven years until he was toppled by an aide
in 1978, avoided the human rights issue altogether.

Presidents stress need for greater integration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Brazil-Pinochet-Mercosur &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The presidents of countries in the
Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur) declared Thursday that
greater regional integration is the key to confronting the
repercussions of the international financial crisis.
	   In their official joint statement, the leaders reiterated that
integration is a priority for the trade bloc formed by Brazil,
Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, with Chile and Bolivia as
associate members.
	   ``Integration is an effective instrument to confront the
insecurities arising from the instability in international
financial markets. Once consolidated and deepened, it will
strengthen the capacity to act abroad,'' the statement read.
	   The presidents also agreed to postpone the implementation of a
single automobile tariff until 2004, to give their countries time
to make their auto industries more competitive. The original target
date for the single tariff was Dec. 31, 1999.
	   Outside the meeting, about 150 students protesting Brazil's
economic belt-tightening measures, the recent aid package from the
International Monetary Fund and unemployment clashed with riot
troops.
	   Three of the protesters were injured and four were arrested.

England's Chelsea after River Plate striker Juan Antonio Pizzi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ English Premier League team
Chelsea is close to acquiring striker Juan Antonio Pizzi of
Argentina's River Plate, a Buenos Aires sports daily reported
Wednesday.
	   The English club is reportedly prepared to pay dlrs 3,000,000
for Pizzi, who played for the Spanish national team in this year's
World Cup before heading to River Plate.
	   The deal would reunite Pizzi with Spaniard Albert Ferrer, a duo
which played together last season for Spain's Barcelona.
	   The remaining obstacle appeared to be a dlrs 2,000,000 payment
River Plate agreed to give Barcelona should the Argentine team
decide to sell him, according to the report in Ole.
	   Pizzi has scored 9 goals in 23 games for River, which has
struggled this season in Argentina's first-division.
	   Argentine-born but a naturalized Spaniard, Pizzi was expected to
fill the void created by former River star Marcelo Salas, who was
transferred this year to Lazio of Italy's top division.

IMF pleased with progress in Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund's director
says South Korea's repayment of $2.8 billion of its international
debt is being viewed as ``a watershed'' in its emergence from last
year's financial crisis.
	   Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said that since
entering into an agreement with the IMF a year ago, South Korea has
``significantly strengthened its external position,'' building up
usable reserves to about dlrs 47 billion.
	   Camdessus, in a statement Tuesday, noted that the won has
increased in value during the year.
	   ``In light of Koreas reduced vulnerability at this time, it is
entirely appropriate that the country begins to repay resources
borrowed from the IMF,'' he said.
	   ``I believe that the international financial community will
judge this repayment favorably and that it marks an important
watershed in the process of Koreas emergence from last years
foreign exchange crisis,'' he said.
	   Camdessus said, however, that the IMF stands ready to help Korea
again if it needs new borrowing.

Kwan ignores confusing state of skating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Michelle Kwan doesn't concern herself with any
figure skating power plays. She leaves that to the politicians and
rulemakers.
	   Kwan concentrates on what she does best: skating. This weekend,
she'll headline the strongest field of any event this season in the
World Pro Championships.
	   Wait a minute? Pro skating?
	   This year, at least, the International Skating Union, which
governs the Olympic-eligible level, sanctioned certain pro-am
competitions. The world pros at the MCI Center is one of them.
	   It's also the biggest challenge Kwan will have _ not even at the
national championships in February will she face anything near the
competition in this event.
	   ``This competition is a great event because it is a chance for
all of us as amateurs to compete against professionals,'' she said.
``I'll get to skate against Lu Chen and Maria Butyrskaya, and also
work on my short program and interpretive long program.
	   ``It will help me throughout the year and heading into other
competitions and for next year.''
	   Kwan hasn't committed to nationals yet, but barring injury,
she's a lock to compete in Salt Lake City. But with Tara Lipinski
no longer eligible and Nicole Bobek still slumping, Kwan might
easily win her third national crown.
	   ``I hope to be there, but I want to be 100 percent,'' she said.
``I love competing at nationals and it's in Salt Lake, where the
(2002) Olympics will be, which is another good point.''
	   Is 2002 on her agenda, as well?
	   ``I think it would be fun to test the waters,'' said the Olympic
silver medalist and two-time world champion. ``It was pretty
confirmed when I finished the long program at Nagano _ even before
then _ I knew what I liked best was competing. When I stop liking
that, it's the time I will be ready to move on.''
	   She moves into the world pros with a triple lutz-triple toe loop
combination in her repertoire. But she isn't expecting to use it,
sticking to an easier triple toe loop-triple toe loop combo.
	   Kwan realizes she must continue to upgrade her technical skating
and jumps. One reason she lost the Olympic gold medal to Lipinski
was her rival's willingness to try more difficult maneuvers. Kwan
will soon need those moves.
	   ``People who are coming up will be very strong and determined,
and you have to be ahead of the game and keep on working,'' she
said. ``I still have to put in the same effort, determination and
motivation to reach 2002. I know it won't be easy.''
	   The competition Friday and Saturday nights isn't too tough, and
it's familiar to Kwan. She usually handles Chen, Butyrskaya and
Bobek easily. 1994 Olympic champion Oksana Baiul is making a rare
competitive appearance, while Katarina Witt also hasn't skated much
this year.
	   That could leave Yuka Sato of Japan, who has performed well as a
professional, as Kwan's chief challenger.
	   Among the men, world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia,
five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge and 1996 U.S. winner Rudy
Galindo face Canada's Browning, who has dominated the pro level the
last three years.
	   The pairs features Olympic champions Oksana Kazakova and Artur
Dmitriev of Russia, and bronze medalists Mandy Wotzel and Ingo
Steuer of Germany.
	   For once, there will be extra focus on the dance. Two-time
Olympic champions Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov will be there _
but with different partners. Grishuk now skates with Alexander
Zhulin, with whom she admits to once having an affair while he was
married to Maya Usova. Platov, meanwhile, now skates with Usova.
	   It will be the first meeting for the estranged-united couples.
	   ``I just want to say we are all human, and, of course, we make
some mistakes,'' Zhulin said. ``I'm sorry for my actions.
	   ``We're thinking about the future, new programs, just thinking
about the future, nothing about the past.''

Pragmatic and fanciful, Nobel laureates receive their prizes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Saramago quotes from banquet &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nine Nobel Prize winners received their
awards on Thursday for work ranging from the behavior of tiny
electrons to pondering the huge issues of human existence.
	   The literature, physics, chemistry, medicine and economics
prizes _ each worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 943,000) _ were
presented at Stockholm's main concert hall by King Carl XVI Gustaf,
after which the laureates and some 1,200 other people gathered for
a banquet at the castle-like city hall.
	   The banquet is an elaborate and lengthy affair of processions
and toasts. Servers delivered each course with quasi-military
precision. The dessert was delivered under dimmed lights and with
each serving plate lit to make the ice cream glowed red.
	   There's more show than talk. Speeches _ one for each prize _ are
limited to two minutes each.
	   Literature laureate Jose Saramago, who won the prize for his
tongue-in-cheek social commentary, concentrated on his serious
side, noting that Thursday marked the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``It is not to be expected that governments in the next 50 years
will do what they did not accomplish during the 50 years we now
celebrate. Let us common citizens therefore speak out,'' he said.
	   Saramago's works include 1986's '''The Stone Raft,'' in which
the Iberian Peninsula snaps off from the rest of the European
continent and floats into the North Atlantic in a metaphorical
search for identity.
	   While Saramago uses fanciful science to lead readers to think
about human issues, physics co-laureate Robert Laughlin used whimsy
to explain science.
	   ``Babies have a natural oneness with nature that makes them a
natural vehicle for even the most abstruse concepts of our field,''
he told the banquet. ``It is an experimental fact that time runs
slower in the vicinity of babies, especially at night.''
	   Laughlin, of Stanford University, shares the prize with Horst
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel Tsui of Princeton
University for discovering how electrons can change behavior and
act more like fluid than particles.
	   The medicine prize is shared by Americans Robert Furchgott of
the State University of New York, Louis Ignarro of the University
of California-Los Angeles and Ferid Murad of the University of
Texas Medical School in Houston, for their work in discovering how
nitric oxide dilates blood vessels.
	   Nitric oxide also plays a role in the working of the
anti-impotence drug Viagra and the laureates say it is likely to
have wide new applications in counteracting asthma and coronary
disease.
	   Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar, won the economics prize for his
work in examining the causes behind famines and other catastrophes.
He is a specialist in welfare economics, the discipline that tries
to establish quantitative ways of assessing quality of life.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern
University for ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions.
Kohn did not come to Stockholm because of an illness in his family;
he plans to come for the 1999 ceremony, according to the Nobel
Foundation.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble and John Hume of
Northern Ireland, also received their prizes on Thursday, in
ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.

Iraq cooperated with some inspections but interfered with others
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors presented a mixed
assessment Thursday of Iraq's cooperation ahead of a final report
on whether Baghdad is keeping its promise to allow unfettered
access to key documents and weapons sites.
	   In his weekly report to the Security Council, chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler said Iraq cooperated in some inspections
but placed unacceptable conditions on photographing bombs,
prevented videotaping at one site, and blocked the search of a
political party office.
	   He said the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, had
evidence that the ruling Baath Party office ``contained materials
of significance to UNSCOM's disarmament mandate.''
	   But he said Iraq refused to allow ``a credible, effective
inspection'' of the site on Wednesday, despite extended discussions
and appeals.
	   Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of the party's leadership, told a
news conference on the steps of the two-story building in Baghdad
on Thursday that U.N. teams would not be allowed to enter.
	   Butler said U.N. inspectors were also prevented from
photographing bombs during a chemical monitoring inspection Dec. 5.
Iraqi officials also attempted to prevent videotaping and refused
to answer questions during a biological weapons inspection the same
day, he said.
	   Butler reported no problems with two teams investigating Iraq's
biological warfare program and a team doing preliminary technical
work for enhanced monitoring of Iraqi missiles tests.
	   On Thursday, an inspection team was delayed for approximately
one hour before gaining access to a site considered ``sensitive''
by Iraqi officials, UNSCOM spokesman Ewen Buchanan said. He
declined to identify the site.
	   Under rules for inspecting ``sensitive'' sites, including
offices associated with military and civilian intelligence agencies
and the Republican Guard, the size of inspection teams is to be
determined by the lead U.N. inspector and Iraqi officials.
	   ``That process _ discussion _ caused the delay,'' Buchanan said.
	   The surprise inspections which began Tuesday are the final test
of Iraq's compliance with the inspectors before Butler reports to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan early next week on whether
Baghdad has kept its promise to fully cooperate in the search for
banned weapons. Annan will then report to the Security Council on
Butler's findings.
	   The United States and Britain called off airstrikes after Iraq
pledged to resume cooperation with UNSCOM on Nov. 14. Washington
and London maintain that military strikes remain an option to
compel Baghdad to cooperate with inspectors.
	   The council must decide that Iraq is fully cooperating with
inspectors before it will undertake a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting sweeping economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, though the United States insists there is no link to
ending sanctions.
	   UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify
that Baghdad has eliminated banned weapons before the Security
Council can lift sanctions.

DiMaggio's lungs drained after congestion worsens slightly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with intestinal infection clearing &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHEL LA CORTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Doctors treated a persistent infection
in American baseball great Joe DiMaggio's lungs Thursday, hoping to
relieve congestion that grew worse overnight and clouded his
overall health picture once again.
	   Still, despite a low-grade fever and the increased congestion,
DiMaggio was in stable condition after the procedure, and his blood
pressure, heart and kidneys were all performing well, his doctor
said.
	   ``It's not necessarily a turn for the worse, but it clearly
would be better if he didn't have this,'' said Dr. Earl Barron, who
has treated DiMaggio for five years.
	   Doctors drained infected material from his lungs _ a procedure
that helped DiMaggio rally on Monday, after he was described as
near death.
	   ``His lungs continue to be congested and there's probably still
some residual infection,'' Barron said. ``We were not able to
suction nearly as much material today, which is a good sign. It
means he's not producing as much.''
	   DiMaggio, who battled back from a fever and low white blood-cell
count during the weekend, remains on a respirator at Memorial
Regional Hospital, a wing of which is named for the 84-year-old
Hall of Famer.
	   Barron said DiMaggio's prognosis is guarded and day-to-day.
	   ``This is not a peak or a valley, it's really a stable
situation,'' the doctor said. ``We would like to see things
improving, obviously. It hasn't happened, but we're just hoping
that it will.
	   ``I'm not going to tell you he's not going to survive,'' the
doctor said. ``I'm not going to say any of those things because he
can still turn around and survive beautifully.''
	   The hope is to get him to breathe on his own, but with the
increased congestion DiMaggio will not be taken off the respirator
anytime soon, Barron said.
	   Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's attorney and longtime friend, said
he had asked Barron to rate the former New York Yankees center
fielder on a scale of 0-to-10, with zero being the worst and 10 the
best.
	   ``On Monday, the doctor said he was 0.5,'' Engelberg said.
``Then on Tuesday, he rallied and it was 2. Today, he told me it
was 1. That scared me.
	   ``It's a roller-coaster ride. He's in deep trouble. He's very
sick.''
	   DiMaggio, who entered the hospital Oct. 12, had a cancerous
tumor removed from his right lung two days later. He is fighting
recurring pneumonia in his left lung. An earlier intestinal
infection has cleared up, Barron said.
	   DiMaggio is not strong enough to have chemotherapy for the
cancer. ``It's the pneumonia, not the cancer, that is the
problem,'' Engelberg said.
	   When his fever shot up during the weekend, doctors summoned
relatives and friends. His condition was so grim that doctors even
discussed signing a ``do not resuscitate'' form, but Engelberg said
he would not consider doing that.
	   Besides treatment with three antibiotics, fluid also was drained
from DiMaggio's lungs several times. His blood pressure dropped so
rapidly on Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was summoned to
administer last rites.
	   Barron said it's impossible to predict how long DiMaggio will
remain in the hospital, where he has been kept sedated so he can
rest and hopefully heal.

 &UR; Kwan ignores confusing state of skating &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATING to show Butyrskaya not in event &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Michelle Kwan doesn't concern herself with any
figure skating power plays. She leaves that to the politicians and
rulemakers.
	   Kwan concentrates on what she does best: skating. This weekend,
she'll headline the strongest field of any event this season in the
World Pro Championships.
	   Wait a minute? Pro skating?
	   This year, at least, the International Skating Union, which
governs the Olympic-eligible level, sanctioned certain pro-am
competitions. The world pros at the MCI Center is one of them.
	   It's also the biggest challenge Kwan will have _ not even at the
national championships in February will she face anything near the
competition in this event.
	   ``This competition is a great event because it is a chance for
all of us as amateurs to compete against professionals,'' she said.
``I'll get to skate against Lu Chen and ... also work on my short
program and interpretive long program.
	   ``It will help me throughout the year and heading into other
competitions and for next year.''
	   Kwan hasn't committed to nationals yet, but barring injury,
she's a lock to compete in Salt Lake City. But with Tara Lipinski
no longer eligible and Nicole Bobek still slumping, Kwan might
easily win her third national crown.
	   ``I hope to be there, but I want to be 100 percent,'' she said.
``I love competing at nationals and it's in Salt Lake, where the
(2002) Olympics will be, which is another good point.''
	   Is 2002 on her agenda, as well?
	   ``I think it would be fun to test the waters,'' said the Olympic
silver medalist and two-time world champion. ``It was pretty
confirmed when I finished the long program at Nagano _ even before
then _ I knew what I liked best was competing. When I stop liking
that, it's the time I will be ready to move on.''
	   She moves into the world pros with a triple lutz-triple toe loop
combination in her repertoire. But she isn't expecting to use it,
sticking to an easier triple toe loop-triple toe loop combo.
	   Kwan realizes she must continue to upgrade her technical skating
and jumps. One reason she lost the Olympic gold medal to Lipinski
was her rival's willingness to try more difficult maneuvers. Kwan
will soon need those moves.
	   ``People who are coming up will be very strong and determined,
and you have to be ahead of the game and keep on working,'' she
said. ``I still have to put in the same effort, determination and
motivation to reach 2002. I know it won't be easy.''
	   The competition Friday and Saturday nights isn't too tough, and
it's familiar to Kwan. She usually handles Chen and Bobek easily.
1994 Olympic champion Oksana Baiul is making a rare competitive
appearance, while Katarina Witt also hasn't skated much this year.
	   That could leave Yuka Sato of Japan, who has performed well as a
professional, as Kwan's chief challenger.
	   Among the men, world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia,
five-time U.S. champ Todd Eldredge and 1996 U.S. winner Rudy
Galindo face Canada's Browning, who has dominated the pro level the
last three years.
	   The pairs features Olympic champions Oksana Kazakova and Artur
Dmitriev of Russia, and bronze medalists Mandy Wotzel and Ingo
Steuer of Germany.
	   For once, there will be extra focus on the dance. Two-time
Olympic champions Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov will be there _
but with different partners. Grishuk now skates with Alexander
Zhulin, with whom she admits to once having an affair while he was
married to Maya Usova. Platov, meanwhile, now skates with Usova.
	   It will be the first meeting for the estranged-united couples.
	   ``I just want to say we are all human, and, of course, we make
some mistakes,'' Zhulin said. ``I'm sorry for my actions.
	   ``We're thinking about the future, new programs, just thinking
about the future, nothing about the past.''

	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ American veteran Sondra Van
Ert outclassed her competition to easily win a women's World Cup
super giant slalom snowboard race Thursday.
	   Van Ert, 34, ran the course in 1 minute, 7.12 seconds. Italy's
Margerita Parini was second in 1:08.50 and Austria's Ursula
Fingerlos was third in 1:08.97.
	   ``I can safely say that's the most scared I've been on a
snowboard,'' Van Ert, a native of Ketchem, Idaho, said.
	   Olympic champion Karine Ruby of France was in contention but
fell during her run.

U.S. and North Korea extend talks on access to suspect site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The United States and North Korea held a fifth
round of talks Thursday on a U.S. demand for access to a North
Korean site suspected of being used for development of nuclear
weapons.
	   The delegations agreed to meet again Friday.
	   There was no comment from either side as the parties left the
U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
	   The two delegations met last Friday and Saturday in New York and
continued the discussions in Washington on Monday and Tuesday
before returning to New York.
	   The talks have been devoted exclusively to American concerns
about the North Korean project, which is said to involve thousands
of workers at an underground site.
	   North Korea has asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the
right to inspect the site. The United States has refused to make
any payment.

Manninen beats Vik at finish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colorado (AP) _ World Cup leader Hannu
Manninen of Finland took control inside the last kilometer Thursday
to edge Olympic champion Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway by three-tenths
of a seconds for his fourth World Cup Nordic combined victory of
the season.
	   Manninen, who broke one of his jumping skis during the final
training round and switched to new skis for the 88-meter
competition, was third in jumping on the opening day of the Sprint
Ski Town USA World Cup. He started the 7.5-kilometer race, which
uses a handicap start format, nine seconds back of Vik.
	   He and Vik, who was tied with Satoshi Mori of Japan for first
place after the jumping competition in the morning, dueled
throughout the race before Manninen pulled away on the last
downhill and held off Vik in the sprint to the finish. Austrian
Felix Gottwald was third, another three seconds back.
	   Manninen was little more than a stride ahead of Vik at the
finish of the race. Under the handicap start formula, the first
skier to finish wins. He's won four of the five events this season
and was second behind Vik in the other competition.
	   ``When I had the lead at the top of the last hill, I knew I
could win,'' Manninen said.
	   ``I was concerned because of the elevation of Steamboat (6,700
feet). It can be hard to breathe, especially in a short race like
this.''
	   Despite his disclaimer, Manninen has won both sprint events in
Steamboat in the last two years.
	   ``My jumping has been very, very good here for two years and my
cross-country has been good, too. I am pleased.''
	   Vik just smiled as he said, ``I have done six individual
competitions here and I have five times been No. 2.
	   ``I'm satisfied with my competition today, though. My jump was
good and I also had a good feeling in the cross-country. Hannu was
faster than me and that was it.''
	   Hometown favorite Todd Lodwick had a so-so jump and was 21st but
had moved up to sixth in the 7.5-kilometer race when he fell on an
icy turn at the bottom of a hill during the second of four laps in
the race.
	   Lodwick finished 14th and noted, ``I guess I've got to get
Picabo (Street, two-time World Cup downhill champion) to help me
with my downhill skiing. This is two years in a row I've fallen on
that same corner; maybe that's why they call it Deadman's Turn.''
	   Trond Einar Elden of Norway, 32nd in jumping, had the fastest
7.5K race and finished sixth with teammate Jacob Gunnes, seventh in
jumping, posting the second-fastest race to place seventh overall.
	   The event continues Saturday with 112-meter jumping. The
athletes get two jumps instead of the one from the sprint, and a
15K race Sunday.

Pastrana: 'Sick' society shares the blame for Colombia's poor
</HEADLINE>
rights record &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Human Rights &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana on Thursday
called Colombian society ``sick'' for an egotistical ethic that
helps make this country among the world's worst in human rights
violations.
	   ``This society cannot go on being the society of 'save yourself
at all costs', which teaches that only the strongest survives,''
Pastrana said in a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``We have lost respect for others' lives and sometimes even for
our own,'' Pastrana added.
	   He blamed ``this urgency of having to have everything at
whatever cost, this way of thinking that everything ought to be
obtained effortlessly'' on the get-rich-quick, instant
gratification mentality of too many of his countrymen.
	   Such an attitude ``can even demand the physical elimination of
competitors'' and encourages the casual investments in drug
trafficking that are rampant in society, Pastrana told about 150
people at the presidential palace including Almudena Mazarrasa, the
departing U.N. special representative for human rights.
	   ``This sick society should opt for life,'' said Pastrana, who
took office in August.
	   He said Colombians should not make the government ``a scape
goat'' for the country's steady diet of rights violations _ from
massacres by paramilitary death squads, to murder by leftist
guerrillas and abuses by members of the military.
	   ``Colombian society has to accept its share of responsibility,''
he said.
	   Pastrana also said the armed forces was improving its human
rights record, a claim refuted by international groups including
Human Rights Watch/Americas.
	   In its annual report issued last week, the Washington-based
organization noted that Pastrana's government has yet to announce a
plan for ending the Colombian military's tacit and sometimes active
support for murderous paramilitary groups, which kill alleged
guerrilla sympathizers.
	   Paramilitary groups committed 73 percent of Colombia's 619
political killings in the first half of 1998, the report says.
	   Human Rights Watch also criticized Pastrana for not yet taking a
position on legislation stalled in Congress that would reform the
military's penal code so that armed forces members accused of
rights violations could be tried in civilian courts.
	   Currently, such cases are tried by military tribunals, where
high-ranking officers accused of gross human rights violations have
routinely been acquitted.

Locked-out players' game may be hard sell in Atlantic City
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Facing bad publicity and long
odds of selling the event, the organizers of an exhibition game
featuring locked-out National Basketball Association players
changed course Thursday and decided to give all proceeds to
charity.
	   ``Because of the cancellation of the NBA All-Star game, the
players want to do this for the fans in Philadelphia and the
world,'' said Curtis Polk, president of Falk Associates Management
Enterprises.
	   Instead of splitting the proceeds between needy players and
charity, any profits will be donated to UNICEF and other charities.
	   But that's assuming there are profits to give away.
	   Ticket sales have been delayed twice, casinos have been slow to
support it and experts say the hurried scheduling of the Dec. 19
event _ which was announced Monday _ could spell trouble.
	   ``The Game on Showtime,'' a benefit for charity and the league's
lower-paid players featuring former Dream Teamers Patrick Ewing,
Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway and Reggie Miller, will be televised by
Showtime.
	   Organizers hope to raise dlrs 1 million from broadcast rights
and the sale of 13,000 tickets at dlrs 25 to dlrs 500 apiece.
Players from the 1992 and 1996 U.S. Olympic teams and the 1994 and
1998 World Championship teams are expected to participate.
	   Tickets were originally scheduled to go on sale Wednesday but
were delayed as organizers plotted the seating configuration at
Convention Hall. The Depression-era Boardwalk landmark _ the home
of the Miss America Pageant _ is currently undergoing a two-year
dlrs 70 million renovation.
	   Work will be discontinued to allow installation of the court,
scoreboard and lighting, according to Assistant General Manager
Gregg Caren.
	   As of Thursday, Ticketmaster ticket agency operators were still
telling callers no information was available about the event.
	   Casinos, usually the biggest supporters of sporting events here,
are being asked to buy blocks of tickets for their patrons.
	   ``The casinos are only going to buy tickets if the general
population does,'' said one former casino marketing official, who
would not be named. ``They mimic the general population. If the
public doesn't care, the casinos won't either.''
	   Historically, basketball events have struggled here. Two years
ago, a Coaches Vs. Cancer Classic doubleheader featuring St.
Joseph's-Tulsa and Temple-Georgia Tech drew less than 5,000 people
to Convention Hall, despite the regional appeal of two
Philadelphia-area teams.
	   The Atlantic City Seagulls, the city's entry in the U.S.
Basketball League, average about 1,100 fans per game.

Canseco optimistic about hitting 40 to 50 homers in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official announcement &QL; 
 &UR; By FRED GOODALL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ The Tampa Bay Devil Rays hope
Jose Canseco is right.
	   The 34-year-old outfielder thinks the addition of his bat can
help make the expansion team significantly better in its second
season.
	   Canseco, coming off a year in which he hit a career-high 46 home
runs for the Toronto Blue Jays, signed a dlrs 2 million, one-year
contract Thursday that includes performance bonuses and two club
option years that could raise the total to dlrs 16 million over
three seasons.
	   ``The Devil Rays had good pitching and defense this year, and
I'd like to hopefully add some offense,'' he said, adding that he's
looking forward in batting regularly at hitter-friendly Tropicana
Field.
	   ``The ball carries extremely well. Hopefully I can stay
healthy,'' Canseco added. ``I think history has shown that if I
stay healthy I can hit anywhere from 40 to 50 home runs.''
	   Another goal would be improving his batting average, which
slipped to .237 last season when he struck out an AL-high 159 times
while driving in 107 runs for the Blue Jays.
	   A .269 career hitter with 397 home runs and 1,214 RBIs in 14
seasons with the Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, Texas Rangers and
Boston Red Sox, he appeared in 151 games in 1998.
	   ``If I can get the average up just 20 points it's going to mean
seven to 10 home runs and a lot more RBIs,'' Canseco said.
	   Canseco, who reportedly sought a three- or four-year package
worth over than dlrs 6 million annually to return to Toronto,
stressed during negotiations that he considers himself an everyday
outfielder who can best help the team by playing regularly.
	   The Devil Rays, who made obtaining a right-handed power hitter
their top offseason priority, say he'll likely split time between
left field and designated hitter.
	   The Devil Rays finished second in the AL in fielding and were
fourth in pitching. Offensively, they were 13th in batting and last
in home runs with 111.

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The world's biggest ocean-racing
catamaran has been built in Auckland for one of the world's
craziest adventurers, American Steve Fossett.
	   He is about to embark on another round-the-world hot air balloon
attempt, and also wants to sail around the globe non-stop in the
monster multihull.
	   Each hull of the red, yellow and black yacht is 105 feet (32
meters) long and the catamaran has become a prominent landmark
around the Viaduct Basin. The mast stands 147 feet (44.8 meters)
tall.
	   The catamaran, to be named Playstation, is sitting on an empty
base in the America's Cup village while the finishing touches are
applied.
	   It has been built at Cookson boatyards, with the gigantic mast
made by Southern Spars.
	   Fossett has shown interest in The Race, a nonstop
circumnavigation starting on Dec. 31, 2000.
	   In the meantime he is waiting in Marrakesh for a three-man
assault on the world ballooning record with Richard Branson and Per
Lindstrand.
	   Fossett holds the record, covering 12,600 miles (20,277 km) --
almost two-thirds of the way around the world -- before crashing
off the coast of Australia in August.
	   The millionaire, 54, has a sailing background -- he holds seven
world records, including the fastest crossing of the Pacific Ocean.
	   He has also swum the English Channel, driven in the Le Mans
24-hour race and completed an Ironman triathlon.

Exiles heading for Cuba on boat intercepted by authorities

	   MIAMI (AP) _ At least five Cuban exiles who left the Florida
Keys Thursday with the goal of reaching Cuba were stopped en route
and had their vessel confiscated by the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The members of the Democracy Movement were testing the resolve
of the U.S. government to stop them. The voyage aboard the group's
boat Human Rights was scheduled to mark the 50th anniversary of the
U.N. human rights declaration.
	   ``We seized their boat this afternoon for violation of Florida's
security zone and it's being taken to Key West,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman, Scott Carr.
	   ``We're not arresting the people,'' added spokeswoman Veronica
Bandrowsky. ``We are stopping their transportation.''
	   Both Carr and Bandrowsky said there were seven people on board
the vessel when it was seized in international waters between Key
West and Havana, but the movement would not confirm that number.
	   The Human Rights left Marathon in the Florida Keys and was
headed for Cuba Thursday with two U.S. Coast Guard officers on
board, leaders of the exile group said.
	   The flotilla group planned to arrive and disembark in Cuba, said
Norman del Valle, the movement's executive subdirector, who was in
Miami and in radio contact with the ship.
	   Those on board were members of the group's executive committee
and included its leader, Ramon Saul Sanchez, del Valle said.
	   They timed the trip to be able to join a planned demonstration
on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which the United Nations adopted on Dec. 10, 1948.
	   Dissidents were organizing a rally to be held in a Havana park,
del Valle said.
	   ``We are supporting these people... (who) want people to be free
and (who) want Cuba to be a democratic country,'' del Valle said.
	   By early afternoon the 35-foot (10.5-meter) fishing boat was
experiencing 7 or 8 foot (2- to 2.5-meter) waves and was located 60
miles (96 kilometers) northeast of Havana, del Valle said.
	   The exiles did not have the Cuban government's permission to
return, but they think the declaration gives them the right to
return, del Valle said.
	   They plan to ``try to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy
after 40 years of tyranny,'' he said.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard has said that boats up to 150 feet (45
meters) long must get a permit if they plan to go to Cuba from many
Florida ports. If a Cuba trip is planned without a permit, the
Coast Guard has maintained that a boat can be seized and those
aboard can be subject to prosecution.
	   The Coast Guard officers boarded the Human Rights just before it
left Florida shores and asked if the crew planned to enter Cuban
waters. The crew refused to answer, the exile group said.
	   Seizing the boat would signify that U.S. authorities have
violated the human rights declaration, del Valle said.
	   The Coast Guard seized another Democracy Movement boat, the
Democracia, last year when its crew tried to sail uninvited into
Cuban waters. The U.S. government returned the boat after an
agreement reached between U.S. attorneys and the group was
announced in April.
	   If the ship had arrived in Cuba, those on board were planning to
remain indefinitely, del Valle said.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The world's biggest ocean-racing
catamaran has been built in Auckland for one of the world's most
famous adventurers, American Steve Fossett.
	   He is about to embark on another round-the-world hot air balloon
attempt, and also wants to sail around the globe non-stop in the
monster multihull.
	   Each hull of the red, yellow and black yacht is 105 feet (32
meters) long and the catamaran has become a prominent landmark
around the Viaduct Basin. The mast stands 147 feet (44.8 meters)
tall.
	   The catamaran, to be named Playstation, is sitting on an empty
base in the America's Cup village while the finishing touches are
applied.
	   It has been built at Cookson boatyards, with the gigantic mast
made by Southern Spars.
	   Fossett has shown interest in The Race, a nonstop
circumnavigation starting on Dec. 31, 2000.
	   In the meantime he is waiting in Marrakesh for a three-man
assault on the world ballooning record with Richard Branson and Per
Lindstrand.
	   Fossett holds the record, after covering 12,600 miles (20,277
km) _ almost two-thirds of the way around the world _ before
crashing off the coast of Australia in August.
	   The millionaire, 54, has a sailing background _ he holds seven
world records, including the fastest crossing of the Pacific Ocean.
	   He has also swum the English Channel, driven in the Le Mans
24-hour race and completed an Ironman triathlon.

Japan's Cabinet approves Osaka's bid for 2008 Olympics

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Cabinet ministers Friday approved a bid by
the nation's third-largest city of Osaka to host the 2008 Olympics,
the Foreign Ministry said.
	   The formal decision paves the way for government financial
support for the city's preparation for the event. Government
officials had previously agreed to support the bid.
	   Osaka, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo, will
formally file its candidacy with the International Olympic
Committee in early 2000.
	   Paris, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur have also expressed hopes to
host the 2008 summer games. The host will be decided at an IOC
meeting in Moscow in 2001.
	   Osaka has asked the central government to shoulder about half of
the costs to prepare for the games, following the example of the
Nagano Olympics held in central Japan in February.
	   An estimated 80 billion yen (dlrs 680 million) will be needed to
build an Olympic stadium and a swimming pool if the city wins the
bid, said Osaka City spokesman Yoshimitsu Yorise.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. House Judiciary Committee weighed
final arguments Thursday over alleged ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' by President Bill Clinton. Speaker Newt Gingrich
notified the full House to prepare for a historic impeachment vote
next week. Republican counsel David Schippers said Clinton's
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power left lawmakers
with the ``sorrowful duty'' of seeking his removal from office.
Democratic lawyer Abbe Lowell countered: ``Listen to the American
people, who are asking you to find a truly bipartisan way to avoid
the course you are about to undertake.'' But by all accounts,
Republicans were ready to approve at least one article of
impeachment. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership on
Thursday scrapped constitutional clauses rejecting Israel's
existence and said it would try and stem a wave of violence that
has jeopardized the peace _ moves that may smooth President Bill
Clinton's troubled visit to the region. A group of senior
Palestinians led by Yasser Arafat voted overwhelmingly to declare
clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction null
and void, a key condition of the Clinton-brokered Wye River talks
two months ago. Selim Zanoun, who announced the decision by the
Palestine Central Council to nullify the offending passages, said
that the larger Palestine National Council would not take up the
same vote when it hosts Clinton on Monday. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations marked the anniversary
Thursday of the world's most comprehensive human rights declaration
with praise for the half-century-old vision that shaped it and
shame that the goals have not yet been met. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, the top U.N. human rights official, Mary Robinson,
government ministers and human rights defenders from around the
world delivered the same message: The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights is indeed universal and must be implemented in full by
every government. ``Human rights are foreign to no culture and
native to all nations,'' Annan declared at a special daylong
General Assembly session held in tandem with ceremonies in Paris,
where the declaration was adopted Dec. 10, 1948. Fifty years later,
and despite the ratification of 60 treaties inspired by the
declaration, hundreds of millions of people in all parts of the
globe are still deprived of their most basic political, civil,
economic, social and cultural rights. (UN-HUMAN RIGHTS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Attorneys for Gen. Augusto Pinochet went back to
the House of Lords Thursday, seeking to stop Spain's effort to
extradite the former Chilean dictator to stand trial on charges of
murder and other human rights abuses. Their plea to overturn a
ruling by the highest court of appeal is extremely unusual in
English law. It came a day before Pinochet was due in court to
begin an extradition battle that is likely to be long and costly.
Pinochet's attorneys argued, once again, that he was entitled to
sovereign immunity for any actions while he was head of state. That
argument was rejected two weeks ago in a 3-2 decision by law lords
sitting as Britain's highest court of appeal. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. and British scientists for the first time
have mapped the entire gene pattern of an animal, a tiny worm that
already is providing clues to human problems such as cancer, aging
and Alzheimer's disease. Experts called the achievement an
important advance in the ambitious effort to map the human gene
structure and to someday use that knowledge to find the causes and
cures of human disease. The worm, a type of nematode called
Caenorhabditis elegans, is as common as dirt. A handful of garden
soil contains thousands. But the animal provides a crucial keyhole
view of the vast world of genetics, said Robert H. Waterston,
leader of a Washington University, St. Louis, team that joined with
British scientists to find the worm's genes. (SCI-US-MAPPING GENES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stock prices fell for the third session in a row
Thursday, as anxiety mounted about the quality of corporate
earnings and technology stocks retreated. On Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 167.61 _ or by 1.8 percent _ at
8,841.58. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England announced a third key interest
rate drop in as many months Thursday to ward off the risks of
recession and deflation, prompting complaints from manufacturers,
union leaders and some analysts that it was too little too late.
The bank voted to reduce its base lending rate for loans to
commercial banks from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent, after cutting
its lending rate 0.5 percent in November and 0.25 percent in
October. That still leaves Britain's interest rates at about twice
the level of those of the 11 European countries that are
introducing a single European currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
Earlier this month, those countries coordinated a base rate drop to
3 percent. (BRITAIN-INTEREST RATES)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Telecommunications company LM Ericsson
AB, hit hard by the Asian financial crisis, expects disappointing
year-end results that could force it to eliminate some 10,000 jobs.
Ericsson, Sweden's largest company, employs about 100,000 people in
its worldwide operations, including about 8,000 in the United
States. It is a leading maker of cellular telephones and equipment
for wired and mobile phone systems, and for data and telecom
networks. Chief executive Sven-Christer Nilsson said Thursday in a
meeting with analysts that 1998 results, to be announced Jan. 28,
are likely to be below market expectations, both in terms of
profits and sales. (SWEDEN-ERICSSON)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian Senate on Thursday
ratified the dlrs 41.5 billion aid package put together by the
International Monetary Fund to help Brazil's ailing economy. The
endorsement authorizes Brazil to sign the financial aid agreements,
announced last month, with the IMF and the Bank for International
Settlements, which is coordinating the bilateral contributions to
the credit line. The rescue package makes the dlrs 41.5 billion
available to Brazil over the next three years. About dlrs 37
billion will be on tap if needed in the next 12 months. The IMF
will put up dlrs 18 billion, while other international aid agencies
will chip in dlrs 9 billion. The remaining dlrs 4.5 billion will
come from industrial countries in North America, Europe and Asia.
The United States will contribute dlrs 5 billion. (BRAZIL-IMF)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Economic growth in the 15-nation
European Union accelerated to 0.6 percent in the third quarter from
0.4 percent in the preceding three months, EU officials said
Thursday. Gross domestic product in the 11 EU countries taking part
in the launching of the single currency, the euro on Jan. 1, also
grew 0.6 percent in the third quarter, according to the EU
statistics office, Eurostat. No figures were given for individual
EU countries. Compared with the same period last year, GDP in the
15 EU countries was 2.4 percent higher in the third quarter of
1998, Eurostat said. (EU-ECONOMY)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called on
OPEC countries to completely halt production during the winter
season to boost record-low prices, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Thursday. ``It is illogical that the prices of commodities
we buy as consumers double at the time oil prices continuously go
down.'' MENA quoted Gadhafi as saying in a letter sent to the
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The
agency gave no other details. Oil prices have reached record-low
due to a glut in the market and depressed demand in recession-hit
Asia and a warm winter in the West. (LIBYA-OIL)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Royal/Dutch Shell on Thursday unveiled management
changes designed to enable the company to react more quickly to
changing market conditions. ``We have entered a new period where
executive decisions have to be made rapidly and business
accountability must be absolutely clear,'' Mark Moody Stuart,
chairman of the committee of managing directors, said at a London
business conference. He said that each of Shell's five business
areas will have its own chief executive officer and executive
committee. Shell's gas and coal unit, its chemicals and renewables
unit and international services unit already have their own chief
executive officers. The company is now introducing the structure to
its other two businesses, oil products division and the exploration
and production group. (BRITAIN-SHELL)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Bruce Springsteen won a battle against music
pirates Thursday when a judge blocked the release of an
unauthorized collection of songs recorded early in his career.
	   The rocker argued that release of ``Before the Fame'' would
damage his artistic integrity because the songs don't meet his high
standards.
	   ``I came over here to defend the ownership of my music,''
Springsteen said outside the courtroom. ``It's something I fought
for since I was young, and I'm really satisfied.''
	   London-based Masquerade Music said it had a license for the
songs recorded between 1972-74 from Jim Cretecos, a member of
Springsteen's former management team who claimed to own the rights.
	   But Judge Francis Ferris ruled that Springsteen owned the 19
songs and ordered Masquerade to pay his legal costs, estimated at
dlrs 825,000.
	   Masquerade's Ronald Winter said the company will appeal.

	   LIMESTONE, Maine (AP) _ Merchants are bemoaning the Phish that
got away.
	   The popular Vermont band that drew more than 60,000 fans to
three-day festivals at the former Loring Air Force Base each of the
last two years is not returning to Limestone in 1999.
	   Instead, Phish will put on a festival in Hawaii, said Brian
Hamel, who heads the Loring Development Authority.
	   The Limestone festivals pumped an estimated dlrs 40 million into
the state's economy and gave a boost to a region sorely in need of
an economic lift.
	   ``Of course, we'll miss them,'' said Mark Sleeper of Sleeper's
grocery and clothing store in Caribou.
	   ``It's the high point of August,'' said Jack Forbush, manager of
a convenience store in Caribou.
	   Hamel said the band might return in 2000.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 25-minute tape recording of The Beatles in a
1963 concert was sold at auction on Thursday for 25,300 pounds
(dlrs 42,000).
	   The 10-song tape, made at the Gaumont Theater in Bournemouth,
England in the early days of the Beatles' success, was sold to an
anonymous buyer at Christie's auction house. The reel-to-reel
recording was made by the theater's sound technician and sold on
his behalf by his daughter.
	   Also sold at the Christie's auction were two postcards written
by John Lennon about 1972-73, a letter from John Lennon from about
1969-70, and a Beatles photo album of 71 snapshots taken by a fan
about 1966 to 1967.
	   The postcards sold for 5,750 pounds (dlrs 9,550), the letter for
5,175 pounds (dlrs 8,600), and the photo album for 4,140 pounds
(dlrs 6,870). All went to anonymous buyers.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A family photo album and a collection of letters
that actress Audrey Hepburn wrote to her father were sold at
Christie's auction house on Thursday for more than 70,000 pounds
(dlrs 117,000).
	   An autograph dealer paid 24,150 pounds (dlrs 40,300) for 64
family photos, including snapshots of the actress as a child, in
her school uniform, of her two sons, and herself with family and
friends. Many of the pictures are inscribed on the back to her late
father, Anthony Hepburn-Ruston.
	   The actress' stepmother, Fidelma Hepburn-Ruston, wife sold the
photos, as well as affectionate letters and postcards written by
the star between 1964 and 1990, which went to an unidentified
private collector for 45,500 (dlrs 75,500).
	   The Oscar-winning actress, famous for her roles in ``Roman
Holiday,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' died
in January 1993 at the age of 63.
	   She was born in Belgium, daughter of Hepburn-Ruston, an English
and Irish banker, and Ella van Meemstra, a Dutch baroness. Her
parents divorced when she was a child.
	    &UR; ___
	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ Acting on complaints from
church leaders, the Cayman Islands says it will no longer allow
cruise ships to dock on Sundays, Christmas or Good Friday.
	   Cruise ship operators said Wednesday they were notified of the
ban in a letter from tourism minister Thomas Jefferson.
	   The change would only affect about 10 cruise ship calls each
year, shipping agents said.
	   But Michelle Paige, director of the Florida Caribbean Cruise
Ship Association, said many companies had already made out sailing
schedules and noted Sunday stops in advertising.
	   ``We're very disappointed because none of the cruise lines
received an advance notice of this action,'' Paige said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ In a seven-hour megaconcert ending early Friday,
performers from all over the rock spectrum _ from Peter Gabriel to
Radiohead to ``The Boss'' himself, Bruce Springsteen _ feted the
anniversary of the human rights charter before 15,000 cheering
Parisian fans.
	   If that weren't enough, the Dalai Lama took the stage, too, to
urge fans to fight for human rights.
	   The concert was organized by Amnesty International and The Body
Shop in honor of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed
here exactly 50 years ago.
	   The Bercy stadium in eastern Paris was nearly full to capacity
with fans who began partying before 6 p.m. and were still rocking
well after midnight.
	   The opener was a highlight: Springsteen, Gabriel, Tracy Chapman
and Youssu N'Dour joined for a rendition of Bob Marley's ``Get Up,
Stand Up.''
	   Later, Springsteen performed an acoustic set that included
``Born in the U.S.A.''
	   Other artists included the popular British band Radiohead,
performing for the first time in eight months; Alanis Morisette;
and Shania Twain.
	   Also appearing were former Led Zeppelin stars Jimmy Page and
Robert Plant, and the London-based band Asian Dub Foundation, which
said backstage that ``Raising awareness is the first step'' toward
fighting human rights _ ``then, creating a discussion.''
	   Commemorations earlier in the week drew U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson,
plus a host of dissidents, activists and other figures including
the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, and Chinese dissident
Wei Jingsheng.
	   The artists all appeared for free, united under the theme ``The
struggle continues'' _ the last words of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the ethnic
Ogoni human rights crusader in Nigeria who was executed in 1995 on
orders from the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Six astronauts jubilantly swung
open the doors to the new international space station and flipped
on the lights Thursday, becoming the first guests aboard the
250-mile-high outpost.
	   ``It's fantastic. I can't say how much this means to all of
us,'' radioed down Robert Cabana, commander of the attached shuttle
Endeavour.
	   Mission Control replied: ``You've opened the doors to a whole
new era in spaceflight.''
	   Cabana and Russia's Sergei Krikalev were the first to enter the
space station. Cabana beckoned for the cosmonaut to join him in
crossing the threshold of the U.S.-Russian complex. They floated in
side by side.
	   In addition to flipping on the lights, the astronauts installed
air ducts and fans and also planned to bring aboard clothes and
other supplies for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in 2000.
	   For the five Americans and one Russian _ and hundreds of flight
controllers below _ it was a moment for which they and their
countries had been striving for years.
	   The space station consists of only two rooms so far and is still
more than five years from completion. Its first permanent residents
_ Krikalev and two other men _ won't even move in for another year
or so. But for the first time in nearly 25 years, NASA has a space
station of its own, with people on board.
	   ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' proclaimed
flight director Bob Castle.
	   The astronauts excitedly unlocked the three hatches leading from
Endeavour's crew cabin into Unity, the American-built chamber
launched aboard the shuttle one week ago. It was slow going; the
astronauts had to use wrenches to unbolt the tightly sealed hatches
and wait for the air pressure to equalize.
	   Unity was dark inside and so the astronauts took along
flashlights and lanterns. Upon entering, they flipped on the three
light switches.
	   ``We remember when Unity was just an aluminum shell,'' Cabana
said, admiring the spotless white and yellow walls. ``It's just so
nice inside. It's really nice to be in a new home.''
	   Then they set about opening the three remaining hatches leading
from Unity into Zarya, the Russian-made control module, and
squeezed into that portion, too, with Cabana and Krikalev again
leading the way.
	   ``Looks like home, what do you think?'' Mission Control asked
Krikalev.
	   ``It's small yet,'' he replied. ``We need to have more
modules.''
	   As Krikalev worked at replacing a faulty battery charger inside
Zarya, his shuttle crewmates installed electronics for Unity's
antennas. Also high on their to-do list: removing hundreds of bolts
that were used to reinforce the station components for launch.
	   A third and final spacewalk to wrap up work outside the station
is scheduled for Saturday. The next component of the space station
is due to arrive late next summer from Kazakstan.
	   ``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,''
said Cabana. ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's
just a small beginning and it's only going to grow.''

IOC orders inquiry into Salt Lake payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ What started as a local controversy
in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international
scandal.
	   The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level
investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group
which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a ``bribe.''
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international
body's juridical commission _ which deals with legal and ethical
issues _ to investigate.
	   The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, a highly respected former World Court judge.
	   The scholarship fund was first disclosed two weeks ago by a Salt
Lake radio station.
	   The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress
report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to
make to the IOC executive board this weekend.
	   ``It is clearly disappointing and this is an issue that can only
be described as disruptive at a critical time of importance for
Salt Lake City,'' said John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of
the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``I would hope whatever the IOC and
president Samaranch decide, this is resolved quickly so people
charged with organizing the games can get back to business.''
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between IOC votes on the 1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   SLOC said the money went toward tuition assistance, books,
living expenses and athletic training.
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Salt Lake organizers have refused to identify the other IOC
relatives who received scholarships.
	   Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the IOC oversight panel on the
2002 games and has often been effusive in his praise for Salt
Lake's Olympic preparations, feels the project was unethical.
	   ``It's not wrong to say it's a bribe _ it is a bribe,'' he said.
``It's a bribe, yes.''
	   Sion, in the Alps south of Lausanne, is running again for the
2006 Winter Games.
	   ``I just came back from a Sion meeting and they're very proud
people and said they can do it without bribes,'' Hodler said.
	   Following allegations of bribery and other influence peddling in
previous Olympic votes, the IOC assigned Hodler to draw up new
rules and restrictions to weed out the possibility of corruption.
	   ``The rules are very clear: gifts should not be higher than dlrs
100,'' he said. ``If (the Salt Lake scholarship fund) is a gift,
that gift is irregular. If it would be connected with the voting,
of course, it's corruption.''
	   It's unclear what sanctions _ if any _ could be taken against
Salt Lake if the IOC investigation finds irregularities.
	   ``Can we take the games away from Salt Lake City?'' Hodler said.
``Does that make sense? I can't propose it because in that case
people will say Sion will get it free of charge. I'm a Swiss and
Sion was No. 2 (in the vote).''
	   Hodler said he will propose that only the 11-member IOC
executive board and leaders of sports federations select Olympic
cities _ rather than the full IOC assembly.
	   Hodler said he pushed through a similar change when he was
president of the International Ski Federation, where, he said,
``there was also a lot of corruption.''
	   Hodler said he would also propose that any IOC member found
guilty of accepting favors should be expelled from the
organization.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia took a tactical edge in the
third cricket test on Friday, winning an important toss and
deciding to bat first against England at the Adelaide Oval.
	   Australia leads the five-match series 1-0 following its
comprehensive trouncing of England in Perth in the second test.
	   England sprung a major selection surprise by including off-
spinner Peter Such ahead of the experienced Robert Croft.
	   Such has played just one game this tour, against South Australia
in Adelaide a month ago, and has not played test cricket since
appearing against
	   New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1994.
	   England made two changes to its side that was beaten inside
three days in
	   Perth, Such coming in at the expense of paceman Alex Tudor, and
paceman Dean
	   Cork being replaced by his fellow fast bowler Dean Headley.
	   Cork was ruled out with the flu.
	   Australian leg spinner Stuart MacGill replaced fast bowler
Michael Kasprowicz.
	   Teams:
	   AUSTRALIA: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh, Michael Slater,

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Six astronauts jubilantly swung
open the doors to the new international space station and flipped
on the lights Thursday, becoming the first guests aboard the
250-mile-high outpost.
	   ``It's fantastic. I can't say how much this means to all of
us,'' radioed down Robert Cabana, commander of the attached shuttle
Endeavour.
	   Mission Control replied: ``You've opened the doors to a whole
new era in spaceflight.''
	   Cabana and Russia's Sergei Krikalev were the first to enter the
space station. Cabana beckoned for the cosmonaut to join him in
crossing the threshold of the U.S.-Russian complex. They floated in
side by side.
	   In addition to flipping on the lights, the astronauts installed
air ducts and fans and also planned to bring aboard clothes and
other supplies for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in 2000.
	   For the five Americans and one Russian _ and hundreds of flight
controllers below _ it was a moment for which they and their
countries had been striving for years.
	   The space station consists of only two rooms so far and is still
more than five years from completion. Its first permanent residents
_ Krikalev and two other men _ won't even move in for another year
or so. But for the first time in nearly 25 years, NASA has a space
station of its own, with people on board.
	   ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' proclaimed
flight director Bob Castle.
	   The astronauts excitedly unlocked the three hatches leading from
Endeavour's crew cabin into Unity, the American-built chamber
launched aboard the shuttle one week ago. It was slow going; the
astronauts had to use wrenches to unbolt the tightly sealed hatches
and wait for the air pressure to equalize.
	   Unity was dark inside and so the astronauts took along
flashlights and lanterns. Upon entering, they flipped on the three
light switches.
	   ``We remember when Unity was just an aluminum shell,'' Cabana
said, admiring the spotless white and yellow walls. ``It's just so
nice inside. It's really nice to be in a new home.''
	   Then they set about opening the three remaining hatches leading
from Unity into Zarya, the Russian-made control module, and
squeezed into that portion, too, with Cabana and Krikalev again
leading the way.
	   ``Looks like home, what do you think?'' Mission Control asked
Krikalev.
	   ``It's small yet,'' he replied. ``We need to have more
modules.''
	   As Krikalev worked at replacing a faulty battery charger inside
Zarya, his shuttle crewmates installed electronics for Unity's
antennas. Also high on their to-do list: removing hundreds of bolts
that were used to reinforce the station components for launch.
	   A third and final spacewalk to wrap up work outside the station
is scheduled for Saturday. The next component of the space station
is due to arrive late next summer from Kazakstan.
	   ``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,''
said Cabana. ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's
just a small beginning and it's only going to grow.''

Meissnitzer widens overall lead, but goal is still worlds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Though she just wanted to prove that
her Super-G victory in Lake Louise, Canada two weeks ago was no
fluke, on Thursday Alexandra Meissnitzer ended up proving much more
than that.
	   Leaving no doubt in the minds of those watching, Meissnitzer
stormed to victory, crossing a commanding .79 seconds faster than
her closest rival Martina Ertl of Germany.
	   The win not only confirmed her talent as a Super-G racer, but
solidified her status as one of the dominant figures in the women's
field, further increasing her lead atop the overall World Cup
standings where she sits with 525 points.
	   Ertl, her closest contender, is second with 383.
	   Though she's had a strong start to the season, winning three
races and finishing on the podium in two others, Meissnitzer
refuses to read too much into the current tables, insisting her
stay at the top is likely temporary.
	   ``It's a real surprise for me to find myself at the top of the
overall,'' said Meissnitzer, who placed first and second in a pair
of giant slalom races in Park City and finished third in a downhill
in Lake Louise. ``But there are many other girls who are strong.''
	   Ertl, on the other hand, was only too eager to talk about the
chase for the coveted title.
	   With World Cup overall, downhill and Super-G champion Katja
Seizinger out for the season with injured knees, the window of
opportunity is finally open for Ertl.
	   Ever in the shadow of her illustrious teammate, Ertl is aware
her chance to shine is now or never.
	   ``Of course I'm going for the overall,'' said Ertl. ``Alexandra
Meissnitzer was more aggressive today, but the season is long.
	   ``In the absence of Katja, I am the team leader,'' Ertl said.
``I want to live up to that role.''
	   Though leading the overall rankings, Meissnitzer's strength is
limited to the speed events and to a certain extent, the giant
slalom. The Austrian does not compete in the slalom, one of Ertl's
stronger suits.
	   ``That gives Martina an extra nine races, nine chances to
collect more points,'' said Meissnitzer, who hinted she might race
in the combined events this year. ``Besides, it's only the
beginning of December, and too early to talk about the overall.
	   ``In 1995 I was also leading at the start of the season but only
finished fifth at the end and everyone around me was very
disappointed,'' said Meissnitzer, whose ultimate goal this season
is the world championships in Vail, Colorado in February. ``If at
the end of January I'm still at the top, then we can talk about
it.''
	   For Ertl, December is soon enough to start contemplating her
long-time goal. The German is aware that over time her skill in the
slalom will give her an edge.
	   ``The ski season is long,'' said Ertl. ``If I am able to remain
in good shape, if I do not get hurt, there shall be no problem for
me, even if for the time being Meissnitzer is stronger in the
Super-G and downhill.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Glowing rocks blew out of a volcano near
Mexico City on Thursday, but did not threaten populated areas, the
government said.
	   The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters said that
activity at the Popocatepetl volcano had increased slightly, with
50 exhalations during 24 hours.
	   An explosion Thursday morning dumped glowing rocks on the side
of the volcano and released a dense column of smoke.
	   The 18,000-foot (5,400-meter) volcano is just 50 miles (80
kilometers) southeast of Mexico City and 300,000 people live on its
slopes. It has been active since 1994 and regularly emits gas and
steam.
	   The Volcano of Fire in Colima, 300 miles (480 kilometers) west
of Mexico City, continued to shove out red-hot glowing blocks on
Thursday as it has for several days, but it did not threaten nearby
residents, according to state civil defense officials.
	   The government news agency Notimex also reported that small
amounts of ash were reported Wednesday in two communities close to
the volcano, La Yerbabuena and El Jabali.
	   Increased activity at the Colima forced evacuations of about 300
people in nearby villages in November. ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The chairman of the Mexican airline Taesa has
been arrested and jailed on charges of failing to report millions
of dollars in tax withholdings, the federal attorney general's
office said Thursday.
	   Alberto Angel Abed Shekaiban was being held at Mexico City's
Northern Prison for arraignment.
	   In a joint news release with the federal Treasury Secretariat,
the attorney general's office said Abed Shekaiban was accused of
failing to report some 28.8 million pesos _ roughly dlrs 2.9
million at current exchange rates _ in taxes withheld from
employees in 1996.
	   Taesa, whose formal name is Empresa Transportes Aereos
Ejecutivos, was founded in 1989 as an executive air charter service
and it expanded to commercial operations in 1991, using cut-rate
fares to challenge established carriers Mexicana and Aeromexico.
	   In October, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration accused the
airline of flying an aircraft at above its maximum allowable weight
on a flight between Santiago, Chile, and Miami. ___ &QC; 
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's family services minister,
Humberto Belli, has resigned after criticizing the head of the
Education Ministry, a post he formerly held.
	   Belli submitted his resignation Wednesday just before President
Arnoldo Aleman departed for Washington for talks on the Hurricane
Mitch recovery effort. He had been the only minister left over from
the previous 1990-97 administration of Violeta Chamorro.
	   Belli had criticized his successor in the Education Ministry,
Jose Antonio Alvarado, for ``trying to abolish autonomy in the
schools.''
	   Alvarado has proposed that the ministry appoint school
principals from a list of nominees, replacing the system in which
teachers, parents and students elected their principals.
	   Belli said he was considering several job opportunities outside
of the government. ___ &QC; 
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Workers, teachers and students
marched through central Panama City on Thursday to denounce the use
of violence by police to break up a protest against privatization
of the country's water services.
	   The clash between riot police and students Wednesday ended with
110 people arrested and dozens injured.
	   Thursday's march led to the national Legislative Assembly, where
workers demanded that legislators condemn the violence and end
plans to sell off the state Institute of National Aqueducts and
Sewers.
	   ``We repudiate the aggression against students and freedom of
expression,'' said Gabriel Castillo, leader of the National
Coordinating Council of Syndicate Unity.
	   Riot squads entered the state University of Panama campus
Wednesday, firing rubber bullets and tear gas to stop the protest.
Students and school authorities called the action a violation of
university autonomy.
	   Privatization opponents say the change will increase the cost of
drinking water. The government says it is needed to update water
services and improve efficiency.

Heaven Forbid? Tokyo landmark may be headed for the suburbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK110,112 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For decades, Tokyo Tower has been to the Japanese
capital's skyline what the Empire State Building is to New York or
the Eiffel Tower to Paris.
	   About 130 million people _ more than the population of all Japan
_ have stood on its observation decks to marvel at one of the most
spectacular views of the Tokyo skyline.
	   But if a group of well-funded businessmen, scholars and local
officials has its way, Tokyo's best-known landmark may soon be
headed for suburbia.
	   The Saitama Tower Co., the consortium seeking to replace the
tower with a bigger, better one on Tokyo's northwestern fringe, is
making a strong bid to take over Tokyo Tower's primary function as
a relay station for radio and television signals.
	   Without the revenue that generates, Tokyo Tower officials say
they would have to seriously rethink the tower's viability, and if
worse came to worst, would consider closing it or tearing it down
altogether.
	   The 333-meter (1,093-foot) tall structure, built in 1958,
immediately became the symbol of Tokyo's recovery from the almost
total devastation caused by massive firebomb attacks during World
War II.
	   But the tower's age is working against it.
	   The expected switch in the near-future to a digital-based
television broadcasting system will require larger antenna capacity
than Tokyo Tower can now offer.
	   Saitama's tower would be built to meet the new requirements. It
would stand 500 meters (1,640 feet) tall, and would cost around 25
billion yen (dlrs 210 million).
	   ``Tokyo Tower been around for 40 years,'' said Saitama Tower
spokesman Masaaki Takano. ``They would have had to tear it down
some time anyway.''
	   The red-and-white Tokyo Tower, located in the heart of the city,
is 33 meters (109 feet) higher than France's Eiffel Tower but
shorter than the 381-meter (1,250-foot) Empire State Building.
	   According to a pamphlet handed out to all visitors who pay the
820 yen (dlrs 7) entrance fee, it is the world's tallest
free-standing steel tower.
	   It is also still a big draw _ about 3 million tourists visit the
tower each year.
	   Along with the view, they get a good dose of kitsch. The lower
floors of the tower have countless souvenir stalls, a wax museum,
an aquarium with 50,000 fish and a 3D art gallery.
	   Toru Suzuki, an official with the Saitama government, said
Saitama sees their potential tower not only as an important source
of revenue for the local economy but also as nearly as big a
tourist attraction as Tokyo Tower.
	   Consortium officials expect 2 million people would likely ascend
the Saitama edifice annually, despite its more out-of-the-way
location in Yono, about 40 minutes by train from Tokyo.
	   ``It would be our symbol,'' Suzuki said.
	   Still, Tokyo Tower spokesmen say they are not going to roll over
without a fight and have put together a plan to build a new
2,300-foot (700-meter) replacement.
	   A decision by the TV and radio networks on whether they will
stay in Tokyo or move to Saitama is expected within a few months.
	   In the meantime, the mere idea of Saitama stealing the Tokyo
Tower has set a tempest brewing in the capital area's media and
spawned a flurry of articles and television reports.
	   Saitama, dominated by farms and bedroom communities, is a
neighbor that residents of the capital have long loved to look down
on.
	   ``They really should keep the tower right here,'' Yoko Sakamura,
a young Tokyo resident, said while looking at the city from the
observation deck one recent evening.
	   ``Saitama Tower would be so uncool,'' added her boyfriend.

Israel welcomes covenant vote, waits for second round with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Israel welcomed a vote by the
Palestinian leadership revoking clauses which called for Israel's
destruction but wants a repeat performance in the presence of
President Bill Clinton before it will put the peace process back on
track.
	   Fulfilling a key obligation in the U.S.-brokered peace accord,
the 105-member Palestinian Central Council convened Thursday and
voted overwhelmingly in support of a letter Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat sent to Clinton in January guaranteeing that the
offending clauses in the PLO charter were void.
	   Palestinian officials also said they would try to stop a spate
of violence that has crippled the accord and cast a dark cloud over
Clinton's visit to the region this Saturday.
	   White House spokesman David Leavy described that as ``an
important and welcomed step toward implementing the Wye accords.''
	   But Arafat and officials stood firm on their refusal to hold a
re-vote in the larger Palestine National Council _ the
Palestinian's parliament-in-exile _ when it convenes in the
presence of Clinton in the Gaza Strip Monday.
	   That meeting ``will be only to listen to President Clinton's
speech and President Arafat ... there will be no vote,'' said PCC
member Selim Zanoun.
	   For Israel however, the charter change by the PNC is the main
reason for Clinton's trip and only a vote will convince the Israeli
government that the Palestinians have given up armed struggle and
accepted the existence of the Jewish state.
	   ``Up until now they've done what they were supposed to do in
terms of the rejection of those articles in the covenant, and we
expect that they will continue to do so on Monday and vote in an
unequivocal matter,'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Bar-Illan said there would be no further implementation of the
land-for-security deal signed at the White House in October and
frozen by Israel last week, unless the PNC held a vote on the
issue.
	   The Palestinians have said that the meeting Monday will
``affirm'' the annulment of the offensive passages, but have not
said how that would be carried out.
	   Arafat said the procedure was an internal Palestinian matter.
``It's not their (the Israelis') business,'' he said.
	   The dispute could put Clinton in an awkward position. If there
is no vote, Israel will walk away from the Wye River accord he
labored to bring to fruition and could harm relations between the
two countries.
	   Last week, Israel said it would not continue with the agreement
and hand over more war-captured West Bank land to Arafat's control
unless the Palestinians dropped demands for the release of
Palestinian prisoners jailed for acts against Israel.
	   The prisoner issue has sparked almost daily West Bank riots
between Palestinian stone-throwers and armed Israeli forces and has
led to the deaths of two Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, negotiators from both sides indicated they may be
close to a compromise over the issue of prisoner releases which
would stem the violence before Clinton's arrival.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Thursday that the
Palestinians had accepted a compromise worked out by U.S. Mideast
envoy Dennis Ross whereby representatives from all three sides
would jointly go through lists of so-called security prisoners one
by one.

following an overnight drop on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar
rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 168.72 points,
or 1.14 percent, to 14,639.08 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the index lost 124.10 points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.32 yen, up 0.26 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo but marginally below its late New York level of 117.33 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said Japanese stocks fell following a drop on Wall
Street overnight as well as selling here Friday related to the
December futures settlement, known as the special quotation.
	   In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
167.61 points to 8,841.58.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.15 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,135.63.
The TOPIX lost 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar was higher as
Japanese interbank players bought the U.S. currency to cover short,
or oversold, positions, traders said.
	   But the weakness in U.S. stocks and lingering concerns over
financial problems in Latin America are discouraging investors from
aggressively building up dollar positions, they said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.160 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price up to 105.47 yen from 105.29 yen.

Researchers find evidence of ancient asteroid or comet impact

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An 18-mile-long (29-kilometer-long) layer of
greenish glass in an Argentine seaside cliff may have been
deposited by the fiery impact of a comet or asteroid hitting the
Earth 3.3 million years ago, according to researchers.
	   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, Peter H.
Schultz of Brown University said that the glassy material is
consistent with melted rock created by a comet or asteroid impact
nearby.
	   The glassy formation is between Mar del Plata and Miramar, two
cities on the central Atlantic coast of Argentina.
	   At the time of the impact, said Schultz, the site of the deposit
would have been far from the ocean, but a shifting shoreline has
now put it right at the coast. The crater created by the impact,
said Schultz, is probably somewhere offshore, but it has not yet
been found.
	   Schultz said geologic deposits just below the glass layer
contain fossils of some 36 different types of animals that became
extinct around the time of the impact. However, there is
insufficient evidence to prove that a collision with a space
boulder actually caused the extinctions, he said.
	   A widely accepted theory is that a six-mile-wide
(9.6-kilometer-long) asteroid smashed into the Earth 65 million
years ago and led to the demise of the dinosaurs. The impact was
large enough to cause major, global disruptions in weather, it's
believed.
	   But the Argentine event came millions of years later and was
much smaller.
	   ``This was mostly a local event,'' said Schultz. ``It may have
been small enough to cause regional damage and extinctions and may
have triggered a climate change.''
	   Among the animals that disappeared after the Argentine impact,
he said, were some types of ground sloths, some hoofed mammals, a
giant armadillo and a large meat-eating bird.
	   There is geological evidence, said Schultz, that the air and
ocean temperatures also cooled quickly about 3.3 million years ago.
But, again, he said more research is needed to determine whether
the comet or asteroid impact caused the climate change.

Summit confronts rift over EU's shift to the east

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Just days away from the historic launch
of their common currency, European Union leaders gather at their
year-end summit to decide on the next big steps toward unity.
	   There is new impetus behind plans to forge a common defense
strategy less dependent on the United States, but deep divisions
over how to bring in new members from the old East Bloc and end
Europe's post-war divisions.
	   The two-day summit from Friday dominated by the socialist
leaders who now run 11 of the 15 EU nations, will brainstorm over
getting the Union's 16.6 million unemployed back to work.
	   Meeting amid the imperial splendors of the Hofburg Palace from
where Austrian emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, the
leaders are sure to restate a pledge that up to 12 candidate
nations can join the Union someday.
	   The EU has already opened membership talks with the frontrunners
- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
_ who hope to join early next decade.
	   To applicants' chagrin, the EU won't set a timetable for
expansion. Its reluctance is over differences in the pace and
scale, and over who covers the costs of accepting poor neighbors.
	   Before the enlargement, the EU must overhaul its annual dlrs 100
billion budget, over 80 percent of which goes to subsidies for
farmers and aid for poorer EU regions.
	   If left unchanged, those costs will skyrocket when the
easterners join. Poland alone has 4 million farmers, over half the
number in the whole of the current EU. All the eastern European
candidates are poorer than the poorest EU member _ Greece.
	   Germany and other rich EU nations want to freeze spending at
current levels so they do not have to pay more for the expansion.
	   ``We cannot and we do not want to solve Europe's problems with a
German checkbook,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Thursday.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar promised to resist this
assault ``on the bastion of solidarity'' between rich and poor
nations within the EU. Spain is leading other poorer EU members who
fear they will lose out when EU funds start flowing eastward. They
insist on an increase that will add dlrs 24 billion to the EU
budget by 2006.
	   Without a compromise in Vienna, EU officials fear the Union will
miss a March deadline for wrapping up the budget review and be
forced to delay the enlargement.
	   Complicating the issue are divergences over how many should be
allowed in. Britain, Denmark and Austria support a review that
could see Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta open formal
membership talks next year. Germany and France disagree.
	   There's more unity on defense, following Britain's decision to
back plans for cooperation so Europe can respond to crises like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo without having to rely on the United
States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Jacques Chirac are
expected to explain the recent Franco-British agreement to develop
defense ties and seek support for widening the ideas on an EU
level.
	   As always, unemployment will feature prominently. Blair and
Aznar have appealed to other leaders to join them in cutting
red-tape on business, overhauling welfare and simplifying hiring
and firing.
	   ``Reform is essential if Europe is to maximize the positive
employment effects of growth,'' Blair and Aznar wrote.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police released four opposition
leaders Friday morning after holding them for several hours for
distributing political leaflets.
	   The four, including the deputy president of Parti Rakyat
Malaysia, were still, however, likely to face court charges, party
president Syed Husin Ali said in a statement.
	   PRM's Abdul Razak Ahmad and two of its senior members, Hassan
Abdul Karim and Mohd. Salleh Haji Haji Ahmad and Chan Yoke Lam of
the Democratic Action Party, were detained in the southern town of
Johor Bahru on Thursday.
	   They were distributing leaflets to people to inform them about
the ``need for genuine reform,'' Syed Husin said.
	   Hundreds of political activists have been arrested in Malaysia
in recent months for supporting the reform movement started by
Anwar Ibrahim, the jailed former deputy prime minister.
	   Anwar is being tried on charges of abuse of power and engaging
in illegal sex acts.

	   MOOSE JAW, Saskatchewan (AP) _ A jet from Canada's elite
military aerobatics team crashed after touching another plane
during a training exercise. One pilot died.
	   It was the third fatal crash in the past 10 years involving the
Snowbirds, who perform aerobatic routines at air shows across North
America.
	   Air force officials said Thursday that the accident occurred
during a maneuver by a six-plane formation from the military air
base at Moose Jaw.
	   They said there was contact between two jets; one crashed and
the other landed safely. The crashed jet was a Canadair CL-141
Tutor jet, a two-seater training plane built in the 1960s.
	   The name of the pilot of the crashed plane _ the only person
aboard _ was not released pending notification of relatives.
	   The military immediately opened an inquiry into the accident.
	   The Snowbirds _ a unit of 11 pilots _ formed in 1971 and since
then has performed before an estimated 85 million spectators.

Greenpeace takes legal action over Olympic ``ozone threat''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The environmental group Greenpeace on
Friday launched a Federal Court challenge to a decision by the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games to use ozone-depleting gas in an arena's
refrigerant system.
	   The environment group contended that the planned use of the gas
in the Superdome arena air-conditioning system was a breach of
environmental guidelines included in Sydney's bid for the 2000
Games.
	   Greenpeace said it was seeking injunctions to stop the Olympic
Coordination Authority from ``continuing to make misleading
representations.''
	   The lobby's spokesman, Ian Higgins, said the environmental
guidelines for the Summer Olympic Games made a commitment to an
Olympic site which did not threaten the ozone layer.
	   ``The OCA receives enormous mileage out of its worldwide
promotion of a green games, yet behind our backs is allowing the
installation of an air-conditioning system that uses ozone
destorying chemicals.'' he said.

 &UR; CAYMAN ISLANDS: No cruise ships on Sunday, government says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) _ Acting on complaints from
church leaders, the Cayman Islands says it will no longer allow
cruise ships to dock on Sundays, Christmas or Good Friday.
	   Cruise ship operators said Wednesday they were notified of the
ban in a letter from tourism minister Thomas Jefferson.
	   The change would only affect about 10 cruise ship calls each
year, shipping agents said.
	   But Michelle Paige, director of the Florida Caribbean Cruise
Ship Association, said many companies had already made out sailing
schedules and noted Sunday stops in advertising.
	   ``We're very disappointed because none of the cruise lines
received an advance notice of this action,'' Paige said.
 &UR; BARBADOS: U.S. official says EU, not Caribbean, to blame in banana
spat
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ U.S. officials blamed the European
Union for delays in negotiations in a banana export dispute and
said Caribbean nations should be more sensitive to poverty in other
banana-producing regions.
	   ``Every time we have approached the EU and asked to discuss the
matter of bananas they have pointed to some document which they
have and refused to discuss our concerns,'' said Ralph Ives, deputy
assistant U.S. trade representative for Western Europe and the
Mediterranean.
	   ``Since 1992 we have asked the EU to discuss banana policy
because we want a solution to this issue,'' he said.
	   Ives and John Hamilton, an assistant U.S. secretary of state who
deals in Caribbean affairs, spoke to Caribbean officials during a
teleconference organized by the United States Information Service.
	   The World Trade Organization ruled earlier this year that
European trade perks given to banana exports from former European
colonies in the Caribbean violate free-trade guidelines.
	   It was acting on complaints from the United States and Central
American countries.
 &UR; ANGUILLA: Agency says wants more information about launch pad
	   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) _ An Anguillan agency said Thursday it
wants more input from residents before it endorses plans for a
rocket launch pad on tiny Sombrero Island.
	   ``There are still too many unanswered questions, too many
concerns based on our ignorance of the highly technological
stuff,'' Anguilla Natural Trust Executive Director Ijahnya
Christian told The Associated Press. ``We do not think that a final
decision should be made until every Anguillan is satisfied that
those questions have been answered.''
	   Dallas-based Beal Aerospace wants to build a dlrs 20 million
launch pad on the island to launch rockets carrying commercial
satellites. It is also negotiating with the nearby U.S. Virgin
Islands to build a rocket assembly plant on the island of St.
Croix.
	   Officials are especially concerned about Beal's plans to move
hundreds of birds to refuges on other islands, perhaps as far as
200 miles away.
	   An environmental study showed construction would eliminate as
much as 80 percent of nesting areas for the island's masked boobies
and 35 percent of those used by other species.
	   ``The business of birds migrating is not as easy and simple as
Beal thinks it is,'' Christian said.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Drug companies threaten to cut off hospital
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Drug vendors are
threatening to cut off deliveries to St. Thomas' main hospital
because of more than dlrs 500,000 in unpaid bills, its director
said Thursday.
	   Eugene Woods, chief executive officer of the Roy L. Schneider
hospital, said some vendors have given the hospital until next week
to pay up, and he will have to use dlrs 100,000 in emergency funds
to cover some payments.
	   ``We are working closely with the Department of Finance to
prioritize which vendors we feel need to get paid immediately,''
Woods said. ``A couple of vendors have given us deadlines.''
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands is about dlrs 1 billion in debt, about
dlrs 100 million of it in vendor bills and overdue income tax
refunds.
	   Last weekend, gasoline sellers refused to fuel government
vehicles _ including fire trucks, ambulances and police cars _
after the Department of Property and Procurement fell behind on
about 100,000 in payments to Esso Virgin Islands and Hess Oil.
	   The government said it planned to issue checks to the gasoline
companies this week.
	   Meanwhile, private citizens donated money to help keep emergency
vehicles on the roads and police officers used money from their own
pockets to keep squad cars running.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Official indicted on bribery charges
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A federal grand jury
has charged a U.S. Virgin Islands official with taking a bribe to
award a roofing contract, prosecutors announced Thursday.
	   The indictment charges Ann Abramson, a former Department of
Public Works commissioner and businesswoman for whom the cruise
ship pier in St. Croix is named, took dlrs 6,500 in bribes from
contractor Berthill Thomas.
	   She is the second Virgin Islands official to be charged with
wrongdoing this week. On Tuesday, police arrested Stephen Monsanto,
special assistant to the director of the territory's tax bureau, on
charges of embezzling dlrs 196,000 through false bills.
	   Thomas was hired by the agency to repair the roof of the
territory's Finance Department, which was damaged by Hurricane
Marilyn in 1995. The indictment claims he paid Abramson bribes
between September 1995 and October 1998.
	   The 10-count indictment charges both Thomas and Abramson with
conspiracy, bribery in connection with programs using federal
funds, making false claims to the United States, and making false
statements within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.
 &UR; GUYANA: Telephone company in rate row with AT and T
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Saying its viability is at stake,
Guyana's U.S.-owned telephone company is refusing to lower rates
for international calls even though its own costs may soon drop.
	   Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Co., 80 percent-owned by Atlantic
Tele Network of the U.S. Virgin Islands, said that AT and T plans
to end a call switching operating agreement next year in a dispute
over rates.
	   Beginning Jan. 1, AT and T and other carriers will start
reducing rates charged to companies like GT and T to complete calls
to and from the United States. The reductions comply with U.S.
Federal Communications Commission guidelines.
	   GT and T said in order to maintain its viability, it cannot pass
the savings on to consumers _ as desired by Guyana's Public
Utilities Commission.
	   ``If the rates they pay drop, then subscribers should benefit
also,'' PUC financial analyst Lance McKaskey said Wednesday.
``Lower rates mean subscribers will use their telephones for more
minutes and it will stimulate more business, not only for AT and T,
but also for GT and T. Anything else is nonsense.''
 &UR; GUYANA: Guyana Airways cannot pay employees
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana Airways is so short for cash
that it will not be able to pay its more than 300 employees this
month, the company said Wednesday.
	   Chief executive officer Frederick Duncan has been holding
meetings with staff asking them to cooperate while he tries to
persuade the Guyanese government to make up a dlrs 1 million
shortfall in time for Christmas.
	   The state-owned company said its Boeing 757 pilots and those
working turboprop domestic service planes were not paid in
November, either.
	   Duncan said much the company's deficit was due to the grounding
of the company's leased 757 in early November after engineers
discovered damage to the right landing gear.
	   Authorities are awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) for the airplane to resume North American
flights.
	   Guyana Airways has suffered several problems in the last year.
Mechanical problems stranded dozens of passengers for days in
Puerto Rico and Curacao, and this spring the leased 757 struck the
wing of another airplane at the Georgetown airport.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Parliament approves money laundering law
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The Barbadian parliament on Tuesday
approved laws to crack down on money laundering in the Caribbean
country.
	   The measure, which passed without opposition, creates an
Anti-Money Laundering Authority to investigate large bank
transactions. It punishes money launderers with a dlrs 1 million
(Barbados dlrs 2 million) fine or 25 years in prison.
	   ``Barbados has a fine reputation for integrity, one which must
not be sullied by money laundering scams,'' said attorney general
David Simmons, who introduced the bill.
	   The measure is aimed at bringing a 1990 banking law in line with
a United Nations agreement signed in June that calls for all
countries to pass revised laws against money laundering by 2003.
	   Barbados and other Caribbean countries are popular banking areas
because of tax benefits and privacy they have traditionally offered
depositors. In recent years, those benefits have come under
scrutiny from international regulatory groups.
 &UR; SURINAME: Court orders government to pay hospital
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ A supreme court justice has ordered
the Surinamese government to pay an unpaid hospital bill of dlrs
740,000 (368 million guilders).
	   The bill from the Diakonessen Hospital covers 100 beds that the
hospital reserves for poor patients from the country's interior. It
has been unpaid since February, hospital officials claim.
	   On Monday, Judge John von Niessewand ordered the Ministry of
Social Affairs to pay the bill and a 37,000 late fee.
	   Dozens of hospitals in Suriname complain the cash-strapped
government is months behind on payments.
	   Last week, the government transferred dlrs 4.2 million (guilders
2.1 billion) to the State Illness Fund to cover overdue doctors'
fees from 1997.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Unions call for general strike
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Martinique's largest unions on
Tuesday called for a general strike in support of banana workers
who are demanding pay raises.
	   About 200 banana workers struck after labor talks broke down
Nov. 21. They have blocked entrances to Fort-de-France's port with
shipping containers and are refusing to let import or exports
through.
	   Plans for a general strike on Monday were endorsed Tuesday by
the Democratic Union of Martinique Workers, the General Union of
Martinique Workers, the General Confederation of Martinique
Workers, the Federal Syndicate of Martinique, and the Central Trade
Union of Martinique.
	   Banana harvests, meanwhile, are rotting in warehouses. Managers
say they have lost dlrs 4 million (francs 25 million) and will not
resume talks unless workers allow containers of bananas to enter
the port and be refrigerated.
	   On Sunday, police cleared demonstrators and briefly re-opened
the port. As soon as they left, protesters built new barricades and
resumed picketing.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Jet from Jamaica nearly collides with another plane
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Two passenger jets heading to Europe nearly
collided off Long Island, New York, and federal investigators are
trying to determine if a computer malfunction at an air traffic
control center was to blame.
	   The planes, traveling at more than 500 mph (800 kph), came
within 1.07 miles (1.72 kilometers) of each other Sunday night, the
Federal Aviation Administration said. The pilots took evasive
action after being alerted by onboard collision systems.
	   The planes were a British Caledonian L-1011 carrying 271 people
from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Manchester, England, and a Delta
Airlines Boeing 767 carrying 101 passengers from Atlanta to Zurich.
	   They were both flying at 33,000 feet (9,900 meters) where safe
separation is considered either 2,000 feet (600 meters) vertically
or 5 miles (8 kilometers) horizontally. After the warnings, the
jets ended up 900 feet (270 meters) apart vertically; it was
unclear how close they were horizontally.
	   Air traffic controllers blamed the near miss on computer failure
at the Boston Center in Nashua, New Hampshire. The FAA has not
reached that conclusion.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Contractor, tax official arrested on fraud
charges
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Police on Tuesday
arrested a high-level tax official on charges he embezzled dlrs
195,883 from the U.S. Virgin Islands government.
	   Stephen Monsanto, special assistant to the director of the
Internal Revenue Bureau, was charged in Territorial Court with
forgery, obtaining money by false pretenses, embezzlement and
conspiracy. He was released on dlrs 40,000 bail.
	   Monsanto, 40, intercepted and cashed checks that should have
gone to vendors, assistant attorney general Douglas Sprotte
claimed. He said Monsanto also created false invoices and then
cashed the checks issued to cover the bills.
	   Prosecutors allege Monsanto, who was hired in January 1995 and
earned dlrs 53,000 annually, stole the funds funds between May 16,
1996 and April 6 of this year.
	   Bureau director Joseph Aubain was off-island and could not be
reached for comment. Acting director Ervin Dorsett would not
comment Tuesday.
 &UR; GUYANA: U.S. company buys into diamond mine
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A Florida company has signed a deal to
invest in a diamond mine in western Guyana that government studies
show could yield more than 2 million carats in less than 10 years.
	   Pangea Resources Inc. of Dade County has agreed to raise dlrs 5
million to develop the mine at Kurupung, a western mining enclave
near the Venezuelan border.
	   The deal was confirmed Monday by Pangea president Alfredo Lobo
and Mike Correia, president of Correia's Mining Enterprise, the
local partner.
	   Work by small-scale miners between 1900 and the mid-1940s
produced 278 million carats using pick axe and shovel. Finds
gradually grew more sparse, and most small-scale miners have since
left the area.
	   However, government geology studies show there are still about
dlrs 100 million in diamonds left.
	   The proposed mine would use heavy equipment to excavate the
land, then sift gravel for diamonds, Correia said. His company owns
rights to the 28,000-acre plot that will be excavated.
	   Guyana's diamond exports this year are about 23,000 carats, the
government says.
	   The mine would employ as many as 200 people, Correia said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Pillsbury buys meat pie company
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Food manufacturer Pillsbury
announced Monday it will buy Productos Kikuet, Puerto Rico's
largest maker of traditional meat pies, and will move to introduce
the products to other markets.
	   The Minneapolis-based company said it is trying to strengthen
its presence in Latin America and expand into Hispanic markets in
the United States.
	   ``We are acquiring a business that has a shining future,'' the
company said in a written statement Monday.
	   The company owns other refrigerated food companies in Argentina,
Brazil and Venezuela. The company would not disclose the terms of
the purchase.
	   Kikuet, founded in 1997 in San Juan, has two factories and about
170 employees. It has 124 products.
	   Among other brands, Pillsbury produces foods under the Green
Giant, Old El Paso, Haagen-Dazs, Progresso, Hungry Jack and
Totino's labels.
 &UR; CANADA: Charter airline with Caribbean flights reaches deal with
pilots
	   VANCOUVER, Canada (AP) _ Canada 3000 Airlines Ltd., a charter
airline serving many Caribbean destinations, and the union
representing its 235 pilots have reached a tentative deal for a
first contract.
	   A spokesman for the Pilots Association of Canada, which had been
negotiating with the company for the contract for two-and-a-half
years, said he was reasonably pleased with the outcome.
	   ``It's not everything we had hoped for but there are elements
there to make us pleased and there's always another contract,''
said First Officer Pat Ellison.
	   Canada 3000 flies to Antigua, Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada and
Jamaica, in addition to other vacation destinations.
	   The agreement was reached late Saturday with the help of a
federal conciliator, Arnold Palmer, who stepped into the
negotiations in September.
	   Angus Kinnear, president of the charter airline, which operates
out of Vancouver and Toronto, also expressed satisfaction with the
agreement.
	   Details won't be released until after the vote.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Companies offer loan to fix year 2000 bug
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Gov. Roy Schneider
is asking U.S. Virgin Islands lawmakers to allow a dlrs 32.4
million loan to fix the year 2000 bug in government computers.
	   In a letter to legislative leaders Monday, Schneider warned the
problem could paralyze computers with ``meaningless, or worse,
erroneous, calculations.''
	   The problem stems from software and hardware that only uses two
digits to designate years in dates. When 2000 arrives, computer
experts warn many older systems could mistake the date for 1900.
	   Schneider said Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and IBM Corp. have
submitted loan offers with repayment schedules of 10 years and
seven years, respectively.
	   Debt on the 10-year loan would range from a maximum of dlrs 5.8
million in fiscal year 2001 to dlrs 835,000 in fiscal year 2010 if
interest rates remain the same.
	   The loan would be secured by property taxes paid by a refinery
to be built in St. Croix by Hess Oil of the Virgin Islands and
Petroleos de Venezuela.
	   The request comes only weeks before Schneider steps down to make
way for governor-elect Charles Turnbull.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Prime minister says government may restore cut wages
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur
says the government may restore the 8 percent it cut from public
employees' wages during austerity measures in 1991.
	   During a meeting of his Barbados Labor Party Sunday night,
Arthur said the issue of the cuts was high on the agenda of
upcoming labor contract negotiations.
	   ``It is our wish and our will that in the next round of
negotiations ... the question of the restoration of the 8 percent
will be put on the table as one of the matters which will be
finally resolved,'' Arthur said.
	   He said the payroll increase would total about dlrs 29.5 million
(Barbados dlrs 59 million). It would affect about 25,000 workers.
	   In 1991, the Barbadian government was forced to lay off some
3,000 workers, cut public workers' salaries and curb government
spending in order to qualify for aid from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The measures lasted 18 months while the Barbadian economy
recovered from a recession.
	   Arthur said the government would also renegotiate the
government's pay scale.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Eighth electric worker dies
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An electric worker died while
handling a line in the southern Puerto Rican town of Yauco,
bringing to eight the number of linemen killed while repairing
hurricane-damaged lines.
	   Alexander Sinigaglia Gonzalez, 36, died Saturday while trying to
lift a downed 110-volt line, police said.
	   His colleague, Javier Huerta Vega, 27, tried to help Sinigaglia
and suffered severe burns. Huerta remained in a Yauco hospital in
critical condition Sunday. Three other workers were unhurt.
	   Yauco and other southern communities were worst hit by Hurricane
Georges on Sept. 21, and many pockets are still without
electricity. Last week, the city of Ponce said it was dedicating
its city festival this year to electric workers who have died while
repairing lines.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Water and sewer utility workers demonstrate
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ About 5,000 water and sewer workers
in Puerto Rico staged a 24-hour strike Monday to protest a
breakdown in negotiations for a new labor contract.
	   The workers are demanding a new contract before a private
company, Professional Services Group, takes over most management of
the government's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in January. The
company already handles the the utility's customer service
department.
	   The agency said most disruptions were in requests for service
and repair of water lines.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello has called the strike an attempt to disrupt
campaigns just before a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's future
relationship with the United States.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Television station sues over campaign ad
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican television station
is suing Gov. Pedro Rossello's party over footage of a news
reporter in an advertisement advocating U.S. statehood for the
island.
	   WAPA-TV Televicentro, San Juan's Channel 4, claims the ad
implied that reporter Luis Guardiola endorses U.S. statehood in an
upcoming vote on Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   It filed suit against Rossello's New Progressive Party on Friday
in San Juan Superior Court, the San Juan Star newspaper reported.
Campaigners later edited the reporter out of the ad.
	   The Dec. 13 vote asks Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, independence with treaty ties to the United States,
continued commonwealth or ``none of the above,'' a protest vote.
	   The ad showed an interview with San Juan mayor Sila Calderon in
which she called it ``absurd'' for opponents of statehood to vote
for ``none of the above.'' Calderon has since changed her mind.
	   Guardiola was shown interviewing her, then summarizing her
comments during a newscast.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Club Med where guests were held hostage reopens
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Guests were given an
extra-warm welcome by tourism officials at the airport Friday and
Saturday in an effort to erase the impact of an incident in which
workers held resort guests hostage.
	   The Club Med resort in the town of Sainte-Anne reopened its
doors Friday, a month after workers went on strike and refused to
allow the 373 guests to leave the grounds. Police eventually
stormed the hotel and ended the standoff with no significant
injuries.
	   The resort was temporarily closed after the incident and the
management and employees reached an agreement on Nov. 18 to settle
the strike.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Dairy cattle suffer from post-hurricane stress
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It seems even cows can suffer from
on-the-job stress.
	   The production of fresh milk dropped by eight percent in recent
months compared to last year, and the general manager of the Tres
Monjitas dairy blames the stress suffered by cows following
Hurricane Georges, which raked Puerto Rico with 100 mph (162 kph)
winds on Sept. 21 and 22.
	   But manager Juan Corrada said production would still be
sufficient to supply Puerto Rico's needs and he expected by the
middle of December the ``emotional state'' of the cows would have
returned to normal.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Accident in Puerto Rico figures in first air-bag
verdict
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the first child air-bag death case to reach
trial, a federal jury Friday decided DaimlerChrysler AG must pay
half of a dlrs 1.5 million award to the family of a 5-year-old boy
killed by an air bag.
	   The jury, after a 1-month trial in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, decided that the car maker was 50 percent responsible
for the death of 5-year-old Michael Crespo during a family vacation
to Puerto Rico in 1995.
	   DaimlerChrysler in a release denounced the verdict finding that
air bags were unreasonably dangerous. Germany's Daimler-Benz AG
merged with the Chrysler Corp. last month.
	   ``It is unfortunate that the jury appears to have let their
emotions cloud their judgment,'' said Ken Gluckman, the car maker's
associate counsel. ``This was a tragic accident involving the
senseless death of a young child and the sad truth is that child
would be alive today if his father made sure that he was wearing
his seat belt.''

Biggest-ever international gathering challenges Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo HAN101
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ If it had been able to see the pitfalls,
Vietnam might have thought twice about putting on next week's ASEAN
summit.
	   Seen as an opportunity to show the world it can host a major
international gathering, the government has discovered it's a bit
like a water polo match: it looks easy, but a glance below the
surface shows lots of grinding hard work that often is unrewarding
_ and thankless.
	   Foreign diplomats privately grumble that Vietnam is unfocused,
trying to cater to too many issues while pushing its own agenda
instead of trying to mediate the consensus that members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations seek.
	   Journalists have complained about everything from information
restrictions to technical hassles and price-gouging in one of the
world's poorest countries. Many major decisions were left to the
last minute, complicating staffing.
	   More than 500 reporters and other media staff have been
accredited for the two-day summit and its preliminary meetings.
While last year's Francophone summit here drew a similar number and
went fairly smoothly, a gathering of ASEAN leaders attracts a much
more aggressive crew.
	   One problems is that government ministries and state-owned
corporations are effectively fiefdoms accustomed to running their
own show and they don't like being told what to do by other
officials.
	   So Vietnam Post and Telecommunications has resisted requests to
temporarily trim costs that are among the highest in the world _ in
some cases triple or more those charged in other countries.
	   Customs officials, told to facilitate temporary imports of gear
to be used for the summit, exerted their authority by refusing to
translate clearance documents and requiring submitting
organizations to do it instead.
	   Some Vietnamese embassies have continued to adhere to rigid visa
requirements. One reporter was told he couldn't get a visa that
already had been approved by the Foreign Ministry because he didn't
have six blank pages in his passport.
	   Before the restrictions on access to officials were eased, some
ASEAN officials had worried that they would be accused of
censorship by media attending from their own countries. The limits
still remain among the tightest ever seen at a meeting of this
magnitude.
	   Despite all the hassles, visitors will find Hanoi a pleasant,
bustling capital of a million people.
	   Lakes, trees and small parks complement the French
colonial-style architecture which contrasts with a handful of
high-rise buildings that have gone up in recent years.
	   Traffic is chaotic and daunting, with motorbikes zipping here
and there, but there are few jams. Outside the high-end hotels,
food is cheap.
	   The city has been undergoing a frantic last-minute facelift. On
one recent night, bricklayers were working in the rain until nearly
midnight on new sidewalks for Tran Hung Dao, one of the major
streets.
	   The same sidewalks have been rebuilt four times in the last
decade or so while others that are in much greater need of repairs
have been left alone. That led a columnist in one government
newspaper to question whether the city's traffic and public works
departments have so much money that they can afford to waste it.

Clemens still with Toronto as meetings begin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roger Clemens was still with the Blue Jays as
teams started heading to the winter meetings Thursday night, and it
appeared Toronto was no closer to a deal for the five-time Cy Young
Award winner.
	   ``We are prepared to move on a deal,'' Blue Jays general manager
Gord Ash said. ``I just don't have control over a timetable.''
	   Texas, Houston, the New York Yankees and Cleveland were said to
be in the chase, with Colorado and Atlanta possibly long-shot
contenders.
	   ``We've certainly had discussions with the Blue Jays,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We've talked about
individual players that we would discuss, and individual players
that we wouldn't discuss. I think really the ball is in their
court.''
	   Ash, speaking from Toronto during a telephone conference call,
said five teams remained in contention for Clemens. He said he
hadn't been contacted by the team he said Wednesday had discussed a
package Toronto deemed acceptable.
	   In other baseball news, Houston signed pitcher Shane Reynolds to
a dlrs 21.5 million, three-year contract extension through 2002,
catcher Tom Lampkin agreed to a dlrs 1.55 million, two-year
contract with Seattle and shortstop Rey Sanchez agreed to a dlrs
1.1 million, one-year deal with the Royals.
	   Kansas City also acquired third baseman Joe Randa from the New
York Mets for former first-round draft pick Juan LeBron.
	   Reynolds, 19-8 with a 3.51 ERA this year, will make dlrs 3.5
million next year, the final season of an dlrs 8.5 million,
three-year contract. Under the extension, Reynolds gets a dlrs 3.5
million signing bonus payable over three years, dlrs 5.5 million in
2000, dlrs 6 million in 2001 and dlrs 6.5 million in 2002.

Report: Deutsche Bank, Sakura Bank to merge brokerage units
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank, and major
Japanese lender Sakura Bank Ltd. have agreed to form a strategic
alliance by merging their securities subsidiaries, a local
newspaper said Friday.
	   Under the deal, Sakura Securities and Deutsche Securities would
merge as early as next summer, the Yomiuri, Japan's
widest-circulation daily, reported.
	   The two banks also plan to link their businesses in areas such
as asset management and the development of mutual fund-type
investment products, the report said. A formal announcement of the
tie-up was expected as soon as next week, it said.
	   A spokesman for Sakura did not rule out such an alliance, but
said no final decision has been made.
	   The move would mark the latest bid by Deutsche Bank and other
foreign financial firms to expand their presence in Japan, which
has begun to implement drastic deregulation of the banking,
brokerage and insurance industries.
	   Last month, Deutsche Bank announced plans to set up a joint
venture asset management company with Japan's Nippon Life Insurance
Co.
	   Also, Bankers Trust Corp. of the United States agreed last month
to be acquired by Deutsche Bank in a mega-deal valued at about dlrs
10.2 billion.

International team takes early lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Presidents Cup is in new
territory, and so is the International team.
	   After two straight years of falling far behind from the start,
the International team took an early 3 1-2 to 1 1-2 lead Friday
behind a 12-meter (40-foot) birdie putt from Frank Nobilo on the
18th hole that rocked Royal Melbourne Golf Club and handed Mark
O'Meara and David Duval their first loss in a Presidents Cup match.
	   ``I was pleased with my team's effort,'' International captain
Peter Thomson said as the alternate-shot matches were winding down.
``It was about 100 percent better than it was the last time out.''
	   Just about anything would have been better than the first two
years, when
	   the United States opened leads of 5-0 and 4-1 after best-ball
matches en route to victories in the first two Presidents Cup
matches played at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia.
	   These matches began with alternate-shot, but that wasn't the
only change.
	   For the first time all week, a scorching wind blew from the
north _ the direction that gives Royal Melbourne its sharpest teeth
_ and the International team felt right at home.
	   The only U.S. victory came from Fred Couples and Tiger Woods,
who got a boost when their scrambling bogey enabled them to halve
the par-3 8th hole, and they went on to crush Ernie Els and Vijay
Singh, 5 and 4.
	   Davis Love III and Justin Leonard pulled out a tie against Nick
Price and
	   Stuart Appleby when Leonard hit his approach on the 18th to
about 4 feet and
	   Love made the birdie putt.
	   Greg Norman, the player most responsible for getting the
Presidents Cup moved out of the United States, teamed with Steve
Elkington for a 2-up victory over John Huston and Jim Furyk, while
Craig Parry and Shigeki Maruyama, two short but powerful players,
steamrolled to a 3 and 2 win over Lee Janzen and Scott Hoch.
	   Nobilo and Greg Turner, both from New Zealand and carried along
by shouts
	   of ``Come on, Kiwis'' by a partisan gallery, never trailed in
the first match of the day against O'Meara and Duval, the best two
players in America this year and 3-0 as a team in the last cup.
	   Nobilo and Turner played only one hole over par _ a triple-bogey
on the 464-yard, par-4 14th that played dead into the wind _ and
gave Thomson the match he expected when he made both of them his
captain's picks.
	   They took the lead for good on No. 6 when Duval blocked his
drive 35 meters right of the fairway and presumably over the fence
and onto a city street _ the ball never was found. Duval and
O'Meara missed three putts of about 10 feet on the first nine
holes, but were only one down when O'Meara hit his approach on No.
18 to about 2 feet, setting up a probable halve of their match.
	   But Nobilo, a descendant of pirates, robbed the Americans of a
gutsy comeback with his putter. He saved par on the 17th with a
4-foot putt to keep
	   the International lead at 1-up, then rolled in his 40-footer as
O'Meara and Duval watched in disbelief.
	   Nobilo said he was inspired by watching an ESPN television
report that ``basically gave us no chance.'' O'Meara knew better.
	   ``When I hit it up there about 2 or 3 feet, I told David to just
roll it in,'' O'Meara said. ``But in the back of my mind, I though
Frank might make that putt. In this type of format, you can never
underestimate your opponent.''
	   Norman knew from the forecast of hot weather _ it was already
approaching 35C (90F) degrees when the matches began _ that the
wind would blow from the north.
	   ``It was pretty tough in the wind, but we know each other's
games so well,'' said Norman. He and Elkington were winning
partners last month in the
	   Shark Shootout, Norman's first tournament since surgery on his
left shoulder

Cambodia, non-interference issues push to the fore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ASEAN-Host Hassles &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The focus is supposed to be on economic
recovery when Southeast Asian leaders meet next week. But some
officials are concerned the agenda is getting hijacked by internal
issues.
	   Coming just a month after the wider and more high-profile Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia that U.S. Vice
President Al Gore attended, no major new initiatives are expected.
	   Instead, a draft of the final declaration and a separate plan of
action talk largely about implementing proposals endorsed at last
year's Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   In recent months, some countries hit hard by the region's
economic contagion have shown signs of bottoming out. The ASEAN
summit Tuesday and Wednesday aims to do what it can to foster a
turnaround.
	   ``The crisis which ravaged the region prominently highlights the
requirement for sustainable development: economic growth must
accompany settlement of social problems, especially equal
distribution of wealth,'' Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Vu Khoan
said.
	   ASEAN Secretary-general Rodolfo Severino has said he hopes the
group will become more actively involved in the process of revising
the global financial system.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, always one of ASEAN's
most outspoken members, may try to sell his controversial currency
controls, which he believes have helped keep his country from
economic collapse.
	   But most of the pre-summit buzz has been about whether Cambodia
should become ASEAN's 10th member now and whether to change one of
the group's founding principles: non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
	   As the summit host, Vietnam is supposed to foster consensus on
issues. But it is the leading proponent of Cambodia's admission and
a prime opponent of any change in the non-interference policy.
	   It is ironic that Vietnam, which joined ASEAN in 1995, is
hosting the summit, considering that the regional grouping was
formed 31 years ago as a counterbalance to Vietnamese communism.
	   But the country has been on a decade-old path of economic reform
that has allowed capitalism and individual initiative to thrive _
albeit despite red tape and other hassles.
	   Cambodia's admission is almost certain; the question is whether
it should be allowed in now. It had been scheduled to join ASEAN in
1997, but political turmoil led to its application being put on
hold until a stable government was in place.
	   Agreement between two major factions was reached late last
month, and the country was given back its seat at the United
Nations this week.
	   Several countries say there's no reason to delay completing
ASEAN's membership, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
	   Others say that, given Cambodia's history of instability, they
do not want to act hastily, since it would be difficult to expel or
suspend a member if the situation were to deteriorate again.
	   The issue has implications for the non-interference policy
debate. Some leaders suggested at last year's summit _ held at the
height of the economic crisis _ that it should be reviewed.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan has proposed that ASEAN
move toward a more outspoken position of ``flexible engagement''
which encourages talks on political issues of mutual concern.
	   But Cambodia already has said it favors keeping the policy as it
is. Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos and Myanmar are certain to back that
stance, too.
	   The summit will be strictly an Asian affair. After last year's
meeting had 10 ``dialogue partners'' that included the United
States, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, only three _
Japan, China and South Korea _ were invited this time.
	   Although officials from the countries that were left out refuse
to publicly criticize the decision, some admit privately to being
miffed since they are major donors or investors in the region.
	   Another controversial topic is the Philippines' push to get a
statement on the South China Sea, the cause of numerous territorial
disputes centering around the Spratly Islands, believed to
surrounded by oil fields.

Countries with poorer human rights records defend themselves at UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; speeches resume at 1500 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Countries criticized for human rights
abuses used the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights to defend their records and pledge adherence to the
document's lofty goals.
	   China, Algeria and even Chile _ whose rights record has come
under scrutiny with the recent arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet _
were among the speakers opening a special General Assembly session
to mark the anniversary.
	   The session was continuing late Thursday and through Friday
because only a fraction of the 126 speakers signed up had delivered
their addresses.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan began the session by awarding Human
Rights Prizes to five activists in the front lines of the struggle
against injustice.
	   ``Today we honor the highest of human aspirations and renew our
promise to conquer the worst of human cruelty,'' Annan said. ``We
pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of these human
rights, and to the memory of those who died for them.''
	   The winners were former U.S. President Jimmy Carter; Sunila
Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka; Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda; Jose
Gregori of Brazil; and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic.
	   A sixth prize honored ``all human rights defenders all over the
world.''
	   Later Thursday, Luciano Pavarotti and Wynton Marsalis gave a
gala concert in the assembly hall _ capping a day of appearances by
celebrities such as Michael Douglas and Vanessa Redgrave.
	   ``Our music, jazz music, is the music of freedom,'' Marsalis
told the audience before he began.
	   Speakers at the special session and at a parallel conference in
Paris noted that hundreds of millions of people throughout the
world are still deprived of the most basic political, social and
economic rights _ despite the declaration and the ratification of
60 treaties inspired by it.
	   Among the human rights violations cited: the lack of health care
and education for women and girls in Afghanistan; mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia; the murders and disappearances of
thousands of people under Pinochet.
	   Chile's deputy U.N. ambassador, Juan Larrain, didn't refer to
Pinochet's 1973 coup in his speech, but said his country realized
the fragility of the idea of human rights when its democratic
history was ``interrupted.''
	   ``It was in these difficult circumstances of our life as a
nation that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights took on even
more meaning for the Chilean people, serving as a permanent guide
for those who believed that the dignity and respect for human
beings couldn't be trampled in any way, under any pretext,'' he
said.
	   China and Algeria, meanwhile, defended their human rights
records and stated their adherence to the declaration's values.
	   ``As a country under the rule of law, China gives equal
importance to the individual rights of its people,'' China's U.N.
ambassador, Qin Huasun said. ``It respects and protects civil
rights and political rights and opposes the activities that violate
the legitimate rights of its people.
	   Algeria's ambassador, M. Abdallah Baali, said his country had
seen ``major advancements'' in democracy and the field of human
rights, despite efforts to thwart them _ a reference to a Muslim
insurgency that has wracked the country for seven years.
	   At the start of the session, the General Assembly adopted a
nonbinding resolution reaffirming ``the faith of the United Nations
in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human
person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large
and small.''
	   Despite such symbolic efforts _ and more concrete ones,
including the creation of international tribunals to prosecute war
crimes suspects _ the world's record in responding to and
preventing gross human rights abuses ``does not give ground for
encouragement,'' said the top U.N. human rights official, Mary
Robinson.
	   In Paris, where the declaration was signed 50 years ago, Anna
Eleanor Roosevelt recalled the intention of the declaration's
original supporters, including her grandmother, former American
first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
	   ``Human rights begins in the small places, close to home,'' she
said, quoting her grandmother. ``If we remember to respect our
neighbor, our coworker, our children ... we will understand how to
give strength to peoples who live far away, who perhaps we will
never know.''

600 evacuated as destructive Cyclone Thelma bears down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The last of 600 people were evacuated
Friday from the sparsely populated Dampier peninsula in northwest
Australia as Cyclone Thelma's highly destructive winds bore down on
the coastline.
	   ``About 400 of them self-evacuated to Broome and Derby last
night, and 200 are in a convoy to Broome as we speak,'' State
Emergency Service (SES) Broome region assistant manager Alan Gale
said.
	   ``SES people and the Department of Transport are bussing them
out, and the Department of Family and Children's Services has
organized shelter for them,'' he said.
	   The category five cyclone packing 185 mph (300 kph) winds near
its destructive core -- the most severe on record to assault
Australia -- was brushing past Western Australia's northern-most
tip last night.
	   People on ranches in the remote area had retreated to bunkers or
specially strengthened rooms in their houses, Gale said.

UN chief urges Israel to release Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Israel
to implement its part of the latest land-for-peace accord and to
continue releasing Palestinian prisoners during a meeting Thursday
with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, U.N. officials said.
	   During the ``cordial and frank'' meeting, Annan also asked
Israel to stop building new settlements, and specifically mentioned
the Har Homa project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, the
spokesman told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east
Jerusalem. They say the Har Homa settlement is part of an Israeli
plan to cut off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from
their hinterland in Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.
	   Sharon, who has been in New York and Washington since Sunday,
said the meeting _ his first with the U.N. chief _ was very
interesting.
	   ``I presented the secretary-general with, on the one hand,
Israel's sincere desire to arrive at peace with all of its
neighbors, including the Palestinians, and on the other hand,
Israel's firm insistence that the Palestinians fully carry out
their obligations,'' Sharon said, according to a release from
Israel's U.N. Mission.
	   During the meeting, requested by Israel, Annan pointed out to
Sharon that the Oslo peace accords are based on U.N. resolutions
which in turn are based on the concept of land-for-peace.
	   The latest land-for-peace agreement was reached two months ago
at Wye River, Maryland, but Israel has frozen further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank saying the Palestinians have
violated the accord. The Palestinians in turn have insisted that
Israel release more political prisoners.
	   Annan ``encouraged Israel to continue to release Palestinian
prisoners, as agreed to at Wye plantation,'' the U.N. spokesman
said.
	   The U.N. chief also urged Israel to exercise restraint in
southern Lebanon, where Israel has occupied an enclave to protect
its northern territory from cross-border attacks from Hezbollah
guerrillas, the spokesman said.
	   Annan raised concerns conveyed to him in a letter from the
Lebanese prime minister ``concerning the supersonic flights over
Beirut at night flown by Israeli aircraft,'' the spokesman said.
	   ``We cannot have comprehensive peace without Syria,'' the
spokesman quoted Annan as reminding Sharon. Syria is the main power
broker in Lebanon.
	   Sharon for his part ``explained our desire to conduct peace
negotiations with Syria; not of course from the point Syria is
demanding, but from the point that everything is open to
negotiation,'' according to the release.
	   Sharon said that in his opinion, Israel could only withdraw from
southern Lebanon as called for by U.N. resolutions if Lebanon was
held responsible for what takes place on its territory and if there
were peace negotiations running concurrent with any decision to
withdraw.
	   Sharon presented Annan with a 16th century map of the region.

Reports: Government decides size of 1999 tax cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
ruling party have decided to cut income taxes by 20 percent across
the board next fiscal year, Japanese newspapers reported Friday.
	   In a meeting Thursday, tax officials from the government and the
Liberal Democratic Party agreed on the measures, which will include
a maximum cut of 150,000 yen (dlrs 1,280), the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported.
	   They also agreed to cut residential taxes by 15 percent, or up
to 40,000 yen (dlrs 340), said the paper, Japan's leading business
daily.
	   News of the cuts was also carried on the front pages of three
other major Japanese newspapers.
	   But a Finance Ministry spokesman quoted Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa as saying that nothing concrete had been decided and that
government and LDP tax officials were discussing details.
	   The spokesman said a decision will be announced by the end of
next week. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The government plans to send tax reform legislation to the next
regular session of Parliament beginning in January.
	   The Nihon Keizai said the 1999 tax cuts are expected to total 4
trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion).
	   Overall, however, benefits from tax cuts will remain unchanged
from this year, when there was a one-time special tax cut worth the
same amount.
	   The amount of the tax cuts for households with two children and
annual income of 10 million yen (dlrs 85,250) will come to 190,000
yen (dlrs 1,620).
	   But those with income of 8 million yen (dlrs 68,200) will total
116,000 yen (dlrs 990), the daily said, adding that the proposed
cuts for 1999 are weighted towards the wealthy.
	   The government and the ruling party had already decided to
reduce the maximum income tax rate for next year from 50 percent to
37 percent and the highest residential tax rate from 15 percent to
13 percent.
	   The cuts are aimed at boosting consumer spending in Japan, which
is in the midst of a nagging recession that has failed to respond
to previous tax cut and fiscal stimulus measures.

Government, hoping for debt relief, draws up 1999 austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 19th graf to CORRECT revenue and spending figures. Also
moved on general news lines &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government drew up an austerity budget
for 1999 on Thursday but the bid to repair Russia's decrepit
economy requires massive debt restructuring that foreign creditors
have so far been unwilling to grant.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters.
	   The draft budget that was approved by the government Thursday
calls for $7.2 billion in new foreign loans, and provides for
repaying only $9.5 billion in foreign debt next year, Zadornov
said.
	   That means Russia, in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, will seek restructuring
of $8 billion of the $17.5 billion it is due to pay in 1999.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who holed up in a country residence this
week after more than two weeks in a hospital for treatment of
pneumonia.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris Club of
creditor nations.
	   But so far the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The government will submit the draft budget on Friday to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Zadornov said. Primakov,
who enjoys broad support in the Duma, is counting on quick
approval.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that it is very austere,'' Primakov
told his cabinet as leaders hashed out the draft. ``The essential
thing is that it is honest. We didn't include spending that can't
be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov said expected revenues would cover all of Russia's
domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia needs to
restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet Union.
The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what Russia
owes next year.
	   But creditors have been unwilling to rework the debts Russia
already has, and the prospects for more foreign loans are equally
hazy.
	   A $22.6 billion loan package put together by the International
Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt default and ruble
devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign credits that had yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that if it does not get foreign
aid, it would simply print money _ which would send inflation
soaring.
	   The government already intends to print about $1.7 billion worth
of rubles next year, according to the draft budget, to cover part
of a deficit equivalent to around $5 billion.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues worth $24 billion, by
Thursday's exchange rate for the ruble, and spending of around $29
billion, officials said.
	   Many economists predict the deficit will be even larger because
the government's estimates of an average ruble rate of 21.5 to the
dollar and 30 percent next year may be unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.

Global conference to stress problem, possible remedies

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With 385 days to go until Jan. 1, 2000, a
U.N. conference on Friday was to tackle the so-called ``Year 2000
bug,'' a problem that could threaten every country's computer
systems _ and the global economy that depends on them.
	   More than 200 representatives from at least 120 member-states
were to convene at the global body's New York headquarters in a
closed meeting to identify the crisis points in solving the
computer problem and discuss contingency plans post-Y2K.
	   ``This meeting has a single agenda. It is Y2K,'' said Ahmad
Kamal, the Pakistan ambassador at the United Nations and chairman
of the U.N. Economic and Social Council's Working Group on
Informatics.
	   Y2K is shorthand for the Year 2000 problem, which occurs because
some programs, especially older ones, may fail when the date
changes to 2000. Because they were written to recognize only the
last two digits of a year, such programs could read the digits
``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.
	   Assessments of what might happen vary wildly, especially in
developing countries. They don't use as much sophisticated
technology, but the technology that is used often is older and
relies on software that cannot been updated. In the developed
world, the sheer number of computer systems needing to be checked
and corrected is the main obstacle.
	   Aircraft control, telecommunications, electrical power,
financial services and governmental functions are all at risk from
the bug. And some economists worry that world financial markets _
not fully recovered from the current financial crisis hitting Asia
and other parts of the globe _ could become even more unstable.
	   The conference will focus on determining how quickly countries
are upgrading their computer systems, monitoring the upgrade
process and planning for the inevitable failures.
	   Capers Jones, chief scientist at Software Productivity Research
Inc. in Burlington, Massachusetts, a well-respected Y2K expert,
said he didn't expect much from the conference.
	   ``I don't think anyone at the U.N. knows much about the
problem,'' he said. ``And they'll probably gloss it over.''
	   Jones expects that 15 percent of the problems won't be solved in
time in the United States. In Europe, he expects a failure rate of
25 percent and 35 percent everywhere else.
	   ``It's going to be an uncomfortable three months,'' he said,
predicting widescale phone outages, electrical disruptions and
roiled financial markets. People in a position to address the
problem, he said, waited too long and now governments must prepare
for rough going in early 2000.
	   ``There will be problems,'' Kamal acknowledged, ``and that is
the reason for contingency plans.''
	   But flanked by representatives from nine member-states, Kamal
appealed for all countries to work together, calling for an
international spirit of we-can-do-it-together-ness.
	   ``This is a working group before you,'' agreed John A. Koskinen,
chairman of the United States' presidential council on the Y2K bug.
``We all know the challenge is not one of any single country
itself, and all of us are dependent on each other.''
	   Representatives from Bulgaria, the Netherlands, South Africa,
Chile, the Philippines, Mexico and South Korea also attended the
press briefing.
	   Reflecting the potential for wide-ranging disruption, Y2K
experts from the World Bank, the International Telecommunications
Union, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the International
Civil Aviation Organization, the Joint Year 2000 Council and the
International Technology Association of America also will attend
Friday's conference.
	   But is it too little, too late to prevent a global hangover on
New Year's Day 2000?
	   ``We have a year and a few days,'' said Kamal. ``Let us try to
do the maximum that we can.''

Government, hoping for debt relief, draws up 1999 austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 19th `The draft...' to CORRECT transposed revenue and
spending figures. Picks up penultimate graf pvs, `Many
economists...' &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government drew up an austerity budget
for 1999 on Thursday but the bid to repair Russia's decrepit
economy requires massive debt restructuring that foreign creditors
have so far been unwilling to grant.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told reporters.
	   The draft budget that was approved by the government Thursday
calls for $7.2 billion in new foreign loans, and provides for
repaying only $9.5 billion in foreign debt next year, Zadornov
said.
	   That means Russia, in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, will seek restructuring
of $8 billion of the $17.5 billion it is due to pay in 1999.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who holed up in a country residence this
week after more than two weeks in a hospital for treatment of
pneumonia.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris Club of
creditor nations.
	   But so far the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The government will submit the draft budget on Friday to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Zadornov said. Primakov,
who enjoys broad support in the Duma, is counting on quick
approval.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that it is very austere,'' Primakov
told his cabinet as leaders hashed out the draft. ``The essential
thing is that it is honest. We didn't include spending that can't
be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov said expected revenues would cover all of Russia's
domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia needs to
restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet Union.
The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what Russia
owes next year.
	   But creditors have been unwilling to rework the debts Russia
already has, and the prospects for more foreign loans are equally
hazy.
	   A $22.6 billion loan package put together by the International
Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt default and ruble
devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign credits that had yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that if it does not get foreign
aid, it would simply print money _ which would send inflation
soaring.
	   The government already intends to print about $1.7 billion worth
of rubles next year, according to the draft budget, to cover part
of a deficit equivalent to around $5 billion.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues worth $24 billion, by
Thursday's exchange rate for the ruble, and spending of around $29
billion, officials said.
	   Many economists predict the deficit will be even larger because
the government's estimates of an average ruble rate of 21.5 to the
dollar and 30 percent next year may be unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.

Australia 78 for one at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Dean Headley drew first blood for
England after two dropped catches threatened to undermine the
visitors' spirited bowling in unbearable heat in the third cricket
test Friday.
	   With temperatures reaching 42 degrees midway through the morning
at Adelaide Oval, Australia, winning the toss and batting, was 78
for one at lunch on the first day with Mark Taylor and Justin
Langer unbeaten on 30 and 23 respectively.
	   Headley, playing his first test since his appearance against Sri
Lanka at the Oval, forced Michael Slater to edge a catch to
wicketkeeper Alec Stewart in the 12th over of the morning.
	   Three balls before Mark Ramprakash had spilt a chest-high catch
at point off a cut by the Australian opener.
	   In the third over of the day, medium paceman Darren Gough had
Taylor edging before he had scored, but second slip Graeme Hick
could only get a fingertip on it before grassing it.
	   Taylor, playing in his 102nd test, moved past David Boon's 7,422
runs to become the second highest run-getter for Australia behind
Allan Border's world record 11,174.
	   He pulled left-arm seamer Alan Mullally for two through mid
wicket to move past the milestone when on 16.
	   Taylor and Langer coming together at 28 for one, batted
watchfully in 66 minutes together.
	   Headley has taken 1-27.

Thailand's greatest sports day infects many with Asian Games fever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bigger crowds are pressing around
television sets and office workers take longer breaks as Thai
athletes pile up unexpected victories at the Asian Games.
	   Many Bangkok residents who earlier shrugged when the 15-day
sports extravaganza was mentioned are now gripped with games fever.
	   ``Best ever day in our Asiad history,'' headlined the Bangkok
Post Friday.
	   Indeed, the previous day host Thailand took four golds, its best
performance in the 47 years of the Asian Games. Its victories came
in shooting, gymnastics, equestrian competition and swimming.
	   At the pool, some 5,000 screaming fans helped propel Torlap
Sethsothorn to gold and a games record in the 400-meter freestyle.
The 19-year-old, who trains in Australia, has emerged as the local
games hero.
	   The Thais have jumped from sixth to fourth place on the medals
chart behind China, Japan and South Korea, with seven gold, 12
silver and 17 bronze medals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   THE BIG BYE-BYE: Organizers are hoping to attract some 100,000
people to a gigantic street party to bid farewell to athletes who
took part in the Asian Games.
	   Silom Road, dubbed Bangkok's Wall Street, will be closed to
traffic Dec. 19 to make way for nine processions, rock bands,
cabaret shows and food stalls. Many of the games' 6,000 athletes
are expected to join in the Silom Bangkok Carnival, being organized
by the municipality and businesses along the road.
	   The games' closing ceremony comes the following day.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUNNED DOWN AT THE GAMES: The killing of a sports official in
southern Thailand may be related to gambling debts rather than his
role in the Asian Games, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Wirat Khongjan, a 47-year-old physical education instructor, was
gunned down Thursday by two men on a motorcycle in the southern
town of Trang.
	   Wirat was organizing sepak takraw competition in Trang, one of
several provincial areas where Asian Games events are being staged,
said the newspaper The Nation.
	   Police Lt. Col. Charoen Losiri was quoted as saying the killing
may be tied to Wirat's alleged gambling debts, ruling out his role
in the Asian Games as a motive.
	   Wirat won a provincial award last year for being an outstanding
physical education teacher.
	   In sepak takraw, a Southeast Asian speciality, players hit a
small ball across a net using virtually every part of their bodies.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FREE SNAPS: Kodak, the official film supplier of the Asian
Games, expects more than 110,000 rolls of film will be used during
the 15-day sports event.
	   About 25,000 rolls will be handed out free to accredited
photographers, while the rest will be sold at more than 40 booths
set up at the main venues.

Luxury hotel is focus in battle over Cyprus' Akamas Peninsula
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY322 &QL; 
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AKAMAS PENINSULA, Cyprus (AP) _ It's almost impossible not to
notice the new, Cyprus pounds 27.5 million (dlrs 55 million) Anassa
hotel sitting on a ridge in this remote and virtually virgin corner
of Cyprus.
	   The 185-room hotel is not the only building on the peninsula.
But it is by far the biggest in the last area of this Mediterranean
island that so far has escaped the mad rush to build for mass
tourism.
	   The Anassa's size and ownership by a leading politician have
made the hotel a focus in a battle by environmentalists to save
Cyprus' westernmost cape and turn it into a protected area.
	   ``It is a very big hotel,'' said George Perdikis, spokesman for
the Green Party. ``You can see it from miles (kilometers) away. It
is shouting, `I am here _ the hotel owned by Alecos Michaelides!'''
	   Another activist, Irene Constantinou, said the hotel's link to
the former foreign minister is not as troubling as its location
amid the forest, brushland, hills and long sandy beaches that make
the Akamas special.
	   ``To me, it is just another big hotel,'' said Constantinou, the
Cyprus representative of the environmental group Greenpeace. ``We
are not against tourism, but we want sustainable tourism and
development which won't endanger the environment.''
	   Constantinou and Perdikis said the Akamas Peninsula faces other
dangers: illegal hunting and construction, growing tourism and
brush fires touched off by live-fire military exercises _ suspended
at least for now _ by British troops based on the island.
	   The environmentalists' campaign is opposed by landowners, who
hope to cash in on booming tourism that already attracts more than
2 million visitors a year to Cyprus.
	   The landowners want the government to protect only the Akamas
forests _ about a fifth of the 320-square-kilometer
(130-square-mile) peninsula that juts into the Mediterranean about
30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Paphos.
	   A 1996 World Bank report recommended that all of Akamas be
protected, with even low-level development limited. Constantinou
said adopting that plan could cost the government 30 million Cyprus
pounds (dlrs 62 million) to compensate landowners.
	   The environmentalists have fought the Anassa hotel in a series
of lawsuits, the latest questioning the legality of exemptions from
zoning laws. Some concede they expect to lose, but say the fight
has pointed up the dangers facing the unspoiled peninsula.
	   The hotel, overlooking the clear blue waters of the Asprokremmos
Bay, has a majestic view of nearby hills. The western leg of the
Troodos Mountains, the island's highest, rises in the background.
	   Michaelides, the Anassa's owner, denies he used his political
influence in gaining permits for the hotel. He also argues the
hotel's beige and white, two- and three-story buildings fit in with
rather than detract from the beauty of the peninsula.
	   The Anassa blends classical, Byzantine and turn-of-the-century
Cypriot design, and Michaelides says he instructed architects to
make the building reflect the island's history.
	   ``I told them ... that I did not want it to look like a hotel,''
he said in an interview.''
	   ``Next time you come, you'll miss us altogether,'' he added,
referring to plans for using trees to conceal the hotel, where a
top suite costs as much as cyprus pounds 500 (dlrs 1,000) a night.
	   Michaelides' critics see the hotel as a dangerous precedent that
tempts other developers _ adding considerably to threats facing the
Akamas' ecological balance.
	   The environmentalists are fighting to protect monk seals, which
are occasionally seen in the area, and endangered Green turtles,
one of two sea turtle species that lay their eggs on the
peninsula's beaches between June and August.
	   ``Turtles once nested on beaches across the island,'' said
Andreas Demetropoulos of the Agriculture Ministry's Fisheries
Department.
	   Constantinou gave a broader view of the threat of extinction: 50
years ago the turtles nested along the entire Mediterranean shore
but now are limited to Cyprus, southern Turkey and some Aegean
islands.
	   Perdikis of the Green Party claims the Anassa hotel is already
interfering with the turtles. ``We have reports that hatchlings
emerged from the sand and headed for the hotel instead of the sea
and subsequently died,'' he said.
	   Demetropoulos, the fisheries official, agreed that was
plausible, noting the hotel's lights are much brighter than the
reflection of light in the sea, which is what lures baby turtles
into the water.

A hard road out of the slums for Chile's poor

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CERRILLOS, Chile (AP) _ Elida Mansilla is proud of the neat
little apartment she now lives in, after the cardboard and wooden
shack she inhabited for years in one of Santiago's poorest slums.
	   Yet the change doesn't mean she no longer has to fight for a
better life, the mother of three says.
	   She is one of the pioneers of Chile Barrio, a year-old
government program to move more than 500,000 people from 972 slums
throughout the country into small but solid new buildings. The goal
is to clear out all the slums by 2003.
	   The program, however, faces a major problem: Families remain as
poor at their new apartments as they were at the slums, but now
they have financial obligations they didn't know before.
	   In the slums, they cooked with firewood and survived without
running water, electricity, sewers. After the move, they have all
those services, but they also get the bills.
	   Both the government and the former slum dwellers say that
problem must be tackled if the slum eradication program is to
succeed.
	   The government now is requiring candidates for the new homes to
complete job training that will allow them to increase the meager
income that kept them in the slums for years.
	   The residents themselves are organizing in neighborhood
associations to unite forces.
	   ``We organize to educate people to live in real houses and with
real services and not to waste them,'' said Patricia Rojas,
president of the association in Cerrillos, a sprawling suburb just
west of Santiago.
	   She said women are being given training so they can find jobs
when their husbands are unemployed _ a common occurrence.
	   ``By doing this, we make sure we will not lose the houses we
have struggled so hard to get,'' Mrs. Rojas said. ``We cannot
accept people losing them simply because they can't pay their water
or electricity bills.''
	   Some families have had electricity and water cut off at their
new homes for lack of payment.
	   It is a hard fight for families who must survive on small,
occasional wages to save the initial deposit of 290,000 pesos (dlrs
620) that opens the door to a new house under the government
program.
	   Mrs. Mansilla, for example, is now learning to be a dressmaker
so she can supplement the 90,000 pesos (dlrs 190) a month she
receives from her former husband as support for herself and three
children.
	   The Mansillas were one of 301 families that recently moved to
the small but neat apartments in Cerrillos, in an area that
includes paved streets and even a playground for children.
	   Chile Barrio aids families who haven't saved enough money to
qualify for a new apartment, providing them with tools and
construction materials to improve their huts until their time to
move comes.
	   Gabriela Rubilar, a social worker for the program, said money is
also being invested in community improvements, such as nurseries
where some women take turns caring for children so others can go to
work.
	   Even the unemployed are helping. Jorge Munoz, a wall painter who
has been out of work for some time, works planting grass and
flowers in public areas in his new neighborhood in Cerrillos.
	   During its first year, Chile Barrio has found that women are
more enthusiastic and constant than men, especially when it comes
to learning new trades, social workers say. Many women are training
to become electricians and plumbers.
	   Social workers also say the program has improved relations in
the communities involved and provided many people with motivation
to attempt bettering their lives.
	   At the Calama slum south of Santiago, 68 families are close to
amassing the savings they need to qualify for apartments.
	   ``Since we joined Chile Barrio we get along better among us,''
said Maria Ines Garrido, standing at the cardboard and wood shack
where she lives. ``I think it is because we are all fighting for
the same thing.''

Japan stocks fall in morning trading, dollar steady in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply Friday morning
following an overnight drop on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar was
little changed against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 244.48 points,
or 1.65 percent, to end the morning session at 14,563.32. On
Thursday, the index declined 124.10 points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.06 yen, unchanged from late Thursday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 117.33 yen overnight.
	   Traders said share prices fell in reaction to Wall Street's
plunge as well as selling triggered by the settlement of monthly
stock future contracts, known as the special quotation.
	   In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
167.61 points to 8,841.58.
	   Disappointment with the Japanese government's latest tax cut
proposal also pushed down share prices, traders said.
	   Investors were unimpressed with the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's proposal on Thursday for income tax relief which includes
``little actual cut'' in the tax burden on most middle class
families, said Masaaki Higashida of Nomura Securities Co.
	   The government and the LDP decided to cut income tax payments by
20 percent across the board in 1999, Japanese business daily Nihon
Keizai reported Friday.
	   But the paper said few taxpayers will be eligible for the full
amount, saying many in the middle class will effectively pay more
in taxes next year than in the current fiscal year.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 10.07 points, or 0.88 percent, to 1,129.71.
The TOPIX lost 0.96 points, or 0.08 percent, the previous day.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar was higher in
early trading as Japanese interbank players bought the U.S.
currency to cover short, or oversold, positions, traders said.
	   But the weakness in U.S. stocks and lingering concerns over
financial problems in Latin America have discouraged investors from
aggressively building up dollar positions, they said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.165 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.180 percent,
driving its price up to 105.42 yen from 105.29 yen.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers are relying on an extremely unusual court
challenge and an indictment citing crimes against humanity to
battle over Gen. Augusto Pinochet's fate, in what could be the
start of years of legal wrangling on the former Chilean dictator's
extradition to Spain.
	   Almost two months after his arrest, the 83-year-old general was
scheduled Friday to take his first public step into the legal fray
when he appears for a routine bail hearing that promises to attract
anything-but-routine international interest. It will be his first
public appearance since his Oct. 16 arrest in a London hospital.
	   Court officials scheduled the hearing at Belmarsh, a
high-security magistrate's court once used to indict Irish
Republican Army gunmen, instead of in central London because of the
expected crush of interest. Belmarsh is 10 miles (15 kms) from the
city center.
	   Also Friday, the House of Lords planned to announce how it will
proceed on an extremely unusual appeal by Pinochet's lawyers to
overturn its decision that Pinochet does not have immunity from
arrest as a former foreign head of state. British newspapers
reported Friday that a hearing on the appeal was expected to be
held Tuesday.
	   The grounds of the appeal were not disclosed, but the lawyers
had earlier complained about links between one of the five senior
law lords and the human rights group, Amnesty International, which
lobbied extensively on behalf of victims of the general's regime.
Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, who cast one of the votes against
Pinochet, is an unpaid director of an Amnesty International
charity, although the organization said he played no role in its
lobbying efforts.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw discounted any possible bias in
Britain's highest court when he decided Wednesday to let Spain's
extradition request proceed.
	   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon completed a 300-page criminal
indictment on Thursday, charging Pinochet with genocide, terrorism
and torture committed by his security forces during his 17-year
regime. Straw had ruled that Pinochet could not be indicted on a
charge of genocide, but let the other charges stand.
	   The indictment lists thousands of alleged victims including
Spaniards, Argentines, Paraguayans, Bolivians and Mexicans. Garzon
also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world assets and
for his continued detention in Britain.
	   As the general's lawyers work to free him, it was not clear how
much success their appeal might have because of its rarity in
modern legal history.
	   The Times reported Friday that the only previous challenge to a
House of Lords ruling was attempted in 1823 over a land ownership
case. The challenge failed, the newspaper said.
	   ``We are in completely uncharted waters,'' James Vallance White,
a senior clerk in the House of Lord's judicial office was quoted as
telling The Times.
	   Pinochet's lawyers also announced Thursday that they are
considering appealing Straw's decision, which was denounced in
Chile as a violation of its national sovereignty and a threat to
the fragile democracy set up in 1990 when Pinochet relinquished
power.
	   Pinochet remains under police guard at a rented mansion in an
exclusive London suburb.

Events on the 50th anniversary of the U.N. human rights charter

 &UR; With UN-Human Rights &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Events around the world Thursday as the United Nations
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights:
	   _CHINA: President Jiang Zemin promised to protect the rights and
freedoms of China's citizens. Police ransacked the homes of at
least six dissidents in a widening clampdown on political dissent.
	   _INDONESIA: Thousands of angry students demanding greater
democracy and human rights hurled stones and bottles at Jakarta's
police headquarters in a show of discontent with the pace of
political reform.
	   _BULGARIA: Parliament abolished capital punishment and replaced
it with life imprisonment without parole in a measure to move its
legal system closer to European standards.
	   _PHILIPPINES: President Joseph Estrada ordered a special
committee to review all the cases of people jailed for politically
related crimes and recommend those who should be released.
	   _PAKISTAN: Dozens of Afghan women protested outside U.N.
offices, accusing successive leaders of the country of ``savagely
assaulting the rights'' of women and attacking the rules imposed by
the Taliban religious army that prevent women from working or
attending school.
	   _INDIA: Groups representing Indians once known as
``untouchable'' began a campaign to end discrimination based on
caste, which is illegal but entrenched by tradition.
	   _SOUTH AFRICA: The government announced that it would ratify
several U.N. human rights conventions on civil and political
rights, the elimination of all forms of racial or degrading
treatment or punishment and the prevention and punishment of
genocide.
	   _FRANCE: In a seven-hour megaconcert, rock singers Peter
Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, and others feted the anniversary of the
human rights charter before 15,000 cheering fans. The concert was
organized in honor of the declaration, signed in Paris 50 years
ago.

<TEXT>
	   MOOSE JAW, Saskatchewan (AP) _ A jet from Canada's elite
military aerobatics team crashed after touching another plane
during a training exercise. One pilot died.
	   It was the third fatal crash in the past 10 years involving the
Snowbirds, who perform aerobatic routines at air shows across North
America.
	   Air force officials said Thursday that the accident occurred
during a maneuver by a six-plane formation from the military air
base at Moose Jaw.
	   They said there was contact between two jets; one crashed and
the other landed safely. The crashed jet was a Canadair CL-141
Tutor jet, a two-seater training plane built in the 1960s.
	   Capt. Michael VandenBos, 29, managed to eject before his Tutor
jet slammed into a snow-dusted knoll near Mitchellton in
south-central Saskatchewan. But he died in hospital a short time
later.
	   The military immediately opened an inquiry into the accident.
	   The Snowbirds _ a unit of 11 pilots _ formed in 1971 and since
then has performed before an estimated 85 million spectators.

Government, hoping for debt relief, draws up 1999 austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CORRECT revenue and spending figures &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has drawn up an austerity
budget for 1999 but the bid to repair Russia's decrepit economy
requires massive debt restructuring that foreign creditors have so
far been unwilling to grant.
	   ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 2000 and
the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple as
that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said.
	   The draft budget that was approved by the government Thursday
calls for dlrs 7.2 billion in new foreign loans, and provides for
repaying only dlrs 9.5 billion in foreign debt next year, Zadornov
said.
	   That means Russia, in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, will seek restructuring
of dlrs 8 billion of the dlrs 17.5 billion it is due to pay in
1999.
	   ``We are counting on understanding by creditors and investors in
restructuring both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said.
	   The 1999 budget is a key test for Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who was appointed in September after the previous
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending
the economy into a freefall.
	   The budget was also drawn up in the near-total absence of
President Boris Yeltsin, who holed up in a country residence this
week after more than two weeks in a hospital for treatment of
pneumonia.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was in Paris on
Thursday for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris Club of
creditor nations.
	   But so far the group has given no sign that it would grant
Russia's request.
	   The government will submit the draft budget on Friday to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Zadornov said. Primakov,
who enjoys broad support in the Duma, is counting on quick
approval.
	   ``The budget's advantage is that it is very austere,'' Primakov
told his cabinet as leaders hashed out the draft. ``The essential
thing is that it is honest. We didn't include spending that can't
be covered by revenues.''
	   Zadornov said expected revenues would cover all of Russia's
domestic expenses _ but not the foreign debt.
	   Government officials have already warned that Russia needs to
restructure payments on debts it inherited from the Soviet Union.
The servicing of those debts makes up about half of what Russia
owes next year.
	   But creditors have been unwilling to rework the debts Russia
already has, and the prospects for more foreign loans are equally
hazy.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since August's debt
default and ruble devaluation.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans, and specifically warned against
factoring in foreign credits that had yet to materialize.
	   Russia's government has warned that if it does not get foreign
aid, it would simply print money _ which would send inflation
soaring.
	   The government already intends to print about 33 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) worth of rubles next year, according to the
draft budget, to cover part the 101 billion ruble (dlrs 5 billion)
deficit.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues worth 475 billion rubles
(dlrs 24 billion), by Thursday's exchange rate for the ruble, and
spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion), officials said.
	   Many economists predict the deficit will be even larger because
the government's estimates of an average ruble rate of 21.5 to the
dollar and 30 percent next year may be unrealistic.
	   The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the U.S. dollar in
recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent this year.

Reports: Thai villagers end protest against power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai villagers have ended their protest
against the construction of three power plants after government
officials promised they would not be built, local papers reported
Friday.
	   The dispute over the coal-fired plants that villagers say would
pollute the environment sparked rioting between thousands of police
and demonstrators over two days in which at least 65 people were
injured.
	   Thailand's Interior Minister denied reports that three
protesters had been killed, according to Friday's The Nation
newspaper.
	   The villagers from Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (145
miles) southwest of Bangkok, said the plants, at least one of which
would use lignite, or brown coal, would destroy their environment
and health.
	   They cited a similar plant in the northern Thai city of Mae Moh,
where villagers charge that abnormally high rates of cancer, lung
disease, birth defects and the poisoning of land and water are
attributable to residue from the lignite plant.
	   The Nation said that Deputy Interior Minister Pinit Charusombat
late Thursday signed an agreement with the protesters promising he
would not approve licenses for the three plants.
	   Thailand is privatizing its power industry, and the three plants
are joint ventures with foreign companies. It's not clear how those
companies will react, and if fallout from the cancellation of their
projects will harm further efforts at privatizing the industry.
	   The agreement convinced the protesters to end their blockade of
the Phet Kasem highway, the main road linking Bangkok with the
south.
	   Earlier Thursday, the protest again turned violent when
villagers assaulted Wassapol Jaisin, the Prachuab Khiri Khan police
chief, causing him serious head injuries.
	   At least 50 protesters and 15 policemen were injured in rioting
Wednesday night when officers staged a baton charge and drove
trucks into the protesters to try and dislodge them from the Phet
Kasem highway.
	   Wednesday's battle was just one of several that have broken out
in recent years between police and members of communities opposed
to dams, power plants or other development projects in their areas.
	   More than 15,000 farmers and villagers descended on Bangkok last
year to protest that many development projects were destroying
their land and way of life while only enriching the country's elite
and wealthy businessmen.

Pavarotti and Marsalis team up in tribute to human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ There's probably never been a rendition of
``O Sole Mio'' like it _ Luciano Pavarotti singing passionately and
jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis belting out the refrain on a night
dedicated to human rights.
	   As ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights drew to a close Thursday night, the
United Nations briefly turned from words to music.
	   At the start of the concert in the soaring U.N. General Assembly
Hall, Secretary-General Kofi Annan told 1,500 invited guests that
artists and musicians had enriched the soul of mankind.
	   The first human rights concert in 1948 was conducted by Leonard
Bernstein and featured actor Laurence Olivier and violinist Yehudi
Menuhin.
	   Annan expressed hope that Pavarotti and Marsalis would be an
inspiration to the world ``to do more for those whose human rights
have yet to be fulfilled.''
	   Pavarotti, a U.N. Messenger of Peace, opened and closed the
official program with a series of operatic classics. Calling it ``a
super special night,'' he said, ``I was a kid when this beautiful
story of human rights began.''
	   Marsalis enthralled the audience with his solo section,
including one number dedicated to the late American first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt, a moving force behind the Universal Declaration
whom he called ``one of the first great champions for democracy and
equal rights for all people all over the world.''
	   ``Jazz music is the music of freedom,'' Marsalis told the
audience. ``You're always looking up at the stars.''
	   As an encore, the Italian tenor jokingly asked whether the
American trumpeter could accompany him.
	   Marsalis came on stage for the unique finale, a jazz-operatic
duet of ``O Sole Mio,'' which ended with Pavarotti exultantly
shouting ``Woo! Woo! Woo!'' and the two men embracing. The
assembled dignitaries and diplomats gave them a standing ovation.
	   After the performance, the secretary-general went to their
dressing room and they posed for pictures. Pavarotti and Marsalis
starting humming a tune, and turned to Annan who hesitantly tried
to join in, asking: ``Am I messing it up?''
	   The secretary-general then picked up Marsalis' trumpet and the
trumpeter started showing him the fingering. Annan decided to give
it a try and held the trumpet to his lips and started to blow _ but
all that came out were strange, indescribable noises.

Greenpeace takes legal action over Olympic ``ozone threat''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Olympic group defending need to use
ozone-threatening system. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The environmental group Greenpeace on
Friday launched a Federal Court challenge to a decision by the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games to use ozone-depleting gas in an arena's
refrigerant system.
	   The environment group contended that the planned use of the gas
in the Superdome arena air-conditioning system was a breach of
environmental guidelines included in Sydney's bid for the 2000
Games.
	   But a spokesman for the Olympic Coordination Authority said that
there was no alternative.
	   He said no hydrocarbon-based refrigeration plant is big enough
for the Superdome arena, and engineers said ammonia-based
refrigerants were not safe for such a large venue.
	   Greenpeace said it was seeking injunctions to stop the Olympic
Coordination Authority from ``continuing to make misleading
representations.''
	   The lobby's spokesman, Ian Higgins, said the environmental
guidelines for the Summer Olympic Games made a commitment to an
Olympic site which did not threaten the ozone layer.
	   ``The OCA receives enormous mileage out of its worldwide
promotion of a green games, yet behind our backs is allowing the
installation of an air-conditioning system that uses ozone
destroying chemicals.'' he said.

Toyota chief expects Thai car sales to rebound in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Declining interest rates and rising job
security among Thai workers will fuel a rebound in domestic car
sales in 1999, a local paper quoted the head of the Thai unit of
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. as saying.
	   Yoshiaki Muramatsu said in an interview with the Bangkok Post
that he expects Toyota's sales in Thailand to increase by 33
percent to 180,000 vehicles in 1999 from 135,000 this year.
	   Japanese companies dominate local car sales, and Toyota leads
the pack with 30 percent market share. Thailand is the largest
automobile producer in Southeast Asia.
	   The domestic car market has been hard hit, however, by
Thailand's economic crisis. A recent U.N. report said there will be
3 million unemployed in Thailand by next year.
	   Muramatsu said exports will continue to play a larger role in
the industry, according to the Post.

Clinton to pay official visit in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will
make a state visit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum summit next September, Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley announced Friday.
	   The state visit will be the first by a U.S. president since
President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
	   ``New Zealanders can be confident that APEC 99 will be well
attended by world leaders, with confirmation from United States
President Bill Clinton this week that he will be here,'' Shipley
said.
	   Clinton missed the recent APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
sending Vice President Al Gore in his stead.
	   Clinton confirmed he would make the state visit to Wellington
following the APEC summit in Auckland.
	   ``It will strengthen relations between New Zealand and the
United States, will lift our international profile and is good news
for the success of our year as chair of APEC.''
	   Shipley also announced that she would visit Canada and the
United States from Jan. 13-15.
	   Shipley said while in Washington she would call on senior
members of the Clinton administration and Congressional leaders.

 &UR; Skalbania starts jail term for theft &LR; 
	   VANCOUVER (CP) _ It took seven years, but flamboyant Vancouver
businessman Nelson Skalbania began serving a one-year jail term
Thursday for $100,000 he stole from a former client.
	   The B.C. Court of Appeal turned down Skalbania's appeal of the
sentence Thursday.
	   The man who once owned hockey great Wayne Gretzky, the Edmonton
Oilers, the Calgary Flames, the Montreal Alouettes and was a
part-owner of the B.C. Lions was already in custody and was not
present for the reading of the decision.
	   Crown counsel Teresa Mitchell-Banks said it is up to the
corrections branch to decide whether Skalbania will be held in jail
or monitored electronically with his movements restricted.
	   The case has been before the courts since 1991.
	   Skalbania was originally acquitted of theft in B.C. Supreme
Court by Justice H.A.D Oliver, who ruled Skalbania never had a
criminal intent to steal the money.
	   The Crown appealed the acquittal, which was overturned by a
three-judge panel of the B.C. Court of Appeal, which sent it back
to B.C. Supreme Court for sentencing.
	   During sentencing last year, Justice Jon Sigurdson rejected the
argument of defence lawyer Peter Leask, who argued for a
conditional discharge.
	   Leask said the $100,000 theft was actually a technical breach _
``marginal criminality'' _ because Skalbania never intended to keep
the money but Sigurdson ruled Skalbania knew what he was doing was
wrong.
	   He sentenced Skalbania to a year in jail, a sentence upheld
Thursday by the Appeal Court which ruled the sentence was not
``clearly or manifestly excessive.''
	   Skalbania's incarceration was criticized Thursday by well-known
stock promoter Peter Brown.
	   ``Anybody who knows the facts of this case knows that it's a
vicious prosecution and a ridiculous sentence,'' he said. ``It's
really justice run amok.''
	   Brown and developer Jack Poole were character witnesses for
Skalbania during his trial.
	   Skalbania committed a breach of trust by taking $100,000 in 1991
from Gordon Gooch and placing it in the general revenue account of
his company, Prime Realty. The money had been given to him as a
down payment in an $11-million real estate deal with Harvey
Richman.
	   At the time, the Prime Realty account was overdrawn and
Skalbania used part of the money to cover an outstanding cheque for
$50,000 owing to friend and business associate Sam Belzberg of
Vancouver.
	   An additional $35,000 went in Skalbania's private company, N.M.
Skalbania Ltd., $6,000 was used personally by Skalbania, $2,950
went to his daughter, $2,180 to a brokerage firm and $3,277 for
sundry bills, including dry cleaning.
	   Skalbania gave Gooch the run-around for three months but
eventually returned the money with $4,000 interest.
	   Skalbania, who was raised on Vancouver's working class east
side, made millions flipping real estate properties in the 1970s.
	   In 1982, Skalbania's highly leveraged business world collapsed.
He claimed he was $40 million in debt.
	   To avoid bankruptcy, he struck a deal with his creditors,
agreeing to a five-year restructuring plan that allowed him to pay
them half of every dollar he made each year _ after the first
$90,000.
	   After five years, however, Skalbania had failed to provide any
money or even a proper accounting to his creditors. It wasn't until
1990, after he had paid only $800,000 on total debts of $8 million,
that he was discharged. (Vancouver Sun)

Police officer testifies in support of prosecution case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior police officer told the
court trying sacked deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday
that regular police were kept from the interrogation of two people
who had accused Anwar of sexual misdeeds.
	   Musa Hassan, the 13th prosecution witness in the corruption and
sexual misconduct trial wrapping up its fifth week, told the court
that intelligence officers of the Special Branch were deputed to
interrogate the two accusers and not the detectives from his
criminal investigation department.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar put immense
pressure on the police to silence the two people _ the former
driver of his wife and the sister of his former secretary _ and
obtain retractions from them.
	   While Azizan Abu Bakar, the driver, has testified that Anwar
repeatedly sodomized him in 1992, Ummi Hafilda Ali has accused
Anwar of sleeping with her brother's wife.
	   The two were arrested briefly in August 1997 and have claimed
they were forced by police to sign statements retracting their
allegations against Anwar.
	   The decision by authorities to allow only the Special Branch to
handle the case angered the head of the criminal investigation
unit, Musa testified.
	   Musa took the stand Thursday at the end of stormy testimony by
Azizan, who claimed he was coerced into homosexual acts not only by
Anwar, but also by his adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence after pleading guilty
to allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar. The other person in
jail for pleading guilty to having sex with Anwar is Munawar Ahmad
Anees, Anwar's speech writer.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions.
	   Although defense lawyers have complained about Azizan's
credibility as a witness, citing glaring inconsistencies in his
stories, the judge on Thursday disallowed a move to throw out his
entire testimony and disqualify him.
	   Azizan's sodomy accusations form the core of the 10 charges
against Anwar, who was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Sept. 2 on grounds of immorality.
	   Anwar's sacking and his subsequent arrest and beating while in
police custody have led to demands for political reforms and
anti-government protests.
	   He is being tried first on four counts of corruption. He will
face trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and
five for alleged illegal sex acts.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Dave Andreychuk scored 78 seconds into
overtime, capping a mad scramble in front of Philadelphia
goaltender Ron Hextall as the New Jersey Devils beat the Flyers 5-4
Thursday night in North American National Hockey League action.
	   After Lyle Odelein's shot hit the crossbar, the puck ended up
back in front of Hextall as the Flyers tried to clear it. With
Hextall sprawled on the ice, Andreychuk flicked it into the top of
the net for his 10th goal.
	   The Atlantic-leading Devils came back from a 4-1 deficit to
extend their season-best unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2). New
Jersey took a six-point lead over the second-place Flyers.
	   Eric Lindros, leading the NHL with 38 points, had his second
straight two-goal game and John LeClair scored his 19th goal and
assisted on both of Lindros' goals.
 &UR; Bruins 3, Hurricanes 2 &QC; 
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Tim Taylor scored his first goal
of the season with 2:48 left as Boston extended its unbeaten streak
to eight straight.
	   When Martin Gelinas tied the score 15 seconds after Boston had
taken its first lead midway through the third period, it appeared
the game was headed to overtime.
	   But Taylor beat Carolina goaltender Trevor Kidd with a
wraparound shot to end Carolina's unbeaten streak at six. Boston is
6-0-2 in its last eight games.
 &UR; Predators 2, Sharks 1 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Vitali Yachmenev scored with 8:15 left
and Tomas Vokoun won his first NHL game as Nashville beat San Jose.
	   Yachmenev got his second goal of the season on a screened shot
from the left circle to beat Sharks goaltender Steve Shields and
break a 1-1 tie.
	   Vokoun, Nashville's third-string goalie, made 34 saves to give
the Predators their first win in five games. The Sharks are winless
in their last six games.

Analysts say returns on auction of Thai business loans may be low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS FOX &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will likely be disappointed at
returns generated by next week's auction of business loans held by
56 shutdown finance companies, foreign fund managers and local
analysts said Friday.
	   The auction of 370 billion baht (dlrs 10.2 billion) worth of
loans on Tuesday is considered a major step towards restructuring
Thailand's shaky financial sector, which is riddled with bad debt
totaling as much as 40 percent of all loans.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times after a failed defense of the country's currency, the baht,
last year in which the central bank squandered nearly all its
foreign reserves.
	   Fund managers and analysts told Dow Jones Newswires, however,
that while they believe there will be plenty of bidders next week,
their offers won't match government expectations. Still, some brave
investors could end up with high-risk, high-return loans for prices
as low as 20 cents on the dollar.
	   ``It looks like they will have a lot of participation. Foreign
houses are interested in repackaging the assets for resale,'' said
Vana Bulbon of Prudential Portfolio Managers Asia.
	   But others said failure to push through reforms of antiquated
bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, now expected to gain parliamentary
approval in March, could drive down both prices and the number of
bidders.
	   The auction ``has focused people's minds on what is really a
huge problem in Asia,'' said Damien Wood, credit research director
at Barclays Capital Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``There is no
discipline for borrowers, no legal system to support you.''
	   Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has said an average
return of 20 percent would be unacceptable. But Montri
Chenvidyakarn, Assistant Secretary General of the state Financial
Sector Restructuring Authority, or FRA, said the rehabilitation of
the assets is more important than price.
	   ``If we get lower than expected but acceptable prices, and the
investor decides to invest in the economy on a long-term basis,
that will offset any losses,'' Montri said.
	   The FRA is responsible for the liquidation of the finance
companies, closed last year by the government. That move was
strongly recommended by the International Monetary Fund, which
organized a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package for the
country.
	   A secondary market for the resale of the problem loans will be a
step forward from the current state of affairs. Assets worth more
than 700 billion baht (dlrs 19.4 billion) have been frozen for a
year and a half since the central bank first suspended the
companies' operations.
	   The FRA began small-scale auctions of movable property and
securities in the second quarter of 1998.
	   The Thai government and the IMF have forecast a return to
positive gross domestic product growth in the second half of 1999,
after a 7 percent contraction this year.
