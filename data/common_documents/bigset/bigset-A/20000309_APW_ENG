<HEADLINE> LA County Nation's Biggest  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People still love L.A., but there's something
about Forsyth County, Ga. that has made it one of the
fastest-growing counties in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the warm climate? Or the Southern hospitality, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ''Location, convenience, and beauty of location. They just put
in a nature trail here,'' said Judy Havenhill, who moved from Texas
to a development outside of the Forsyth County seat of Cumming
three years ago. ''We really like it -- it's all the trees. We don't
have too many trees in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Census Bureau estimates being released Thursday,
Forsyth, a county nestled in the Appalachian foothills about 30
miles north of Atlanta, grew by 11.9 percent in population, from
86,409 on July 1, 1998, to 96,689 on July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from the 9.3 million people in Los Angeles County,
Calif., once again the country's largest. But it is the lack of an
urban feel that has folks moving to Forsyth, and the other counties
surrounding Atlanta, Forsyth County Administrator Stevie P. Mills
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth was the fastest-growing county last year. Technically,
it didn't top the list this year, coming in second behind Sussex
County, Va., which had a 22.8 percent population jump to 12,345.
But the increase in Sussex was due to the opening of two state
prisons since May 1998, with a combined inmate population of over
2,400.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said Sussex County? It's usually some place outside of
Denver or Atlanta,'' Census Bureau analyst Sam Davis. ''When you
see something like that, you say something's wrong. And those new
prisons are the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sussex and Forsyth, the next three fastest growing
counties were Douglas County, Colo., up 10.9 percent to 156,860;
Loudon County, Va., up 8.1 percent to 156,284, and Henry County,
Ga., also up 8.1 percent, to 113,443.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 13 of the top 20 fastest-growing counties were in the
South, and six were in the West, following earlier Census Bureau
forecasts of those regions being areas of high growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fast-growing counties in the decade are considered to be
suburban counties, or are adjacent to urban areas,'' Census Bureau
analyst Marc Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interesting thing with Atlanta is that in many of the
suburban counties that are gaining residents, they are not moving
there from Atlanta itself, but from elsewhere in the country. It's
suburbanization, but not from within Atlanta itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The county with biggest percentage population decline was
Kalawao County, located in a remote area on the Hawaiian island of
Molokai. Kalawao, which was the site of a 19th century leper
colony. The county lost nine of its 67 residents, or 13.4 percent,
between July 1998 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major counties -- classified by the Census Bureau as those
with populations over 10,000 -- Grand Forks County, N.D. lost the
most, declining 3.2 percent to 64,674. It was followed by Curry
County, N.M., down 2.9 percent to 43,570; Beadle County, S.D., also
down 2.9 percent to 16,637; Pulaski County, Mo., down 2.8 percent
to 38,230; and Lawrence County, S.D., down 2.1 percent to 21,369.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Grand Forks came mostly as a consequence of the
massive flood of 1997 that gutted 11 buildings in the city of Grand
Forks, said Richard Rathge, a professor at North Dakota State
University and director of the state's census data center.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates being released by the Census Bureau include:
</P>
<P>
   --Los Angeles County led all counties in net international
migration, with 91,745 immigrants pouring into the southern
California county between 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --Maricopa County, Ariz., which encompasses the cities of Phoenix
and Tempe, led all counties in net domestic migration, with 43,163
moving into Maricopa from other U.S. addresses.
</P>
<P>
   --The median age of the U.S. residents went up from 32.8 in April
1990, the date of the last official census count, to 35.5 in 1999.
Utah residents were the youngest, with a median age of 26.7 in
1999, and West Virginia residents were oldest, with a median age of
38.9.

<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his
presidential campaign Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a
stranglehold on the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday
voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of
old foe Al Gore as he scripted his Thursday exit from the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear
whether the Arizona senator would end his campaign entirely, or
simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his options. At least one
senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider launching
a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide said he would halt the campaign. Another said
McCain would quit outright. Both spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nominees-in-waiting, reached
out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one another as they
pivoted toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled the vice president ''an agent of Washington,'' and
Gore returned the insult, saying Bush was too cozy with the
''extreme right'' as personified by the National Rifle Association
and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   McCain huddled with senior strategists and major financial
backers at his mountain cabin here to assess the situation.
Campaign events in Colorado and Illinois were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scheduled a news conference for noon EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of McCain's senior aides have been urging him to withdraw,
saying Bush has built an almost impossible lead in the delegate
count. Weaver suggested that McCain could be ''pushed'' into
running as a third-party candidate -- a remark Bush supporters
viewed as an attempt to gain leverage as McCain seeks to extract
promises from Bush in exchange for an endorsement. McCain has said
his campaign finance crusade would continue even if his candidacy
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said there was no campaign schedule after Thursday's
announcement, except for an off-the-record barbecue with
journalists at McCain's rustic cabin near Sedona. Reporters were
told they would be dispatched to Phoenix at the end of the day --
without McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For both Bradley and McCain, the day was spent reflecting Super
Tuesday defeats that effectively ended their hopes of winning the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were urging McCain to quit. Key to the decision, they said, was
finding a way to effectively push McCain's campaign themes of
broadening the party's base and overhauling reforming campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   A list of options had been prepared for McCain's meetings
Wednesday. These included staying in the race to further his
political reform agenda, getting out and supporting the GOP ticket,
and leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said previously
he would not leave the GOP, and by day's end one adviser said a
third-party bid had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said there had been discussions about how to
ease McCain's return to the Senate after a campaign in which he
often attacked his own party as beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former New Jersey senator would announce his withdrawal on
Thursday and throw his support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
They also said he has no interest in the vice presidential spot on
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore was thinking along those lines. One senior adviser
to the vice president, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Bradley had not won any contests in his quest for the
nomination and Gore would want someone on the ticket who had
demonstrated an ability to carry a state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bradley as a running mate, Gore said in Nashville,
Tenn.: ''I'm not drawing up a list -- short, long or in between. It
is just too early.'' But he credited Bradley, whom he had attacked
repeatedly in debates and advertising when the nomination was at
risk, for prompting ''a very constructive and healthy debate,''
especially on health reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed to McCain's desire, often stated on the
campaign, to deny Gore the White House. ''I would say, 'John, let's
team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore,'' the governor said. He
hastened to add he wasn't extending an offer of the vice
presidential spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign was at a pivotal point, but there were
still primaries to come, and both Bush and Gore continued to seek
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had Michigan on his itinerary for the day, which chooses
Democratic delegates Saturday. At the same time, given the collapse
of Bradley's candidacy, the vice president's aides decided to pull
back $500,000 in TV advertising that had been slated for Southern
states with March 14 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set stops Thursday in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where
delegates will be picked in primaries and caucuses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the virtual nationwide primary on Tuesday, the AP delegate
count showed Gore with 1,424 delegates, to 412 for Bradley, out of
2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, it was 617 for Bush to 231 for McCain, with
1,034 needed to nominate. Those numbers told the hopelessness of
McCain's position. An additional 91 delegates are stake in Western
states on Saturday, and 351 more on March 14 in states across the
South, the part of the country where Bush is strongest.

<HEADLINE> Prepackaged Meat Squeezing Butchers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 24 years as a butcher, Maurice Miller suddenly is faced
with the possibility of losing his livelihood despite an apparent
shortage of people with meat-cutting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I'd see the end of meat-cutting in stores,''
said Miller, who works at Wal-Mart in Jacksonville, Texas. ''It
looks like I'm going to have to start thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart last week announced plans to eliminate butchers at 180
of its stores and begin selling prepackaged meat. The world's
largest retailer said meat wrapped at the packing plant looks
better than meat wrapped by store butchers and consumers prefer it.
</P>
<P>
   Meat-industry officials say the move is part of a larger trend
that could drastically reduce the number of butchers behind the
counters of America's grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, widely admired in the retail industry for its
often-innovative cost-cutting and merchandising steps, insisted
consumer tastes, not a fight with a big union, was behind the
decision to eliminate butchers in its Supercenter stores in Texas,
Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas and Missouri. Eventually,
Wal-Mart plans to eliminate meat-cutting in all its U.S. stores,
said spokesman Les Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the the announcement raised eyebrows, even
among Wal-Mart allies. The company disclosed its move at a hearing
on a union election in one of its Texas stores. Just last month,
butchers at another Wal-Mart, in Jacksonville, Texas, voted 7-3 to
form the first union in a U.S. Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leaders in organized labor think the Texas vote was one of
their most significant wins in the last 10 years, even though it
was only 10 people,'' said Burt Flickinger III, a food-industry
consultant to stores such as Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The United Food and Commercial Workers Union is weighing its
options to challenge the move.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and its main meat supplier, IBP Inc., based in Dakota
Dunes, S.D., both say they have been working to switch all the
chain's beef to prepackaged since March 1999. At that time,
Wal-Mart began experimenting with prepackaged steaks and other beef
in some of its Arkansas stores. Sales jumped, store officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said ''case-ready
meat'' -- slaughtered, cut and vacuum-packed at the packing plant
instead of the store -- is part of a long evolution in the way meat
is prepared for American dining tables.
</P>
<P>
   Stores once received whole or half carcasses of beef and did all
the butchering. Beginning about 30 years ago, packing plants
reduced the carcasses to boxes full of meat parts, which were then
cut or ground and wrapped by store meat cutters. That step reduced
the amount of labor needed at the store while still allowing for
custom orders.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, an even bigger change was taking place in the
handling of poultry. The birds were slaughtered, cut into pieces
and packaged at the poultry plant and shipped to stores, which
simply put the finished product on display.
</P>
<P>
   Beef was not routinely handled the same way because prepackaged
beef tended to look deep purple or brown in color, not the red that
consumers expect, said Pat Pines, a vice president at the American
Meat Institute. Recent advances in packaging material now allow the
factory-packaged meat to arrive on grocers' shelves looking just
like freshly cut meat -- and at less overall cost to the stores, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prepackaged meat solves another pressing problem for grocery
stores -- a shortage of butchers, according to Flickinger, the
food-industry consultant in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wal-Mart and other stores have been studying for years buying
pre-cut, packaged meat because it's tough to find enough meat
cutters, especially in the evenings and weekends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Denier, a spokesman for the 1.4 million-member United Food
and Commercial Workers, which is trying to organize the Wal-Mart
meat cutters, said talk of the demise of butchers is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see more case-ready (meat) in the future,'' Denier
said. ''But you'll still see meat departments and meat cutters
because consumers like to get special cuts of meat, consumers like
to ask for a fresh grind.''

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP unveils privacy protection recommendations  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The stockpile of public information is as
potentially frightening as it is extensive: professors display test
results by social security numbers, the long and revealing trail of
E-Z pass tags, and prisoners -- at least in other states -- uncover
personal information of innocent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Following 13 months of research and testimony, Senate
Republicans on Wednesday introduced a 78-page report of
recommendations to ''prevent the state from becoming a culprit'' in
the national problem of privacy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You name it and there's a problem,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. ''Educational
records, medical records, insurance, banking, Department of Motor
Vehicles, with your licenses; E-Z Pass, supermarket scanners, you
name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was joined by Senate Republicans who have already or say
they are about to submit proposals to crack down on identity theft
and the ''wild west mentality'' of credit card companies, marketing
firms, and even the government.
</P>
<P>
   The report was produced by a task force chaired by Bruno, with
Sen. Michael Nozzolio, a Finger Lakes Republican.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Nozzolio evoked the case of Cynthia Watkins, a
retired elementary school teacher from his district, who learned
her identity had been stolen when an armed bounty hunter burst into
her home and demanded to know where she and her husband were hiding
the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should insure that victims of the fastest growing crime in
America, identity theft, have protections,'' Nozzolio said.
</P>
<P>
   Task force research found that inmates in some states working on
government contracts involving telephone contact have used social
security numbers to access credit card numbers and other
information to commit fraud and harass customers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bruno spokesman Chris McKenna knew of no instances of
this in New York -- and Department of Corrections spokesman Jim
Flateau said inmates could currently access little more than
information than is available in phone books -- the task force wants
a prohibition on the books in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though the lawmakers agreed that some problem areas -- in
particular the Internet -- are a federal responsibility, they said
the state should make sure its own agencies had safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Motor Vehicles alone makes nearly $50 million
a year by selling information from driver's records. Some $2
million of this results from a contract the state has with a direct
marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   A prohibition against the sale of that information -- one of the
actions recommended by the task force -- would mean a loss of that
income, which Bruno said was a worthy tradeoff.
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled by PC World Magazine:
</P>
<P>
   --The minimum cost of obtaining an e-mail address for marketing
purposes is 1 cent.
</P>
<P>
   --92 percent of commercial web sites collect personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   --Three of 10 credit card reports contain a serious factual
error.
</P>
<P>
   --$700 million is lost every year to credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty recommendations are to be introduced in a series of
proposals during this legislative session. Among them are measures
to restrict the sale and distribution of personal information and
create civil and criminal penalties for those who steal and abuse
data.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said the Democrat-controlled Assembly appears equally
eager to approve safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Assembly Democrats announced a set of public
hearings on consumer privacy. Last month, Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat, proposed a bill to help Internet users
maintain online privacy and fend off unwanted electronic mails.

<HEADLINE> Pataki wins kudos; other Republicans not so lucky  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki's stock is way up after
his orchestration of George W. Bush's New York primary win, but
there's disagreement over whether that gets him onto a list of
possible Republican vice presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing a governor can do for a presidential
candidate is to deliver his state,'' GOP consultant Jay Severin
said Wednesday. ''I think it boosts the governor's stock
tremendously. How many other governors are politically dead in the
wake of the McCain juggernaut?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Bush) campaign was staggering and he brought it across
the finish line,'' said Nelson Warfield, a New Yorker who served as
a top aide to Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had placed Pataki in charge of the New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 93 GOP delegates at stake in New York's Super Tuesday
primary, Bush captured at least 67. The Texas governor also had big
wins Tuesday in California, Ohio and other states. His chief rival
for the GOP nomination, Sen. John McCain, is considering whether to
stay in the race in the wake of his Tuesday losses.
</P>
<P>
   With Pataki's stock on the rise, both Severin and Warfield said
he could well make it onto Bush's list of possible running mates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any governor of New York is automatically a blue-chip stock,''
Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield said Bush may well look for a big-state partner for
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''If California is a no-go for Bush, then New York becomes an
opportunity. ... You don't want to write off both New York and
California,'' the former Dole aide said.
</P>
<P>
   But Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said it is the numbers game that will keep Pataki off
the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't deliver his state'' in November, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrats have a nearly 5-3 edge over Republicans
in voter enrollment, and recent polls have shown Al Gore, the
expected Democratic nominee, well ahead of Bush in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki earned kudos for his work, other New Yorkers didn't
come out of the primary so lucky and one of those said the Texas
governor should see a warning in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened in our district should send a strong signal to
the Bush campaign ... that the sharp turn to the right in South
Carolina is not something that will be viable nationally,'' said
state Sen. Roy Goodman, the Manhattan GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, one of several big-name New York Republicans who lost
bids Tuesday to become convention delegates for Bush, said his
Manhattan district and areas of Long Island that also went to
McCain contain the moderate voters Bush needs to win the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having taken a recent poll which showed me with a 90 percent
approval rating, that's documented proof that it was not a
repudiation of me personally, but of the philosophy for which our
candidate stood,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   After his New Hampshire primary loss, Bush moved hard right in
South Carolina to blunt McCain's momentum. Bush won that southern
primary, but left some moderate Republicans nervous about his
chances in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Goodman, the McCain sweep of delegates in the
14th Congressional District also cost state Assemblyman John Ravitz
of Manhattan a trip to the GOP convention in Philadelphia this
summer as a Bush delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Long Island, McCain captured 12 of the 15
delegates at stake, throwing a possible monkey wrench into the
summer travel plans of state Assemblywoman Patricia Acampora from
Suffolk County and influential state Sen. Dean Skelos of Nassau
County.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nassau County GOP Chairman Joseph Mondello, long considered
the most powerful local Republican leader in the state, barely
succeeded in his bid to get elected as a Bush delegate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain near sweep of Long Island left some top state
Republicans privately grumbling about Mondello. Not only did
Republican Alfonse D'Amato, a Nassau County alumnus, lose his
Senate seat in 1998, but Democrats last year took control of the
Nassau County's legislature for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people get one wake-up call, this is the third wake-up
call that the Republicans need to do something there, and it looks
like the infection may be spreading to Suffolk'' County, Warfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the Republican machine in New York generally delivered
for Bush, in some regions you could say, 'What machine?'' Severin
said.

<HEADLINE> Teen pleads guilty to murdering neighbor last Mother's Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy has admitted to
strangling his neighbor with a dog leash as she jogged along a bike
path last Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kindt, who was 15 at the time, faces nine years to life
in prison after pleading guilty to a charge of second-degree murder
Wednesday in Cattaraugus County Court. Sentencing was set for May
1.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt was indicted in June on second-degree murder, rape and
weapons charges in the death of Penny Brown, 39, a mother of two
who lived near Kindt.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found under a pile of leaves a day after she
disappeared while jogging with her two dogs last May.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Edward Sharkey said Brown's family approved of
the plea deal, which came less than a week before Kindt's trial was
to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant admitted he murdered Penny Brown ... It spares
the family of the victim from reliving the events through a trial,
which at times can be confrontational,'' he said. ''It allows the
healing process for the Brown family to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindt's attorneys, however, said the plea was part of their
strategy to have the case overturned by a higher court. They said
they would appeal based on Judge Larry Himelein's decision to allow
the district attorney to use blood evidence and a statement made to
police by Kindt during questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best thing strategically,'' Daniel Henry said of the
plea. ''What took place today is procedurally in the best interest
of our client.''
</P>
<P>
   The case gripped the attention of Salamanca's 6,500 residents,
who had not had a murder among them since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   When a judge ordered court records in the case sealed, the
ruling was challenged by The Associated Press, The Buffalo News and
Salamanca Press.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the challenge, Sharkey had said unsealing the
records could fuel racial tension between Indians and non-Indians
in Salamanca and taint the potential jury pool. Kindt is Native
American and the victim was white.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Kindt's attorneys asked Himelein to keep the
court records sealed while they prepare the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt has been described by acquaintances as troubled. Two days
before Brown's death, he was expelled from the 11-student Salamanca
Christian Academy for disciplinary reasons.

<HEADLINE> Fire, fire everywhere, and Cornhill residents worry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two youths are charged in eight fires that
slashed through a partly abandoned city neighborhood since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two suspects 14 and 15 years old were charged with
third-degree arson in the fires that have frightened residents of
the Utica neighborhood known as Cornhill, said Deputy Police Chief
Nicholas Yagey. More arrests are expected, Yagey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it was just for something to do,'' Yagey said. ''At
this time, that is what the investigation reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, whose names were not made public, will be
prosecuted as juveniles in Oneida County Family Court, Yagey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is getting too dangerous,'' resident Wendy Tarver said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to take back our neighborhoods,'' Lorraine Stucky
pleaded Tuesday night at a meeting of city officials, council
members and the Utica Neighborhood Housing Service. ''It's like a
cancer and it's spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   Stucky is a resident of the Cornhill section of the city. She
and her neighbors are trying to stay upbeat and focused on progress
in the wake of a rash of eight fires since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is getting too dangerous,'' resident Wendy Tarver said in
Wednesday's Observer-Dispatch of Utica.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 residents attended the meeting, which was conducted
in response to the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't sleep at night,'' said Samuel Bal, who once lost his
garage when a neighboring building burned. ''They should be tearing
down all of the abandoned houses.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials agreed. Chief Codes Officer Phillip Montana said
33 vacant structures will be demolished in the next three weeks.
Structures next to occupied homes will be given first priority. The
demolition will be paid for through a $1.3 million capital
improvement project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need your cooperation, we need your eyes and ears,'' Public
Safety Commissioner Cornell Maye said. ''Please leave with the idea
that you're going to keep your eyes opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace pledged his support.
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing is getting to be old-hat for the city. In 1997,
Utica made a demolition blitz, targeting 100 abandoned buildings
with the help of the Army National Guard in an effort to stem a
string of arsons.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, the federal government helped set up the Utica
Arson Strike Force, which combines federal, state and local
investigative resources to probe suspicious fires.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Shanley, Utica Community Action Inc. executive director,
said Tuesday his agency is working with the city to board up vacant
buildings in central city neighborhoods, including Cornhill.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ''will consist of a major effort to board up and
seal vacant buildings,'' Shanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Park resident Venice Ervin said he was concerned because
of the many vacant buildings around the corner from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a lot different than the last time there was a rash of
fires,'' Ervin said before Tuesday's meeting. ''They're going up so
fast it's not a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Rev. Johnny M. Wilson Jr. said Cornhill
residents need to concentrate on progress, not panic. Wilson,
pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church and a strong proponent of
economic redevelopment for Cornhill, said he hopes concern about
the fires serves to unite, not divide, the inner-city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult situation,'' Wilson said. ''It's so easy
to just point the finger at authorities or people in the
community.''

<HEADLINE> A statistical duel with some personal and political overtones  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- George Pataki is fighting back against
critics -- both political foes and a group that helped get him
elected governor -- who are giving him static over New York job
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   First, the governor worked hard this month touting statistics
showing New York had created nearly 200,000 private-sector jobs in
1999 and created them at a faster rate than the nation as a whole.
That is a sign that his tax-cutting, red tape-cutting strategies as
governor have been working, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This state is back,'' Pataki declared. ''Our private sector
again has confidence in the future of this state. Our young people
understand that they can get a job and build a career and have a
future here.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki surrogate, state Economist Stephen Kagann, has been
traveling around the state armed with the same statistics making
the same arguments to chambers of commerce and like groups.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on the campaign-like tone of those pronouncements,
Pataki started this week to appear in television advertisements
funded through his Empire Development Corp. extolling the virtues
of New York's business climate under his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Call us, we're good for business,'' Pataki says in one of the
ads. ''Call us, we'll make things happen,'' he says in another.
</P>
<P>
   These promotional activities have many intended purposes and
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are designed to counter the complaints of Democrats
that New York as a whole has never caught up with the rest of the
nation in recovering from the recession of the late 1980s. Those
Democratic critics range from U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton to two possible Pataki opponents for governor in 2002, H.
Carl McCall and Andrew Cuomo, to Pataki's chief foil in Albany,
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's statistics also showed that jobs grew in upstate New
York last year at a rate faster than the rest of the nation, laying
to rest -- or so the governor is hoping -- the charge that upstate
New York has missed out on economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Another primary target of Pataki's offensive is the group
Change-New York. Funded by wealthy conservatives, Change-New York
was a staunch supporter of Pataki when he won election in 1994 over
Mario Cuomo and its organizers have been among Pataki's chief
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   But the group has surprised and stung Pataki by funding
television ads criticizing his administration's job-creation record
and blaming him for what it argues is an out-migration of people
from upstate New York. If things are so good, the group asks, why
are people continuing to leave?
</P>
<P>
   In tone and content, the ads struck many observers as being as
anti-Pataki as anything Democratic opponents, unions or other
critics have run against the governor in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And, Pataki insisted, the commercials were also wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Change-New York ads are totally inaccurate, factually
wrong,'' he charged. ''They were factually wrong based on the data
that existed at the time the ads were put on and obviously now it
shows they had no basis in fact whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Change-New York, a savvy and obviously well-funded group based
in suburban Albany, has responded to those contentions with facts
and figures of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The group insists that upstate New York would be 49th in the
nation in job creation since Pataki took office if considered as a
separate state. The region's 6.7 percent private-sector gain was
dwarfed by job creation in such states as Nevada (34.4 percent),
Arizona (29.6 percent), Utah (24.7 percent) and Colorado (23.9
percent), Change-New York said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also backed up its out-migration claims with U.S.
Census Bureau statistics showing that 1,034,899 net people left New
York between 1995-99.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics, of course, are notoriously difficult to use to prove
a point conclusively. Or, rather, they are notoriously easy to use
to counter the point a critic is trying to make with his own set of
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, New York is either a laggard in the national economy, nine
years and many billions of dollars short of sharing in the general
prosperity, or it has re-emerged thanks to the Pataki
administration's policies. Upstate New York is either doing better
than the nation as a whole or it remains in an extended,
resident-draining, last-one-out-turn-out-the-lights funk.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may be the final arbiters of what the numbers really mean
through one of the few statistics that leave hardly any room for
interpretation, the election results in 2002 when they again pick a
governor.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Fires Flight Attendants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines has fired a dozen flight
attendants after an alleged sickout over stalled contract
negotiations, the airline confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Five more resigned after being asked about their work absences
during the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest spokesman Jon Austin confirmed the dismissals and
resignations after a flight attendant was fired in a meeting with
the company at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Austin declined to comment on any of the firings.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's lawyers have characterized a higher-than-normal
illness rate among flight attendants around the holidays as
''guerrilla warfare'' by the attendants, leading it to cancel
several hundred flights.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Davenport, president of Teamsters Local 2000, the union
representing Northwest's flight attendants, said grievances will be
filed to protest the firings. None of the sick calls were false,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said the union will bargain to get them back on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I can tell, they are being discharged because,
purely, the company didn't believe them,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants from Detroit, New York, Los Angeles and
Honolulu were among those fired.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest sued the union and some of its members in January,
alleging they had violated federal labor laws by orchestrating a
sickout. The company has conducted court-authorized searches of the
home computers of some flight attendants, looking for evidence that
a sickout was organized.
</P>
<P>
   The union has argued that the high number of sick calls over New
Year's was because of a flu outbreak and fears of flying during the
Y2K rollover.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Take Over Hotel Lobby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- About 150 people were arrested Wednesday
after taking over the lobby of a Hilton hotel to protest passage of
a juvenile-justice ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21, approved Tuesday by 62 percent to 38 percent,
will impose sweeping changes in the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   A large crowd gathered on the street, then moved to the Hilton
where youths gave speeches over bullhorns and loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Templeton, a spokeswoman for the Third Eye Movement, which
opposed Proposition 21, said protesters targeted the Hilton because
its parent company contributed about $10,000 to help pass the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the ornate lobby adorned with glass chandeliers and marble,
protesters carried signs saying, among other things, ''Education
not incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 protesters later blocked traffic as they marched
toward a BART commuter rail station. Many ended up outside a police
station in the Mission district where the arrested protesters were
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes in the measure are allowing prosecutors,
rather than judges, to decide whether youths aged 14 to 17 are
tried as adults for serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21 also limits judges' authority to refer youths to
treatment or probation rather than locked facilities after
convictions. The measure requires adult prison sentences, in most
cases, for 16-year-olds convicted of felonies in adult court.

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   John Smoltz's season-ending injury overshadowed some
other big
events at spring training: Charlie Manuel's return to Cleveland's
dugout and wins by the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Braves' camp at Kissimmee, Fla., was jolted when Smoltz
learned he has a torn ligament in his right elbow and will miss the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty painful,'' Smoltz said Wednesday, three days
after lasting only 1 2-3 innings in his lone exhibition outing.
''The last few days have been the worst for me. I knew what I had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Manuel had been hospitalized following emergency
colon surgery Feb. 28. He was released Sunday from Winter Haven
Hospital and rejoined the Indians for Wednesday's 12-1 loss to
Kansas City at Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good to be back in the dugout, but when I saw 20 hits
and all those runs ... I think they were testing me to see how
strong I was,'' Manuel said. ''It seemed like a long game.''
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors said Manuel, who got to the field in a golf cart
but walked to the dugout from the clubhouse, is allowed as much
physical activity as he feels comfortable with. He will be required
to undergo a follow-up surgical procedure sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw something in my first at-bat,'' first baseman Jim Thome
said. ''He told me to slow down and get my timing. It was fun to
have him back talking baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Andy Pettitte pitched four scoreless
innings, and Tino Martinez and Luke Wilcox hit three-run homers as
the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 10-4 following an 0-6 start.
</P>
<P>
   New York had been outscored 56-21 without holding a lead in its
first six games. Last year, the Yankees were 14-19 in spring
training, then went 98-64 and won the World Series for the third
time in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody likes to lose, but this team had a losing record last
spring, too,'' Yankees catcher Jim Leyritz said. ''We know the most
important thing is being ready the last week of spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Todd Hundley hit a two-run homer and Orel
Hershiser pitched three scoreless innings as the Dodgers beat the
Detroit Tigers 12-5, also stopping an 0-6 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who knows anything about baseball knows these games
don't mean anything,'' Eric Karros said. ''Don't get me wrong, it's
nice to win games, but there are a lot of other things we're more
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Astros 5, Marlins (ss) 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Marc Sagmoen hit a two-run homer, his second

inning when they sent 14 batters to the plate and scored 10 runs
against starter Mike Sirotka and Pat Daneker.
Athletics (ss) 7, Angels (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, John Jaha, who has been bothered by a sore foot,
homered in his first at-bat and also doubled.

six hits in 1 1-3 innings, giving up a solo homer to Jim Edmonds
and a two-run drive to Garret Anderson.
Mariners 4, Giants 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Alex Rodriguez went 0-for-3 after the Seattle
Mariners told him they were going to keep him, and Edgar Martinez
hit his second home run of the spring.

   At Tucson, Ariz., Damian Miller doubled in two runs and Mike
Morgan pitched three shutout innings for the Diamondbacks.

three-inning start.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bierbrodt, the Diamondbacks' first-ever draft choice in
June 1996, pitched a scoreless fourth inning to earn the victory.

<P>
   The Kings, who trailed by 18 points at one stretch in the first
half, produced a 12-2 run early in the fourth quarter in winning
their third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   After playing solid defense in the third quarter to pull to
76-73, the Kings made 10 of their first 11 shots in the final
period to take a 95-88 lead. They made 15-of-20 shots in the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Foul-plagued Chris Webber finished with 22 points. Jon Barry
scored six points in the fourth quarter and finished with 11. Nick
Anderson also had 11.
</P>
<P>
   David Wesley had 17 of his 21 points in the first half for
Charlotte, which has lost six of nine games. Derrick Coleman had 17
points and Elden Campbell added 15 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Barry converted a reverse layup off a fastbreak, giving
Sacramento its first lead, 81-80, with 9:36 remaining. He later
lobbed a pass to Webber for a dunk as Sacramento went ahead 89-82
at the 7:10 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scored nine points and Webber had eight as the Kings
rallied from a sluggish first half to outscore the Hornets 29-21 in
the third quarter. An 8-0 run helped Sacramento pull to 76-73
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley scored seven points in a 19-5 second-quarter run to give
Charlotte a 53-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting consistently from the perimeter, Wesley scored 17 points
and Coleman had 12, helping the Hornets take a 55-44 lead into
halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kings reserve center Scot Pollard was put on the injured
list prior to the game. He sprained an ankle in Tuesday's win over
Dallas. Veteran Bill Wennington took his place on the roster. ...
Campbell had three blocks in the first quarter. ... In foul
trouble, Webber had a poor first half, getting six points and two
rebounds. ... Sacramento had three second-half turnovers and
finished with 11.

<HEADLINE> Top Mexico Law Enforcer Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The closure of a bank branch led to the
accidental discovery of $700,000 in suspicious funds in the safe
deposit box of a senior lawman, followed by the man's apparent
suicide, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a late-night news conference Wednesday, Madrazo said Juan
Manuel Izabal Villicana had left an emotional note for his wife,
saying he was killing himself to avoid having them ''go through
hell'' with his disgrace and asking forgiveness from his wife, his
children and God.
</P>
<P>
   Izabal headed the attorney general's administrative branch, a
high-ranking post in an agency in charge of prosecuting all federal
crimes -- including drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   He was found dead early Wednesday, slumped over the steering
wheel of his Chevrolet Suburban a block from his house with a
bullet wound in his head and a pistol in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo told the news conference that all evidence indicated ''a
high degree of probability'' that the death was a suicide and he
said officials were trying to determine where Izabal had received
his money.
</P>
<P>
   In the suicide note read by Madrazo, Izabal told his wife that
the money ''is difficult to explain. It is the product of
businesses I have made, but in my position as a public servant, it
would not be understood. It is not from drug traffickers, not at
all, but I did not declare it and circumstances have put me against
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's lead role against drug trafficking and organized
crime has for years made it a target for corruption, and attorneys
general have fought a constant battle to clean up the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said officials of Citibank in Mexico told him they were
closing a branch in Mexico City and had repeatedly notified Izabal
and others with safe deposit boxes to reclaim their goods and
transfer them to another office.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not respond, bank officials opened the box and found
$700,000 in Mexican and U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   Izabal finally came to Citibank early Tuesday and was told that
bank officials had decided to consult with the attorney general's
office before returning the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank's chief attorney in Mexico, Juan Rodriguez Macedo,
called Madrazo on Tuesday and made an appointment to speak with him
at noon Wednesday. By the time of the meeting, Izabal had been dead
for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very sad to lose a working colleague of many years,''
Madrazo said. ''It is even sadder in the circumstances which
surround his death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the message to his wife, Izabal asked her to tell his
children ''that their father loves them very, very much and suffers
in his soul to leave them, but it would hurt more to make them
suffer that full shame of their father pursued and torn to
pieces.''

Bradley, McCain Prepare To Withdraw
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his presidential campaign
Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a stranglehold on the Republican
nomination after Super Tuesday voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe Al Gore
as he scripted his Thursday exit from the presidential campaign. McCain was not
expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear whether the Arizona senator would
end his campaign entirely, or simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his
options. At least one senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider
launching a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Protein Linked to Vein Blood Clots  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   High levels of a little-understood blood clotting protein appear
to double the risk of developing clots in veins, Dutch researchers
reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Such clots can break loose, travel into the lungs and block
blood flow, a deadly condition known as a pulmonary embolism.
Sitting or lying down for long stretches, smoking and high
cholesterol can lead to vein clots.
</P>
<P>
   If high levels of Factor XI turn out to be caused by a genetic
defect, doctors could screen for the defect to predict whether
someone is likely to develop unwanted clots, other doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Utrecht and Leiden universities looked at 474
patients at anti-coagulation clinics in Leiden, Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, and an equal number of people without clotting problems.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of blood clots rose with the amount of Factor XI in the
blood, and was more than double for people whose Factor XI levels
were in the top 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results were fascinating and unexpected, said Dr. Andrew
Schafer, a hematologist and chairman of medicine at Baylor College
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Low levels of Factor XI are associated with bleeding disorders,
but the relationship is not nearly as clear-cut as the newly found
one between high levels and excess clotting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted, the connection between excess clotting and
high levels of the protein does not tell which causes which.
</P>
<P>
   And a twofold increase in a risk factor is not necessarily
large, said Dr. Barbara Alving, director of the blood division of
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may become a greater increase if you are also at bed rest,
or also on oral contraceptives, or pregnant -- situations that also
increase the risk,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Smoking's Dangers Immediate  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smokers are four times more likely than nonsmokers to get
life-threatening blood infections or meningitis from a bug that
usually causes pneumonia, researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're used to thinking of smoking as causing terrible results
long in the future. But smokers in this study had a much higher
risk of this immediate infection,'' said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   And the more cigarettes a person smokes, the higher the risk of
an infection.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers aren't sure why this is so, but noted, among
other things, that cigarette smoke makes it harder for the lungs to
expel foreign material and easier for bacteria to stick.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and researchers in Atlanta, Baltimore and Toronto looked
at 228 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease -- Streptococcus
pneumoniae infections -- and at 301 people without the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Such infections are most likely in elderly people, children and
people with immune problems. However, the study in today's New
England Journal of Medicine looked only at patients 18 through 64
with healthy immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that smokers were 4.1 times more likely
than nonsmokers to get the infections, and nonsmokers who were
often exposed to cigarette smoke were 2{ times more likely than
people who did not have such exposure.
</P>
<P>
   People who smoked up to 14 cigarettes a day were 2.3 times more
likely than nonsmokers to get the infections, and those who smoked
at least 25 a day were 5.5 times more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a significant addition to the list of bad effects of
smoking,'' said Dr. Robert Rogers, a professor of pulmonary and
critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''People sort of have the idea that, 'Well, when I start to feel
symptoms, I'll stop smoking. My father smoked until he was 60, and
I'll wait until I'm 55,''' he said. ''Here's a good reason to stop
now, because here are young people who have a very serious
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   The study noted that former smokers appeared to have an
increased risk of the infection for at least 10 years after they
quit.

<HEADLINE> Clot Drug Errors May Kill 1,500  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- About 1,500 U.S. heart attack victims may die each
year because they receive the wrong doses of clot-dissolving drugs
given to hundreds of thousands of patients, a study estimates.
</P>
<P>
   While the medicines are clearly lifesavers if given properly,
the new work shows they can also prove fatal when nurses fail to
administer the precisely correct dose at the right time -- a mix-up
that apparently happens frequently in hectic emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs -- TPA, streptokinase and Retavase -- are standard
treatment for patients who arrive at the emergency room within six
hours of the start of symptoms. Last year, the medicines were given
to about 260,000 heart attack patients in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Given quickly, the drugs can clear away the blood clots that
cause heart attacks before permanent damage results. Emergency room
teams typically try to get the treatment started within a half-hour
of the patient's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston reviewed
the results of eight large studies involving almost 50,000 patients
to see how commonly errors occur. They found that TPA, the most
complicated of the three drugs to give, results in the most errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every place we looked, the simpler the dosing, the fewer the
errors. And if they had an error, it was bad news,'' said Dr.
Christopher Cannon, who directed the review.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon plans to present the results Saturday at an educational
session at the start of the annual meeting of the American College
of Cardiology in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The number of TPA errors varied from study to study, ranging
from 12 percent to 16 percent of patients treated. Errors occurred
in 8 percent to 11 percent of patients getting streptokinase and in
about 5 percent of those receiving Retavase, the simplest of the
drugs to administer.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate was 7 percent to 8 percent if the drugs were
given properly and double that if mistakes were made.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon estimated that 22,500 patients nationally get the wrong
dose of clot-dissolving drugs annually, and this error results in
approximately 1,500 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''This therapy has to be given within minutes,'' Cannon said.
''You have to rush. So there is a big push. It's a setting where
you could imagine errors happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In a busy emergency department, staff members may get distracted
by even sicker patients who need immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   TPA -- tissue plasminogen activator or Activase -- was the first
widely used clot dissolver but is the hardest to give. Patients
must receive two separate infusions, the first for 30 minutes and
the second for 60 minutes. Also, those who weigh less than 150
pounds must get a lower dose, depending on their weight.
</P>
<P>
   Typical mistakes include giving the drugs too fast or too
slowly, forgetting to give the second infusion on time and giving
too high or low a dose. The analysis suggests that any of these
errors can increase the death rate.
</P>
<P>
   Errors were more common in women than in men, mostly because
women are more likely to need less than the standard dose because
of their size.
</P>
<P>
   ''TPA is given according to a fairly rigid cookbook of timing,''
said Dr. David Vorchheimer of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York
City. ''It's a high-wire act. Small screw-ups in timing can have
important consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon said Retavase results in the fewest errors because it is
given in two simple injections a half-hour apart, not timed
infusions. Awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration is
an even simpler drug, a new form of TPA called TNK or tenecteplase,
that will be given as a single injection.

<HEADLINE> Flu-Like Heart Disease Is Curable  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A rare but deadly heart disease with symptoms that
mimic the flu
is curable if doctors figure it out in time and give the heart some
help, researchers reported today in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fulminant myocarditis is a severe inflammation that weakens the
heart. It affects fewer than one in a million patients, but often
kills those people.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors sometimes fail to recognize the disease. And up to now,
even when they recognized it, they had no reliable way of
predicting which patients might recover.
</P>
<P>
   A study at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore found that when
these patients are properly diagnosed and treated, they can recover
fully within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make physicians aware that although this condition
is uncommon, it should be considered in patients with flu-like
symptoms and fluid in the lungs,'' said Dr. Joshua Hare, associate
director of the heart failure and cardiac transplant program at
Hopkins. He said the condition is under-diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   An echocardiogram and biopsy are used to diagnose the disease,
usually caused by a viral or other infection or by an immune
disorder. Effective treatments include medicine to stimulate the
heart or an implanted pump to help the heart until it can manage by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physicians should use any means necessary to maintain these
patients' heart function, as virtually all will recover within two
weeks and then lead a normal life,'' said Dr. Kenneth Baughman,
director of Hopkins' division of cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with fulminant myocarditis appear much more seriously
ill than those with acute myocarditis, which causes shortness of
breath and fatigue. But if they are treated, they will live longer
and probably will not need a heart transplant, unlike patients with
acute myocarditis, Hare said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers compared 15 patients with fulminant myocarditis and
132 with acute myocarditis between 1984 and 1997. Fourteen of the
15 fulminant myocarditis patients were still alive 11 years after
the diagnosis, while fewer than half of the people with the less
severe form survived that long.

<HEADLINE> Night Light-Nearsighted Link Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children won't go nearsighted because of their night lights,
suggest two new studies in today's journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of researchers said they were unable to duplicate the
results of an earlier study indicating children who sleep with a
night light until age 2 are three times more likely to develop
nearsightedness, or myopia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The original report suggested that parents turn out the
lights,'' said Jane Gwiazda of the New England College of Optometry
in Boston. ''And now with two studies to the contrary, it's safe to
say parents can leave the lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   The two follow-up studies were done separately at the New
England College of Optometry and Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   The original study was done by scientists at the University of
Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and was
published in Nature last May. It raised the possibility that too
much light during the first two years of life prompts the rapidly
developing eyes to grow excessively and throws them out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up studies found no difference between the rate of
myopia for children who slept in the dark and those who slept with
a night light.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the real explanation may be -- at least indirectly
-- heredity, the researchers said. Myopic parents are more likely to
have myopic children. And myopic parents may like to leave night
lights on so they can see better at night.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group studied 213 people ranging in age from 2 to 24,
with a mean age of 11. It found that 20 percent of the children who
slept with night lights developed myopia, exactly the same
percentage as the youngsters who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State study, which involved 1,220 children with a
median age of 10, found the percentage of children who became
nearsighted after sleeping with a night light as babies was about
17 percent. Statistically, that was the same as the 20 percent of
the children who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the percentage of children who slept in a fully lit
room and later became nearsighted was essentially the same at 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest link the Ohio State study found was between the
number of nearsighted parents and their use of night lights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surprise, surprise: Those of us who can't see like to leave
the lights on,'' said Ohio State optometrist Karla Zadnik.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Stone, an ophthalmologist and co-author of the
Pennsylvania study, said in a response published in Nature that
widespread publicity may have led parents in the follow-up studies
to underreport night light use out of guilt for possibly
contributing to myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also said the differing results may be due to the
differing average age for the children -- the average age in the
Pennsylvania study was 8.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is widespread biological evidence from animal
studies that cycles of light and darkness affect eye development.

   JEAN, Nev. (AP) -- A van crowded with 13 people flipped over
several times in front of two casinos outside Las Vegas, killing
eight and injuring the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the bodies thrown from the vehicle, authorities picked
through wreckage that included a rearview mirror and sun visors as
well as a purse, shoes and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the worst one I've seen, as far as a single vehicle
accident,'' in several years, Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman
Michael Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   The van skidded across an interstate highway, plunged down a
steep highway median and flipped over several times Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was headed toward Las Vegas when it rolled over about 30
miles south of the city. The driver veered off the left side of the
interstate, then overcorrected, sending the van across the road and
down the gravel median, the Nevada Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were thrown from the van, and seven of them were
killed, Cooke said. The only person in the van wearing a seat belt
was among the survivors, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The large green 2000 Dodge van was registered in California to
Rental Car Finance Corp., an Ohio company. Authorities said they
did not immediately know the relationship of the people in the van.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of alcohol was found among suitcases strewn around the
scene, but the Highway Patrol said it was unknown whether alcohol
played a role in the accident. Road conditions did not appear to
have been a factor and no other vehicles were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred shortly after 1 p.m. between the two
hotel-casinos that straddle Interstate 15 in the small community of
Jean.
</P>
<P>
   The injured victims, three men in their 60s, a woman in her 60s
and a woman in her 50s, were in fair condition at University
Medical Center in Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Army Rejects 1865 Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- The U.S. Army has rejected an appeal to
overturn the 1865 conviction of Dr. Samuel Mudd as an accomplice in
the escape of John Wilkes Booth after the Lincoln assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Mudd's 99-year-old grandson, Dr. Richard Mudd of Saginaw, has
waged a long campaign to clear grandfather's name.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Army Assistant Secretary Patrick T. Henry
rejected the latest request to throw out Samuel Mudd's conviction
by a military court.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said his decision was based on a narrow question -- whether
a military court had jurisdiction to try Samuel Mudd, who was a
civilian.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find that the charges against Dr. Mudd (i.e., that he aided
and abetted President Lincoln's assassins) constituted a military
offense, rendering Dr. Mudd accountable for his conduct to military
authorities,'' he wrote in Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Booth shot President Lincoln at Ford's Theater
in 1865, he knocked on the Maryland door of Samuel Mudd, seeking
treatment for the leg he broke jumping from the president's box
onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A nine-member military commission convicted him in 1865 of
aiding Booth in his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Mudd said he did not know of Lincoln's assassination and
did not recognize Booth, a popular actor, when he put a cast on
Booth's leg. However, Mudd had met Booth at least twice before.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Mudd was sentenced to life in prison in Florida, but
served only four years. He received a pardon in 1869 from President
Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there was uncertainty about his complicity in
Booth's escape. He also cited Samuel Mudd's heroic effort to save
lives during a yellow fever epidemic at the prison.

<HEADLINE> French Distribute Food in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Jusuf Kamberi strained to
hold up the box of food French peacekeepers delivered to the ethnic
Albanians now back in their homes on the Serb side of this divided
city.
</P>
<P>
   The two boxes of Rice Krispies that topped off the package
really confused him.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is this?'' he asked, boxes in hand. ''There is no meat!
No bread!''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were distributing food to the residents of
three high-rise apartment buildings on the Serb-controlled side of
Kosovska Mitrovica because the families cannot go out shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Residents swarmed to a burned-out storefront Wednesday,
desperate for the meager ration of cereal, potatoes, oranges and
milk. The offerings were the first groceries they have received in
the five days since French peacekeepers stormed through a
rock-throwing mob to return them to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO acted to take a stand against ethnic division in the
industrial city split by the Ibar River into a predominantly Serb
north and an almost exclusively ethnic Albanian south.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers are now dealing with the reality that ethnic
Albanians relocated under their care cannot leave their homes,
fearful of what awaits them in a city where most have lived all
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   People like Kamberi, a 61-year-old retired miner, haven't even
left their apartments since French peacekeepers escorted them back
in armored personnel carriers -- much less dared to do their daily
shopping or mingle in town. Even at home, there is reason to fear:
A rocket slammed into the seventh floor of one building on Tuesday.
No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way you can even go out is with KFOR,'' Kamberi said,
using the acronym for the NATO mission in Kosovo. ''Security is a
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The food distribution underlines the troubles NATO is having in
Kosovska Mitrovica, 25 miles from Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Even
as peacekeepers and the U.N. mission desperately attempt to prove
they are making it possible for the town to remain multiethnic,
violence continues to erode the promise of harmony and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ethnic Albanian residents are coming back -- four more
families returned under French escort Wednesday -- their new reality
is becoming apparent. The U.N. refugee agency, which had opposed
the conditions under which the displaced residents returned,
stepped in Wednesday despite their earlier objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will help them,'' said Claire Bourgeois, head of the local
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ''This is not
yet a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials, meanwhile, continue to draw plans to resettle
Serbs on the ethnic Albanian side of the river -- a situation that
could prove even more volatile because so few Serbs actually live
there now.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment dwellers, meanwhile, wonder what will happen to
them as time goes on. The French peacekeepers check on them often --
but people like Kamberi wonder how long that will last.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the future?'' he asked. ''Are they going to be like
this forever?''

<HEADLINE> Raptors 95, Clippers 94  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vince Carter did it again Wednesday night,
making a 3-point shot as time expired to give the Toronto Raptors a
95-94 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who scored 14 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter,
hit a 3-pointer as time was running out to give the Raptors a 96-94
win at Boston exactly a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who made just one of his first 10 shots and scored only
four points in the first half, took an inbound pass from Tracy
McGrady, and the buzzer sounded with the ball in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom had made two free throws with 1.5 seconds left to
give the lowly Clippers, who lost for the 17th time in 18 games, a
two-point lead. Toronto then called a timeout and ran the winning
play.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Christie scored 18 points and McGrady scored 15 for the
Raptors, who won their seventh straight game -- a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby and Derek Anderson scored 21 points, Maurice Taylor
had 20 and Odom had 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists for
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who finished 9-of-21 from the floor, appeared to make a
costly mistake before his game-winning shot, fouling Odom outside
the 3-point line when it appeared Odom would be unable to get off a
shot before time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's 3-point shot with nine minutes remaining gave the
Clippers an 86-72 lead -- largest of the game for either team -- and
he made two free throws with 4:54 left to make it 90-79.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors then scored the next 11 points, the final two on a
jump shot by Charles Oakley for his only points of the game,
knotting the score at 90 with 1:16 to play.
</P>
<P>
   A jump hook by Michael Olowokandi, who had 10 points and 14
rebounds, put the Clippers on top, but Carter's long jumper with 51
seconds to play tied it again, and it stayed tied until the
exciting finish.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has now led the Raptors in scoring in a franchise-record
16 straight games, but he was off his game for the first three
quarters, scoring just nine points.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers took a 12-point lead early in the third quarter
before the Raptors went on a 19-5 run to put them ahead 66-64.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers finished the period by outscoring Toronto 11-3 to
give them a 75-69 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't score for the first 8{ minutes, missing his first
three shots, with the third falling far short, drawing chants of
''air ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers scored the final seven points of the first half for
a 51-43 lead. Carter played only four minutes, scoring just two
points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto has won a franchise-record five straight road
games. They are 15-14 on the road, the only Eastern Conference team
with a winning road record. ... They were 9-16 on the road during
the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season and 23-27 overall. ... The
Clippers have won just three of their last 34 games, and their
12-49 record is the NBA's worst. ... Carter has averaged over 30
points in the last 16 games, never scoring less than 21. ...
Clippers guard Troy Hudson didn't play because of a stomach
ailment.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Voters Reign Supreme  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Test tube babies. Jobs for women.
Traffic overload.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention animal rights, asylum seekers, abolition of the
army, European integration and U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
   It's voting time in Switzerland. Again. And again. ... And
again. This small Alpine nation of 7 million inhabitants accounts
for an estimated half the referendum ballots worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since the modern Swiss constitution took effect in 1848, the
Swiss have been summoned to the national ballot box no less than
471 times on a bewildering array of subjects. They are now asked to
decide national issues an average of three times a year. And that
doesn't include local votes on issues like building projects and
school lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the world record holders in voting,'' declares Jean
Clerk, a senior official with the Swiss parliamentary services,
proud that he personally has voted in 250 nationwide polls. ''It's
a fundamental part of Swiss democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under direct democracy rules, 100,000 signatures on a petition
are enough to prompt a referendum to introduce a new law, and
50,000 signatures can challenge a proposed government law.
</P>
<P>
   There are six so-called popular initiatives currently gathering
signatures, all of which have to be checked and double-checked for
authenticity before being delivered to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Many don't make the grade: plans to ''save our youth'' with the
reintroduction of the death penalty for drug dealers, removal of
dog dirt from public places, the use of carrier pigeons in the army
-- all recent examples of those that failed to cross the 100,000
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 proposals are currently under government or
parliamentary consideration and in the long line for voting.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing critics, however, maintain the line is TOO long. How
do they suggest solving the problem? By holding another vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proposals in Sunday's poll would impose a 12-month
limit between a petition being submitted to the government and the
actual referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say popular initiatives are too often put on a back
burner for political and tactical reasons. Nonsense, counter the
authorities who say such a cap would cripple any meaningful debate.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree the proposal is likely to be thrown out, as
are others to impose tough restrictions on in-vitro fertilization,
introduce minimum quotas for women in federal employment and halve
road traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout is expected to be around 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't vote,'' says Fabian Grillon, a 32-year-old chef. ''I'm
not interested in politics and it's all to complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendums that draw even half the 4.5 million electorate
are rare. The most recent record was in 1992, when about 79 percent
turned out to reject a government proposal to join a loose European
free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   While voters have followed the government's advice in about
three-quarters of all polls, that's not so for foreign policy.
Government efforts to end Switzerland's self-imposed isolation have
invariably ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
   To repair the damage caused by the 1992 trade pact vote, the
government painstakingly negotiated a series of trade agreements
with the European Union to safeguard vital Swiss export industries.
But even these have been challenged by nationalists and so will be
put to a popular vote May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Another looming challenge is U.N. membership. Proponents only
just managed to scrape by a deadline to hand in the petition,
partly by copying other lobby groups and paying students to collect
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a got a lot of work in front of us,'' concedes Patrick
Loeb, head of the U.N. organizing committee -- mindful that efforts
to join the world body were thrown out by a massive 75 percent
majority in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. initiative joins the other pending referendums, which
include proposals to ban abortion, to abolish the army and replace
it with a voluntary civil defense service, even one to ban pleasure
fights by water jets over Swiss lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We vote on everything'' sighs Geneva florist Maurice
Lavergnat. ''We even vote on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even more amazingly, we even vote to increase them.''

<HEADLINE> Three Killed During Md. Kidnapping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLEYS QUARTERS (AP) -- A man suspected of killing three people
while abducting his estranged girlfriend went on a shooting rampage
Wednesday, injuring a woman and child, before being tracked to a
hotel in eastern Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-girlfriend, who had been missing since Tuesday, was found
safe at the Elridge Hotel, where her alleged abductor, Joseph
Palczynski, 31, was engaged in a standoff with police early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Major Jeff Caslin said Wednesday's shooting spree began about
7:45 p.m. when the suspect shot at a woman in her car.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, the man shot at a Chrysler LeBaron he
was trying to steal, hitting a woman and her 2-year-old daughter
who were driving by. The suspect took the LaBaron, but the driver
was unharmed, Caslin said. A short time later, the man stole
another car from an elderly woman, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The names and conditions of Wednesday night's shooting victims
were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents assisted state and local police in their manhunt
before eventually tracking Palczynski to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski had been sought since Tuesday for the alleged
abduction of Tracy Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had told police that Palczynski, her ex-boyfriend,
beat her when she tried to move out of their apartment on Friday.
He was arrested but was later released, according to police
documents. The circumstances of the release weren't immediately
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead moved in with friends, George and Gloria Shenk, in
Bowleys Quarters, about 10 miles east of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after they had eaten dinner, a gunman entered the
apartment and told Whitehead: ''Tracy, get up, you're going,''
according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Shenks, ages 49 and 50, were shot and killed. Their son and
George Shenk's niece, who also were in the apartment, were not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor David Meyers, 42, was killed when he tried to help
Whitehead, police said. The gunman and Whitehead were seen leaving
in a van, police said.

<HEADLINE> Bill pushes for cleaner Connecticut air  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The owners of five Connecticut power
plants say they will be forced to shut down for eight weeks if the
Legislature passes a bill calling for lower emission rates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from NRG Energy Inc. and Wisvest Corp. say their
companies are already in compliance with standards set by the
federal Clean Air Act, and are fighting the bill to clean up the
so-called ''Filthy Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Riley, a vice president for NRG, the bill would cost his
company $476 million and force the power plants to be shut down for
up to two months while new equipment is being installed.
</P>
<P>
   And his colleagues say the new equipment isn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The air has gotten incredibly cleaner over the last 20 or 30
years,'' David Damer, a Wisvest official said Wednesday. ''The air
quality is getting better and better, and the asthma rates seem to
be getting worse and worse. I can only conclude that there is no
correlation between the direction that air pollution is heading and
the direction that asthma is heading. It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But forcing the plants to lower emissions will improve both air
quality and the health of Connecticut residents, a group of
doctors, lawmakers and environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   They said limiting the number of pollutants being spit into the
air will cut childhood asthma and other breathing problems in the
communities surrounding the plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cleaning up the 'Filthy Five' would be a major step toward
preventing those problems for people in the state of Connecticut,''
said Conrad Schneider, a member of the Clean Air Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require fossil fuel power plants in Bridgeport,
New Haven, Middletown, Norwalk and Montville to cut their
production levels of nitrogen and sulfur oxides by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The air pollutants emitted by power plants cause many and
serious adverse health effects,'' said Dr. Jefferson Dickey, a
member of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   After a similar bill passed last June on a 68-67 vote in the
House of Representatives, the Legislature's Energy and Technology
Committee never took it up again, effectively killing it.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of last year's bill said the proposal could have
derailed the electric deregulation law that required the power
plants to be auctioned by the end of the year. They said passing
the legislation would hurt the value of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis-based NRG paid Northeast Utilities $460 million for
the Connecticut Light &AMP; Power plants in Montville, Norwalk and
Middletown. The sale also included a CL&AMP;P plant in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   United Illuminating, which owned the New Haven and Bridgeport
plants, sold its plants to Wisvest of Milwaukee for $272 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 110 lawmakers who are backing the bill, said Rep.
Chris Caruso, D-Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to fight for this every step of the way this
year,'' Caruso said.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--UTC Job Cuts, Conn Bjt, 540  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Connecticut lawmakers said they were pleased
to hear the head of United Technologies Corp.'s promise not to cut
any more jobs for the next two years. But, they said more needs to
be done to protect the state's workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are appealing to their better angels,'' said Rep. John
Larson, a Democrat whose East Hartford district is hit hard by the
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   UTC Chairman George David also stressed that Wednesday's Capitol
Hill gathering was not in response to a similar meeting between
lawmakers and union members a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to have labor-management negotiations via the
United States Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been in the process of eliminating 3,500 jobs
since it started a major restructuring and consolidation effort in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In late January UTC officials announced they'll add 1,700 more
jobs to that list by the end of the year from the companies Pratt &AMP;
Whitney jet-engine manufacturing plants in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit brought by
the Machinists Union that plans to move some 500 repair jobs from
Connecticut to other states violates contractual requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers characterized Wednesday's meeting as positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us expected they would turn around the
layoffs but we hope they keep in mind as we go forward that
Connecticut is not just any state. We are their home state. We've
given a lot and we expect a little in return,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hartford, Conn., dozens of unionized workers
protested the planned job cuts in front of UTC headquarters. They
marched carrying signs that read ''Good Jobs, Strong Communities.''
</P>
<P>
   James Parent, with The Machinists union, District 91, said the
cuts would have an impact far beyond the fences of Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every 100 aerospace manufacturing jobs, it affects 393
other jobs,'' Parent said. ''This will affect the entire state of
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 of the job cuts will come from the hourly work
force, mostly line workers in the company's East Hartford, North
Haven and Middletown plants. The remaining 200 cuts will come from
salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cuts are due to contracts with foreign governments
that agree to buy Pratt products in return for some of the
manufacturing being done in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said David will now provide them with information
about these agreements, known as offsets, before they happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to know what these are about so we know if we are
lobbying for support of something that means a loss of jobs in the
state,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposed cuts are the result of the company's desire to
move operations to other states.
</P>
<P>
   David said he plans to appeal the ruling on the union's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he is hoping to convince David to compromise
rather than appeal the union's lawsuit. '' Every day, everywhere in
America, parties after a lower court's decision get together and
settle. Maybe that could mean keeping some of those jobs.''

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Unaffiliated voters who chose a party in
order to participate in Connecticut's presidential primary had a

   Leaders of both parties say these independents will have an even

   Seven out of 10 independent voters who went Republican for the
primary chose Arizona Sen. John McCain over Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In exit polls, almost 8-in-10 of these voters said they would
support McCain over Vice President Al Gore in a hypothetical
November election.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain floundering, Bush seems more likely to be the
party's nominee. If that happens, many of these independents will
switch over to the Democratic ticket and choose Vice President Al
Gore, the polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were conducted for The Associated Press and television
networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   About 44,000 voters, or a quarter of the voters in Tuesday's GOP
primary, were previously unaffiliated but registered with the party
so they could vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   One-in-five Democratic voters, or about 35,000 voters, told
pollsters they previously had been independents.
</P>
<P>
   For the general election, Connecticut has 787,000 unaffiliated
voters, compared with 477,000 Republicans and 699,000 Democrats,
1998 election figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DePino, the state GOP chairman and a Bush supporter, said
McCain was a logical choice of many independents.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the rebel with a cause. That's a pretty engaging
attraction to independent voters,'' DePino said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he thinks McCain supporters will not be attracted to
Gore in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will find no rebel with a cause in Al Gore -- I can assure
you of that,'' DePino said.
</P>
<P>
   Independents in the Democratic primary favored New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those independent voters said they would
support McCain in a Gore-McCain November match-up, but only a
quarter of them said they would support Bush over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, less than one-fifth of independents who voted
Democratic Tuesday said they would support Bush over Gore in
November, the exit poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain vote came down to people who found his personality
and history as a prisoner of war compelling, said Ed Marcus,
chairman of the state Democratic Party and a Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain did poorly in primaries nationwide and will likely
drop out of the race, independent McCain supporters will have to
take another look at the remaining candidates, Marcus said. He
predicted McCain supporters would defect to Gore in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 1,344 voters in the Connecticut
Republican presidential primary and 1,180 voters in the Democratic
primary. The exit poll was conducted in 40 randomly selected
precincts statewide. The margin of sampling error for each result
is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Suit: Ad portraying commute as animal cruelty is protected byConstitution  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- By refusing to put up an advertisement from mass
transit advocate groups, Metropolitan Transportation Authority
officials say they are looking out for their operation and their
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the advocates say that muting their ad campaign -- with a
poster headline that states ''With livestock it's called animal
cruelty. With people it's called a morning commute'' -- infringes
upon their right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the ad sponsors sued the agency that runs New
York's subways, saying the MTA violated the First Amendment by
refusing to put the ad in subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not shouting 'fire' on a crowded subway. We are just
seeking public support to improve mass transit,'' said H. Claude
Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, which filed
the lawsuit along with the New York Public Interest Research Group
Straphangers Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The morning commute ad was one of two offered by non-profit
groups hoping to spur commuters into joining a mass-transit
advocacy coalition and urging political leaders to fund MTA
improvements such as a new subway line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sued to defend free speech and to improve the subways,''
said Gene Russianoff, a staff attorney for the Straphangers
Campaign. ''We want to make sure that the MTA doesn't change its
motto from 'Going Your Way' to 'Better Think Our Way.''
</P>
<P>
   A second ad shows a state-of-the-art subway station and train
with the headline: ''It's modern. It's reliable. Unfortunately,
it's not in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional Plan Association Inc. and the Straphangers Campaign
filed their lawsuit against the MTA in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. According to court papers, the MTA initially rejected
both advertisements on Feb. 29, but later decided to allow the
second ad.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to force the MTA to place both posters.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the MTA had asked the groups to change
both headlines and that MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway personally
called a representative of the groups to do so.
</P>
<P>
   MTA spokesman Tom Kelly said he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in litigation now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a rejection letter regarding the crowded subway ad, the MTA
told the groups that use of the headline ''is directly adverse to
the commercial interests of the MTA, in that it is highly critical
of the MTA's performance and its current mass transit services,''
the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This advertisement would discourage the use of the MTA's mass
transit services as well as negatively impact the morale of MTA
workers,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes as the New York Legislature considers a new
four-year capital spending program for the MTA, one that the
advocacy groups hope will improve mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   The groups want to see the Legislature go even further than
proposals by the MTA to construct a new subway line down Second
Avenue in Manhattan and to purchase 1,130 subway cars and 1,056
buses.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Wrestlers Arrested, Conn Bjt,400  </HEADLINE>
dlstfrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- The 15-year-old boy who was allegedly
hogtied and sodomized with a plastic knife handle by his wrestling
teammates at Trumbull High School was a special needs student who
was encouraged to join the team to help him fit in, his lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the team have been charged in the hazing
incidents. School officials completed expulsion hearings Tuesday
for seven of the wrestlers, but refused to release the results.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged victim is a special education student with a
learning disability and attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorder, according to his lawyer, Howard Klebanoff.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanoff said the boy was urged by the school to become a
wrestler after some bad experiences with the band and the track
team. But police say his teammates intimidated and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think calling it hazing is absolutely a misnomer,''
Klebanoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not hazing. To put a child in a locker and poke him
with a pole, to extort money from him to let him out, to take
things from him and make him buy them back -- that's a combination
of physical and emotional abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the alleged abuse took place over a month-long
period, beginning in December. The boy's parents complained to
school officials and police on Feb. 2 after noticing bruises on
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Trumbull Superintendent of Schools Ralph M. Iassonga said the
school district has been working closely with the boy's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the privacy rights of all of the individuals, I
can't comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the students charged in the assault say there has
long been a tacit approval of the hazing ''tradition'' at Trumbull
High -- a charge school officials have denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would think if (school officials) were diligent they
should have known about these things,'' said Frederick Paoletti, a
lawyer for one of the students. ''The kids got a mixed message here
about what you can do and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebanoff said the boy's parents are deeply troubled by what
happened to their son and do not wish to speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be certainly safe to say that various types
of civil lawsuits are being contemplated and studied,'' Klebanoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the boy's status as a special needs student could expand
the legal options open to the family.

<HEADLINE> Patriot movement leader acquitted of conspiracy, attemptedkidnapping  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- After failing to convict Patriot Movement
leader James ''Bo'' Gritz's of attempting to kidnap a 12-year-old
involved in a custody dispute, prosecutors are turning their
attention to the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wiegand is a fugitive, accused of trying to hire the
former Green Beret Colonel to take her son from her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   If caught, she will be prosecuted on custodial interference
charges in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Linda is the fourth conspirator in this case,'' Assistant
State's Attorney John Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The other three are Gritz, his son James and Sheldon Robinson of
McKinney, Texas, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz and Robinson were acquitted Wednesday on charges including
conspiracy, attempted second-degree kidnapping and attempted
custodial interference. Gritz was also acquitted of loitering on
school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand, who has accused her former husband of sexually abusing
her children, called the Associated Press after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear for the lives of my children,'' Wiegand said. ''I want
to know who is going to protect my children.''
</P>
<P>
   After his acquittal, Gritz saluted the jury and promised to keep
attention on Wiegand's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole trial has been about Linda Wiegand,'' Gritz said.
''The system has been constipated when it comes to her case, and
maybe my trial provided a laxative for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz and his son James were arrested Sept. 30, 1996, in the
parking lot of the McAlister Middle School, where Wiegand's son was
a student. James Gritz is being prosecuted separately.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Gritz planned to snatch the 12-year-old from
his school and reunite him with Wiegand. Authorities said Robinson
flew the Gritzes to Connecticut in his single-engine plane, rented
hotel rooms and paid for a meal with his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gritz and Robinson said the men were simply checking
Wiegand's claims. Gritz said he was thinking of doing something
''confrontational'' to bring attention to Wiegand's case, but said
he never plotted a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had acknowledged that much of the evidence against
Gritz (rhymes with ''fights'') was circumstantial. The Gritzes had
pictures of the boy and Wiegand's 10-year-old son from another
relationship, two-way radios and other items in the car, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand first accused her ex-husband of sexually assaulting the
children in Vermont during the couple's divorce in 1994. Charges
were dropped. An 18-month investigation in Connecticut also found
insufficient evidence to support Wiegand's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed that the system was not able to provide a
higher degree of protection for (Wiegand's husband),'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would decide later whether to continue the case
against James Gritz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the acquittals, his case by itself certainly is
weakened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gritz and Wiegand donated thousands of dollars to
her cause and sent letters to judges, lawyers and the governor.
They also released a confidential report by a state prosecutor
which they said supported the woman's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand went on the run with the children for two years. She was
arrested in Las Vegas in 1996 but has since disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The barrel-chested ex-military officer served as a negotiator in
the FBI siege of separatist Randy Weaver and his family at Ruby
Ridge in 1992. He also briefly was a mediator in the Montana
Freemen standoff in 1996, and in 1998 attempted to locate alleged
abortion clinic bomber Eric Rudolph in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz first came to prominence in the 1980s for staging several
unsuccessful commando-style forays into Laos to retrieve American
prisoners of war. His activities were curbed after U.S. authorities
charged him with using a passport under a false name.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for president in 1992 and is a leader of the Patriot
Movement, which rails against a United Nations-led ''New World
Order'' and accuses the government of corruption and violence.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- A passenger jetliner crashed Thursday at Moscow's main airport
and there were reports of fatalities, the Interfax news agency reported. The
report gave no details of what caused the crash of the Yak-40 aircraft, a medium
range Soviet-era passenger jet that carries up to 120 passengers. The Emergency
Situations Ministry in Moscow said it could not immediately confirm the report.
The plane was on a flight from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, to Moscow,

Bradley, McCain Prepare To Withdraw
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his presidential campaign
Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a stranglehold on the Republican
nomination after Super Tuesday voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe Al Gore
as he scripted his Thursday exit from the presidential campaign. McCain was not
expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear whether the Arizona senator would
end his campaign entirely, or simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his
options. At least one senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider
launching a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Doug Swingley Leads Iditarod Race  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPHIR, Alaska (AP) -- Defending champion Doug Swingley kept his
lead Wednesday in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, but previous
winners Martin Buser and Rick Swenson were right behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley of Lincoln, Mont., arrived at Ophir, an old gold mining
town, at 10:07 a.m., leaving 12 minutes later. He dropped a dog at
the checkpoint, leaving him with a 12-dog team.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Iditarod winner Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska,
arrived at 10:55 a.m. and stayed for about six hours before pushing
on with 13 dogs at 4:51 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, the race's only five-time winner,
left 22 minutes after Buser with a 14-dog team.
</P>
<P>
   ''All right King, that a boy,'' Swenson said as he directed the
team back on the trail toward the next checkpoint at Cripple 60
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof, Alaska, who had been leading the race
since Monday, remained in the previous checkpoint at Takotna for a
mandatory 24-hour layover. He had arrived at the previous
checkpoint in Takotna about 1{ hours before Swingley.
</P>
<P>
   DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow, Alaska chose to take her layover in
Ophir.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mackey of Nenana, Alaska, who won the race in 1983, was
preparing to leave Ophir shortly after Swenson departed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm in a real good position. So far everything has
worked out,'' Mackey said as he tossed fish chunks to his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the frontrunners pushed through Takotna, other
mushers took advantage of the village's reputation for hospitality.
Takotna and its 51 residents puts on one of the biggest welcomes
for mushers in the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. For that
reason, many of the mushers choose to do their mandatory 24 there.
A record 81 mushers began the race on Saturday. Two have scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers cooked up everything from burgers, pies and cakes to
steak and crab legs at the community hall, which sits in the center
of town. Mushers were taking the opportunity to catch up on some
much-needed rest after tending to their dogs. They've been racing
since Sunday and fatigue was starting to set in.
</P>
<P>
   During the 24-hour layover, mushers' times are adjusted to make
up for their differing start times, so it can be difficult to tell
exactly who is ahead until they complete their layovers.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen mushers joined Gebhardt for the long stay in
Takotna, including Ramy Brooks of Healy, Bill Cotter of Nenana,
Jerry Riley of Nenana and Jon Little of Kasilof.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the back of the pack were having trouble with a trail
left rough and bumpy by snowmachines and other mushers. Several
mushers had broken their sleds, running into trees and stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures have been rising into the 30s during the day and
many mushers have been running their teams during the cool nights,
so as not to overheat the dogs. Mushers welcomed the colder
temperatures of Alaska's Interior, where temperatures hovered
around zero Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> More Sydney Tickets To Go on Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney 2000 Olympics organizers will
place more than 2 million tickets on general sale next month, a
move which should help appease a highly critical Australian public.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG, criticized for its initial ticket ballot and after a
series of ticketing bungles, will offer the tickets on a
first-come, first-serve basis via the Internet and regular agency
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway announced the latest ticket
offer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be from tickets that were unsold before, of course,
and returns we always said we'd now be starting to get in from the
national Olympic committees and from sponsors,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means we will have tickets across most sports and
sessions, including some for the ceremonies and finals.''
</P>
<P>
   The SOCOG board will decide next week on the prices and
distribution of the tickets, which became available after an audit
and a reconfiguration of seating plans reduced the number of ''seat
kills'' -- those lost to obligatory media and official seating
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A change of protocol for the closing ceremony, allowing athletes
onto the arena for the celebration, allowed the reallocation of
10,000 more previously reserved seats.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Aims at Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a $1 boost in the minimum wage all but
inevitable, House Republicans are aiming to put their stamp on a
traditionally Democratic issue by coupling the legislation with a
10-year, $122.7 billion package of tax cuts intended to ease the
wage increase's impact on small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an understanding that we will have a vote on this wage
bill,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ''We're looking for a fair
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding President Clinton's veto threat, the House today
planned votes on both the tax cuts and competing proposals to
increase the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage: the GOP's increase of $1
over three years and an alternative two-year increase.
</P>
<P>
   Republican conservatives also won the chance for a vote on an
amendment allowing states the option of implementing the $1 wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke clears, GOP leaders intend to merge the
victorious minimum-wage version with the business tax breaks and
send the bill to the Senate, which has already approved a $1
increase in the wage and its own package of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a straightforward $1 increase over two years,
arguing the tax cuts -- particularly reductions in the estate tax --
are tilted toward the wealthy and would eat into projected budget
surpluses needed to shore up Social Security and add a Medicare
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republican leaders send me a bill that makes workers wait
for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum
wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity, I'll
veto it,'' Clinton said Wednesday at a White House rally. ''It is
time to stop nickel and diming American working people out of the
money they need and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage issue carries strong political overtones for
Republicans. Many moderates, particularly in the Northeast where
organized labor is strong, have pushed for a vote on an increase to
remove an issue Democrats could use against them. GOP
conservatives, meanwhile, oppose the wage increase as a job-killer,
but they are happy to vote for the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has roiled the House GOP for months, but supporters
were confident that eventually workers would get their raise and
that tax cuts of some size would become law in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has already jumped a lot of hurdles,'' said Rep.
John Shimkus, R-Ill. ''We've had a lot of internal and external
fights just to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the tax bill's 10-year cost comes from a gradual
reduction in the estate tax, which carries a price tag of $78.6
billion. Democrats say this primarily benefits the wealthy,
pointing to an analysis by the labor-funded Citizens for Tax
Justice concluding that it mainly benefits people with incomes over
$319,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not be forced to bribe the most wealthy in our
society in order to secure a simple dollar more per hour for the
poorest working American families,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say the estate tax kills small business and farm
growth and imposes burdensome tax planning costs that should be
reduced if businesses are forced to pay a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that with the minimum wage, we want to cushion the
impact on the economy, particularly small business,'' said Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The tax package also would gradually boost 401(k) contribution
limits and make other pension changes; make health insurance
premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed sooner than
under current law; increase the amount of business meals that can
be deducted; and enact other tax breaks for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage bill is H.R. 3081.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill is H.R. 3832.

<HEADLINE> Police Track Murder Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLEYS QUARTERS, Md. (AP) -- A man suspected of killing three
people while abducting his estranged girlfriend went on a shooting
rampage Wednesday, injuring a woman and child, before being tracked
to a hotel in eastern Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-girlfriend, who had been missing since Tuesday, was found
safe at the Elridge Hotel, where her alleged abductor, Joseph
Palczynski, 31, was engaged in a standoff with police early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Major Jeff Caslin said Wednesday's shooting spree began about
7:45 p.m. when the suspect shot at a woman in her car.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, the man shot at a Chrysler LeBaron he
was trying to steal, hitting a woman and her 2-year-old daughter
who were driving by. The suspect took the LeBaron, but the driver
was unharmed, Caslin said. A short time later, the man stole
another car from an elderly woman, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The names and conditions of Wednesday night's shooting victims
were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents assisted state and local police in their manhunt
before eventually tracking Palczynski to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski had been sought since Tuesday for the alleged
abduction of Tracy Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had told police that Palczynski, her ex-boyfriend,
beat her when she tried to move out of their apartment on Friday.
He was arrested but was later released, according to police
documents. The circumstances of the release weren't immediately
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead moved in with friends, George and Gloria Shenk, in
Bowleys Quarters, about 10 miles east of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after they had eaten dinner, a gunman entered the
apartment and told Whitehead: ''Tracy, get up, you're going,''
according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Shenks, ages 49 and 50, were shot and killed. Their son and
George Shenk's niece, who also were in the apartment, were not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor David Meyers, 42, was killed when he tried to help
Whitehead, police said. The gunman and Whitehead were seen leaving
in a van, police said.

Jet Crashes at Moscow Airport
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A passenger jetliner crashed Thursday while taking off from
Moscow's main airport and there were reports of fatalities, officials said. The
Ministry of Emergency Situations said rescue crews had been rushed to the site
of the crash at Sheremetyevo airport and were searching for survivors. There was
no immediate word on casualties, but the ITAR-Tass news agency said at least
five people died in the crash and the Interfax news agency reported four
fatalities. The Yak-40 aircraft, a medium range Soviet-era passenger jet that
carries up to 120 passengers, was carrying a crew of five and four passengers,
the Emergency Situations Ministry said.

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Ending days of speculation, Deutsche Bank and

international banking powerhouse with more than $1.2 trillion in assets.
Deutsche Bank will hold between 60 percent and 64 percent of the combined banks,
according to a statement released early Thursday. Dresdner will hold a stake
between 36 percent and 40 percent. The two banks also plan to spin off their
retail unit in the next three years. The merger is expected to be completed by
July 1 and save the company $2.8 billion by wiping out overlapping operations.

Bradley, McCain Prepare To Withdraw
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his presidential campaign
Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a stranglehold on the Republican
nomination after Super Tuesday voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe Al Gore
as he scripted his Thursday exit from the presidential campaign. McCain was not
expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear whether the Arizona senator would
end his campaign entirely, or simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his
options. At least one senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider
launching a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jan Hlavac scored the tying goal with
1:20 left in regulation and Brian Leetch won it 29 seconds into
overtime as the New York Rangers rallied for a 4-3 victory over the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves recorded his 100th career power-play goal and Radek
Dvorak also scored for the Rangers, who improved to 1-5 at Anaheim
Arena. It was New York's only meeting this season with the Ducks,
who went 8-13-4 against Eastern Conference teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rucchin and Teemu Selanne welcomed linemate Paul Kariya
back to the Anaheim lineup by scoring goals less than 5{ minutes
apart in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac also scored for the Ducks, 3-3-1 without Kariya -- who
bruised his right foot blocking a shot on Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who lost at San Jose on Monday, responded after
getting a heated lecture from coach John Muckler at Tuesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   New York pulled even when Hlavac got the puck from Dvorak at the
base of the left circle and put the puck between Guy Hebert's right
leg and the post for his 18th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac nearly ended it with a shot that hit the post with 18
seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the extra session, Selanne lost the puck near his blue line
to Leetch, who skated untouched down the slot and put his fifth
goal inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The goal ended a streak of 36 consecutive overtime shots Hebert
stopped, dating to Jaroslav Spacek's goal Oct. 16 at Florida.

<HEADLINE> City agrees to pay $1.87 million to three Harlem men shot bypolice  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawyer representing three young men shot by
police says he sees some similarities between his clients'
situation and the police shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Attorney Robert L. Herbst says out that neither
his clients nor Diallo were carrying weapons. But the more
important connection is that both cases indicate a need for change,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like the Diallo case, this case illustrates that the city has
a lot of work to do to supervise, train and better discipline its
officers so that they don't shoot innocent people down in the
streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the city agreed to pay the three men $1.87 million
to settle a lawsuit stemming from their shooting in Harlem on Feb.
13, 1997, by police officers, lawyers in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached shortly before the parties told U.S.
District Judge Loretta A. Preska that a trial set to start in six
weeks would not be necessary. The suit had been filed in February
1998 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Herbst said the deal calls for $1.5 million to be paid to Robert
Raynoso, $355,000 to Juval Green and $20,000 to Caesar Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was killed on Feb. 4, 1999, when a late night encounter
led to four officers firing 41 shots at the unarmed African
immigrant, striking him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers involved in the Diallo case were cleared at
trail of criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Crane, an assistant corporation counsel for the city, said
he could not explain publicly why the city opted to settle with
Raynoso, Green and Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the police officers acted appropriately under
the circumstances,'' he said. ''But there were some extenuating
circumstances that prompted us to settle the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleged that the unarmed men were shot by two
plainclothes officers who fired numerous times from automatic
pistols, striking Raynoso once in the stomach, Green in the leg and
grazing Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the lawsuit alleged, the officers shouted at
the men to ''shut ... up or I'll shoot you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Raynoso and Green were both left handcuffed to their hospital
beds for three days as they recovered from the gunshot wounds, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Raynoso and Green were initially charged with criminal
possession of a weapon and menacing but the charges were later
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers, the lawsuit said, were never punished.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs had contended the shooting victims were
unconstitutionally subject to assault and battery, trespass, false
imprisonment, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   They had initially sought more than $100 million in damages.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Expected To End Bid  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The clock has run out on Bill Bradley's drive to
win the Democratic presidential nomination, and the former
professional basketball star and ex-senator was preparing to
announce he is passing the ball to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scheduled a news conference today near his New Jersey
campaign headquarters, and aides said he would endorse Gore, who
swept the 15 Democratic contests held earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers said Bradley plans to stay active in public life and is
not expected to rule out another presidential run. But they added
he has no interest in being vice president -- a position Gore was
unlikely to offer based on Bradley's failure to win any of the
primary contests held so far.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his underdog campaign 15 months ago at a
Newark, N.J., community center, and his hopes soared through much
of 1999 as he pitched his ideas for universal health insurance, an
assault on child poverty and strict gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   He walked picket lines, spoke of his commitment to race
relations and assailed Gore for past ambivalence on abortion.
Still, the Democratic Party's core constituencies -- organized
labor, minorities, and abortion-rights groups -- rallied around
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors working against Bradley included his distaste for
political hardball, his decision to challenge Gore in Iowa and
competition from Republican John McCain for independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Bradley declined to do more than jab at one Gore
soft spot, the Democratic Party's fund-raising excesses in 1996.
And when he did take the gloves off, using past votes in Congress
to paint Gore as a closet conservative, for example, the party
rushed to Gore's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, Bradley's biggest mistake may have been investing
time and resources in Iowa's leadoff caucus instead of continuing
to focus on New Hampshire, where he overtook Gore in polling for
the Feb. 1. primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain both were at a disadvantage in Iowa, having
voted in Congress against subsidies for ethanol. But while McCain
skipped Iowa to focus on New Hampshire, Bradley courted Iowans as a
belated convert to government support of the corn-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Gore attacked Bradley's central proposal --
universal health care -- at once calling it too expensive and not
expansive enough to help poor people afford full coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's own health became an issue Dec. 10, when he was
treated for atrial fibrillation, the most common type of heart
irregularity.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly held a news conference to proclaim, ''I'm feeling
great. No problem.'' But exit polls indicated that one in five New
Hampshire voters said they were concerned Bradley's health would
interfere with his ability to serve effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore beat Bradley in New Hampshire by 6,200 votes -- 50 percent
to 46 percent. But Bradley tried for weeks to spin Gore's narrow
victory as a partial success.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, won the Republican New Hampshire primary and
enjoyed the reformer's spotlight also sought by Bradley who, due to
a quirk in scheduling, endured a five-week stretch before the next
binding Democratic contests.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a tide-turning event, Bradley took the unusual
step of investing time and money in Washington state in hopes of
winning a nonbinding primary on Feb. 29. Bradley supporters back
East grumbled to reporters that he was frittering away precious
time better spent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lost the Washington state contest 68 percent to 31
percent, and followed with losses in New York, California and 13
other states in the Super Tuesday rout that ended his journey.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Voters Say It's the Economy  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- At the heart of Spain's election rhetoric
is a three-word boast: ''Espana va bien.'' It means Spain is in
good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, a conservative elected in 1996,
made the assertion early in his term as he claimed progress in
rescuing an economy with 23 percent unemployment and other woes.
Since then, he has repeated it often.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a catch phrase that echoes with varying degrees of
sincerity or sarcasm everywhere from radio talk shows to the
chambers of Parliament. And as Spain gears up for Sunday's national
elections, it is heard often.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, Aznar should be breathing easy. The economy
grew a robust 3.7 percent last year and during his term the jobless
rate has dropped sharply -- although at 15 percent it's still the
European Union's highest. Under Aznar, Spain also qualified as a
founding member of the European Union's single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old former tax inspector is the nation's top-rated
politician, albeit one sometimes seen as dull and uncharismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Polls give Aznar and his center-right Popular Party a slim lead
over the opposition Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   But winning with numbers like that would mean Aznar would lack a
majority in Parliament and would need to seek support from regional
nationalist parties, such as the Catalan party Convergence and
Union, as he did after the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can the government do its job well and still not sell its
product?'' mused Ramon Cotarelo, a political science professor at
Complutense University in Madrid. ''That's the $64,000 question.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that no matter how good Aznar's record is, for
historical reasons -- like 36 years of right-wing dictatorship under
Gen. Francisco Franco -- there's a limit to how much support a
center-right candidate can attract.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Spain, it is still a little shameful to openly say you
support the right wing,'' said historian Juan Pablo Fusi.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar is promising continued economic growth, more jobs, income
tax cuts, a balanced budget and higher pensions if he is
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist Party, trying to regain the power it held for
nearly 14 years until being defeated by Aznar, has allied with
Spain's third largest party, the communist-dominated United Left.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist candidate, 51-year-old Joaquin Almunia, charges
that the economic bonanza touted by Aznar has been lopsided in
favor of the rich and well-connected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Aznar government has played Robin Hood backwards,''
Almunia said. ''It has put a lot of power and money in just a few
hands, and this cannot remain so.''
</P>
<P>
   Job security also is an issue. Although Spain's economy created
nearly 700,000 jobs last year, almost a third were temporary
positions with contracts as short as a few months, government
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   And with the economy so hot, inflation is becoming a problem.
Last year it was nearly 3 percent, more than the average wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy may be strong, but in their day-to-day life people
do not notice any difference,'' Cotarelo said.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Call a Halt to Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain, battered in primaries this
week and facing yet another grim day Tuesday, has decided to call a
halt to his presidential campaign, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scheduled a news conference to announce his decision and
the only suspense was whether he would out of the race entirely, or
simply put his campaign on hold.
</P>
<P>
   He was not expected to endorse Rival George W. Bush at his news
conference. Advisors were still discussing tactics to keep the
themes McCain raised a part of the election debate.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing a Super Tuesday primary drubbing, McCain huddled
with senior strategists and major financial backers at his mountain
cabin here to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for strategists to conclude that soldiering
on made little sense, and within a few hours the campaign schedule
was scrapped. Campaign events in Colorado and Illinois were
canceled, and aides said McCain had no public events after today's
announcement. Two senior campaign aides confirmed that McCain was
halting his bid for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Most of McCain's senior aides have been urging him to withdraw,
saying Bush has built an almost impossible lead in the delegate
count. Any doubt of that was erased in this week's round of
primaries, aides argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point it becomes a math issue,'' said one aide.
</P>
<P>
   There are disagreements, however, about how to handle the exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some have urged McCain to launch a third-part bid, pointing to
his strength with independents in the primary season. Putting his
campaign on hold would keep that option in play, but McCain has
consistently ruled that out, arguing he's a ''loyal Reagan
Republican,'' and an aide said ''there's no change in that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign added a spark to a GOP contest that most had
expected Bush to dominate, and he rocked the campaign with upset
wins in New Hampshire and Michigan. Interest in the GOP fight was
high and voter turnout in some early contests soared.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made it clear that his bid to reshape the Republican
party will continue even if he leaves the race, and much of the
campaign discussion focused on how to gain leverage with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That explained the lack of a Bush endorsement and the refusal to
completely rule out a third party bid. Aides said McCain has
generated enthusiasm on the campaign trail, and wants to translate
that into changes in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't conceive of John jumping from the Republican Party,
but I certainly can conceive of John being pushed into it,'' said
political director John Weaver. Weaver has been among a minority
advocating McCain stepping away from the party to continue a run
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going to walk away from issues he cares about,''
Weaver said. ''He's going to continue fighting for that. There are
all kinds of avenues to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A key to McCain's plans will be Bush's reaction. Despite
defeating McCain soundly, Bush presumably would want to reach out
to independent voters who rallied to McCain's cause and that could
require some degree of accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaign has been bruising and there's been little
effort to seek middle ground so far, but political realities could
alter that.
</P>
<P>
   There were few options facing McCain after the latest round of
primaries. He stunned Bush with a landslide win in New Hampshire,
and rocked the campaign with a big win in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But he fared poorly in this week's giant round of primaries, and
Bush began to pile up a huge edge in delegates. Things only get
worse for McCain as next week includes Florida and Texas, both
states with governors named Bush and huge delegate totals.

<HEADLINE> Artist's Slaying Stuns Island  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) -- Amid the soothing ping
of yachts' masts, the discovery of the body of an American artist
along a scenic, boulder-strewn shore stunned this corner of
Caribbean paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Four foreigners -- all American visitors -- were arrested hours
after Lois Livingston McMillen, 34, of Middlebury, Conn., was
killed in mid-January. The four men were seen with her in the days
before her drowning death. They face murder charges and life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying shocked many of the 14,000 residents of Tortola, the
most populated of the British Virgin Islands' 40-odd islands and
keys. But available documents -- as well as interviews with police
and residents -- reveal little motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of thing never happens here,'' said Ben Bischmann,
24, a Chicago native who is a manager at Pusser's Soper's Hole, a
harborside pub. ''This is a place where you leave the keys in your
car and don't lock the doors. You hitchhike if you need a ride
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are Michael Spicer, 36, a law student from
Washington, D.C., and a longtime neighbor of McMillen's, and his
houseguests: Evan George, 22, a construction worker from
Washington; investment banker William Labrador, 36, of Southampton,
N.Y.; and Alexander Benedetto, 34, who works for a book publisher
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All deny the charges and deny being with McMillen the night she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   They are jailed at Her Majesty's Prison, a remote hilltop jail
with a panoramic view of palm-fringed shores. A preliminary inquiry
set for March 27 will determine whether the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really, really sad. I pray for her,'' said Sgt. Patrick
Harewood of the Royal British Islands Police Force as he looked at
a photo of the striking McMillen, gazing intently at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   She was remembered at a Feb. 12 Connecticut memorial as a
painter, philanthropist and ardent activist against domestic
violence. She came often to her family's Tortola villa. Spicer's
family owned a home up the hill and had known the McMillens for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   A pedestrian found McMillen's body Jan. 15 on the shore next to
the highway. She was fully clothed with ''what appeared to be blood
oozing from her ear,'' Chief Inspector Jacob George said in an
affidavit. Officers found ''female accessories strewn from the road
to the sea and some blood stains.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector surmised that she ''had been involved in a
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist determined she had not been sexually assaulted,
and her rental vehicle was found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Spicer said he and his friends saw McMillen the
night of Jan. 12 at Bomba's Surfside Shack, a popular bar on the
north coast, and that McMillen gave the four a ride home early Jan.
13. The night of Jan. 13, the four men and McMillen went out for
food and drinks at Pusser's. Labrador walked home, and McMillen
later drove the rest home, Spicer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the last time I saw Lois,'' Spicer said in a separate
statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen was last seen the evening of Jan. 14 at the waterfront
bar of the Jolly Roger Inn.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Spicer said he and his houseguests went to Quito's
Gazebo, a beach bar a half hour's drive from the Jolly Roger. They
took a cab home around 2:30 a.m., then watched a movie,
''Vertigo.'' Labrador told police he went with other friends to an
ATM machine, then decided to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after McMillen's body was discovered, police went to
Spicer's home. They left, then returned and seized clothing worn by
the men the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Spicer admitted to having been wearing a bloodstained
shirt. He was not able to account for the blood,'' said a statement
from Jacob George. It added that ''there was blood on one pair'' of
three pairs of wet, sandy shoes also seized.
</P>
<P>
   In another affidavit, Benedetto said he met McMillen in Tortola
in 1997 and began a relationship with her. ''The relationship ended
amicably after three months,'' said Benedetto.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto said he didn't see McMillen again until Jan. 12, at
Bomba's, where ''we spoke for about an hour and she told me that
she did not like Tortola anymore and that the natives were treating
her with aggression and meanness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Jan. 16 statement to police, Evan George said he was
unemployed and had a relationship with Spicer for 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Spicer and Evan George's attorney, Oscar Ramjeet, suggested that
forensic tests being conducted in Jamaica could benefit his
clients. Benedetto's attorney, Paul Dennis, declined comment.
Labrador's attorney, Gerard Ferrara, didn't return telephone
messages.

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Congress are headed for
an election-year showdown over whether the United States should
give China the same permanent trade benefits it grants most other
nations, with supporters seeking votes in both the House and Senate
before Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton formally sent the measure to Congress and
backers worked at bringing about a quick vote in the Senate,
opponents sought to rally their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are depicting the upcoming debate on China as one of
the biggest of the year, one complicated by election year politics.
</P>
<P>
   Citing concerns about China's record on human rights, worker
protections and the environment, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
declared in a ''Dear Colleague'' letter: ''People in this country
have real worries that this deal may hurt them more than it will
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that Clinton sent to Congress on Wednesday is
required under a market-opening agreement the Clinton
administration struck with China last year to allow Beijing to join
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based international
organization that oversees world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, China is the only major U.S. trading partner whose
normal trading status -- previously called most-favored nation --
must be renewed annually. The measure, which would end these annual
reviews, is being fought by labor and environmental groups. The
administration, business groups and most congressional Republicans
support the China trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic support is mixed, and is particularly weak in the
House, where labor is a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to pass the legislation ''as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And he reiterated that Congress will not be voting directly on
whether to admit China to the WTO, only on ''whether the United
States will share in the economic benefits of China joining the
WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote against extending permanent normal trade relations ''will
cost America jobs as our competitors in Europe, Asia and elsewhere
capture Chinese markets that we otherwise would have served.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that support is stronger in the Senate than in the
House, backers hoped to move it quickly toward the sympathetic
Senate Finance Committee and then to the Senate floor in hopes that
this would give it momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the game plan,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a chief
Senate advocate for increased trade with China. ''We're heartened
the president has sent up the legislation and has set in motion the
momentum for passage -- in both the House and the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Senate debates the measure first, it must delay a
final vote on the measure to observe a constitutional requirement
that trade measures involving tariffs originate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would assure China the same access to U.S. markets and
lowest-possible tariffs that are now viewed as routine with other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bill offers the most significant opportunity
for positive change in China since President Nixon's historic visit
three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can work to pull China in the right direction or we can
turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong
direction,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said earlier this
week that the administration's failure to launch a new round of
global trade negotiations in December in Seattle raised questions
about Clinton's commitment to free trade. He suggested Clinton
wasn't doing enough to promote the China trade package.
</P>
<P>
   But Baucus argued, ''The time is now, and the president is fully
engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is more contentious on Capitol Hill than on the
presidential campaign trail. Vice President Al Gore supports the
pact, as do both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore raised doubts about the administration's
commitment at AFL-CIO meetings in New Orleans last month. Labor
leaders said Gore promised them that if elected president, he would
renegotiate the China agreement to include protections for worker
rights and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Landlord sentenced to nearly two years in prison for cheating IRS  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Manhattan landlord of two tenants who
disappeared in 1997 has been sentenced to 23 months in prison for
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey handed Robert Rodriguez the
prison term on Wednesday, just days before Rodriguez's scheduled
sentencing in state court in a credit card and tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's arrest on those charges arose from the investigation
into the disappearance of his tenants Camden Sylvia, 36, and
Michael Sullivan, 54. They were last seen after an argument with
Rodriguez on Nov. 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has denied knowing anything about the couple's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosen, a lawyer for Rodriguez, asked Mukasey to be
lenient, saying his client would be forced to serve four years in
prison on the state charge after he completes his federal jail
term. He also noted that his client had pleaded guilty to the
entire indictment against him in both courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge was not persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mean to sound callous,'' Mukasey said, ''but ... I
don't give volume discounts generally. I think if you commit a
separate crime, you get a separate sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said little but did tell the judge, ''I agree with
everything my lawyer has said, and I do regret everything that's
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure you do,'' Mukasey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez pleaded guilty in federal court in October to personal
tax evasion, filing false corporate tax returns and hiding income
from his locksmith business.
</P>
<P>
   He also has pleaded guilty in state court to larceny, credit
card fraud and evading taxes on more than $1 million in income.

<HEADLINE> States' Plan for Tobacco Funds  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money from a $206 billion tobacco settlement
with states is earmarked to pay for an array of local health care
initiatives, from improving community care centers to spending more
on mental health programs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the National Conference on State Legislatures showed
that most state laws and proposals allocating the tobacco money are
focused on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one states are considering 140 bills that allocate the
money for indigent care programs, expanding insurance to poor
families, hospital charity care, children's health programs,
medical research and community health centers, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   States have also targeted tobacco settlement money for education
and childhood development programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a massive deal forged in 1998, big tobacco companies must
shell out $206 billion to 46 states over 25 years. Four remaining
states settled separately for an additional $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to compensate states for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses of people on Medicaid. Many states have
focused their settlement-funded smoking prevention programs on
children. Forty-four states have passed or are considering measures
aimed at preventing youths from smoking, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   But states are free to spend the money any way they wish,
creating an unprecedented opportunity to finance much-needed
programs, such as expanding insurance to people without coverage,
an issue of great concern to many state health officials.
</P>
<P>
   The survey looked at the money states would have available from
settlement payments made through April 15.
</P>
<P>
   It found that California, which is getting $991.8 million, has
proposed to expand health programs for poor families, improve
hospitals and trauma centers in low-income areas and conduct
biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which gets $126.5 million, has already passed
legislation to use the money to subsidize prescription drug costs
and pay for primary care to at-risk newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota wants to use $159 million of its $462 million for
medical student stipends. New Jersey proposed using $10 million of
its $300 million for mental health services in prisons.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Rattles South Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 5.6 shook southern Taiwan on Thursday, less than an hour after a
4.5-magnitude quake struck the central part of the island,
seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The larger quake's epicenter was about 12 miles north of
Chengkung, a coastal city about 180 miles south of the capital
Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of tremors and aftershocks have rattled Taiwan
since a 7.6-magnitude quake jolted the island on Sept. 21, killing
about 2,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   A magnitude-5 quake can cause significant damage in populated
areas.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Gunmen Parents Apologize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The parents of the two teen-age gunmen responsible
for the Columbine High School massacre expressed anguish and deep
regret in condolence letters aired Wednesday on ''Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Michalik, the mother of Columbine shooting survivor
Richard Castaldo, read letters she received from the parents of
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is with the deepest humility, that we write to express our
anguish over the events of Columbine,'' a letter signed by Sue and
Tom Klebold said. ''We never saw violence or hatred in Dylan until
the last moments of his life when we watched helplessly with the
rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Wayne and Kathy Harris said: ''There are no words
to express how much we regret the tragic events of that day. We
would have given our lives to prevent them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither family has spoken publicly since the April 20 shootings,
when the boys opened fire and killed 13 people before taking their
own lives. Both families sent condolence letters to victims'
families following the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Michalik said the letters were therapeutic for her son,
18-year-old Castaldo, who was hit eight times during the shootings,
leaving him paralyzed and in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Richard) was glad they acknowledged him, his pain,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that though the letters were a comfort, she did not
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say to them,'' Michalik said. ''I'm sorry
for what they're going through too. I know we've all suffered and
they're suffering too.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Dems Spar Over Fetal Tissue  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members are holding what is likely to be
a highly-charged hearing on whether illegal profits are being made
from fetal tissue for medical research after Democrats abandoned an
effort to exclude the public and media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats are trying to throw a cloak over these
proceedings,'' Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the
National Right to Life Committee complained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic aide acknowledged that members of his party, along
with some pro-abortion Republicans, wanted today's House Commerce
subcommittee hearing held behind closed doors, partly because of
concerns that militant abortion foes might retaliate against some
of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the effort
was dropped after Republicans provided assurances ''that the
testimony will not put researchers and clinics in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Research using fetal tissue is seen as among the best hopes for
finding new treatments for illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, AIDS and diabetes. But the ethics of using
fetal tissue for medical research have long been questioned by
abortion foes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schmidt, the Commerce Committee's Republican spokesman,
said: ''If the Democrats have now dropped their objections and
agreed they will have an open hearing, it is clearly because they
know the American people will be outraged. The American people have
a right to know what goes on behind the closed doors of a
congressional committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic-led lawmakers had maintained that a closed hearing
was in order because of House rules that allow a majority of
members to vote to close a committee if testimony may ''defame,
degrade or incriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   But both the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the
National Right to Life Committee issued statements Wednesday
accusing abortion rights advocates on the committee of trying to
prevent the public from learning about the trade in fetal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the witnesses on the committee list have been subpoenaed
by Congress -- pathologist Dr. Miles Jones and medical technician
Dean Alberty, both of Missouri. Aides said it was unclear whether
Jones would adhere to the subpoena and appear.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of fetal tissue research was scheduled to be
highlighted in an episode of ABC's ''20/20'' Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it is legal to use fetal tissue for research
as long as it is donated, not sold, by the woman. Reasonable
charges are allowed for companies that extract and transfer the
tissue to researchers. Today's hearing by the health and
environment subcommittee was to investigate concerns by
anti-abortion activists that some companies are charging exorbitant
prices to make a profit off fetal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, national president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said ''any wrongdoing, if it exists, needs
to be investigated and it needs to be dealt with accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress lifted a ban on federally funded research using fetal
tissue in 1993, but made it a felony to purchase or sell the tissue
for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents have also expressed concern that some clinics
may perform unsafe procedures on women if it means a better chance
of salvaging fetal tissue.

<HEADLINE> Indian Gambling Expansion Approved  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPINE, Calif. (AP) -- Peter Tony drives four hours to Laughlin,
Nev. to play $3 slot machines twice a month, but he won't have to
make the trek much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tony will take a half-hour drive from his home in San
Diego to the Viejas Casino and Turf Club, a faux stone-and-adobe
complex of buildings in the mountains 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to be in full swing here, why should I go to
Laughlin?'' asked the 64-year-old sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of money being wagered on people like Tony.
</P>
<P>
   The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians has hired veteran Nevada
gambling executives and prepared expansion plans to take advantage
of Proposition 1A, the initiative adopted by 65 percent of voters
Tuesday that allows Nevada-style games of chance on California
tribal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see us get a lot better,'' tribal chairman Anthony Pico
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling first moved west a decade ago as California Indian
tribes began operating quasi-slot machines that look like video
games and spit out slips of paper instead of coins.
</P>
<P>
   Such machines have limited appeal to gamblers. It's harder for
players to move quickly between games -- they have to wait for a
cashier to trade the receipt for cash -- and it's more difficult to
work several machines simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   It's also just not as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to hear the coins drop,'' said Tony, who was checking
out the Viejas Casino on Wednesday for future trips. ''A piece of
paper is just not as good.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the reality behind Proposition 1A, which allows tribes
to operate 45,000 Vegas-style slot machines. They now have about
19,000 of the video-style games.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego area, along with Palm Springs, is expected to be a
major center of Indian gambling because of its proximity to Los
Angeles and Orange County and its patchwork of tribes scattered
around the city's rural fringe. San Diego County already has three
major casinos, including Viejas -- and more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Rincon San Luiseno Band of Mission Indians has signed a
contract with Harrah's Entertainment Inc. to build a $100 million
hotel-casino. The Pala Band of Mission Indians reached a deal with
Anchor Gaming to build a $90 million casino. And the Campo band has
announced an arrangement with International Thunderbird Gaming
Corp. to build a casino east of Viejas.
</P>
<P>
   Viejas executives say they aren't worried. They opened a $16
million casino expansion in November and hope to begin installing
the real slot machines within months, said General Manager Andy
Asselin, who previously worked for the Hilton casino in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Viejas will also be expanding and reconfiguring its gambling
floor to accommodate more machines and card tables. The tribe will
have 2,000 slot and video machines, up from 1,132 now.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe is also diversifying its economy. Viejas operates an
outlet mall next to the casino with Nike, Gap and Tommy Hilfiger
outlets that is undergoing a $15 million expansion. Last year, they
announced plans to buy a local television station and run a
gambling cruise ship from San Diego to Rosarito, Mexico, in
partnership with Florida's Commodore Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Pico said the 300-member tribe may not be able to count on
gambling forever.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see gaming as a rock in a creek that we must step across,''
Pico said. ''And on the other side of that creek is economic
diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the economic progress comes at the cost of gambling
centers in Nevada remains to be seen. Pico suspects there will be
only a minor drop off in Las Vegas, but probably a substantial one
in Laughlin, where about 40 percent of wagers are made by Southern
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Another negative effect is seen by Proposition 1A opponents such
as former Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who said the huge expansion of Las
Vegas-backed casinos spells trouble for Californians with gambling
addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Several interviewed inside the darkened Viejas casino said they
would cut down on trips to smaller Nevada cities, but would still
go to Las Vegas for the lights and excitement. Concerns about
gambling elicited shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should know better than this,'' Ann Travers, a 78-year-old
retired bank manager said as she fed money into a video machine.
''But I've got to do something. I can't just sit at home and rot.''

<HEADLINE> INS-FBI Fingerprint Merger Outlined  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It will take five years and cost well over
$200 million to merge the fingerprint files of the FBI and
Immigration and Naturalization Service in a bid to avert a repeat
of the INS' release last year of a suspected ''railroad killer,''
the Justice Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the department to devise such a plan when it
enacted this year's budget. It was reacting to the case of a
Mexican drifter, Angel Maturino Resendiz, who used the alias Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Last June 2, he was picked up by Border Patrol agents for
illegal entry into the United States and sent back to Mexico.
Agents said they were unaware he was wanted by Houston police and
the FBI for questioning in connection with several murders along
rail lines.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered in El Paso, Texas, on July 13 after being put in
the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. Authorities wanted to question him
about nine killings along railroad lines in this country, including
four people whose bodies were found after his June 2 release. He
has been charged in seven of those murders.
</P>
<P>
   The department said Wednesday that it plans to put the INS
fingerprints on the FBI's computerized system and upgrade it so
that Border Patrol agents can check the records of the 1.5 million
illegal aliens they seize each year in two minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   When fully implemented after five years, the new system ''will
minimize the possibility that an apprehended or detained alien is
incorrectly released,'' the department outline said.
</P>
<P>
   But it cautioned that even this system will only be used for
aliens caught entering illegally or suspected of entering
illegally. The department said the system would not be used to
check ''the vast majority of aliens seeking entry to the United
States at a port of entry'' for criminal histories.
</P>
<P>
   The department said preliminary estimates for the hardware and
software exceed $200 million. ''In addition, INS-related
operational costs, which will cover additional space, staffing and
equipment, will cause the total to be substantially higher,'' the
department said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that three more studies will be launched before
completing the merger of the files. A criminality study will match
a sample of INS fingerprints against FBI criminal fingerprints to
estimate the percentage of captured illegal border crossers who
have been previously charged with more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   An engineering study will refine equipment design and costs. And
an operational study will design new border procedures and evaluate
the effect of lengthened response times on Border Patrol
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In another response to the same incident, Attorney General Janet
Reno told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday about 37
percent of the 35,000 criminal aliens released over the last five
years from INS custody went on to commit additional crimes. She did
not have a breakdown of how many were violent crimes and how many
were minor crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although this rate of recidivism is similar to non-alien
criminals who were recently released, I'm troubled by the
information and I want to address this very important problem,''
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said, ''This is
shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have got to recognize ... that the same rough fraction
holds true for those United States citizens that are released from
our jails,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers asked, ''Why were they (the aliens) not deported back to
their home country when their time was up here in jail?''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said a number of nations refuse to accept their nationals
back when the United States tries to deport them for criminal
activity.

<HEADLINE> Military Anti-Gay Activity Said Up  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-homosexual abuse in the armed services
has more than doubled in the past year, despite the addition by the
Pentagon of ''don't harass'' to its ''don't ask, don't tell''
policy, a lawyers group that defends gays in the military said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network reported 968 incidents,
including a murder, assaults and verbal gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   The group of lawyers, which annually has reported on military
harassment against gays for six years, says the problem is worse
than ever, with a record percentage of women discharged for being
gay last year in what it called a spate of ''lesbian baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said the services investigate all
allegations of harassment and officials do not believe it has
increased. While declining to comment specifically on a report
officers have not yet seen, spokesman Bryan Whitman pointed out
that discharges for homosexuality decreased last year by 10 percent
after several years of increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe there is growing anti-gay harassment in the
military,'' Whitman said. The military last year issued guidance to
ensure that ''everyone from the newest recruit to flag officers,
understands the policy and the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's inspector general is scheduled to issue a report
on implementation of the policy in all of the services later this
month. That report, based partly on a survey of military personnel,
also is intended to assess the level of anti-gay harassment in the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog legal defense group, in its 75-page report
''Conduct Unbecoming,'' says incidents in fiscal 1999 increased 142
percent from the previous year, which was double the year before
that.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes the July 5 murder of Pfc. Barry Winchell at
Fort Campbell, Ky. His mother and stepfather, Pat and Wally
Kutteles, are filing a wrongful death suit against the military in
her son's death. Their decision was announced by the legal defense
group in releasing the report.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and gay rights advocates earlier said the military's
policy failed to protect Winchell, who was rumored to be
homosexual. In December, a military jury sentenced Army Pvt. Calvin
N. Glover, 19, to life in prison for the slaying. Prosecutors said
he was driven by hatred of homosexuals to bludgeon Winchell to
death as he slept in his cot.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the servicemember
defense group, said the new report ''details the dramatic and
horrifying results of a bad policy made worse by failed
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Among incidents listed:
</P>
<P>
   -- Anti-gay graffiti mocking Winchell's murder at the base where
he served.
</P>
<P>
   -- An officer who used derogatory language in forwarding guidance
on harassment prevention.
</P>
<P>
   -- A ''witch-hunt'' of women at the Defense Language Institute at
Monterey, Calif., which targeted 12 Air Force women.
</P>
<P>
   In describing ''lesbian-baiting,'' the report says military
women are being accused of being lesbians for retaliatory reason,
sometimes for ''rebuffing men's sexual advances, regardless of
their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Pentagon statistics, the report notes that 31 percent of
the 1,034 service members discharged last year under the policy
were women -- the highest percentage in two decades -- while women
make up only 14 percent of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, speaking for the Pentagon, confirmed those statistics
but said officers follow the law and anti-harassment policies in
dealing with both men and women. He said the vast majority -- 83
percent -- of those discharged volunteered statements that they were
gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take every allegation seriously, and we investigate every
claim of harassment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' report documents 495 reports of harassment since
the Pentagon announced it was cracking down on anti-gay harassment
in August -- more than it listed for all of 1998. Military policy
now includes a prohibition on beginning an investigation of a
soldier simply because he or she has been subjected to anti-gay
harassment.

<HEADLINE> 6 Arrests in Tijuana Chief's Murder  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Six people who were working for drug
traffickers have been arrested in the killing of Tijuana's police
chief, Baja California's attorney general announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference late Wednesday, Attorney General Juan
Manuel Salazar Pimentel said the men admitted working for Vicente
Zambada Niebla, whom he identified as the son of drug trafficker
Mario Zambada from the northwestern state of Sinaloa, the
birthplace of many leading Mexican drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the men had killed 14 other people, including attorney
Rodolfo Gallardo, a former state judge who was shot to death along
with his wife, son and a local policeman on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said officials believe the traffickers wanted to create
confusion that would help them operate without interference, but he
said investigators were still investigating the motive.
</P>
<P>
   Zambada apparently had been trying to compete with the Arellano
Felix brothers, a notoriously violent drug gang based in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Alfredo de la Torre Marquez was fatally shot Feb.
27 while driving to his office. Investigators said gunmen fired 99
bullets at his car, killing him instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said police confiscated several automatic
rifles and other weapons from the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He identified them as Osvaldo Gonzalez; Jaime Ramon Alcala
Garcia; Carlos Gabriel Garcia; Juan Carlos Juarez Rivas; Rene
Alejandro Moreno Sanchez, and Juan Manuel Murillo Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the federal government's Notimex news agency quoted
Baja California Gov. Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer as saying the six
were involved in an auto theft ring that operated both in Baja
California and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said other victims included physician Sergio Guillermo
Perez, attorney Joaquin Baez Lugo, state policeman Pedro Vazquez
and Jesus Arainza Sanchez, identified as a member of a rival drug
operation.

<HEADLINE> Patriot Movement Leader Acquitted  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- After failing to convict Patriot Movement
leader James ''Bo'' Gritz of attempting to kidnap a 12-year-old
involved in a custody dispute, prosecutors are turning their
attention to the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wiegand is a fugitive, accused of trying to hire the
former Green Beret Colonel to take her son from her former husband.
If caught, she will be prosecuted on custodial interference charges
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Linda is the fourth conspirator in this case,'' Assistant
State's Attorney John Malone said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other three are Gritz, his son James and Sheldon Robinson of
McKinney, Texas, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 61, and Robinson were acquitted Wednesday on charges
including conspiracy, attempted second-degree kidnapping and
attempted custodial interference. Gritz also was acquitted of
loitering on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would decide later whether to continue
their case against Gritz's son.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand, who has accused her former husband of sexually abusing
her children, called the Associated Press after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear for the lives of my children,'' Wiegand said. ''I want
to know who is going to protect my children.''
</P>
<P>
   After his acquittal, Gritz saluted the jury and promised to keep
attention on Wiegand's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole trial has been about Linda Wiegand,'' Gritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz and son were arrested Sept. 30, 1996, in the parking lot
of the McAlister Middle School, where Wiegand's son was a student.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Gritz planned to snatch the 12-year-old from
his school and reunite him with Wiegand. Authorities said Robinson
flew the Gritzes to Connecticut in his single-engine plane, rented
hotel rooms and paid for a meal with his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gritz and Robinson said the men were simply checking
Wiegand's claims. Gritz said he was thinking of doing something
''confrontational'' to bring attention to Wiegand's case, but said
he never plotted a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had acknowledged that much of the evidence against
Gritz (rhymes with ''fights'') was circumstantial. The Gritzes had
pictures of the boy and Wiegand's 10-year-old son from another
relationship, two-way radios and other items in the car, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand first accused her ex-husband of sexually assaulting the
children in Vermont during the couple's divorce in 1994. Charges
were dropped. An 18-month investigation in Connecticut also found
insufficient evidence to support Wiegand's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegand went on the run with the children for two years. She was
arrested in Las Vegas in 1996 but has since disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Gritz served as a negotiator in the FBI siege of separatist
Randy Weaver and his family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He also
briefly was a mediator in the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996. In
1998, he attempted to locate alleged abortion clinic bomber Eric
Rudolph in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for president in 1992 and is a leader of the so-called
Patriot Movement, which rails against a United Nations-led ''New
World Order'' and accuses the government of corruption and
violence.

<HEADLINE> Ga. County Growing Fast  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not sunny California, but for 10,280
people, Forsyth County, Ga., will do just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many new people moved into the Georgia county about
30 miles north of Atlanta between July 1, 1998, and July 1999,
according to Census Bureau estimates being released today.
Forsyth's population increased 11.9 percent over that period to
96,689, making it one of the fastest-growing counties in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The total is far below the 9.3 million population of Los Angeles
County, the nation's largest. But for folks like Judy Havenhill,
who moved from Texas into a development near the Forsyth County
seat of Cumming three years ago, it's the lack of a big-city
atmosphere that's making more people call it home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really like it. It's all the trees -- we don't have too many
trees in Texas,'' Havenhill said. ''Where we live is very rural,
our main entrance comes by a field of cows and horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth was the fastest-growing county last year. Technically,
it didn't top the list this year, coming in second behind Sussex
County, Va., which had a 22.8 percent population jump to 12,345.
But the increase in Sussex was due to the opening of two state
prisons since May 1998, with a combined inmate population of over
2,400.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said Sussex County? It's usually some place outside of
Denver or Atlanta,'' Census Bureau analyst Sam Davis. ''When you
see something like that, you say something's wrong. And those new
prisons are the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sussex and Forsyth, the next three fastest growing
counties were Douglas County, Colo., up 10.9 percent to 156,860;
Loudon County, Va., up 8.1 percent to 156,284, and Henry County,
Ga., also up 8.1 percent, to 113,443.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 13 of the top 20 fastest-growing counties were in the
South, and six were in the West, following earlier Census Bureau
forecasts of those regions being areas of high growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fast-growing counties in the decade are considered to be
suburban counties, or are adjacent to urban areas,'' Census Bureau
analyst Marc Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interesting thing with Atlanta is that in many of the
suburban counties that are gaining residents, they are not moving
there from Atlanta itself, but from elsewhere in the country. It's
suburbanization, but not from within Atlanta itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The county with the biggest percentage population decline was
Kalawao County, located in a a remote area on the Hawaiian island
of Molokai. Kalawao, which was the site of a 19th century leper
colony, lost nine of its 67 residents, or 13.4 percent, between
July 1998 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major counties -- classified by the Census Bureau as those
with populations over 10,000 -- Grand Forks County, N.D., lost the
most, declining 3.2 percent to 64,674. It was followed by Curry
County, N.M., down 2.9 percent to 43,570; Beadle County, S.D., also
down 2.9 percent to 16,637; Pulaski County, Mo., down 2.8 percent
to 38,230; and Lawrence County, S.D., down 2.1 percent to 21,369.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Grand Forks came mostly as a consequence of the
massive flood of 1997 that gutted 11 buildings in the city of Grand
Forks, said Richard Rathge, a professor at North Dakota State
University and director of the state's census data center.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates being released by the Census Bureau include:
</P>
<P>
   --Los Angeles County led all counties in net international
migration, with 91,745 immigrants pouring into the southern
California county between 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --Maricopa County, Ariz., which encompasses the cities of Phoenix
and Tempe, led all counties in net domestic migration, with 43,163
moving into Maricopa from other U.S. addresses.
</P>
<P>
   --The median age of the U.S. residents went up from 32.8 in April
1990, the date of the last official census count, to 35.5 in 1999.
Utah residents were the youngest, with a median age of 26.7 in
1999, and West Virginia residents were oldest, with a median age of
38.9.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche, Dresdner Banks To Merge  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Ending days of speculation, the
world's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, announced plans Thursday to
get even bigger by merging with rival Dresdner Bank, creating a
German powerhouse with more than $1.2 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would create an institution that would rival the
planned merger involving Japanese giants Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji
Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan. Those companies agreed in
August to combine by 2005 to create a bank with roughly $1.3
trillion in assets at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   While the German banks called their deal a ''merger of equals''
in a statement, Deutsche Bank will be the dominant partner, holding
between 60 percent and 64 percent of the combined banks. Dresdner
will hold the rest. The two banks also plan to spin off their
retail unit in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to be completed by July 1 and save the
company $2.8 billion by wiping out overlapping operations.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's chief executive Rolf Breuer and Dresdner's
Bernhard Walter will be co-chief executive officers of the new
bank, which will retain the name Deutsche Bank AG while adopting
Dresdner Bank's green corporate color over Deutsche's blue.
</P>
<P>
   The new, combined German bank would focus on investment banking
and asset management, areas traditionally dominated by U.S.
investment houses. At the same time, a merged entity would free the
banks from their unprofitable retail services. The banks are
expected to close branches and emphasize electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
   The retail activities of both institutions will be merged into
Deutsche Bank 24, which will go public within the next three years.
The Munich-based insurance giant and holding company Allianz AG
will take a minority stake in the retail bank and will also take
control over Deutsche Bank's insurance activities.
</P>
<P>
   A deal must still pass final approval by each company's
supervisory board. Deutsche Bank supervisory board member Gerhard
Renner said the boards would meet again Tuesday. The banks planned
a joint press conference later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is the world's largest in terms of assets, with
$840 billion, and Dresdner Bank is Germany's No. 3 money lender.
But joining the ranks of their American rivals means a big break
with a German tradition of banking for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche and Dresdner banks control just 10 percent of Germany's
market, where private citizens tend to favor local and regional
banks for personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Streamlining those services could entail closing a third of
their combined 3,800 branches and laying off 10 percent of the
combined companies 146,000 employees, Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up in German banking was made possible in part by
Allianz, which holds major stakes in each bank. It will increase
its stake in the spun-off retail services in several stages.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Allianz to exploit the spun-off unit, to be
called Bank 24, as a channel to sell investment and insurance
services to nearly 10 million customers.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Ambushes Firemen in Tenn.  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Firefighters responding to a house fire
Wednesday were ambushed by an off-duty Memphis firefighter who
stepped out of the garage and began shooting, authorities said. Two
firefighters and a sheriff's deputy were killed, and a woman was
found dead in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected gunman, Fred Williams, was wounded and was in
critical condition early Thursday after undergoing surgery, Police
Director Walter E. Crews said. A bystander also was wounded, but
not seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had just returned to work as a firefighter this week
after an extended leave on disability, Crews said. The suspect did
not work at the same station as the men who were killed, but J.C.
Fleming, deputy director of the fire department, said they probably
knew each other from working the same shift.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't expect this. We're here to fight fires,'' Fire Chief
H.J. Pickett said. ''You want to say it's part of the job, but it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not live in the house, and his relationship to the
victim in the garage was unclear, Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site early today, The Commercial Appeal newspaper
reported that the woman was Stacey Williams, the suspect's new
wife. Citing police records, the newspaper also reported that
Williams had been arrested in October following a domestic
disturbance involving the two.
</P>
<P>
   A court date on the case had been set for March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were called to the home just before 1 p.m. When
they arrived, witnesses said, a man came out of the garage firing a
shotgun and shouting, ''Get away! Get away!''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters Lt. Javier Lerma and Pvt. William Blakemore were
killed. Sheriff's Deputy Rupert Peete was shot in his patrol car as
he responded to the report of the shooting, authorities said. His
car crashed through a fence and ended up next to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis police officers then arrived and tried to get the gunman
to put down his weapon. When he refused, ''one of our officers got
into a gun battle and the suspect was shot,'' Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of firemen clutched each other in a tight embrace and
wept after the fire was put out. Another fireman solemnly placed
his helmet on top of the body bag of one of his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred in a neighborhood of mostly one-story
brick houses and well-kept yards at the edge of the city. A golf
course is a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Before firefighters arrived, neighbors reported seeing smoke

   ''It's a tragic thing for the city and for the families. The

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen Thursday amid
market caution over central bank efforts to curb the Japanese
currency's rise. Tokyo stocks closed lower.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.82 yen, down 0.26 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 107.04 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 104.47 points,
or 0.53 percent, to close at 19,662.33. On Wednesday, the average
closed down 177.44 points, or 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar fell on selling by U.S.
investors, but lingering concerns about more intervention by the
Bank of Japan kept it from dropping further, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's central bank sold yen and bought an estimated $1 billion
to $3 billion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders said Thursday that there were rumors that the
central bank also bought the euro the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Zembei Mizoguchi, the director-general of the international
bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance, hinted Thursday at further
intervention to boost the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are watching the foreign exchange markets closely, and will
take appropriate measures as needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger yen could hurt the nation's big exporters by making
their products less cost-competitive abroad and by lowering the
value of their repatriated earning.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.80 yen, up from
102.62 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, share prices rose moderately in the morning
on the back of Wall Street's gains, but then fell, led by sales of
Sony Corp. stock, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors in Tokyo were cautious on the last
trading day before the expiration of March futures and options
contracts, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.50 to
close at 9,856.53. The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index
closed at 4,897.26, up 49.42.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 17.37 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,643.77.
The TOPIX closed down 4.39 points, or 0.26 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7550 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7400 percent. Its
price fell 0.13 points to 100.38.

<HEADLINE> Advisory Commission Blasts IMF  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 182-nation International Monetary Fund,
which was widely criticized for its handling of the 1997-98 global
currency crisis, needs to be drastically reformed, a blue ribbon
advisory commission is telling Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The International Financial Institution Advisory Commission
issued a 124-page report on Wednesday, recommending a radical
overhaul of the IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the IMF should limit future activities to
providing short-term emergency loans to tide countries over during
times of financial crisis. It said the World Bank should scrap most
of its current loan activities in favor of supplying grants to the
world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are already sparking a lively debate in
Congress even before the panel members were to appear today before
a Senate Banking Committee to defend their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House praised the panel's
recommendations when they were formally released on Wednesday but
Democrats accused the group of engaging in a reckless
''slash-and-burn'' attack on the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, composed of six members appointed by Republican
congressional leaders and five by Democratic leaders, was created
as part of 1998 legislation that boosted U.S. support for the IMF
by $18 billion to replenish resources strained by the Asian
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which split 8-3 on its recommendations, concluded
that both the IMF and the World Bank are wasting billions of
dollars in loans to countries that have access to lending by
private commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that the IMF restrict its future loans to
providing short-term emergency funding to countries facing
financial crises and get out of the business of supplying long-term
development loans.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the World Bank should eventually halt 75 percent
of the loans it is now making to countries such as China that can
raise capital from commercial banks. Instead, it should be renamed
the World Development Agency and refocus its efforts to supplying
grants instead of loans to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, both praised the group for recommending radical
changes in the two agencies, which have long been criticized by
conservatives for wasting taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., however, called the
recommendations ''an extreme, neo-isolationist attitude toward key
institutions. ... Instead of proposing thoughtful reform, the
report takes a slash-and-burn approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., accused the group of
adopting a ''reckless'' approach to the two institutions that would
''likely increase, not decrease, world poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp division in views extended to the panel itself. All
six commission members appointed by Republicans supported the final
report along with two Democratic appointees, Jeffrey Sachs, a
Harvard University economist, and Richard Huber, the former
chairman of insurance giant Aetna Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the report were the other three Democratic
appointees: C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington; former Rep. Esteban Torres,
D-Calif., and Jerome Levinson, a former Agency for International
Development official.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten, speaking at an acrimonious news conference on
Wednesday where both sides traded charges, said he and others
dissented because the majority views, if adopted, would ''totally
gut the role of the IMF as a defender of international financial
stability.''

<HEADLINE> Jet Crashes at Moscow Airport  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A passenger jetliner crashed Thursday while taking
off from Moscow's main airport, killing all nine people aboard,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Emergency Situations said there were five crew
members and four passengers aboard the Yak-40 aircraft when it
crashed. There were no survivors, said ministry spokeswoman Marina
Ryklina.
</P>
<P>
   The Yak-40 aircraft, a medium range Soviet-era passenger jet
that carries 20-30 passengers, was on a charter flight from Moscow
to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane rose briefly into the air and then plunged down,
officials said. There was no indication what caused the crash, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was closed immediately after the crash and incoming
planes were diverted to other airports.

<HEADLINE> Father of serial killer pleads for son's life to be spared  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The father of serial killer Michael
Ross took the stand in his son's death penalty hearing, asking that
the killer's life be spared so he can benefit society by serving as
a ''guinea pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ross said his son is smart and articulate and has the
ability to contribute to society from prison. Michael Ross, 40, a
former Jewett City insurance salesman, graduated from Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it would be a mistake to execute Michael Ross,'' Dan
Ross said Wednesday. ''He is a biological specimen -- a person who
you can get valuable information from. In effect, he could be a
guinea pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ross was convicted of killing Wendy Baribeault, 17,
April Brunais, 14, Leslie Shelley, 14, and Robyn Stavinsky, 19, in
eastern Connecticut in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court threw out his original death sentence in
1994 and ordered a new hearing to determine if Ross should instead
get life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' aunt, Ann L. Rich of Trumbull, testified Wednesday about
the close relationship she has developed with her nephew since his
incarceration in 1984. She also asked that he be spared the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ross tried to explain to the jury what it's like being the
father of a serial killer. He said his son appeared to have a
normal childhood but bore the brunt of his mother's wrath when she
would lose her patience. The couple divorced in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ross would tell Michael, her oldest son, that she hated
him and that she never wanted him, Dan Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he can empathize with people-- much like his
mother,'' Dan Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Karen Goodrow asked Dan Ross if he had any
insight into how a young boy who grew up working on the family
poultry farm in Brooklyn, Conn. turned into a serial killer. Dan
Ross is the only family member who still lives in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' Dan Ross said. ''I will admit he had maybe a
less-than-perfect upbringing, but you cannot set out to make a
Michael Ross. I think there's something wrong there ... What he did
was not normal. I don't believe you can set out to deliberately
make a Michael Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ross also said he would like the ordeal that began 16 years
ago when his son was arrested should come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   If he were sentenced to death ''in a way, it would all be over,
but it would never be over,'' Dan Ross said. ''There'd be no
continuing publicity after this trial. It pretty much would be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ross said he has not visited his son in two years, but talks
with him once a week when he calls collect from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, defense attorneys Goodrow and Barry Butler
introduced a videotape of an interview Ross gave to a BBC
broadcaster in the mid 1990s. The defense last week objected when
prosecutors tried to show portions of the tape to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, Ross laughs often as he describes his crimes and
talks about his trial in 1987, the detective to whom he confessed,
and his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two corrections officers also testified, describing Ross as a
smart, respectful inmate who never gives prison officials any
trouble.

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Ending days of speculation, the world's largest
bank, Deutsche Bank, announced plans Thursday to get even bigger by merging with
rival Dresdner Bank, creating a German powerhouse with more than $1.2 trillion
in assets. The deal would create an institution that would rival the planned
merger involving Japanese giants Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the
Industrial Bank of Japan. Those companies agreed in August to combine by 2005 to
create a bank with roughly $1.3 trillion in assets at current exchange rates.

   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his presidential campaign
Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a stranglehold on the Republican
nomination after Super Tuesday voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe Al Gore
as he scripted his Thursday exit from the presidential campaign. McCain was not
expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear whether the Arizona senator would
end his campaign entirely, or simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his
options. At least one senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider
launching a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Anti-gay billboards (dis)appear on Staten Island  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As suddenly as they appeared, a pair of anti-gay
billboards mysteriously disappeared from two Staten Island
locations -- and it was only later that details about the
controversial ads emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the billboards, PNE Media of Union, N.J., announced
Wednesday that it had removed the anti-gay Biblical translations
after determining they were ''inadvertently posted.''
</P>
<P>
   The company requires that its billboards contain the name of the
advertiser; the anti-gay ads did not mention Keyword Ministries,
which paid for the space.
</P>
<P>
   But the ads' removal came only after Borough President Guy
Molinari and others condemned its message as hateful and divisive,
and five days after they first went up.
</P>
<P>
   The boards quoted a Biblical passage reading, ''Thou shall not
lie with mankind as with womankind: It is abomination.'' One
billboard was replaced, rather quietly, by a Smokey the Bear ad;
the second was covered over in white.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards went up last Friday in the city's smallest
borough.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Kristopher Okwedy, pastor of the Keyword
Ministries, said he believed he had been improperly censored and
would have put his name on the billboards had he been asked to by
PNE Media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I paid money and did not violate any city laws,'' he said.
Okwedy said he paid $1,800 to post the two signs for one month, The
New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said the message delivered on the 8-foot-by-16-foot
billboards was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''People may be expressing their religious beliefs, but they
don't understand that these messages fan the fires of prejudice and
hatred,'' Molinari said. ''I'm terribly distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Staten Island gay groups echoed the borough president's
complaint about the board.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just so cowardly to take a position and not sign your
name,'' said Charles W. Keeler III, president of Integrity/Staten
Island. Keeler's group is a gay ministry within the Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari promised Wednesday morning to investigate the origin of
the signs. But by noon, one of the two signs had already been
replaced with the Smokey the Bear ad and the second was also
covered up.
</P>
<P>
   The flap was reminiscent of a case last year when city officials
forced a Queens man to remove a billboard carrying an
anti-immigration message. In that case, it was determined the
billboard did not have a proper permit.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said the borough's anti-bias task force was
investigating whether the Staten Island billboards were legal, but
the ads were taken down before they had uncovered any answers.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Census May Need More Workers  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A shortage of qualified applicants to fill
jobs for temporary census positions in urban areas could endanger
the accuracy of this year's count, House Republicans charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau may be overly optimistic in claiming it is
ahead of schedule nationally in attracting qualified applicants for
860,000 part-time positions, said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman
of the House Government Reform Committee's census subcommittee.
Miller said severe hiring problems exist in cities like San Diego,
Los Angeles and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At a subcommittee hearing Wednesday, Census Bureau director
Kenneth Prewitt said that as of March 1, there were 1.8 million
qualified applicants nationally, or 74 percent of those needed,
ahead of a goal of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hiring continues to progress well,'' Prewitt said. ''Being
able to staff census operations is not keeping me awake at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately Wednesday, a report obtained by The Associated Press
detailing the progress of job recruiting in each of the Census
Bureau's 520 local offices revealed many sites were far below the
bureau's national goals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, as of late February among offices
behind in recruiting applicants were the Tampa, Fla., office, at 19
percent; one Chicago office, at 17 percent, and one in Baltimore at
26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost said there was a danger in
over-analyzing the report at this stage because ''it does not
reflect actual work force requirements in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ''We all know hiring is so critical to a successful
census. You note that nationally hiring is going ahead of schedule.
However, when one looks at the hiring locally, a different picture
emerges.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the bureau has enough people now to perform census
operations smoothly, and was confident there would be enough
applicants to fill future openings.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several months, the temporary workers will go out
to survey homes that do not return census forms. Most of the
country's 115 million households should have a questionnaire by the
end of the month, with the first batch now being delivered to rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time employees will also be used to survey
hard-to-count populations, such as the homeless and those living on
Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates about 1.4 percent of the population
was undercounted in 1990, many of them minorities and inner-city
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also criticized Prewitt for what he termed another
''public relations problem'' with a Census mailing sent out in
recent weeks saying forms were on the way and including
instructions for requesting one in a language other than English.
</P>
<P>
   The front of a one-page letter in the mailing is in English,
while the back of the letter has five paragraphs each written in
five other languages, but not in English. A return envelope is
enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has received 200 phone calls or e-mails at its
national office, mostly from English-speakers confused by the back
of the letter and the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a public relations embarrassment. I regret it, but if I
really believed it was going to affect the census, I would be doing
something, and I don't think it is,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, census officials said a printing error caused an
extra digit to be printed before street addresses on the same
mailings. For instance, ''10 Main Street'' instead read ''110 Main
Street.''

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Crops Wiped Out  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAQUALANE, Mozambique (AP) -- Aid agencies were making headway
in their war against hunger among Mozambique's flood victims but
faced another battle: getting them on their feet again.
</P>
<P>
   The floods that peaked on Feb. 27 wiped out an estimated 370,500
acres of staple food crops and dealt ''severe losses'' to one-third
of the national cereal production, the U.N. Food and Agricultural
Organization said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   That means hundreds of thousands of subsistence farmers must be
fed until the next harvest in six months -- if seeds arrive in time
for planting season, which starts in April, Brenda Barton of the
U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than 100 tons of food per day to feed those whose
livelihoods were destroyed by the floods. Roughly that amount was
delivered Wednesday to Mozambicans along the flooded Limpopo
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the aid was delivered to the Chaqualane camp for flood
victims in southern Mozambique -- the country's largest with more
than 45,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can keep up the deliveries like we have today, then
we're in good shape,'' Barton said as she weaved through a crowd of
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   Some had bundles of wood balanced on their heads for fires,
whose smoke drifted through the trees. Kids played soccer with a
bundle of tied-up rags for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the men glumly conferred among themselves. Most men in
Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, are subsistence
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   One was Mbiza, a wiry 67-year-old dressed in a tattered shirt
and soiled pants. He was worried he wouldn't have seeds in time for
next month's planting season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost everything to the water,'' Mbiza said. ''Even my seeds
are lost. How can I go on without those?''
</P>
<P>
   Other men who gathered around nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation came as this former Portuguese colony in
southeast Africa was getting back on its feet after a civil war
that ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mozambique had a crop surplus for the first time, and
repeated it in 1999, the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization
said. Now, hundreds of thousands of farmers must start all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said that unless seeds are provided to the farmers by the
world community, those left destitute by the floods will have to be
fed beyond the six months currently planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need these people to start feeding themselves again,''
Barton said.

<HEADLINE> Critics: Schools Need Newer Books  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the books on the shelves of the
nation's public school libraries predate the 1969 moon landing, the
end of the Vietnam War and the breakup of the Soviet Union,
according to critics who say schools need help in offering students
newer, more-relevant works.
</P>
<P>
   And more importantly, says one lawmaker seeking federal funding,
the outdated books often don't reflect the diversity of today's
schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students continually encounter books from a period when
authors viewed the world from only a white perspective,'' said Sen.
Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who argues that Congress can and
should help school libraries update their materials.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years, Reed said, school library funding has plummeted.
The average pricetag of a new library book is $16, but schools can
only spend about $6 or $7 per book. The bulk of books on shelves
were published in the mid- to late 1960s -- the last time libraries
were substantially funded by federal dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves children with books such as ''Colonial Life in
America,'' a 1962 picture book found on the shelf of a Philadelphia
school library, Reed said Reed while displaying the book Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large plantation was like a village. Slaves had their own
cabins,'' the book reads, painting a picture of slave life as
idyllic as its brightly colored illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Another book, a 1968 offering recently taken from a Rhode Island
school library, offered basic facts about the Middle East -- based
on 1966 data.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's proposal, which is unlikely to win support from a
Republican majority that prefers to give states wide latitude in
how they spend federal education funds, comes as parents are more
closely scrutinizing their children's reading texts.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a novel for middle schoolers published by Scholastic
Inc. angered Muslim parents with its plot about a terrorist bombing
by a Muslim girl unhappy with a forced betrothal.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of high tech, the printed word not only offers
offensive stereotypes, but outdated facts from encyclopedias and
dictionaries. Reed noted that one text told students of the new
science discovery, penicillin, an antibiotic that dates to 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools and local districts decide how much money goes for
library books -- with budgets ranging from $300 to $ 30,000. Federal
programs no longer specifically require spending on books.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when schools face funding shortages,'' Reed said,
''library budgets are unfortunately the first to be cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology, however, has also lifted the burden of the constant
need for funding that libraries have faced in the past, said Patty
Likens, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Education,
where local districts set funding levels for books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students are going on the Internet for their assignments as
opposed to going to the library to check out a book,'' she said.
''School libraries are changing so much, it's not just an issue of
books, it's an issue of technology. A lot of schools are looking to
upgrade their technology first.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Accuses Reno on Espionage Probe  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government investigation of alleged
Chinese nuclear spying at Los Alamos National Laboratory was
''inept'' and ''incredibly lax,'' a report from a Republican
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP colleague immediately criticized the report from Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa. Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley said
Specter's report ignored key evidence, while Specter vowed to
''raise some hell'' with Grassley.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's Wednesday report faulted Attorney General Janet Reno
for rejecting the FBI's 1997 request to bug the home and office of
Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos scientist charged last year with
mishandling U.S. nuclear weapons secrets. The report said Reno's
refusal hampered the investigation of Lee and allowed him to
continue to transfer secret nuclear weapons data to his home
computer and portable data tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to comprehend how officials entrusted with the
responsibility for protecting our national security could have
failed to discover what was really happening with Dr. Lee, given
all the indicators that were present,'' Specter's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired a year ago and indicted in December on 59 felony
counts of mishandling classified information at the New Mexico
weapons lab. He has pleaded innocent. The indictment does not
accuse Lee of giving secrets to China or any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, a fellow member of the Senate Judiciary Committee task
force on the issue, disagreed with Specter. In a letter to Specter,
Grassley noted that no other task force member signed on to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned about the content of the report and its failure
to reflect the full record, and about the haste of issuing the
report despite an incomplete investigation,'' Grassley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Specter defended his report and said he was drafting a memo to
''raise some hell'' with Grassley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's wrong, that's all,'' Specter said of Grassley.
</P>
<P>
   The schism could damage GOP efforts to use Chinese espionage as
an election-year issue against Democrats, but Specter said
Grassley's letter ''shows it's not partisan, when you have
Republicans who are willing to look at both sides of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic colleague, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
said he agreed with most of Specter's conclusions, including the
criticism of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inexplicable and will always remain a mystery to me''
why the warrant application was denied, Torricelli said. ''If there
was damage to national security, we will never know if the granting
of that application would have prevented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the task force, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said Reno was correct in not approving the warrant application
because there was insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told the Senate panel last June that there was not enough
evidence at the time to support wiretapping Lee, noting that the
Taiwan-born scientist was once investigated and cleared for alleged
improper contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Specter released the report to gather support for a bill he
wrote to change the way the Justice Department handles warrant
applications in espionage investigations. Grassley and Torricelli
are co-sponsors of that measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the attorney general to personally decide
on warrant applications if the FBI or CIA directors or the defense
or state secretaries ask for it.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Town Marks Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUON MA THUOT, Vietnam (AP) -- The central highlands town of Buon
Ma Thuot geared up today for its biggest event in a quarter-century
with a dress rehearsal for a rare military parade to mark its place
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of uniformed soldiers marched around the main traffic
circle, where an old Soviet tank looms as a mute reminder of the
battle for the town that marked the beginning of the end of the
Vietnam War. On a bright, sunny day, viewing stands stood empty for
the 1,000 invited guests that are expected Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Communist forces took lightly defended Buon Ma Thuot in just a
few hours on March 10, 1975, the first major victory in a final
push that surprised even them with its efficiency and speed.
</P>
<P>
   In just over seven weeks, they would capture Saigon, the capital
of U.S.-backed South Vietnam, and reunite the divided country,
ending a bloody conflict that killed 58,000 American troops and 3
million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The large scale of events in Buon Ma Thuot shows the importance
that the government is placing on commemorations for a war that it
often says it wants to put into the past.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains clear that Vietnam, while not seeking a formal
apology from the United States or other countries that fought
against the communists, would welcome aid, investment or
reparations. With annual per capita gross domestic product of only
$370, Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way with Washington on setting up joint
research into the long-term effects of toxic defoliants like Agent
Orange that were sprayed to eliminate cover for Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese forces, and which have been blamed for high rates of
ailments among those exposed and birth defects in their children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after relations were normalized, the two
countries also are trying to negotiate a trade agreement and other
pacts.
</P>
<P>
   Buon Ma Thuot and surrounding Daklak province have undergone a
transformation since the end of the war. Thousands of members of
ethnic minorities, sparked by ''coffee fever,'' have moved from
other parts of the country to set up plantations for the country's
biggest export after rice.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby airport, the site of serious fighting for a week
after Buon Ma Thuot fell, now is surrounded by swaths of the plants
in the area's red earth.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the parade Friday that also will include groups of
farmers, youths and women, Buon Ma Thuot has made the traditional
slaughter of a water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The military parade will be a rare occurrence in Vietnam. The
biggest in recent memory was for the 20th anniversary of the
capture of Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Next up on the list of historical dates is the fall of the
imperial capital of Hue on March 26, followed by the capture of
Danang, Vietnam's third-largest city, three days later.
</P>
<P>
   The military's normally low profile will be particularly high
next week when William Cohen makes the first visit by a U.S.
defense secretary since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Along with meeting top civilian and military officials to pave
the way for the first military cooperation between the two
countries -- largely in search-and-rescue operations and clearance
of land mines -- Cohen will visit an excavation site that is part of
the effort to recover the remains of the 1,500 Americans still
listed as missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials continue to make the MIA issue the central focus
of their relations with Vietnam, and have praised the cooperation
they have received.

<HEADLINE> House Challenging Gun Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A national gun buyback program championed by
President Clinton is at risk of losing its funding as lawmakers
begin work on an emergency bill to pay for U.S. troops in Kosovo
and combatting drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $9 billion bill, Republicans on the House
Appropriations Committee want to rescind $700,000 that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development is using to purchase
guns turned in at public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the purchases, averaging about $50 a gun, now flows
through HUD's Drug Elimination Program. Elizabeth Morra, a
spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, said Wednesday
that congressional auditors earlier this week concluded that HUD
doesn't have the authority to divert the anti-drug funding for gun
buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere in the grant does it authorize using the funding for a
gun buyback program,'' Morra said. ''HUD would have to prove that
the gun buyback will directly eliminate drugs and they haven't
provided us any proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't about the efficacy of the program; it is a question
of whether HUD has the legal authority for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Egner, a HUD spokesman, said the department's
attorneys reached an opposite conclusion: that the money can be
used for gun buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its unfortunate that some members of Congress want to stop
public housing authorities and police departments from carrying out
local programs to by back guns, reduce violence and save lives,''
Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, housing authorities in 80 cities have signed up to
participate in the gun buyback program, Egner said. Louisville is
the only city to begin buying back guns under this program to this
point. Egner said 179 guns were purchased Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, President Clinton announced last September
what was billed as the nation's largest gun buyback program with
the goal of removing 300,000 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The buyback plan is modeled on local programs in Washington and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia bought 2,306 guns during an
experimental two-day offer in August. That no-questions-asked
program took in guns from across the city, not only from
neighborhoods near housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Washington program, the national buyback offer would
not include amnesty for any crimes committed with the guns.
District of Columbia police are now running ballistics tests on the
purchased guns in trying match them with crimes or suspected
criminals.

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Focus Shifts  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to crack down on money laundering, the
government is designating Los Angeles, New York City and northern
New Jersey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the Southwest border as
high-intensity zones for increased law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of federal, state and local law enforcement officers will
be formed in those high-risk money laundering and financial crime
areas designated by the Treasury Department. Police forces and
local prosecutors will be trained in detecting money laundering as
part of the administration's new strategy to fight laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Other geographic areas or industry sectors are expected to be
named in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering is a growing threat to the United States,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday at a news
conference. ''It undermines confidence in the integrity of our
financial systems, facilitates crime and corruption, and allows
criminals to savor the rewards of their illegal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, deputy attorney general of the Justice Department,
called the administration's new money-laundering strategy ''a
highly ambitious and far-reaching agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat was testifying on the plan today at a hearing of the
House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, seeking to stem the flow through
U.S. banks of billions of dollars from drug trafficking and other
illegal activities, also is seeking new powers from Congress to
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative proposal outlined last week by Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers would give the government the authority to ban
financial transactions between offshore financial havens and U.S.
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody needs to come out of the closet and expose them for
what they are,'' said convicted former money launderer Kenneth
Rijock, referring to island nations in the Caribbean that are
havens of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's financial terrorism,'' he said in an interview this week.
A former Miami lawyer who did two years in federal prison, Rijock
explained in an Associated Press story in September how he used to
fly from Florida into islands such as Anguilla and easily deposit
millions of drug dollars into a dummy corporation's local bank
account. Sometimes he and his cohorts used rubber stamps of cartoon
characters as signatures on deposit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at today's hearing was Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has criticized the administration's plan as
insufficient because it gives the Treasury Department discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it. Schumer
and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the House Banking Committee like the
administration's proposal so much they have said they would
co-sponsor it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and the
panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, proposed a
stricter measure that would have required U.S. banks to collect
detailed information on their customers from countries considered
to be money-laundering havens. The administration's proposal would
leave it up to Treasury to decide whether to impose data-collecting
requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new strategy, the government is:
</P>
<P>
   --Putting new rules into effect that eventually will require
storefront check cashers and money transmitters, brokerage firms
and casinos to notify authorities of suspicious transactions, as
banks now must do.
</P>
<P>
   --Making some $2.5 million this year in grants to state and local
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors' offices to help them
fight money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Eye Lifting Gas Tax  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some lawmakers are proposing that a 1993 gas
tax of 4.3 cents a gallon be lifted temporarily to ease the burden
of motorists having to cope with soaring gasoline prices this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate tax writing committees were cool to the idea,
but a number of Republican senators said the proposal might gain
momentum if prices at the pump, now at more than $1.50 a gallon in
many places, continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to take down the price of gas this summer,'' said
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, suggesting one way to help do that was
suspending the 1993 excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   And the tax could become an issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Wednesday that the tax was
imposed in 1993 when the Democrats held a majority with solid GOP
opposition, and he made a point to say that Vice President Al Gore
cast the tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was (the administration's) energy policy,'' Nickles said.
But some Republican lawmakers also questioned whether tampering
with the federal gas excise tax might be an overreaction,
especially if it gets reimposed once gas prices decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am for tax reduction whenever you can put them on the books.
I'm a little concerned when we say we're going to do it, then we're
going to take it back,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, which considers tax
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And Archer questioned how much good a 4.3 cent difference would
make when gasoline -- as some predict -- hits $2 a gallon during the
peak driving period this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, has not made a decision and will discuss the proposal
with other lawmakers in the coming days, an aide to the senator
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be politically attractive, such a tax cut, even
if temporary, also would take billions of dollars away from the
federal trust fund for highway construction, something that does
not set well with lawmakers planning the transportation budget, nor
the powerful highway lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, another senator favoring the
idea, said lost revenue could be made up later when gas prices go
down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Murkowski on Wednesday used the brouhaha over high
oil and gasoline prices to once again push legislation that would
open up an environmentally sensitive Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   He long has argued that drilling could be conducted on the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern
Alaska without harming wildlife or the area's ecology. His bill was
introduced with 31 Senate sponsors, but its chances of becoming law
this year are slim.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton previously has vetoed legislation to drill for
oil in the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt quickly issued a statement
saying he strongly opposed oil development in the refuge and that
Clinton again would veto such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made it clear again and again. We will protect this last
undeveloped fragment of America' arctic coastline,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate was expected shortly to consider a
nonbinding resolution calling on Clinton to communicate the need
for increased oil production to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries before their meeting March 27. The OPEC members
are expected to decide at the meeting on whether to boost
production.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution received unanimous support Wednesday from the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson recently returned from a trip to the Middle East where
he talked to leading OPEC oil ministers on the need to boost
production.
</P>
<P>
   About a half dozen Republican senators from oil states and other
Western states, meanwhile, criticized the Clinton administration
for not developing an energy policy that would boost domestic oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   They said the United States gets 56 percent of its oil from
imports while vast areas public land and offshore petroleum and
natural gas reserves are being kept off limits to oil companies.

<HEADLINE> Senate Battles Over FEC Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Ohio law professor defended his writings on
campaign finance and pledged to uphold the law if given a job on
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But that pledge didn't seem to change any opinions about Bradley
A. Smith's fitness to enforce federal campaign law.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Smith's answers at a Senate committee hearing
Wednesday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he still planned to
vote against Smith's nomination to the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Smith believes campaign law to be seriously flawed, and Schumer
said voting to confirm him would send a bad message. He compared it
to choosing as attorney general someone ''who did not believe in
incarcerating people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing could send a worse signal to everyone who has to obey
the campaign finance laws,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus,
Ohio, says existing laws have failed to rid the system of
corrupting influences while unconstitutionally infringing on free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   He would rather see a system with no limits on how much
candidates can raise and spend, even though he tried to emphasize
to the senators that he would ''enforce the law as it is, even when
I disagree with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that assurance, he is viewed with suspicion by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have
invoked a Senate procedure to block Smith's name from coming up for
a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's chief patron, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., countered
Wednesday by suggesting he might sink a Democrat's confirmation if
Smith doesn't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   When Danny Lee McDonald, an FEC member since 1981 who is up for
confirmation to a new term, appeared with Smith before the Rules
and Administration Committee on Wednesday, committee chairman
McConnell told the Democratic nominee, ''If Professor Smith is
confirmed, I will not oppose you.''
</P>
<P>
   But keeping McDonald's confirmation off the Senate calendar
wouldn't be much of a punishment; McDonald has continued to serve
on the FEC while awaiting either confirmation to a new term or the
confirmation of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved both Smith's and McDonald's nominations
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure
candidates comply with disclosure requirements and contribution
limits. The six-member commission is evenly split among Republicans
and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year terms and must be
approved by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's nomination has drawn intense criticism from groups such
as Common Cause and Democrats including President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried for nearly a year to get Republicans to offer any
other name, but they stuck with Smith. The president gave in last
month, saying he didn't like the selection ''but I decided that I
should not shut down the whole appointments process.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell introduced into the committee record 32 letters from
campaign law experts who endorsed Smith's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional scholar Daniel Lowenstein, a former Common Cause
board member and a Democrat, wrote that he disagrees with Smith's
views on campaign law but thinks he's an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who chose Smith ''deserve considerable credit for
having picked a distinguished individual rather than a hack,'' he
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Satellite Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Banking Committee has given
unanimous approval to legislation that would allow local broadcast
signals to be beamed into millions of rural households.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation approved last year, major satellite companies
must beam local stations to about one-quarter of the nation's 211
media markets. But that only covered the largest markets, leaving
about 6 million rural households without local service.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by the committee Wednesday would set up a
$1.25 billion loan guarantee fund for companies that provide local
broadcasts to rural markets. The guarantee provision in last year's
bill was dropped amid opposition led by the committee chairman,
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the original bill did not provide enough assurances
that the loans would be repaid. Under this year's bill, which Gramm
sponsored, the loan guarantees would be capped at 80 percent of the
total instead of 100 percent, and borrowers would have to provide
more collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation cleared the House Agriculture Committee last
month without opposition.

<HEADLINE> Feds Halt Blood Pressure Drug Study  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has halted part of the
nation's largest blood pressure study because one of the tested
drugs proved less effective than an old standby treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health said Wednesday that Americans
taking a type of blood pressure drug called an ''alpha-adrenergic
blocker'' should ask their physician if they should switch
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, patients who took an alpha blocker called
doxazosin, sold under the brand name Cardura, were twice as likely
to be hospitalized for congestive heart failure as were patients
given an older, cheaper diuretic called chlorthalidone, the NIH
announced.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure is a common cause of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The study results mean taking an alpha blocker alone is not the
best choice for blood-pressure patients, said Dr. Jeffrey Cutler of
the NIH's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study used Cardura, the effect should be the same
for all alpha blockers, Cutler said. Others include terazosin, sold
as Hytrin, and prazosin, sold as Minipress.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address how well alpha blockers work when used
together with other hypertension drugs, the primary way Cardura is
prescribed, said Dr. Joseph Feczko of Pfizer Inc., which
manufactures the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 24 million Americans taking high blood pressure
medicine, about 1 million use an alpha blocker, the NIH said. Some
alpha blockers are also used for other disorders, such as an
enlarged prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse this warning about alpha blockers with other drugs
called beta blockers, cautioned the American Heart Association's
Dr. Rodman Starke. Beta blockers are a different and very useful
treatment for high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH study has enrolled over 42,000 people to compare
different treatments for hypertension and high cholesterol. Parts
of the study that compare other hypertension treatments called ACE
inhibitors and calcium antagonists with diuretics are continuing.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Bosnian Serb Heartland  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Despite a hostile
reception by hundreds of Serbs the previous day, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright traveled to the Serb heartland of Bosnia today
on a mission to help former foes reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   She is to meet with Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik, along
with Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino Picula and perhaps Biljana
Plavsic, the former Bosnian Serb president who turned from radical
nationalist to a moderate supporting most Western goals for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   On the likely agenda are attempts to agree on the return of some
Bosnian Croats to the Serb half of Bosnia, and Croatian Serbs back
to Croatia. Both ethnic groups fled wars in the region over the
past decade -- about 30,000 Croatian Serbs are in the Serb part of
Bosnia and 70,000 Bosnian Croats in Croatia, U.N. figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Banja Luka, Albright met today with
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, whose pro-Western stance,
criticism of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and attempts to
chart an independent course for the republic of Montenegro -- a part
of Yugoslavia -- has put him on a collision course with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Wednesday she was worried about the security of
Montenegro. After meeting with Albright today, Djukanovic said that
she praised his government's ''cautious, wise and tolerant policy
... in avoiding all incidents set up by Milosevic in order to give
him an alibi for aggression on Montenegro and opening a new crisis
in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   She also expressed support for ''our efforts to keep the peace
and defend ourselves from any eventual aggression,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic again expressed determination to seek independence
from Yugoslavia should it not be possible to develop ''reforms,
democracy and European integration'' within the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, hundreds of Serbs chanted ''killers,'' and an egg
was hurled as Albright drove by, marring her visit to a Brcko, a
city meant to serve as an example of ethnic harmony for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She was in Brcko for the formal announcement making the city a
multiethnic district -- a decision imposed last year in an effort to
placate Serbs, Muslims and Croats all claiming the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiseljak, 25 miles west of Sarajevo, a demonstration by
almost 10,000 Bosnian Croats against the 45-year sentence handed
down to one of their former generals by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal also turned into an anti-U.S. protest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Albright kept to her agenda of publicizing developments
meant to demonstrate growing stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with all three members of Bosnia's multiethnic
presidency and the Croatian and Bosnian defense ministers, she
announced an agreement ending covert Croatian military aid to
Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia and the West had criticized such aid under the previous
Croatian government as part of attempts to strengthen Bosnian Croat
separatist ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose should be clear,'' Albright said. ''We want to
build confidence throughout Bosnia ... that there will be no
military surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Croatian Defense Minister Joze Rados said the agreement removes
a ''burden for Croatian foreign policy and relations with the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright later praised Croatia's moves toward an open democracy
under its new government, adding: ''Bosnia will need to step up the
pace of its own reforms, if it is not to be left behind.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Seeks Bosnia Reconciliation  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Despite a hostile
reception by hundreds of Serbs the previous day, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright traveled to the Serb heartland of Bosnia today
on a mission to help former foes reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with two regional leaders at odds with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and said they serve as examples for
long-term stability in the region. She spoke after separate
meetings with the two -- Milorad Dodik, premier of the Serb half of
Bosnia; and Milo Djukanovic, president of Montenegro, which makes
up Yugoslavia with Serbia, Milosevic's power base.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are pro-Western. Dodik has agreed to support the Dayton
Accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995 and commit all sides to
ethnic reconciliation and democracy. Djukanovic is trying to
democratize Montenegro and has said he will pull his republic out
of Yugoslavia if opposed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Dodik showed determination for economic reform and
ethnic tolerance, ''setting an example in the region for others,
most particularly for Serbia, to follow.'' She praised Djukanovic
as ''another courageous leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ... leaders like this, along with opposition leaders
inside Serbia itself, that give hope for long-term peace in the
region,'' Albright told reporters. She also announced $7 million in
aid to the Serb part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Dodik urged Milosevic to step down, calling him ''the most
tragic figure in Serbian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is still to meet Croatian Foreign Minister Tonino
Picula. On the likely agenda are attempts to agree on the return of
some Bosnian Croats to the Serb half of Bosnia and Croatian Serbs

<HEADLINE> Study: Brains Grow Furiously  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children's brains change dramatically in key areas into puberty,
researchers report in a new study that contradicts some
long-standing assumptions about brain development.
</P>
<P>
   The anatomical changes -- described as ''fine-tuning'' --
surprised scientists in the United States and Canada who conducted
the study published Thursday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The changes occurred between ages 3 and 15, in some cases years
after the brain has reached its full size. Scientists had believed
that neural development slowed after the first few years of life,
and the brain was essentially organized by the time a child enters
first grade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said, even in the mid-teens the amount of gray
matter in some very active areas can double and neurons can
interconnect rapidly while unneeded cells in other areas are
flushed out.
</P>
<P>
   The research continues two earlier studies of brain development
published last fall. Researchers said they have not determined how
the findings might be practically incorporated into new approaches
to education or child development, but the study suggests how
critically intertwined the stages of brain growth might be to a
child's intellectual and emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The teen-age years are a kind of critical time to optimize the
brain,'' one of the study's co-authors, child psychiatrist Jay
Giedd of the National Institutes of Health, told The Washington
Post. ''If a person is doing sports or academics or music, those
are the abilities that will be hardwired.''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers at UCLA, the NIH and McGill University
in Montreal scanned the normal brains of boys and girls ages 3 to
15. Some of the children participated as long as four years.
</P>
<P>
   They saw a wave of growth in the fiber system that relays
information between the brain hemispheres and is a good indicator
of brain activity. The scans also showed new connections being made
in some areas, while other areas shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   In children ages 3 to 6, the team saw burgeoning in the frontal
networks that regulate the planning of new actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the very youngest children, there really is this furious
growth going on in the frontal circuits of the brain,'' UCLA
neurologist Paul Thompson, who helped develop the brain mapping
technique, told the Los Angeles Times. ''You see this extraordinary
wave of peak growth that proceeds from the front of the brain to
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   In teen-agers up to age 15, the researchers observed peak growth
rates in areas in the middle and back of the brain associated with
associative thinking and language.
</P>
<P>
   The finding reinforces the wisdom of learning new languages
early in life. By high school, the task may become biologically
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability to learn a new language declines rapidly after age
12,'' the researchers reported. ''Peak growth rates in linguistic
regions, as well as their attenuation around puberty, may reflect
the conclusion of the critical period for learning languages.''

<P>
   SPOLETO, Italy (AP) -- An Argentinean composer, Oscar Strasnoy,
has won Italy's Orpheus 2000 prize for new chamber opera, it was
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Strasnoy, a 30-year-old Buenos Aires native, was awarded for his
opera ''Midea (2),'' a reworking of an ancient Greek myth.
</P>
<P>
   The jury described the opera's music as ''rich in refined
details'' and praised the piece for doing well ''at maintaining the
lengthy pace of opera.'' It said the opera is relevant to modern
life because it ''focuses on the struggle of minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The biannual International New Chamber Opera Competition, or
Orpheus, is organized by Spoleto's Experimental Lyrical Theater
Adriano Belli of Spoleto. ''Midea (2)'' will premiere at the
theater in September.
</P>
<P>
   Strasnoy's compositions have been performed at the Biennial
Festival of Berlin, at the Pompidou Center in Paris and at the
Illigen Festival in Germany,
</P>
<P>
   He also been commissioned by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower today as concerns
about interest rates and company profits intensified, halting the
market's recovery from Tuesday's big selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 113.24 at 9,743.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 25.46 at 4,871.80, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.56 at 1,358.14.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of industrial stocks led the Dow lower. Alcoa fell
1] to 66, General Electric fell 2 15/16 to 127] and 3M fell 2 to 80
9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Today's selling showed that investors are still very uneasy
about the effects that higher interest rates will have on corporate
profits. Stocks managed a small bounce yesterday after Wall
Street's huge drop on Tuesday, but buyers didn't have enough
conviction to stay in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is now down more than 14 percent for the year, while the
Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is up about 20 percent.
Investors' move away from blue-chip stocks has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue-chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital favored by many technology companies will be
slower to dry up than bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks attracted some investors today. America Online
rose 2 to 57 3/16 and Cisco Systems rose 15/16 to 133 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 149.22 million
shares, behind Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.71 to 591.77.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.5 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- The prosecutor in the trial of a New
Milford police officer charged with murder for shooting a suspect
told jurors today that Officer Scott Smith let his emotions get out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly reminded jurors that no
one is above the law, and cast doubt on testimony from testimony by
Smith and other officers, calling their statements self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, shot Franklyn Reid on Dec. 29, 1998 after a short
foot chase. Smith contends Reid, who had been wanted on several
warrants including threatening, breach of peace and failure to
appear in court, made a sudden move from his knees, as if reaching
for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were offering their final arguments to the jury
late this morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the defense presented evidence about a knife found
near Reid's body.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Kapelsohn, an expert in police training and knives,
testified Wednesday that the folded pocket knife, found about 6
feet from the body in an unzipped pocket of Reid's discarded
jacket, was more of a weapon than a tool. The knife, with a
serrated, 2} inch blade, could be opened with one hand, the expert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapelsohn also testified that it is justifiable for an officer
to shoot a suspect while the officer's foot is on the suspect's
back if the officer perceived a threat.
</P>
<P>
   A passing motorist had testified that she saw Smith standing
over Reid as the suspect lay face down. Reid was shot in the back
at point-blank range.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Two Judges  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Californians who have been waiting years
for a Senate vote on their nominations to the federal bench are
about to finally see that wait end.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was to vote today on the nominations of Richard A.
Paez and Marsha Berzon to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Paez, a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, was first
nominated by President Clinton more than four years ago, and has
been in limbo longer than any judge-nominee in modern history.
Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer, was nominated more than two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to win confirmation. But just in case he's
needed, Vice President Al Gore cut short a Midwest campaign swing
Wednesday to be present for today's Senate votes. In his role as
president of the Senate, the vice president breaks tie votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've waited far too long,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said today. He said that if Paez is defeated, Republicans
will ''have a lot of explaining to do. ... There would be no
explanation beyond partisan politics for denying him that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate conservatives have blocked action on the two, claiming
they are too liberal and that they would add to overly activist
tendencies of the 9th Circuit, which covers California and wide
areas of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are activist judges. I think they are out of the
mainstream of American thought and I don't think either one should
be on the court,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., last year
promised the White House that he would give Paez and Berzon a vote
by March 15 this year. Clinton and Senate Democrats have been
highly critical of the slow pace of the GOP majority in confirming
Clinton's judge nominees and have accused the Republicans of taking
longer to act on minorities and women, a charge Republicans have
denied. Paez is Hispanic and has the strong support of Hispanic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has emphasized that he will vote against both nominees on
the grounds that their past rulings have been too activist, but
says he will abide by his commitment to give them a vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Lott, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, and most Republicans voted to end a filibuster
launched by Smith, setting the stage for today's confirmation vote.
The votes to end the filibuster were 85-14 for Paez and 86-13 for
Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats cautioned Wednesday evening that Republicans
might offer a motion to indefinitely postpone a final vote. Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee and a leading backer of the nominees, said it was
''shameful'' that opponents of the two would try to avoid going on
record for or against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a cowardly and disgraceful step to vote 'maybe'
because we do not want to say we are going to close the door to two
such extraordinary people,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was ''certainly not advocating'' such a motion, but
that it would be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has urged Lott to delay action on
Paez in particular, saying the Senate should first look into Paez's
role in agreeing to what he said was a lenient plea bargain worked
out between Democratic fund-raiser John Huang and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said Huang, accused of making $1 million in illegal
contributions that the Democratic National Committee returned after
the 1996 presidential election, should have been given jail time.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 10.24; Nasdaq Up 47.33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with technology
shares advancing while interest rate worries prevented blue chips
from extending their recovery from Tuesday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 10.24 at 9,846.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were moderately higher. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 47.33 at 4,944.59, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 9.57 at 1,376.27.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in industrial stocks today halted the market's attempt
to rebound following Tuesday's big drop, when the Dow shed 374
points. Stocks managed a small bounce on Wednesday, but today's
trading indicated that investors worried about rising interest
rates lack enough conviction to stay in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alcoa fell 1 to 66], General Electric fell 1 7/16 to 128~
and 3M fell 1 3/16 to 81].
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is now down more than 14 percent for the year, while the
Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is up about 20 percent. The
divergence is likely to continue, said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Dow) represents the old economy, which trades in sharp
contrast to the Nasdaq, which represents the new economy,'' she
said. Dudack noted that a wave of money from mutual fund investors
has helped widen the gap between the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chip stocks has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital favored by many technology companies will be
slower to dry up than bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued to attract investors today. America
Online rose 5[ to 60 5/16 and Cisco Systems rose 3 9/16 to 135
15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 352.52 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.86 to 591.87.

<HEADLINE> Antiques dealer accused of trying to endangering mentally illwoman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ERWIN, N.Y. (AP) -- A relationship that began with a mutual
interest in communicating with a dead Civil War soldier has gone
further awry.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Prussen, an antiques dealer from Milton Mills, N.H., has
been charged with reckless endangerment for allegedly injecting a
woman with over-the-counter drugs and attempting to shoot her in
the head. A restraining order was also issued against him.
</P>
<P>
   State police, who were alerted to the relationship by the
woman's husband, said the woman has psychiatric problems and has
since been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Prussen, 42, said he loved the 38-year-old woman and was not
trying to kill her, just control her, Investigator Alan Morse said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The two met, police said, when the woman answered an ad in the
''Civil War News'' that Prussen placed regarding antiques. The two
began corresponding regularly, and Prussen convinced the woman that
he was talking to the same soldier she claimed to hear from.
Prussen said the soldier requested the woman to join him in death.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 10, 1998, Prussen allegedly drove to the Steuben County
town with a .38-caliber revolver. In a cemetery, police said, he
placed it to the woman's head and pulled the trigger. The gun did
not fire.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several months, Prussen allegedly injected the
woman with a blue fluid that made her ill. He told investigators
that the fluid was made from antacid, sleeping pills and food
coloring.
</P>
<P>
   Prussen has been released on $20,000 bail.

   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- The Franciscan friars at the St.
Joseph Cupertino Friary hope a relic of St. Anthony will quietly
transform their 200-acre center into the biggest pilgrimage site
this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Though Catholic institutions across the United States claim to
have relics of saints, the one held at the friary is particularly
valuable, said the Rev. Martin Cobos, development director for the
Province of St. Anthony of Padua.
</P>
<P>
   This relic of the 13th century monk in Padua, Italy, comes with
impeccable records of authenticity, Cobos said. The relic was a
gift from Franciscans in Padua, where tens of thousands of pilgrims
go each year to see Anthony's relics.
</P>
<P>
   The friars believe the relic brings believers close to the saint
and helps heal the sick and give hope to the hopeless. Anthony is
also the patron saint of lost things such as wallets and car keys,
and is thought to help people recover from more significant losses:
health, housing, sobriety or self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds at the friary's monthly healing ceremonies have doubled
since the relic arrived in November, the friary said, and
architects are drawing plans for expanded facilities.

Michigan poll: Most women pray daily
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Nearly two-thirds of 900 Michigan women surveyed
in a Detroit Free Press poll said they pray daily -- and believe
their prayers are answered. The survey also found that half the
women say they attend weekly religious services.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the purpose of the survey -- with an error
margin of 3 percent -- was to measure attitudes about work, family,
love and daily life at the end of a century that brought profound
changes in women's roles.
</P>
<P>
   For many women, faith brings peace to their often hectic lives.
Faith is even more important to women than to men, according to a
nationwide 1998 Gallup poll in which 67 percent of women said faith
was very important in their lives, compared with 53 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michigan survey, 62 percent of the women said they pray
daily and 19 percent said at least weekly.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if they believed their prayers are answered, 68
percent said they were, 17 percent said sometimes and 4 percent
said they were not answered.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of mothers said they have primary
responsibility for religious upbringing of their children while 45
percent said they share that role equally with their husbands.

Nebraska Catholic archbishop forbids priests at casinos
</P>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Omaha's Roman Catholic archbishop has ordered
priests under his jurisdiction to shun casinos, even in secular
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos are illegal in Nebraska. But in a letter to priests,
Archbishop Elden Curtiss said he acted after complaints from
parishioners who spotted clergy at casinos in neighboring states
</P>
<P>
   Gambling can be addictive and tempt a priest to use parish funds
to recoup losses or to try to hit it big, Curtiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was pre-emptive, said the Rev. Michael Gutgsell, the
archdiocese's chancellor. To his knowledge, Gutgsell said, no
priest has such a gambling problem.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss had previously discouraged use of bingo and other games
of chance for parish fund-raising.

University debates prayer at commencement
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- The University of Rhode Island is
under pressure because it is the only one of the state's three
publicly funded campuses that has no prayer at commencement.
</P>
<P>
   A state lawmaker and some members of the clergy want to change
that, and the state higher education board will take up the issue
March 27.
</P>
<P>
   University President Robert Carothers said he abolished
clergy-led invocations after a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
banned graduation prayers in lower public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Cote, a 1975 alumnus of the university and Democratic
state senator, finds it ''rude'' and ''intolerant'' not to include
the clergy in a ceremony that should embrace the entire campus
community.
</P>
<P>
   At Cote's request, the state Senate last year unanimously passed
a non-binding resolution that urges the higher education board to
allow clergy to lead ''nonsectarian'' invocations and benedictions
at the university graduation.

Kentucky House passes Ten Commandments bill
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The state House has passed a bill that
could lead to copies of the Ten Commandments being posted on
classroom walls, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments issue has consumed much attention during
the Kentucky legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters insisted the proposal does not promote an
establishment of religion in a way that violates the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One proponent, Republican Rep. Bo Ausmus, said: ''This bill is
not exclusionary. We're just trying to encourage the teaching of
moral codes.''
</P>
<P>
   But other legislators said they did not want to leave religious
training to public schools. ''I want my children to receive their
religious education at the church of my choice,'' said Democratic
Rep. Ruth Ann Palumbo.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed with only three representatives voting no. It
now goes to the state Senate, which has already passed a different
Ten Commandments measure.

Evangelical group's use of school campus criticized
</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Public school officials announced they
would take a closer look at religious groups that ask to rent
school space after a parent complained to the American Civil
Liberties Union about an assembly.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Veronica Garcia said she wants to make
sure groups that are allowed to rent space preach tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves a traveling evangelical group, Impact World
Tour, that often rents school gymnasiums for evening rallies that
ask people to follow Jesus, urging them to avoid religious groups
it does not consider Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Impact also holds pep assemblies at schools during the day with
a non-religious message against drugs and gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Roberts, the mother who complained to the ACLU, said she
wanted people to know that the group is ''not promoting a message
of tolerance and diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Vaksdal, director of Impact, said the evangelical group
does not misrepresent itself and does not talk about religion
during daytime school events. He said the group does not view
Mormons or Unitarians as Christian and therefore encourages
students to avoid those churches.
</P>
<P>
   School board policy allows public facilities to be rented to
religious groups. However, if the groups promote intolerance of
certain groups, the district could decide they violate the schools'
code of conduct.

World Bank meets African religious leaders for first time
</P>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The World Bank and religious leaders
should work together to combat poverty in Africa, the bank's
vice-president for the region said during its first meeting with
representatives of religious groups in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A common commitment to end poverty ''is to bind the World Bank
and the Christian church together in our daily work -- not just in
our general sympathies,'' Callisto Madavo told a week-long
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to some 300 delegates, mostly Christian but with a few
Muslims, Harold Wackman, the bank's director for Kenya, stressed
the bank's shift towards poverty eradication and away from
big-ticket development projects in the effort to lift Africa's poor
into economic productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most effective stragegy to fight poverty is to shift
resources towards projects and programs that directly have a
positive impact on the poor and away from personnel expenditures
and debt service,'' Wackman said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, the bank's sister institution,
is also now emphasizing poverty reduction as the most efficient way
toward growth.
</P>
<P>
   African Anglican churches and the World Bank organized the
meeting.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kaia Jergenson was pumping iron in the
weight room. It was the beginning of the new year, and the 6-foot-2
freshman basketball player at Lipscomb University had returned to
campus early from the holiday break for practices.
</P>
<P>
   She was feeling optimistic. ''Things are really starting to
click for me,'' she told coach Frank Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   But that night, she started to chill, then vomited and called
her mother to warn she probably had a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Kaia (pronounced KY'yuh) was hospitalized,
unconscious and in critical condition -- her life in the balance
from meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial infection in her
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Her family released a statement asking for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer is part of the fabric of Lipscomb University. Associated
with the Churches of Christ, the four-year liberal arts school
requires its 2,600 students to attend daily chapel services and
Bible studies. Many professors open class with prayer, and informal
devotional groups meet throughout each week.
</P>
<P>
   As students heard of Kaia's sudden illness, restoring her health
became their daily supplication.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every prayer I hear, Kaia is at the top of the list,'' said
Rachel Lavender, president of the Student Government Association.
''All over campus, before we go to sleep, when we wake up, she's in
our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Several students quickly organized a round-the-clock prayer
vigil, asking classmates to sign up to pray for Kaia in 10-minute
segments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted at least one person to be praying for Kaia at all
hours of the day,'' said Pat Ford, a sophomore computer science and
Bible major from Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worried the overnight hours wouldn't get covered and had
planned myself to fill whatever segments were free. But it filled
right up. In fact, some spots were double- and triple-signed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a powerful expression of faith. And the students expected
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see Kaia wake up, be healed and walk out of that
hospital,'' said Chris Nelms, 20, who had the 4:40 a.m. shift. ''I
prayed that I'd one day see her running the basketball court
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Scriptures were clear, the students felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle Paul wrote to ''pray without ceasing'' (I
Thessalonians 5:17). And they did.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus said, ''Ask, and it will be given you'' (Matthew 7:7). The
students asked.
</P>
<P>
   Christ said, ''All things are possible to him who believes''
(Mark 9:23). And they believed.
</P>
<P>
   They believed and prayed for a complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, a week after the vigil began, surgeons amputated
both of Kaia's legs below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Saint Thomas Hospital said they were trying to save
her life by removing dead tissue. Her condition remained critical.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery shocked Nashville, but especially those on
Lipscomb's small campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in college. We hardly think about something this
serious,'' said Lavender. ''Most of the time, we worry about tests
and boyfriends or girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who organized the prayer vigil, said he was ''crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for all of us here, it kind of shook our faith,'' he
said. ''... There was some questioning whether we were really doing
any good'' by praying for her.
</P>
<P>
   The double-amputation was especially anguishing because she was
so young -- just 18 -- and because she was a standout athlete, the
emotional leader for the team. Kaia was a leading scorer and
rebounder just as she had been in high school, where she'd led her
team to the state championship last year and was tournament MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Kaia was an A-B student with aspirations of
becoming a doctor. She loved to sing and go to movies with friends
and was still brimming with excitement about a high school trip to
Europe last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She always had a big smile on her face,'' Lipscomb teammate
Shelley Sims said, ''even when she was running down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaia no longer would run. She no longer would play college
basketball. In fact, she was still fighting for her life. And in
their own way, her classmates were struggling, too.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Earl Lavender, who teaches theology at Lipscomb,
quickly noticed a difference in his students in the new semester.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their ability to verbalize what they believe seemed shaken,''
Lavender said. ''They could do it fairly simplistically before
this. Now they have had to reconsider. They used to think they were
in control of their life. They have had to come to terms with the
fact they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions flowed: Why did Kaia lose her legs when so many were
praying for her to be healed? Does prayer work? How does God
respond?
</P>
<P>
   Lavender noticed more and more students dropping by to talk.
''They'd sit down and talk around things and eventually get to
'What is my life all about, anyway?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of class discussions changed. He found students
hungrier for understanding and less tolerant of easy explanations
for difficult ideas: The physical body vs. a spiritual one.
Confronting suffering in a feel-good culture. Finding divine
strength in earthly weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ''These issues no longer have a nameless face. Now when they ask
themselves these questions, they think of Kaia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Groping for spiritual understanding, they found some comfort in
the busy-ness of fund-raisers for Kaia's medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A bake sale by the cheerleaders, dormitory donation drives, an
empty milk jug in the campus snack store for students' spare
change.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville radio stations solicited contributions. Nearby,
Gallatin High School, where she had starred, designated one
basketball game ''Kaia night'' and donated gate receipts. Bud
Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans,
donated two Super Bowl tickets to auction.
</P>
<P>
   The medical fund established by the school topped $130,000
within two months, said school spokesman David England.
</P>
<P>
   Kaia's family has asked for privacy throughout the ordeal.
Recently, they released a statement that Kaia was conscious again
and her condition improving.
</P>
<P>
   They thanked those who had prayed for her.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lipscomb Bible professor John York opened chapel
services on campus:
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God,'' he prayed, ''we are grateful beyond words that you
are still active in our lives -- that you hear our prayers. ... We
hurt with her, Father, but we also celebrate with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer vigil is still on. But the nature of the petitions
has changed, as has the outlook of many students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pray that she doesn't blame God,'' Nelms said. ''I pray that
she can return to a good and fruitful life. I know that God has a
better plan for her than just playing basketball at Lipscomb
University.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford listens more and talks less. ''I've moved from just
assuming whatever I think is God's will ... to 'Thy will be
done','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jent, a senior business major, said praying for Kaia will
be one of his most important college experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never forget this,'' he said, pausing and repeating
slowly, ''I will never forget this.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 24.51; Nasdaq Up 40.70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with technology
shares advancing while interest rate worries prevented blue chips
from extending their recovery from Tuesday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 24.51 at 9,832.02.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were moderately higher. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 40.70 at 4,937.96, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 9.12 at 1,375.82.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in industrial stocks today halted the market's attempt
to rebound following Tuesday's big drop, when the Dow shed 374
points. Stocks managed a small bounce on Wednesday, but today's
trading indicated that investors worried about rising interest
rates lack enough conviction to stay in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alcoa fell 1 7/16 to 65 15/16, General Electric fell 1
13/16 to 128{ and United Technologies fell 1 1/16 to 48 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is now down more than 14 percent for the year, while the
Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is up about 20 percent. The
divergence is likely to continue, said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Dow) represents the old economy, which trades in sharp
contrast to the Nasdaq, which represents the new economy,'' she
said. Dudack noted that a wave of money from mutual fund investors
has helped widen the gap between the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chip stocks has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital favored by many technology companies will be
slower to dry up than bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued to attract investors today.
Hewlett-Packard rose 5] to 146\, America Online rose 4 15/16 to 60[
and Cisco Systems rose 5 5/16 to 137 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks were mostly higher today. Qwest
Communications Inc. rose 3 11/16 to 57[ and U S West rose 3 9/16 to
73 3/16. Qwest, which has struck a deal to acquire U S West, is
reportedly negotiating with another telecom company as well, and
reports of a deal have driven up shares of both Qwest and U S West
in recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 492.14 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.54 to 598.22.

<HEADLINE> Feds Step Up Laundering Crack Down  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to crack down on money laundering, the
government has identified several ''high-intensity zones'' for
increased law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of federal, state and local authorities will be formed in
these areas identified by the Treasury Department as: Los Angeles;
New York City and northern New Jersey; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and
the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, ''a money-laundering action team will be created
... and will proceed this year to launch concentrated enforcement
activities,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat testified
today at a hearing of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces and local prosecutors will be trained in detecting
money laundering, a new activity for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Other geographic areas or industry sectors are expected to be
named in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering is a serious threat to our country because it
facilitates drug trafficking, organized crime and international
terrorism, and because it encourages corruption in foreign
governments, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, deputy attorney general of the Justice Department,
on Wednesday called the administration's new money-laundering
strategy ''a highly ambitious and far-reaching agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee's chairman,
expressed support for the administration's strategy, which includes
a legislative proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to working with the administration ... to pass
meaningful anti-money-laundering legislation this year,'' Leach
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, seeking to stem the flow through
U.S. banks of billions of dollars from drug trafficking and other
illegal activities, also is seeking new powers from Congress to
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative proposal outlined last week by Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers would give the government the authority to ban
financial transactions between offshore financial havens and U.S.
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody needs to come out of the closet and expose them for
what they are,'' said convicted former money launderer Kenneth
Rijock, referring to island nations in the Caribbean that are
havens of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's financial terrorism,'' he said in an interview this week.
A former Miami lawyer who did two years in federal prison, Rijock
explained in an Associated Press story in September how he used to
fly from Florida into islands such as Anguilla and easily deposit
millions of drug dollars into a dummy corporation's local bank
account. Sometimes he and his cohorts used rubber stamps of cartoon
characters as signatures on deposit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at today's hearing was Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has criticized the administration's plan as
insufficient because it gives the Treasury Department discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it. Schumer
and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the House Banking Committee like the
administration's proposal so much they have said they would
co-sponsor it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Leach and the panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John
LaFalce of New York, proposed a stricter measure that would have
required U.S. banks to collect detailed information on their
customers from countries considered to be money-laundering havens.
The administration's proposal would leave it up to Treasury to
decide whether to impose data-collecting requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new strategy, the government is:
</P>
<P>
   --Putting new rules into effect that eventually will require
storefront check cashers and money transmitters, brokerage firms
and casinos to notify authorities of suspicious transactions, as
banks now must do.
</P>
<P>
   --Making some $2.5 million this year in grants to state and local
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors' offices to help them
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus in NYC Mosquitos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Government researchers have found that some
mosquitoes hibernating in New York City this winter probably are
carrying the West Nile virus, which killed seven people in the area
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday
that mosquitoes collected at three of 69 sites in January and
February had genetic material indicating the presence of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand mosquitoes were tested. The virus itself was
not detected in the three samples -- numbering several dozen
mosquitoes -- but extremely sensitive testing found its genetic
source.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said it is unclear whether the virus will persist or
pose a health hazard in the spring and summer, when mosquitoes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line here would be that we're not entirely certain
what it means,'' said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, associate director of
the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the seven deaths, dozens more were infected by
the virus, which can cause encephalitis, a dangerous swelling of
the brain. People with weakened immune systems are at a higher
risk.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile symptoms resemble severe flu, with fever often
accompanied by poor muscle control or mental disorientation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Explains Stop in Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today ''it would be a
grave mistake'' to view his upcoming visit to Pakistan as an
endorsement of the military coup that overthrew a democratic
government last year.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he decided to go because he believes that
''America's interests and values will be advanced if we maintain
some contact with, or communications with the Pakistani
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to stop in Pakistan after a five-day visit to its
arch-rival, India, later this month. White House officials say the
Pakistan visit will be limited to just a few hours but will include
a meeting with army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the nation's
military ruler.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had debated for weeks whether Clinton should
go to Pakistan, and if so, what message that would send. The fear
was that Musharraf would see it as conferring legitimacy on his
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not an endorsement of the military coup,''
Clinton said during a brief question-and-answer session with
reporters on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be a mistake not to go,'' the president said.
''But it would be a grave mistake for people to think my going
represents some sort of endorsement of the nondemocratic process
which occurred there. That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States would have greater influence on the
future direction of Pakistan, in terms of restoring democracy and
avoiding dangerous conflicts in South Asia, by keeping channels
open.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all, Pakistan was our ally throughout the Cold War.
Since I've been president, Pakistan on more than one occasion has
helped us to arrest terrorists, often at some risk to the regime.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: IRS Checks Wrongly Delivered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service mistakenly sent
refunds to a tax preparer's address for years after he moved, and
more than $500,000 worth of checks was cashed by residents of the
building and others, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who cashed the checks were a convicted drug dealer
who paid for his court-ordered home monitoring bracelet and a hair
salon owner accused of funneling more than $100,000 into an account
for his shop, The (Baltimore) Sun reported Thursday, citing search
warrants filed in U.S. District Court by the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents said the door of the dingy, three-story row
house was once kicked in by someone who wanted a piece of the
government's inadvertent generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman in Washington, said the agency
cannot discuss specifics of the case because it's a pending
criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS sent the checks to the four-apartment row house from
1989 to 1999, intended for a tax preparation company that once
rented the first floor, The Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   IRS computers failed to note the tax preparer had left the
address, and they continued to mail corporate refunds and other
mail to the row house. Investigators have identified about 200
checks that were illegally cashed after they were sent to the
address but didn't know how many more were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible to determine precisely how many checks have
been pilfered and negotiated ... or how many bank accounts may have
been opened,'' a federal agent wrote in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal affidavit, when James E. Lewis left to
start the firm where he had power of attorney for companies and
received their tax correspondence, the IRS failed to document that
he was no longer representing many of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS continued to send refund checks for payroll withholding
taxes to Lewis' former clients in his care, The Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, now a car salesman in Newport News, Va., hinted that he
tried to alert the IRS about the problem of misdirected checks, The
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There had been previous information when we were closing the
business which we had redirected back to them before we even
left,'' he told The Sun. He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 44, would not say what happened to the checks left at the
building before he moved. He referred questions to his lawyer,
Timothy G. Clancy, who declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that Lewis moved out of the office in 1994.
But the checks kept coming.

<HEADLINE> It's Shannen Doherty Vs. Satan  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shannen Doherty mixes it up with Satan
worshippers in a remake of a 27-year-old movie that capitalizes on
TV's current obsession with all things supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   That means plenty of blood, knives and signs of the devil, like
the '666' scrawled in blood on the chest of a dead man.
</P>
<P>
   ''Satan's School for Girls,'' starring Doherty, Daniel Cosgrove
(''Beverly Hills, 90210'') and Kate Jackson, airs 8 p.m. EST Monday
on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is that the worst title you've ever heard in your life?''
Jackson asks. ''It's stunning that anyone would want to remake
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson should know. She starred in the original 1973 version,
also produced by Aaron Spelling, who gave Jackson and Doherty their
big breaks on his TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson co-starred in Spelling's first series, the '70s police
drama ''The Rookies,'' while Doherty gained fame during a few
tantrum-filled years on ''90210.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Spelling to round up his go-to girls for what he
calls a ''popcorn'' movie. All he had to do was call.
</P>
<P>
   ''My experience has been that when Aaron asks you to do
something, you do it,'' said Doherty, who stars on Spelling's hit
WB show ''Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   After ''The Rookies,'' Jackson helped keep Spelling at the top
of the ratings with ''Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky enough to have been called by him when I was in my
early 20s, so when he calls me now I still say yes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling says ABC approached him about a remake, and he freely
admits, ''This is not an Emmy Award-winning movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Satan's School'' isn't much of a stretch for Doherty, who
plays a witch possessing magical powers on ''Charmed.'' In the
movie, she goes undercover as a college student to investigate the
alleged suicide of her sister at a strange East Coast school for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Fallbridge College isn't for prudes. The students wear clingy
halter tops and too-short dresses, sleep with professors, and in
between classes, those up to no good gather 'round a dead tree for
a satanic ceremony where one of them (yikes!) morphs into a vicious
barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   Method actors need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I could have been this really dramatic, serious
actress without it coming off really, really cheesy,'' concedes
Doherty in between drags on a cigarette outside her trailer on the
''Charmed'' set.
</P>
<P>
   During the kitschy romp through the dark side, Doherty's
character, Beth, is harassed by her late sister's ex-roommate, a
goth girl who looks like Marilyn Manson's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Beth is a cool customer. She shatters lightbulbs with a mere
stare. In the dorm bathroom, the lights flash and a faucet drips
unusually loudly, even after she turns it off. Oooh, danger lurks!
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably one of the more interesting performances I've
given,'' Doherty said. ''I'm not saying good, I'm just saying
interesting because my reactions are really bizarre. When
horrifying stuff happens, my character sort of deadpans it and
rolls her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''horror'' includes black crows and the snarling dog with
glowing red eyes, which conveniently appear just before somebody
winds up dead. The oversized birds get a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job as an actor is for those 80 seconds that I'm on camera
to actually believe it, but the minute they say, 'Cut!,' you're
like, 'Ohh, that crow is so stupid,''' Doherty said. ''It's like,
come on, none of this is real.''
</P>
<P>
   The '73 version lacked the high-tech special effects sprinkled
throughout this movie, including a fiery, chandelier-busting ending
that is particularly gruesome for Jackson's character.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aaron is one of the masters and I love this, he puts his
tongue firmly in his cheek and marches on,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson makes a rare TV appearance as the college's
headmistress, who's mixed up in the devilish goings-on. In recent
years, she's stayed out of the limelight to raise a son.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fond memories of filming the original, Jackson so
despises the movie's title that she insists on calling it ''The
School.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a certain amount of suspension of belief you have so
you can pull it off for the audience,'' she said, ''but you hope
you're not going to be remembered for 'The School.'''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, Kate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I barely remember the first one,'' Spelling said. ''After 138
TV movies, they all kind of run together.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force, Tahiti Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A rocket carrying a $150 million satellite
will be allowed to lift off after the Air Force and the Tahitian
government agreed it will not endanger the people of a little South
Pacific island that the U.S. military had written off as
uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
   The launch had been set for Feb. 28 but was postponed after
Tahiti raised concerns that one of the rocket's stages might fall
on the island of Marutea.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force had said the island was uninhabited. In fact,
Marutea is home to about 200 people, mostly pearl divers and
coconut harvesters.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a week of talks and examination of the data,
Tahitian and Air Force officials agreed that Marutea is not within
the drop zone of the rocket's third stage -- a piece of metal 10
feet long and 4 feet around that will fall from 300 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tahitian government had not been convinced, the Air Force
would have had to evacuate the residents or change the rocket's
trajectory, a time-consuming and risky process that involves taking
the rocket apart.
</P>
<P>
   The launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California is now
set for Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> Military Anti-Gay Activity Said Up  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-homosexual abuse in the armed services
has more than doubled in the past year, despite the addition by the
Pentagon of ''don't harass'' to its ''don't ask, don't tell''
policy, a lawyers group that defends gays in the military said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network reported 968 incidents,
including a murder, assaults and verbal gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he and Defense Secretary William Cohen
had not read the group's report. ''We will read it and take
appropriate action,'' the president said. ''If this report is
accurate, I would expect to see a substantial improvement this
year. Substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of lawyers, which annually has reported on military
harassment against gays for six years, says the problem is worse
than ever, with a record percentage of women discharged for being
gay last year in what it called a spate of ''lesbian baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said the services investigate all
allegations of harassment and officials do not believe it has
increased. While declining to comment specifically on a report
officers have not yet seen, spokesman Bryan Whitman pointed out
that discharges for homosexuality decreased last year by 10 percent
after several years of increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe there is growing anti-gay harassment in the
military,'' Whitman said. The military last year issued guidance to
ensure that ''everyone from the newest recruit to flag officers,
understands the policy and the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's inspector general is scheduled to issue a report
on implementation of the policy in all of the services later this
month. That report, based partly on a survey of military personnel,
also is intended to assess the level of anti-gay harassment in the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog legal defense group, in its 75-page report
''Conduct Unbecoming,'' says incidents in fiscal 1999 increased 142
percent from the previous year, which was double the year before
that.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes the July 5 murder of Pfc. Barry Winchell at
Fort Campbell, Ky. His mother and stepfather, Pat and Wally
Kutteles, are filing a wrongful death suit against the military in
her son's death. Their decision was announced by the legal defense
group in releasing the report.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and gay rights advocates earlier said the military's
policy failed to protect Winchell, who was rumored to be
homosexual. In December, a military jury sentenced Army Pvt. Calvin
N. Glover, 19, to life in prison for the slaying. Prosecutors said
he was driven by hatred of homosexuals to bludgeon Winchell to
death as he slept in his cot.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the servicemember
defense group, said the new report ''details the dramatic and
horrifying results of a bad policy made worse by failed
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Among incidents listed:
</P>
<P>
   -- Anti-gay graffiti mocking Winchell's murder at the base where
he served.
</P>
<P>
   -- An officer who used derogatory language in forwarding guidance
on harassment prevention.
</P>
<P>
   -- A ''witch-hunt'' of women at the Defense Language Institute at
Monterey, Calif., which targeted 12 Air Force women.
</P>
<P>
   In describing ''lesbian-baiting,'' the report says military
women are being accused of being lesbians for retaliatory reason,
sometimes for ''rebuffing men's sexual advances, regardless of
their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Pentagon statistics, the report notes that 31 percent of
the 1,034 service members discharged last year under the policy
were women -- the highest percentage in two decades -- while women
make up only 14 percent of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, speaking for the Pentagon, confirmed those statistics
but said officers follow the law and anti-harassment policies in
dealing with both men and women. He said the vast majority -- 83
percent -- of those discharged volunteered statements that they were
gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take every allegation seriously, and we investigate every
claim of harassment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' report documents 495 reports of harassment since
the Pentagon announced it was cracking down on anti-gay harassment
in August -- more than it listed for all of 1998. Military policy
now includes a prohibition on beginning an investigation of a
soldier simply because he or she has been subjected to anti-gay
harassment.

<HEADLINE> Jaycees president quits after prison record becomes public  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The head of a city civic group that runs
a professional golf tournament has resigned after being required to
place his name on the state's sex offender registry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Walker had become president of the Greater Hartford
Jaycees on Jan. 1. The community service organization is best known
for running the Canon Greater Hartford Open golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 31, of Bloomfield, was convicted of first-degree robbery
and third-degree sexual assault in 1991. Police said he assaulted
and robbed a flight attendant at a Windsor Locks hotel in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Last month he was contacted by state police and required to
register as a sex offender and his picture was placed on the
registry's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Jaycees' board, Michael J. Davis, said
Wednesday he knew Walker had been in prison but did not know he was
a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had never crossed my mind to wonder what he had done,''
Davis said. ''We are not an organization that judges people. We
take people at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Walker was a dedicated Jaycee, a gifted public
speaker and a true leader. Over the past four years, Walker won the
Jaycees' Speak Up award for his public speaking ability, he was
named outstanding local vice president at last year's national
convention and he was named a ''state senator,'' the Jaycees'
highest award on the state level, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had served his time and had demonstrated a track record of
dependability, of service to the chapter and the community,'' Davis
said. ''It's not like he just walked in and became president.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Wednesday he was stepping down from the unpaid post
because of ''personal matters and health reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Hartford Jaycees chapter has about 650 members, and
in a contested election anywhere from 90 to 125 people vote, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with no opponent, Walker's past never became a campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the kind of thing you make part of your campaign
platform,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Americans Shouldn't Gripe About Gas  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Americans who worry about paying as much as
$1.80 per gallon for gasoline are lucky they don't fill up in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Or Japan, or Britain, or France -- just about any of the world's
wealthy economies -- where such prices would seem like an
unbelievable bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Unleaded fuel costs around $5.40 per gallon in Hong Kong, and
there is simply no concept here of a divine right to $1-a-gallon a
gas that many Americans cling to.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists are paying about $1.50 per gallon, an
all-time high that has prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to lobby OPEC to pump more oil and bring the price down.
Richardson predicted recently that gasoline could hit $1.80 when
summer vacation time rolls around, although he's hoping to avoid
that.
</P>
<P>
   Such grumbling sounds like nonsense to drivers in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to pay what the Americans are paying, even a little
more, but not what they charge here,'' said Raymond Yip, a
28-year-old restaurant manager who spends about $250 per month to
keep his Mercedes 180 fueled up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's totally unreasonable, but we're at their mercy,'' Yip
said.
</P>
<P>
   People in many nations pay far more for gasoline because
governments impose steep taxes that keep the prices high and
discourage wasteful use of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel prices have risen quickly in the past year as crude oil
prices soared amid a global production cutback, but in nations
where the price at the pump is propped up by big taxes, people
don't feel the pinch quite as sharply as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as the price of crude oil virtually tripled to
about $34 a barrel, French retail gasoline prices rose by about 30
percent to the equivalent of $4.50 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Japanese, who pay about $3.46 per gallon, about the
problem of high gasoline prices in America and you'll likely get
some incredulous stares.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm jealous,'' said Yoichiro Sunagawa, 31, a corporate
employee in Tokyo. ''If gas were that cheap, I might buy a car.''
</P>
<P>
   In Takely, England, just northeast of London, BMW salesman Nigel
Morris said that out of the $56 he just paid for his ''petrol,''
well more than half was going to Her Majesty's tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The English pay about $5 per gallon, regardless of whether
they're driving a beat-up old Ford or sitting back in style as the
chauffeur steers the Rolls-Royce down the motorway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just another way of raising money for the government and
we are getting a raw deal,'' Morris said. ''I think the Americans
are quite lucky. My family lives there and I keep reminding them
that their cost of living is so much lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Gardiner, an English mother who drives a Nissan Prairie,
couldn't understand the American concerns over gasoline that still
costs well less than $2 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you kidding me?'' Gardiner asked. ''The Americans have all
the luck. We are being ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, company worker Naohiro Yagawa expressed some sympathy
about the higher price, and its effect on the Americans and their
auto culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans depend more on their cars, so I can understand why
it's a problem,'' Yagawa said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just rich countries who face substantially higher
prices. In Mexico, the state oil monopoly has a lock on all gas
stations in the country, which all charge the same high price,
about $2.04 a gallon for regular.
</P>
<P>
   Even though rising prices aren't felt as strongly in countries
that already charge a lot, there is still an impact.
</P>
<P>
   In France, for instance, increases were enough to prompt a
crippling truckers strike in January.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where gas now goes for a record $4.28 a gallon,
officials are afraid that a new bout of inflation will crimp recent
economic gains.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a $1 boost in the minimum wage all but
inevitable, House Republicans are aiming to put their stamp on a
traditionally Democratic issue by coupling the legislation with a
10-year, $122.7 billion package of tax cuts intended to ease the
wage increase's impact on small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an understanding that we will have a vote on this wage
bill,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ''We're looking for a fair
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding President Clinton's veto threat, the House today
planned votes on both the tax cuts and competing proposals to
increase the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage: the GOP's increase of $1
over three years and an alternative two-year increase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cast the Republican bill as a triumph of special
interests over workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering,'' the president said. ''Congress should send me a bill
I can sign, not one that I have to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders struggled today to line up the necessary votes amid
complaints from some Republican conservatives about an amendment
that would strip out their provision allowing states the option of
implementing the $1 wage increase. But after an hourlong meeting
with Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other leaders, the
conservatives grudgingly agreed they would no longer delay the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have just been asked, indeed we have been implored, to do
something that is a serious mistake,'' said Rep. John Shadegg,
R-Ariz. ''It is something we are doing out of respect and loyalty
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke clears, GOP leaders hoped to merge the victorious
minimum-wage version with the business tax breaks and send the bill
to the Senate, which has already approved a $1 increase in the wage
and its own package of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a straightforward $1 increase over two years,
arguing the tax cuts -- particularly reductions in the estate tax --
are tilted toward the wealthy and would eat into projected budget
surpluses needed to shore up Social Security and add a Medicare
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republican leaders send me a bill that makes workers wait
for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum
wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity, I'll
veto it,'' Clinton said Wednesday at a White House rally. ''It is
time to stop nickel-and-diming American working people out of the
money they need and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage issue carries strong political overtones for
Republicans. Many moderates, particularly in the Northeast where
organized labor is strong, have pushed for a vote on an increase to
remove an issue Democrats could use against them. GOP
conservatives, meanwhile, oppose the wage increase as a job-killer,
but they are happy to vote for the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has roiled the House GOP for months, but supporters
were confident that eventually workers would get their raise and
that tax cuts of some size would become law in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has already jumped a lot of hurdles,'' said Rep.
John Shimkus, R-Ill. ''We've had a lot of internal and external
fights just to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the tax bill's 10-year cost comes from a gradual
reduction in the estate tax, which carries a price tag of $78.6
billion. Democrats say this primarily benefits the wealthy,
pointing to an analysis by the labor-funded Citizens for Tax
Justice concluding that it mainly benefits people with incomes over
$319,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not be forced to bribe the most wealthy in our
society in order to secure a simple dollar more per hour for the
poorest working American families,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say the estate tax kills small business and farm
growth and imposes burdensome tax planning costs that should be
reduced if businesses are forced to pay a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that with the minimum wage, we want to cushion the
impact on the economy, particularly small business,'' said Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The tax package also would gradually boost 401(k) contribution
limits and make other pension changes; make health insurance
premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed sooner than
under current law; increase the amount of business meals that can
be deducted; and enact other tax breaks for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage bill is H.R. 3081.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs Property Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private property owners in land disputes could
bypass state courts and take their cases directly to federal courts
under legislation approved Thursday by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-7 vote was mainly along party lines, with Republicans
backing the legislation sponsored by Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation passed the House in 1997 but never made it
through the Senate. It has the backing of developers and property
rights activists but is strongly opposed by environmentalists,
legal groups and associations representing states and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   A property owner now must complete all local and state appeals,
a process that can take years, before the dispute can reach federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said this violates the ''takings clause'' of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution, which bars the taking of private
property for public use without just compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The current system, he said, has ''wreaked havoc on property
owners whose claims are virtually never heard on the merits in
federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the bill a landowner can go to federal court
after a local administration twice rejects a review of a land
decision. It removes the requirement that property owners litigate
their takings claims in state court first.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the bill runs counter to the Republican
philosophy of returning power to local authorities and puts
property rights above civil and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're radically unbalancing the playing field between local
governments and large land owners,'' said Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan, ranking Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered amendments that would have applied the new
procedures outlined in the bill to other constitutional rights or
would exempt cases where the public health and safety were at
issue, but they were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference of Chief Justices, an organization of state court
judges, said in a statement that said the bill ''impinges upon the
basic responsibilities of state courts and diminishes fundamental
federalism principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 2372.

<HEADLINE> New Calif. Airport Future Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION, Calif. (AP) -- A plan to turn
this former Marine base into a commercial airport has been blocked
for now by a ballot measure that could also make it harder for
fast-growing Orange County to build jails and hazardous waste
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to turn El Toro into the county's second big airport has
become the most expensive debate over land use in California.
Airport supporters and opponents spent a combined $34 million on TV
ads, mailers, pickets, Web sites and a deluge of letters to
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, airport opponents won a decisive ballot victory with
Measure F, which passed 67 percent to 32 percent. It requires
two-thirds voter approval before the county can build or expand
airports, jails or waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   That means the airport project will have to be put to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Airport proponents, led by the county Board of Supervisors, said
planning will continue in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   And both sides are promising legal and legislative battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until the county cries uncle and takes out the runways, it's
not over,'' said Meg Waters, spokeswoman for an anti-airport
coalition of cities.
</P>
<P>
   El Toro, next to the cities of Lake Forest and Irvine, opened as
a temporary base in 1943 on bean fields about 50 miles south of Los
Angeles. The base closed last year.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of county supervisors have supported turning it into
a commercial airport that could handle 28.8 million passengers a
year by 2020. Cities in the tourism-oriented northern part of the
county say the project would improve the economy and relieve the
burden at John Wayne Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But cities in the mostly residential southern part of the county
and other opponents say the new airport would be unsafe and
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   They have instead proposed the building of residential and
business developments in a tight real estate market with little
room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, anti-airport forces used footage of a
military transport plane that crashed shortly after takeoff from El
Toro, killing everyone aboard. Pro-airport forces ran an ad with a
retired commander of the base calling the opposition's tactics
hurtful and disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   At least one pro-airport group said Wednesday it will sue over
the measure, contending it is unconstitutional, and an anti-airport
group said it will go to the Legislature to change how such land
use issues are dealt with.

<HEADLINE> Airline denies opening door at 12,000 feet to retrieve strap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Airlines denied an airline
passenger's claim today that a flight engineer opened a door in the
plane at 12,000 feet to pull in a loose strap.
</P>
<P>
   When crew members on Flight 1558 from Miami to Newark realized
that a restraining strap was left hanging out of the plane, the
captain depressurized the cabin, leveled the Boeing 727 and a
flight engineer and a flight attendant pulled the strap through the
door seals, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers may have heard a rush of air and felt their ears pop
when the pilot adjusted the pressure in the cabin to fly at a
different altitude, but opening a door at 12,000 feet would have
been impossible, the airline said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be similar to trying to open a door on a car
traveling at 300 miles per hour,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration, the airline and Boeing as an acceptable one, FAA
spokesman Les Door said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strap did not have a buckle on it. The door was not
opened. The strap was pulled through the door seal,'' Door said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Cora Diaz, 39, told The Star-Ledger of Newark in
today's editions that she was sitting at the back of the airplane
and saw the flight engineer and two crew members unlock the door
and push it. As the cabin pressure changed, crew members retrieved
the strap, which she said ended in a metal buckle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody picked up their heads and said, 'What's going on?
What's going on?''' said Diaz, 39.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at 2:25 p.m. over Jacksonville, Fla., The
Miami Herald reported in today's editions. A Herald reporter on
board the flight said the pilot said the strap's buckle was banging
against the plane and he feared it could be sucked into the engine,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman Chris Chiames said the strap had
snaps, but no buckle. The strap was inadvertently left hanging out
of the door by food service workers, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said the flight was full, but it was unclear how many
passengers or crew members were aboard. The plane left Miami at
1:30 p.m. and landed at about 4:40 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The dawn of the new millennium hit most of
the world on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It hit Longyearbyen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The world's northernmost village, a settlement of about 1,200
people, is on Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, approximately 620
miles north of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers last saw the sun in mid-October. So when it returned
for about 10 minutes at 12:48 p.m. Wednesday, school children and
townspeople gathered to watch its first rays fall on the old
hospital steps and to sing songs welcoming its return during their
traditional Sun Week Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one seems to notice when it disappears, only when it comes
back,'' said Terje Carlsen, of the Svalbard governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some impatient villagers ventured out of town for a sneak
preview, since the sun could be seen earlier from nearby
mountaintops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every winter the village is plunged into total darkness for
about two months, and has nothing but twilight for another three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather threatened visibility Wednesday, but the skies
cleared just before the sun's brief appearance.
</P>
<P>
   With the days quickly getting longer, the Midnight Sun, with its
24-hours of daylight, will have returned to the islands by late
April, he said.

<HEADLINE> St. Jude Hospital Halts Gene Studies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital has
shut down two gene therapy experiments after an internal review
raised concerns that cells being injected into children with cancer
might be contaminated with HIV or with the hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
   Another gene therapy program at the hospital was suspended by
the Food and Drug Administration last month, but the agency
concluded after in-depth testing that the gene therapy in that
experiment wasn't contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Bowman, who oversees the hospital's gene therapy
projects, said Wednesday the program that was shut down is testing
new treatments for neuroblastoma, a cancer in children.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said a master batch of cells had not been tested for
contamination. The cells given to patients were the offspring of
that batch. She said another group of cells taken from that batch
had been tested and showed no signs of infection.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 42 children have already been treated with the
engineered cells and some additional children were treated by a
collaborator at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said 21 of the children are still alive and none is
showing evidence of viral infection, such as elevated liver enzyme
levels. She also said none of the children has been directly tested
for infection.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were being contacted and Bowman said she hoped to have
test results back within two weeks. If tests show no evidence of
contamination, she plans to resume treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The two experiments that have been shut down involve injections
of laboratory-grown neuroblastoma cells that have been genetically
engineered to make them more visible to the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said she notified the FDA immediately after discovering
the problem last week. She had been criticized for not telling
federal officials about possible contamination for several months
in the previous experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said it is investigating the errors that led to the
first contamination scare, but declined to comment on the
neuroblastoma program. The first contamination scare involved
several violations of research rules.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about that program arose when a St. Jude's researcher
realized cells used to grow some of the gene-based medicine might
not have undergone proper quality testing, and so began to
double-check.

<HEADLINE> Report Indicates Tight Labor Market  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits edged up
last week but still hovered in a range economists said indicated
businesses are scrambling to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think labor will be a a scarce commodity as far as the eye
can see,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates.
''It's not only that workers are scarce but there's a scarcity of
some skills as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said Thursday the number of Americans
filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 5,000 to
280,000 for the week ending March 4. That was on target with many
analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The more stable four-week moving average of claims, which
smoothes out week-to-week volatility, fell last week to 277,250 --
the lowest level since Dec. 15, 1973, when claims were at 256,750.
</P>
<P>
   Economists consider jobless claims below 300,000 an indication
of an extremely tight labor market. That means it is difficult for
employers to find qualified workers to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
   While that is good for workers, economists worry employers will
recruit workers with big increases in wages and benefits, increased
costs businesses could pass along to consumers in the form of
sharply higher prices, thus triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
June, a total of a percentage point to 5.75 percent, to slow the
economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Given strong continuing growth and the tight labor markets, most
economists believe the Fed will raise rates again on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones stock average was down 25 points
in afternoon trading, while the Nasdaq was up around 80 points.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Treasury, flush with cash from a booming
economy, bought back $1 billion of the national debt Thursday,
something not done in 70 years. The Treasury Department paid $1.345
billion to repurchase the $1 billion in debt, which is just a tiny
portion of the $5.7 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Economists applauded the move, saying ongoing debt repurchases
will put downward pressure on interest rates, thus promoting
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''These debt buybacks will fuel investment and capital spending
and subsequently economic growth,'' predicted economist Richard
Yamarone.
</P>
<P>
   On the jobless claims front, some economists said last week's
numbers suggest that companies' profits are sufficient enough to
avoid major layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy is contributing to labor shortages and
putting pressure on some companies to boost wages, the Fed said
Wednesday in its most recent survey of business conditions across
the country. Still, product prices, for the most part, remained
stable.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said
mortgage rates edged down this week. The average interest rate on a
30-year fixed rate mortgage slipped to 8.23 percent from 8.27
percent, reflecting investor confidence that the Fed is on top of
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Poet Brooke Depicted as Cruel Lover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rupert Brooke, whose World War I poetry made him a
literary hero, was in private life a cruel lover, according to a
woman whose memoir was made public Thursday by The British Library.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome and well-born poet, one of the gilded youth of the
Edwardian era, wrote of an idyllic prewar England of village greens
and hedgerows.
</P>
<P>
   But he achieved a kind of poetic immortality with the wartime
sonnet ''The Soldier'' and its lines, ''If I should die, think only
this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign field that is for
ever England.''
</P>
<P>
   It was published in 1915, the same year Brooke died, aged 27, of
blood poisoning while serving in the navy.
</P>
<P>
   Although his homosexual relationships were long known, Brooke's
liaisons with women have more recently been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir released Thursday by The British Library was written
by art student Phyllis Gardner a few years after Brooke's death.
The document was accompanied by about 50 love letters from the poet
charting an 18-month affair.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir and letters were in a sealed parcel deposited with
the library in 1948 by Gardner's sister, with the provision it not
be opened for 50 years. The library's complex move into new
headquarters delayed the opening of the parcel.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-page memoir says Brooke tortured Gardner emotionally by
flirting with other women, and threatened her with physical
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''After treating her so badly he eventually dumped her
unceremoniously for another woman who had taken his eye,'' library
spokesman Greg Hayman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After his death she had flashes of him standing in the middle
of her room, and she had difficulty separating the vision from
reality,'' Hayman said. ''It agonized her greatly and she nearly
went insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoir describes the lovers swimming naked in the river Cam,
near Brooke's home at Grantchester, about a mile west of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the only references to correspondence between Brooke
and Phyllis Gardner were in the ''Collected Letters of Rupert
Brooke'' by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, in which she was described merely
as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke's letters to his lover include the poem ''Beauty and
Beauty,'' which was written for her but was later published.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Seeks Forest Fire Measures  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- As fires raged on Sumatra Island,
Indonesia's president said Thursday he will try to prevent a repeat
of the environmental disaster that struck in 1997, when thick smoke
from burning forests blanketed much of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have instructed the Cabinet ministers to take measures to
handle the problem,'' President Abdurrahman Wahid said. ''The fires
are producing hazardous pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the forests surrounding Pekanbaru, a town on Sumatra some 660
miles northwest of Jakarta, hundreds of small fires have been
reported and detected by weather satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Plantation owners and logging companies on Sumatra island use
fire as a cheap but illegal way to clear land. Welfare Minister
Basri Hasanuddin asked for their cooperation in combatting the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who met with Wahid in
Jakarta, said Malaysian officials would work with Indonesian
authorities to monitor efforts to extinguish the fires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, during the waning days of President Suharto's rule,
huge blazes burned on Sumatra and Borneo, spreading smoke northward
to Singapore and parts of Malaysia. Both governments blamed Jakarta
for the resultant pollution, health problems and sharp drop in
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While the El Nino weather phenomenon aggravated the situation
three years ago by causing unusually dry weather in the region,
many believe this year's unusually long wet season will likely
prevent a repetition of the massive blazes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is much better today, after the showers hit many
parts of Sumatra,'' said Setyo Winarso, an official at the
Environment Impact Agency in Pekanbaru.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government had moved fast to punish those
responsible for the blazes, threatening to close down four large
palm oil plantations suspected of using fire to clear land.
</P>
<P>
   Although the haze over Pekanbaru appeared to be clearing, the
smell of burning wood hung over the town and residual smoke was
still reaching Singapore, across the Straits of Malacca.
Singapore's Meteorological Service spokesman Wong Teo Suan said
conditions there were ''slightly hazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pekanbaru, meanwhile, municipal workers handed out cotton
surgical masks to commuters as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, residents shrugged off government warnings to stay
indoors Thursday, as the skies cleared after overnight showers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had this for the past few years now. It's nothing new,''
said 27-year-old Agus Tiai. ''You might cough a bit, but the
pollution level is not serious. Life is normal.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 88.66; Dow Up 2.17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising technology stocks drove the Nasdaq
composite index back toward 5,000 today while interest rate worries
prevented blue chips from extending their recovery from Tuesday's
selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 88.66 at 4,985.92.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 2.17 at 9,858.70, swinging between losses
and gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.30 at
1,382.00.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of computer and telecommunications companies helped the
Nasdaq. The index briefly crossed the milestone on Tuesday, but
collapsed as investors cashed in stocks to capture profits from its
stunning rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is up about 20
percent so far this year, while the Dow is down more than 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, investors snapped up shares of the computer networking
company Cisco Systems, up 6{ to 138~, and the name-your-price
retailer Priceline.com, up 7 13/16 to 95].
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange also
rose. Computer maker Hewlett-Packard soared 8{ to 149], almost
singlehandedly keeping the Dow in positive territory. America
Online rose 4} to 59 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks also rose amid the latest wave of
takeover talk. The long-distance provider Qwest Communications Inc.
rose 4 7/16 to 57~, while regional phone company U S West rose 3
9/16 to 73 3/16. Qwest has a deal pending to acquire U S West, but
is negotiating with the German company Deutsche Telekom, and
reports of possible buyout by Deutsche have driven up shares of
both Qwest and U S West in recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, continued weakness in industrial stocks kept the Dow
from rebounding from its big drop Tuesday of 374 points. The
blue-chip index managed a small bounce on Wednesday, but today's
trading indicated that investors worried about rising interest
rates lack enough conviction to stay in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alcoa fell 1{ to 65~, General Electric fell 1 13/16 to
128{ and United Technologies fell 1 5/16 to 47 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between the high-flying technology stocks and the
slumping blue chips is likely to continue, said Gail Dudack, chief
equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Dow) represents the old economy, which trades in sharp
contrast to the Nasdaq, which represents the new economy,'' she
said. Dudack noted that a wave of money from mutual fund investors
into technology stocks has helped widen the gap between the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chips has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital and other private investments favored by many
technology companies will be slower to dry up than increasingly
expensive bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 750.16 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.79 to 602.47.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urges EU Balkan Help  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bulgaria urged the European Union on Thursday
to strengthen the international stability pact for the Balkans by
turning into reality the financial commitments for the region that
were made a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova also said NATO members
Greece and Turkey support Bulgaria's bid to join the alliance,
which the former communist nation once opposed as a member of the
Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   Mihailova told reporters she held talks this week with Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and congressional leaders to seek
U.S backing for Bulgaria's NATO membership. She also is promoting
foreign investment in Bulgaria in talks with business people and
banking executives.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after NATO began bombing in Serbia, Mihailova
said, the time has to transform ''the stability pact's long-term
vision for integrating the Balkans into Europe into concrete
policy, with structured benchmarks backed by financial resources.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the goal should be not only to neutralize the immediate
consequences of the Kosovo crisis but also to find solutions to the
problems of economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The stability pact, announced by President Clinton and other
world leaders at a summit last year in Sarajevo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, gets its first credibility test when donor
countries meet March 29-30 in Brussels, Belgium, to put up money to
develop Balkan transportation routes and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Kosovo conflict in June, Western allies
pledged to help Balkan countries move beyond the ancient hatreds
that have exploded into violence many times since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The stability pact's goals include creating stable democracies,
prosperity, ethnic tolerance, respect for human rights and efforts
to combat corruption and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mihailova also said an important element for stability in
Yugoslavia was the rejection of ethnic extremism in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She said agreement by traditional rivals Greece and Turkey to
support Bulgaria's entry into NATO came at a meeting last weekend
of foreign ministers from the three countries.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bishops Cite WWII Failings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's Roman Catholic bishops
acknowledged Thursday that the church ''failed in its obligations
toward the Jewish people'' during the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking for forgiveness, we regret and we confess,''
Bishop Kurt Koch, vice president of the Swiss Bishops Conference,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops noted that many Christian families and institutions
welcomed and saved Jewish refugees from Germany and Nazi-occupied
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''But unfortunately, during this same period, it was not
considered necessary to removed anti-Jewish texts from the
liturgy,'' the conference said in a declaration on its behavior
toward Jews to be released in full on April 14. It said such texts
included prayers for ''perfidious Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ''too little was done to protect and save people who were
persecuted,'' the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss church's plea for forgiveness comes as Pope John Paul
II plans to deliver a sweeping apology for the sins of Roman
Catholics over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how specific the pope will be in his homily
for the Day of Pardon Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday. But
he is expected to at least allude to responsibility Catholics bear
in connection with the Holocaust, the Inquisition and the Crusades.
He also is expected to mention acts against other Christians in
religious wars.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, neutral Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews during World
War II. But it turned away an equal number.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a government-appointed panel of historians said
Switzerland closed its borders to Jews in 1942 at the very moment
it became known that Hitler was implementing his infamous ''final
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government and the Swiss Protestant church also have
asked for Jewish forgiveness for their actions during the war.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Ramsey DA To Leave Office  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter,
often criticized for his handling of the unsolved JonBenet Ramsey
slaying, announced Thursday he will leave office at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, 63, said the Ramsey investigation influenced his
decision not to seek an eighth term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this case may well be resolved,'' he said, but added
that it won't be any time soon. Hunter said he did everything he
could with the evidence he had.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old investigation is still active and ''leads are
being followed up as we speak,'' Hunter said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's office and the Boulder police came under intense
criticism for their handling of the investigation into the death of
6-year-old JonBenet, whose beaten and strangled body was found in
the basement of her parents' upscale home on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No suspects have been named, although Boulder County authorities
have maintained that the girl's parents, Patsy and John Ramsey, are
under ''the umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   A Boulder County grand jury adjourned last fall without handing
up an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he plans to remain involved with the JonBenet case
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in law enforcement, who dedicate our lives to this, don't
give up on these cases,'' he said. ''JonBenet's picture is on my
rolltop (desk) to remind me of what this case is about, and it has
been for three years. It's about her death and about hoping
sometime to do justice for this little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a Democrat, was first elected district attorney in 1972
and has faced little or no opposition since then. He was criticized
by some for offering plea arrangements rather than prosecuting many
cases.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there were family considerations in deciding not to
seek re-election, such as his desire to work with his two sons --
both lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my 27th year,'' he said. ''It's been a pretty long run
of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Robinson, a Denver defense attorney who closely follows
the Ramsey case, said Hunter's decision not to run was ''hardly a
surprise to anyone who knows him moderately well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't wish the JonBenet Ramsey murder case debacle on my
worst enemy,'' he said. ''He is too honorable and capable to remain
as district attorney in Boulder County.''
</P>
<P>
   At least four people have said they are interested in running
for Hunter's job, including two of his deputies, Mary Keenan and
Trip DeMuth.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Improve Daycare Safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improving safety conditions at day-care
centers nationwide is the aim of a $200 million Senate bill
introduced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said their
bill would provide block grants to the states to carry out health
and safety initiatives such as background checks on day-care
workers, worker training, inspections, facility upgrades, health
consultants and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safety of these children has to be put first and
foremost,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of states have good standards and two-thirds have
weak ones when it comes to child care regulations, Dodd said. ''We
have better regulations in some cases for our pets than we do our
children,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even states that have strong regulations sometimes fall short on
the funding needed to enforce them, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is spending $3.6 billion this fiscal year
on child care, with about 90 percent spent toward subsidies for
low-income working families, said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for
the Department of Health and Human Services.

<HEADLINE> Mercy Acts Ease Mozambique Plight  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOKWE, Mozambique (AP) -- With a giant wall of water bearing
down on this town, the guards at the district jail faced a dilemma:
leave the prisoners to their own devices or -- overcoming instincts
honed by years of training -- set them free.
</P>
<P>
   The guards paused and then threw open the cell doors, giving 45
inmates, including convicted murderers, a chance to outrun the
floodwaters that rose six feet within 30 minutes. The jailers then
dashed home in the darkness to rescue their own families.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of many acts of courage and generosity performed
by local residents during Mozambique's devastating floods. Most of
that heroism has been overshadowed by the much-heralded -- and
much-broadcast -- rescue missions by helicopter crews of the South
African Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Since the torrent of water crashed into Chokwe 10 days ago, six
of the released prisoners have reported back to the police station.
The rest are missing and may have drowned in the waters of the
Limpopo River, the local police chief said Thursday. He spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The flood surge, which came after weeks of torrential rain in
this region of southeast Africa, was caused by a sudden and massive
discharge of water from a dam in neighboring Zimbabwe. The force of
the water later crumbled the jail and the police station. At its
peak, the flood almost reached the ceilings of the jail cells.
</P>
<P>
   As the waters rose, other acts of courage were everywhere in
this town of 40,000 people, 120 miles north of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the aid agency Doctors Without Borders, who were
already in Chokwe, launched an inflatable dinghy with an outboard
motor when the surge hit. They made their way haltingly under the
dim moonlight, hauling aboard frightened and panicked people who
had fled their homes, clutching their children and whatever
belongings they could grab.
</P>
<P>
   They ferried them to the Hotel Limpopo, pulling alongside the
building's first-floor windows -- and quickly getting assistance
from Pedro Mussa, who runs the town's only hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mussa said more than 80 people clambered through the windows and
onto the flat roof of his hotel. They stayed for five days, looking
out across the lake of water covering the fertile fields where
their crops, their livelihoods, once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave them all the food and water we had,'' Mussa said. ''We
used up everything in the hotel.'' Mussa's wife, Soltana, said she
mostly cooked the victims rice and spaghetti with canned sardines.
</P>
<P>
   Mussa and his two sons, ages 19 and 21, also helped at least 100
other frightened residents who were stranded on another roof across
the street. They swam to the other building, extending a rope along
the rushing water to convey food and clean water to those on the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   The rope still stretched between the metal rails of opposite
balconies on Thursday, as Mussa oversaw the cleanup at his hotel.
Employees swept black, stinking mud out into the street. Torrential
rain during the day seeped back into the building, frustrating
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials so far have collected 44 bodies from Chokwe's
silt-choked streets and from inside partly submerged homes. They
expected the town's final death toll to reach several hundred.
Nationwide, the toll is expected to soar into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of others escaped, though. South Africa said its
military helicopters rescued more than 14,000 people during the
floods, while Malawi reported that its two choppers rescued 1,100
flood victims.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die As Small Plane Collide in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Two small planes collided on a runway at
Sarasota Bradenton International Airport Thursday, killing four
people in a fiery explosion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine planes each carried two people, said Pat
Cariseo, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A controller had cleared one of the planes for takeoff from one
of the airport's two runways, Cariseo said. At the same time, the
other plane requested permission to hold on the same runway, a
normal procedure before taking off. Controllers granted the
request.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is not immediately clear, Cariseo said. The
planes, a Cessna 152 and a Cessna 172, collided at 10:37 a.m.,
airport spokesman Jim Naiman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a big fire, so everyone went out there,'' said
Rosalie Radtke, a secretary for Sarasota Avionics, located about a
quarter-mile away. ''All the guys saw was a big ball of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport, about 50 miles south of Tampa, handles general
aviation, domestic jet service and international charter flights.
The airport handles 1.5 million passengers a year. Miami
International Airport, by comparison, has about 34 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials closed one runway after the crash, Naiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cariseo said NTSB investigators from Miami and Washington were
en route to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second accident at the airport in 24 hours. A
single-engine aircraft had trouble with its landing gear and belly
landed at the airport Wednesday. There were no injuries in that
incident.

<HEADLINE> Putin To Unveil Economic Program  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The economic program that acting President
Vladimir Putin has said he will unveil before this month's
elections will combine liberalization measures with stronger state
regulation, the man heading its development said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand, we need deregulation, but, on the other hand,
the state's role must be increased,'' German Gref, the head of the
Center of Strategic Research think-tank, said on Echo of Moscow
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is widely considered to be a shoo-in in the March 26
balloting, despite his vague stance on how to address many of
Russia's complex economic problems. He has promised to release the
program before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been recording support of about 60 percent in
pre-election opinion polls, against about 20 percent for Communist
Gennady Zyuganov, his nearest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning by all 12 candidates has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Gref, who worked alongside Putin in the St. Petersburg city
government, said the government must streamline control over its
assets and strengthen its traditional functions, such as law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he argued, the state must stop meddling in
every aspect of private business and requiring permission for every
small step. ''We must end an omnipresent state control of
businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graf said his think-tank regularly reports to Putin and receives
his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say when the program will be unveiled. Zyuganov has
repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to release his program.
</P>
<P>
   Gref said that Putin's program will be aimed at creating
conditions for steady economic growth that would bring Russia back
to the ranks of major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who chaired a Cabinet session Thursday, used the occasion
to promise that the government will pay expenses of several hundred
World War II veterans from the former Soviet republics who are to
come to Moscow in May to take part in celebrations marking the end
of that war.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Encircle Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOMSOMOLSKOYE, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops encircling a Chechen
village fought Thursday to keep rebels from breaking through their
lines, but the rebels split into small groups and mounted intense
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Komsomolskoye, which has raged since rebels
entered the village on Sunday, underlines the militants' ability to
inflict serious damage on federal forces in guerrilla attacks, even
though the Russian troops outnumber them and have superior weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Since thousands of rebels abandoned the Chechen capital, Grozny,
more than a month ago, Russian forces have focused their offensive
on mounting intense assaults in the republic's southern mountains.
But despite seizing strategic positions and capturing a major
militant stronghold, the Russians are suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   No casualty tolls are available for the Komsomolskoye fighting,
but Russian Maj. Gen. Nikolai Burbiga said 84 paratroopers died
last week around the village of Ulus-Kert, where fighting was
continuing Thursday, the news agency ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's aim is to wipe out the rebels in the mountains before
spring, when melting snow and blooming foliage would make it easier
for the fighters to travel and take cover. Commanders want to block
rebels from launching attacks in flatland areas already controlled
by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Russian jets strafed the village of Alkhazurovo, in
the foothills between mountains and flatlands, and hundreds of
troops later entered the town to search for rebels. Fighting also
continued in the mountain village of Selmentauzen, and Russian
warplanes and cannon blasted rebel positions near Duba-Yurt, at the
mouth of the Argun Gorge that leads into the steep mountains,
ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   After days of around-the-clock shelling and bombing of
Komsomolskoye, Russian troops entered the town on Wednesday to try
to wipe out remaining rebels. But the rebels have split into small
groups that were fighting back fiercely, according to the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many rebels remained in the town. The
military press service said a ''large bandit formation'' was in
Komsomolskoye, but a top commander had said a day earlier that only
25-30 rebels remained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the military command said federal troops have
dislodged rebel formations from the upper part of the Argun Gorge;
many of the rebels' remaining bases are in and around the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russian soldiers have assumed control over all villages in the
Argun Gorge,'' the press service of the North Caucasus military
command said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 63 missions over
the past 24 hours, mainly shelling rebel positions deep in the
Argun and Vedeno gorges, and the village of Komsomolskoye, the
press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its ground campaign in Chechnya in September to
fight Islamic rebels who attacked the neighboring republic of
Dagestan in August. Moscow also blames the rebels for apartment
bombings in Moscow and two other Russian cities that killed about
300 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a delegation from the parliamentary assembly of the
Council of Europe met Thursday with Russian officials. The
delegation intends to investigate complaints of human rights
violations in Russia's campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member delegation was expected to meet on Friday with
parliamentary leaders and the foreign and defense ministers before
going to the North Caucasus, ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner, Alvaro
Gil-Robles, who visited Chechnya on Feb. 28, said Russia had agreed
to let a human rights group open a mission inside the republic.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms Long-Delayed Judge  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today confirmed Marsha Berzon to a
seat on the federal bench in a contentious vote coming two years
after President Clinton submitted her nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-34 vote on Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer distrusted by
conservatives because of her work with labor groups, was followed
by an even more disputed vote on U.S. District Court Judge Richard
A. Paez, who has been waiting more than four years for Senate
disposition of his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated both Berzon and Paez to seats on the 9th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which covers a vast area of
California and the West.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the political importance of the votes, Vice
President Al Gore cut short a Midwest campaign swing to be present
for the vote. In his role as president of the Senate, the vice
president breaks tie votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've waited far too long,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said today. He said that if Paez is defeated, Republicans
will ''have a lot of explaining to do. ... There would be no
explanation beyond partisan politics for denying him that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate conservatives have blocked action on the two, claiming
they are too liberal and that they would add to overly activist
tendencies of the 9th Circuit, which covers California and wide
areas of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are activist judges. I think they are out of the
mainstream of American thought and I don't think either one should
be on the court,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., last year
promised the White House that he would give Paez and Berzon a vote
by March 15 this year. Clinton and Senate Democrats have been
highly critical of the slow pace of the GOP majority in confirming
Clinton's judge nominees and have accused the Republicans of taking
longer to act on minorities and women, a charge Republicans have
denied. Paez is Hispanic and has the strong support of Hispanic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has emphasized that he will vote against both nominees on
the grounds that their past rulings have been too activist, but
says he will abide by his commitment to give them a vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Lott, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, and most Republicans voted to end a filibuster
launched by Smith, setting the stage for today's confirmation vote.
The votes to end the filibuster were 85-14 for Paez and 86-13 for
Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats cautioned Wednesday evening that Republicans
might offer a motion to indefinitely postpone a final vote. Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee and a leading backer of the nominees, said it was
''shameful'' that opponents of the two would try to avoid going on
record for or against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a cowardly and disgraceful step to vote 'maybe'
because we do not want to say we are going to close the door to two
such extraordinary people,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was ''certainly not advocating'' such a motion, but
that it would be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has urged Lott to delay action on
Paez in particular, saying the Senate should first look into Paez's
role in agreeing to what he said was a lenient plea bargain worked
out between Democratic fund-raiser John Huang and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said Huang, accused of making $1 million in illegal
contributions that the Democratic National Committee returned after
the 1996 presidential election, should have been given jail time.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus in NYC Mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Government researchers have found that some
mosquitoes hibernating in New York City this winter probably are
carrying the West Nile virus, which killed seven people in the area
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday
that mosquitoes collected at three of 69 sites in January and
February had genetic material indicating the presence of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand mosquitoes were tested. The virus itself was
not detected in the three samples -- numbering several dozen
mosquitoes -- but extremely sensitive testing found its genetic
source.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said it is unclear whether the virus will persist or
pose a health hazard in the spring and summer, when mosquitoes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line here would be that we're not entirely certain
what it means,'' said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, associate director of
the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the seven deaths, dozens more were infected by
the virus, which can cause encephalitis, a dangerous swelling of
the brain. People with weakened immune systems are at a higher
risk.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile symptoms resemble severe flu, with fever often
accompanied by poor muscle control or mental disorientation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police Head Relieved of Duty  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The deputy commander of
U.N. police in this ethnically divided Kosovo city was relieved of
duty Thursday after criticizing the conduct of French troops.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute highlights the strains that have emerged between the
U.N. civilian police force and the NATO-led military command. U.N.
police have criticized peacekeepers of being slow to respond to
disputes between the city's Serb and ethnic Albanian populations.
</P>
<P>
   The officer in this case, John Adams, had complained that French
troops contaminated a crime scene following an outbreak of violence
Tuesday. Adams was recalled to Pristina, Kosovo's provincial
capital, said Svend Erik Larsen, the U.N. police commander of the
Mitrovica region of northwestern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''What (Adams) said yesterday was not the truth,'' Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Adams accused French peacekeepers of having
blocked U.N. police from an area in the northern, Serb-controlled
side of Mitrovica following the incident Tuesday, in which 16
French peacekeepers and 24 civilians were injured.
</P>
<P>
   By the time U.N. police were allowed in, French troops had
cleared the area themselves, Adams said. He said they destroyed
physical evidence that might have been used in prosecuting those
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Four ethnic Albanians have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he was relieved of duty, Adams blamed
''ignorance'' for the French actions, saying the French soldiers
''don't know police procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My information is that they were trying to clear the scene of
debris to allow access to foot and vehicle traffic,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, however, said ''some of our police who didn't know the
rules'' asked peacekeepers whether they could begin an
investigation immediately. He said the peacekeepers turned them
down because the site had not been cleared of unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen insisted U.N. police had not been prevented by
peacekeepers from doing their job.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said it is ''standard
procedure'' for the peacekeeping force, called KFOR, to secure a
crime site before starting a joint investigation with the U.N.
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they regret the comment made by the police officer in
Mitrovica complaining about KFOR,'' Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Airline Denies Open Door in Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Airlines today denied a passenger's
claims that a flight engineer opened a door at 12,000 feet to pull
in a loose strap.
</P>
<P>
   When crew members on Flight 1558 from Miami to Newark on
Wednesday realized that a restraining strap was left hanging out of
the plane, the captain depressurized the cabin, leveled the Boeing
727 and a flight engineer and a flight attendant pulled the strap
through the door seals, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers may have heard a rush of air and felt their ears pop
when the cabin depressurized, but opening a door at that altitude
would have been impossible, the airline said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be similar to trying to open a door on a car
traveling at 300 miles per hour,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration, the airline and Boeing, FAA spokesman Les Door said
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strap did not have a buckle on it. The door was not
opened. The strap was pulled through the door seal,'' Door said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Cora Diaz, 39, told The Star-Ledger of Newark in
today's editions that she was sitting at the back of the airplane
and saw the flight engineer and two crew members unlock the door
and push it. As the cabin pressure changed, crew members retrieved
the strap, which she said ended in a metal buckle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody picked up their heads and said, 'What's going on?
What's going on?''' said Diaz, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the pilot reassured passengers over the intercom
that the procedure had been performed because of fears that a
buckle would come loose and be sucked into the plane's engine, Diaz
said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman Chris Chiames said the strap had
snaps, but no buckle. The strap was inadvertently left hanging out
of the door by food service workers, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said the flight was full, but it was unclear how many
passengers or crew members were aboard.

   Advisory Commission Blasts IMF
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 182-nation International Monetary Fund,
which was widely criticized for its handling of the 1997-98 global
currency crisis, needs to be drastically reformed, a blue-ribbon
advisory commission is telling Congress. The International
Financial Institution Advisory Commission issued a 124-page report
yesterday, recommending a radical overhaul of the IMF and its
sister lending agency, the World Bank. The report says the IMF
should limit future activities to providing short-term emergency
loans to tide countries over during times of financial crisis. It
said the World Bank should scrap most of its current loan
activities in favor of supplying grants to the world's poorest
nations.

   Long-Term Investors Told: Stay Put
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock market volatility may send speculators
rushing from one sector to another in search of the 'next big
thing.' But financial advisers who cater to small investors are
urging their clients to tune out the latest market gyrations.
Long-term investors who stick to the old fashioned ''buy and hold''
method will be just fine, say these pros. Volatility is ''always a
curse'' because it frequently causes investors to make rash
decisions, said John Markese, president of the American Association
of Individual Investors.

share. Sales for the quarter were $449.63 million, down from
$542.17 million a year ago. Land's End fell about 10 percent, but
was up 4 5/16 to 35 3/16 in late trading.

<HEADLINE> Bradley quits presidential race  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE (AP) -- Bill Bradley ended his underdog campaign for
president Thursday and threw his support behind Vice President Al
Gore, but stood behind his oft-stated complaints that Gore ran a
campaign of ''distortions and negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   In quitting the race, Bradley bowed to the inevitable. He lost
the Iowa caucuses and the kickoff New Hampshire primary, and his
shutout this week in Super Tuesday primaries across the nation gave
Gore 1,424 delegates out of 2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he will not release the 412 delegates he did win,
saying they had earned a voice at the Democratic National
Convention. He said he was not prepared to discuss what role, if
any, he hopes to play at the convention in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, painted by Gore as a disloyal Democrat for leaving
the Senate in 1996, emphasized his commitment to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time for unity,'' Bradley said. ''Democrats know
that the offerings of the likely Republican nominee and his party
are the opposite of where our country should be headed. This
country needs Democratic leadership, and I will work to ensure a
Democratic White House and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised his former rival for the nomination and welcomed
his support. ''Bill Bradley is a good man whom I respect greatly,''
Gore said in a statement. ''I am honored to have his support.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley ran a ''campaign based on the highest ideals.
... This primary has been good for the Democratic Party and good
for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his underdog campaign 15 months ago at a
Newark, N.J., community center, and his hopes soared through much
of 1999 as he pitched his ideas for universal health insurance, an
assault on child poverty and strict gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was brought to earth by a combination of factors,
some in his control and some not.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley struck some as too reserved and unwilling to return fire
in political skirmishes. His campaign failed to chip away the
bedrock support for the Clinton-Gore administration of unions and
minority groups. And the rise of a reform candidate on the
Republican side, John McCain, provided unanticipated competition
for independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chairman Doug Berman said Gore became a better
campaigner as the race progressed and Bradley was hurt by the
''compelling nature of the Republican story line over the last five
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton praised Bradley and the tenor
of the Democratic nominating contest in general.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you looked at the issues he raised and the way in which he
raised them, it recalled again how very much more substantive in my
judgment the debate was on the Democratic side, on the issues, and
how much more agreement there was,'' Clinton said during a question
and answer session with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Republican side there was far more disagreement, I
think, and it was far less rooted in issues that will really affect
the American people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's withdrawal came within an hour of McCain's
announcement that he was suspending his race after losing the
lion's share of GOP primaries Tuesday to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted that he and McCain held an unusual joint campaign
appearance in New Hampshire to shake hands and agree to swear off
unregulated ''soft money'' if they faced each other in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were putting national interests above partisan interests,
and even above self-interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the outcome of his campaign and that of McCain
illustrates ''how difficult it is to run against entrenched power
in this country, whether you are running against the entrenched
power of a Republican Party out of office, or certainly whether you
are running against entrenched power of a Democratic Party in
control of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took a day off Wednesday to rest after 15 months on the
campaign trail and to prepare his exit remarks. He made them at a
catering hall near his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For a backdrop, aides hung four black-and-white images from the
campaign -- Bradley at a Harlem school chatting with black children,
greeting voters alongside his wife Ernestine, standing with three
of his grandchildren in New Hampshire and rounding third base on
his way to a home run in a softball game in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers and staff members crowded into the room and greeted
the candidate with a prolonged ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his campaign, which seemed to soar last year before
crashing to earth when the primary voting began, advanced a ''new
politics in America'' that gives special attention to the poor and
less fortunate who cannot speak loudly for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He recited the building blocks of the campaign: access to health
care for all, elimination of child poverty, ''bold steps to get
guns off our streets,'' education for all and campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been defeated,'' he said. ''But the cause for which I
ran has not been. ... That cannot be defeated by one or 100
defeats.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice he was asked whether he would run for president again;
twice he avoided answering and said he was going on vacation. He
also rejected the idea of running for vice president on a Gore
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said no, I will not be a candidate for vice president,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playful and relaxed, Bradley joked about his resistance while a
candidate to answering questions of a personal rather than a
political nature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to begin this morning with a discussion of my favorite
books,'' Bradley said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He ended by giving gifts to the reporters who traveled with him:
a keychain with a silver sneaker -- a reminder of his pre-politics
career in professional basketball -- and a tin of the throat
lozenges he used to nurse his voice on the campaign trail.

<HEADLINE> State development agency report backs Long Wharf mall  </HEADLINE>
sfhowticnhrfonrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A key state agency Thursday released a
favorable report on the proposed New Haven mall at Long Wharf,
concluding the project would have no significant impact on traffic,
the environment or the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's ruling is the key to obtaining $28 million in
special state funding for the $500 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Economic and Community Development's report
predicted relatively little effect on air quality in the area, and
almost no noise once construction is complete.
</P>
<P>
   While vehicle traffic would increase, the report indicated the
bulk of mall traffic would occur outside of the peak rush hours.
</P>
<P>
   And because the area is already crisscrossed by highways and
development, little environmental effect would be likely, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the mall have said the project, if built, would kill
downtown New Haven and its retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But DECD Commissioner James F. Abromaitis said the mall would,
in fact, bring back to the area the retail business that had been
lost over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at what it will do for New Haven, it think it
falls in line with revitalization plans for downtown New Haven,''
Abromaitis said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opposition to the Long Wharf plan is backed by
Westfield America Inc., developers of several other malls in the
region. But Abromaitis said the new mall would have a generally
positive effect on existing shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think that we can effectively say what the positive
or negative effect is. It is fair to say the overall impact will
well accommodate any job shifting that occurs,'' Abromaitis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cohen, a lawyer representing Westfield, said the repoort
does not pass the ''straight face test.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very bad policy for government to use taxpayer dollars
to put taxpayers out of business, and that is what the state study
finds will happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland and mall supporters say the project will
provide thousands of new construction and retail jobs and give the
city and region a major economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the project last month cited state and local studies
showing the mall would take as much as 28 percent of downtown New
Haven's retail sales, and up to 23 percent of some suburban retail
business.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. James Amann, D-Milford, who has been critical of the
project from the outset, scoffed at the DECD findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets to the point where it's very amusing, but the bottom
line is all you've got to do is have a pulse to know that doesn't
make any sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amann said that he has internal memos from DECD indicating it
knows the project will have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scamming the people of Connecticut. It is a total,
colossal waste of taxpayers' money. We will move for repeal,''
Amann said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 93.57; Dow Up 73.22  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rising technology stocks drove the Nasdaq
composite index back above 5,000 today and helped blue chips extend
their gradual recovery from Tuesday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   With less than an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular
session, the Nasdaq composite index was up 93.57 at 5,005.82.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 73.22 at 9,929.75, bouncing back from
early losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.24 at
1,382.94.
</P>
<P>
   Surging shares of computer and telecommunications companies
helped the Nasdaq push back above 5,000. The index briefly crossed
the milestone on Tuesday, but collapsed as investors cashed in
stocks to capture profits from its stunning rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is up about 20
percent so far this year, while the Dow is down more than 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, investors snapped up shares of the computer networking
company Cisco Systems, up 6{ to 138~, and the name-your-price
retailer Priceline.com, up 7 13/16 to 95].
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange also
rose. Computer maker Hewlett-Packard soared 8 7/16 to 149 15/16,
driving the Dow into positive territory. America Online rose 4\ to
59 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks also rose amid the latest wave of
takeover talk. The long-distance provider Qwest Communications Inc.
rose 4 7/16 to 57~, while regional phone company U S West rose 4~
to 74{. Qwest has a deal pending to acquire U S West, but is
negotiating with the German company Deutsche Telekom. Reports of a
possible buyout by Deutsche have driven up shares of both Qwest and
U S West in recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks in the Dow were decidedly mixed.
Bargain-hunters bought shares of Merck, which rose 4[ to 60 15/16.
But a wide range of industrial stocks fell, indicating that
investors worried about rising interest rates lack enough
conviction to stay in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alcoa fell 11/16 to 66, General Electric fell 1 13/16 to
128{ and United Technologies fell 1 5/16 to 47 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between the high-flying technology stocks and the
slumping blue chips is likely to continue, said Gail Dudack, chief
equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Dow) represents the old economy, which trades in sharp
contrast to the Nasdaq, which represents the new economy,'' she
said. Dudack noted that a wave of money from mutual fund investors
into technology stocks has helped widen the gap between the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chips has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital and other private investments favored by many
technology companies will be slower to dry up than increasingly
expensive bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 833.39 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.11 to 602.79.

<HEADLINE> Texas Filling Prison Guard Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Andrew Green slams the point of his
2-foot nightstick into the ground and orders about two dozen
sweaty, huffing and puffing men and women to line up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''MOVE!'' he bellows.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial efforts resemble something from the movie comedy
''Police Academy.'' The line might politely be called ragged.
</P>
<P>
   But after a couple of hours of practice on a football field at
Sam Houston State University, the recruits begin mastering the
techniques of forming a line, a column, a wedge. With one hand on
their nightsticks, they step forward as one, a quick thrust of
their weapons matching each step.
</P>
<P>
   Green is an instructor for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice and today is riot control training for the newest class of
Texas prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   They need to learn fast.
</P>
<P>
   The next time they are called on to pull out their batons and
form a line, their lives may be on the line.
</P>
<P>
   After 4{ weeks of training, the 103 rookie officers are within
days of heading into an environment of danger and violence in the
nation's second-largest prison system. They will join 27,300
security officers in a 151,000-inmate system that is operating
about 2,000 guards short.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has been attributed to rapid expansion of the
prison system, low pay, a booming economy that makes the prospect
of spending the day guarding convicts less attractive, and the
risks of dealing with inmates who seem to be getting meaner and
more violent.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials are scrambling to keep penitentiaries staffed,
recruiting at schools and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The guard deficit has been growing since a $2 billion prison
expansion was completed in 1995, tripling the system's capacity. In
1995, the shortage was about 400, then became about 800 the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the attrition rate among guards has climbed
from 11 percent in 1995 to 21 percent last year, outstripping the
rate at which new ones are being hired.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas prison population has climbed 19 percent in the past
five years. And violence toward officers has skyrocketed, up 129
percent in the same period to 1,649 assaults in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials say stiffer parole requirements and longer
minimum sentences are hardening prisoners: As inmates have lost
incentives to behave, they have become more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we go to work we don't know if we'll walk out or
not,'' says Dave Giblin, 47, an officer at the Skyview/Hodge Unit
in Rusk in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a guard at Beeville became the first Texas
corrections officer killed in 17 years. In January, a guard at the
Byrd Unit in Huntsville was stabbed in the belly with a pencil.
Last month, two death row inmates armed with pieces of metal took a
female officer hostage and held her for 13 hours before
surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, including prison officials and Gov. George W. Bush,
agree low pay is a factor. Texas prison guards salaries' top out at
$26,724 after 18 months of service, compared with the national
average of $34,404. Texas guards are the 46th-lowest paid in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that the economy in Texas is so good right now
and our salary is not competitive with the marketplace,'' says
Wayne Scott, the prison system's executive director. ''It takes six
applications to fill one position.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Domingues, warden at a prison in Dalhart in the Texas
Panhandle, says: ''When you have a town with a population of 6,000,
and an unemployment rate of 1 percent, it's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, many states have had difficulty attracting
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a persistent problem,'' says James Turbin, a spokesman
for the Lanham, Md.-based American Correctional Association.
''Staffing has not caught up with growth and it's a profession that
traditionally has had a high turnover rate. The Texas issue is
magnified by the size of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, a key issue is money -- guards want pay equal
to that of law enforcement officers, Turbin says. In other states,
the problem is a limited labor pool in the remote areas where
prisons often are located.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jobs aren't where the people are,'' he says. ''And this is
not the type of job that will draw somebody from an urban area. It
becomes a recruitment problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the heads of both legislative committees that deal
with prisons agree about the need for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   But ''it came down to priorities this last session,'' says
Republican Rep. Patrick Haggerty, noting the emphasis was on
teachers, who received $3,000 raises. ''You can't improve
everybody's lot in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrat Ken Armbrister, chairman of the Senate
Criminal Justice Committee, notes that Texas guards -- unlike other
state employees -- can retire after 20 years and start drawing
benefits at 50. They can also get free meals, laundry, haircuts and
even housing at the prisons.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped irate officers from rallying on the Capitol
steps or booing lawmakers in their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think $27,000 is enough to lay your life on the line
every single day?'' asks Bob Trout, 56, who retired after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough for Patricia Bookman, who has several relatives
already working in the prison system and was looking forward to
graduation from the training academy in Hunstville and her
assignment to a prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''They prepare you to be frightened and to have fear,'' she
says. She says she believes she's prepared to work in ''a
challenging environment.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Check Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Leaders of the National People's Congress are
playing a bigger role in preventing graft in national government
spending, the ruling Communist Party's second-highest official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pervasive corruption, including major scandals in southern
China, is overshadowing this year's annual session of the congress,
the country's most public political event. Authorities executed a
corrupt deputy provincial governor, Hu Changqing, on Wednesday to
coincide with the 11-day session.
</P>
<P>
   The executive committee, or Standing Committee, of the congress
will watch to make sure problems found in audits are corrected and
that government departments do not overspend, congress Chairman Li
Peng said in a speech to the 2,984-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this is to ensure there is legal supervision over the
budget, prevent waste and corruption, make the budget promote
reform and development, and maintain social stability,'' said Li,
who ranks second in the Communist Party only to President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Li also stressed that the legislature must ''completely carry
out the party's political line, principles and policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The party-dominated national legislature has little real power,
but has routinely expressed its displeasure with the government's
inability to stop corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Scandals in at least three provinces have reached all the way up
to the ruling Politburo. They include a multibillion-dollar
smuggling scandal in the port city of Xiamen in which at least 30
officials have been arrested and hundreds questioned, one party
official said. Among those implicated was the wife of Beijing party
secretary Jia Qinglin, a protege of President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Li spoke about corruption only in broad terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the work of establishing laws, the influence of the
interests of government departments and local protectionism must be
avoided in order to protect the unification of socialist law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the legislature's important tasks of the past year was
declaring a ban on Falun Gong as an ''evil cult,'' a move necessary
to prevent unrest, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have been detained around China for refusing
to renounce their faith in Falun Gong, which blends Buddhist and
Taoist ideas with the theories of founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the legislature's ties abroad, Li said it had
''frank discussions'' with Republican and Democratic U.S.
congressmen on Taiwan, Tibet, human rights and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The congress' Standing Committee plans to draft laws on banking,
international trade and social security this year. It also will
take up legislation against monopolies and dumping.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Continues Gun-Safety Plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Making the case for stricter gun safety laws,
President Clinton suggested that measures included in legislation
languishing on Capitol Hill could prevent tragedies such as the
killing last week of a 6-year-old Michigan girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at all sure that even a callous, irresponsible drug
dealer with a 6-year-old in the house wouldn't leave a child
trigger lock on a gun,'' Clinton said in an interview with CNN's
''Burden of Proof,'' a transcript of which was released Thursday by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stepped up pressure on Congress since the shooting
of Kayla Rolland at a school in Mount Morris Township, Mich. She
was killed by a first-grade classmate who had taken the gun from an
adult living in the house of his uncle, where the child was
staying.
</P>
<P>
   A White House meeting with key House and Senate judiciary
committee leaders failed to yield an agreement to resume
negotiations over a gun bill.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to require safety locks on new guns,
ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and require a
three-day waiting period for background checks before buying a
weapon at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conferees have not met since August, unable to
bridge differences over the gun show provision. The House version
would require a 24-hour waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN interview, the president repeated his call for
licensing gun owners and said that in the future, trigger locks
could be retrofitted for old handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could pass this, then I'd start looking at what to do
with the guns that are out there now, whether we could get trigger
locks for them and how we'd do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also reminded that he was no stranger to gun
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have owned hunting weapons,'' he said, adding that he had
been given handguns by police groups that he had addressed. ''I've
always kept them under secure circumstances outside the house when
Chelsea was a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I still remember shooting cans off in the country with a .22
when I was 12,'' he said. ''And I've hunted on and off all my
life.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed an Iraqi air-defense
system Thursday after Iraq fired artillery and targeted the planes
with radar during their patrol of the northern no-fly zone, the
U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said the strikes injured a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi forces fired anti-aircraft artillery from a site north of
Bashiqah and targeted the allied planes with radar from a site
northwest of Tall Afar, according to a statement by the
Germany-based U.S. European Command.
</P>
<P>
   Tall Afar is 250 miles north of Baghdad, and Bashiqah is 42
miles farther east.
</P>
<P>
   All planes left the area safely, the statement said. The planes
are based in the southern Turkish base of Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's state-run television said the U.S. and British warplanes
attacked ''service and civilian'' sites Thursday, injuring one
civilian.
</P>
<P>
   It said the planes flew over the northern provinces of Dohuk,
Irbil and Mosul and fled back to Turkey after being confronted by
surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   It gave no other details.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British planes have been enforcing no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to
protect Shiite Muslims and Kurds from the forces of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not recognize the zones and began challenging the
allied planes in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urged on Journalist's Behalf  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- U.S. philanthropist George Soros on
Thursday urged Angola to drop libel charges against a prominent
journalist who blamed the president for the Southwest African
country's many woes.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Rafael Marques, is also a human rights activist
and the Angolan representative for the Open Society Institute,
founded by Soros to promote economic development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges against Rafael Marques contradict claims by the
Angolan government to adhere to international law,'' Soros said in
a statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, which is Angola's former
colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Marques' trial had been scheduled to begin Thursday in the
Angolan capital, Luanda, but was postponed until March 21 because
another journalist to be tried with Marques on similar charges
failed to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from an article late last year in which Marques
said President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos should be held accountable
for the country's rampant corruption and continued civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Marques was jailed for more than a month before being charged.
He was released in November on condition that he avoid public
statements and foreign travel before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Marques is one of dozens of Angolan journalists questioned or
jailed in a government crackdown since the resurgence of Angola's
25-year civil war in 1998 after four years of fragile peace with
rebels under a U.N.-brokered pact.

<HEADLINE> MOMA to assist in planning of new Tokyo art museum  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Museum of Modern Art is assisting a Japanese
developer in building a major contemporary art museum on the top
floors of a skyscraper planned for the center of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Mori Art Center, part of a business, shopping and
residential complex expected to occupy 27 acres in a busy area of
the Japanese capital, is scheduled to open in 2003. Developer
Minoru Mori said he hopes to display late 20th century and 21st
century art from around the world and also make his new museum a
center for Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope it will enhance the culture ... in Tokyo, instill an
appreciation of art in our young people and draw visitors from
around the world,'' Mori said. ''We can succeed in creating
something new and fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who heads one of Japan's largest development companies,
plans to make the museum the center of a new mega-complex in the
Roppongi section of Tokyo, famous for its nightlife and
international flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.2 billion, 7 million square foot Roppongi Hills
development will include shopping, theaters, residential towers,
office space and the new headquarters for TV Asahi, Mori said. At
its heart will be a sleek 54-story building whose top five floors
will house the art center.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind, the Mori Art Center will be the jewel of the crown
of the whole project,'' said Mori, speaking through a translator at
a news conference at the MOMA, in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mori said he did not know how much the museum would cost to
build or what its budget would be.
</P>
<P>
   MOMA, which will soon begin a $500 million expansion project
that will force its own main building to close temporarily, plans
to advise Mori on how to design and operate the museum in
accordance with the standards of the international art world, said
MOMA director Glenn Lowry.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are providing for Mr. Mori is essentially advice and
guidance on how to build a museum,'' Lowry said. ''We welcome that
opportunity to help build a great new museum in the center of
Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mori center opens, MOMA will send some of its special
exhibitions to be displayed there, Lowry said. The relationship
will not be exclusive, though. MOMA will continue working with
other museums in Japan, and the Mori center will collaborate with
museums around the world, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is also receiving advice from an international advisory
committee, which includes officials from the Royal Academy of Arts
in London and the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris. The builder is
conducting an international search to choose a director for the new
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry praised the new center as a great boon to Tokyo's cultural
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''A museum can be a focal point, a way of enriching the lives of
individuals,'' he said. ''Mori Art Center is one of the most
innovative programs taking place anywhere in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to focus on architecture and design as well as
modern and contemporary art. It will aim to bring the best of
Western art to Japan and also offer a special focus on Asian
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Mori -- who is one of Japan's biggest builders and is currently
working in China on what he hopes will be the world's tallest
building -- said the museum will not initially try to amass its own
collection. Rather, it will bring exhibitions from around the world
to its 65,000 square feet of exhibition space and also create its
own shows.
</P>
<P>
   Planners talked about the spectacular views of Tokyo that
art-lovers would enjoy from panoramic windows and outdoor terraces
atop a building that is expected to be one of the city's tallest.
</P>
<P>
   Museum-goers will enter a translucent, cone-shaped structure
separate from the main tower and climb a spiral staircase to a
bridge that leads them to the skyscraper. An elevator will run to
the top of the building, where a three-story lobby will have a
conical ceiling which New York-based architect Richard Gluckman
hopes will echo the downstairs entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Galleries will occupy the top two floors and three more stories
will be used for conferences and educational programs.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Export Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures nudged higher Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by strong weekly export
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat had the best gains, bolting to a two-week high at the
opening after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported
higher-than-anticipated export sales on the strength of big
purchases by Italy, Egypt and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Colder weather moving into the winter wheat belt raised notions
of possible crop damage, helping to drive prices higher. But prices
gave back more than half of their early gains on a wave of selling
by commodity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also rose on positive U.S. export data, which showed a 21
percent rise from the previous week. Rainfall totals that didn't
meet expectations overnight in the western corn belt underpinned
the price increase, although, as with wheat, a late slump trimmed
the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans posted a slight gain on lighter-than-expected showers
in the Midwest and continued harvest delays in Brazil that could
boost demand for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 1{ cent to $2.63\ a bushel; May corn
rose 1 cent to $2.27\ a bushel; May oats fell \ cent to $1.15{ a
bushel; May soybeans rose 1 cent to $5.16{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures were higher.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .23 cent to 72.55 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 84.70 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose 1.30 cent to 60.75 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .60
cent to 92.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche, Dresdner Banks To Merge  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The wave of consolidation that has
swept Europe's banking industry reached Germany on Thursday as
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank announced plans to combine in a $30
billion deal as they try to capture a bigger market share at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got money to burn and this is just the first in a series
of steps in international competition and expansion,'' said
Deutsche Bank chief executive Rolf Breuer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a single case of a bank becoming an international
market leader without first taking the lead in its home market.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned merger creates a bank with $1.2 trillion assets --
rivaling in size the planned merger involving Japanese giants
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan
that will create a $1.3 trillion giant.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as many banks throughout Europe have already grabbed
partners and staked out their territory
</P>
<P>
   France's Banque Nationale de Paris bought out Paribas last year,
making it France's largest bank and Europe's third in terms of
assets. Meanwhile, Spain saw its banking sector streamlined through
the mergers of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Argentaria and Banco
Central Hispano and Banco Santander.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month, Banco Espirito Santo and Banco Portugues do
Investimento -- two of Portugal's leading banks announced a merger
with the intent of pooling cash and eyeing major investments
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process of concentration in German banking is way
overdue,'' said Heidi Sherman, senior economist with the economic
think tank Ifo. ''But if they can get rid of some of their holdings
now, that will release funds for more acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what the new Deutsche Bank plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the two banks will exchange their shares for stock
in a new holding company. Though the exact exchange ratio was not
set, Deutsche Bank shareholders will own between 60 percent and 64
percent of the combined company, while Dresdner shareholders will
own the remaining 36 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner shares dropped almost 11 percent to close at 50 euros
($48). Deutsche fell almost 13 percent to 80.81 euros ($78).
</P>
<P>
   Part of the merger is a massive unraveling of the stakes
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank have in Munich-based insurance and
holding company Allianz AG and vice versa. Currently Deutsche Bank
holds a 7 percent stake in Allianz, while Dresdner holds 10
percent. Allianz holds 21.5 percent of Dresdner and 4.9 percent of
Deutsche.
</P>
<P>
   That will all be reshuffled under the merger, with the new bank
and Allianz holding less that 5 percent in each other. While
trimming down its holdings in the bank, Allianz will also bulk up
by buying the combined bank's retail branches as well as Deutsche
Bank's asset management arm, DWS Group.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be a new bank free of its unprofitable retail
unit and flush with funds for investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to be the leaders of the consolidation movement in
Germany and not be driven by it,'' Breuer said, adding that the
company was looking to expand overseas -- particularly in the United
States, where it intends to build on last year's buyout of Bankers
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Such reshuffling has been discouraged in the past by Germany's
hefty 50 percent capital gains tax for companies that sell stakes
in other firms. That fit with a cozy postwar business world
characterized by cross-holdings among major corporations with
little incentive to mix up portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But now the government is pushing a plan to allow companies to
sell their holdings tax-free. The reform would begin next year, but
some companies would not be eligible for the tax cuts until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a long time to complete our deal,'' Deutsche Bank
spokesman Ronald Weichert said. ''We hope by the time all the
transactions are made, there will be a different tax schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   A major tax reform could entice German companies to cannibalize
each other or seek a foreign company with which to combine.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say German banking is ripe for further consolidation,
with pressure now on the Hypo-Vereinsbank, the country's No. 2
bank, and the No. 4 player Commerzbank to seek partners.
</P>
<P>
   As the Deutsche-Dresdner deal was being announced, the Berlin
daily Die Welt reported that Britain-based HSBC Holdings was eyeing
a buyout of Commerzbank. Commerzbank declined comment on what it
called market speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ruling Social Democratic party largely welcomed the
trend. Spokesman Ditmar Staffelt said it will strengthen the
country's standing as a center of international finance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere you look, big bank houses are merging, it's not bad
for Germany when it produces leading companies,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Halle Berry Sued in Hit-and-Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman involved in a hit-and-run crash with
Halle Berry is suing the actress, accusing her of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Berry, 31, ran a red light and collided with
Hetal Raythatha's car before speeding off on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Raythatha, 27, said in her lawsuit that she believes either
Berry or other defendants not identified were under the influence
of alcohol or drugs during the accident. Raythatha said she is
permanently disabled from back injuries and emotional distress. She
is seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's spokesman, Allan Mayer, said the actress ''intends to do
what she can to make things right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean she will allow anyone to take advantage
of an unfortunate situation or make slanderous insinuations,''
Mayer said. ''As the police have confirmed, there is absolutely no
evidence indicating that drugs or alcohol played any part in the
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department has asked prosecutors to file criminal
charges. District Attorney Gil Garcetti said the case is under
review.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Are you getting enough sleep, Regis? Kathie Lee
is worried about you.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin's soon-to-depart co-host on ''Live with Regis and
Kathie Lee'' says she's worried that he's too busy with his other
job, as host of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He comes in some mornings and I just know he's not there,''
Kathie Lee Gifford told People magazine. ''We can both do this in
our sleep. That's the bad part. Our audiences deserve better. I
worry because I love him. He's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin wasn't available for comment, a spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, who raised her shirt to a People reporter to refute
talk she's been going braless, said sex helped her and husband
Frank Gifford recover from his affair with a former stewardess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stayed home, we stayed in the word of God, we stayed in
bed,'' she said. ''It's the best thing in the world when somebody's
truly asked forgiveness. Because each time you make love, that
person feels forgiven, and you feel restored and loved again. Let
me just smile and say I have no complaints.''

<HEADLINE> Contractor's protest upheld; U.S. agency says Rome firm deservedshot at Griffiss work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- All James Ocuto wanted was the chance to bid
on some cleanup work at the former Griffiss Air Force Base. After
protesting the bidding process that originally snubbed him, he'll
get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors from the General Accounting Office have
sustained his protest, saying that the Army Corps of Engineers
failed to consider awarding the work to a business located near
Griffiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means local contractors will get to bid on contracts in the
county and that the money will stay local,'' said Ocuto, owner of
Ocuto Blacktop and Paving Co. of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said the decision does not guarantee a local business will
get the work, but ''it gives us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end it will save taxpayers money,'' he said. ''It's
nice to know the system does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto protested to the GAO last year when the Corps of Engineers
selected Cape Environmental Management Inc. of Illinois to cap a
19.6-acre landfill and install a system to protect the local water
supply from contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said the decision violated a federal law that requires the
Corps to give bidding preference on projects at closed military
bases to businesses in the vicinity of those bases. Griffiss was
closed by Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO agreed and recommended the Corps review how it goes
about awarding bids on closed bases. It also said the Corps should
reimburse Ocuto for his expenses in pursuing the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said he does not know exactly how much he spent, but
figured it was in the ''tens of thousands'' of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McDermott, environmental coordinator for the Griffiss
cleanup, said the GAO decision, reached last week, means the
landfill work on the north side of the base will be set back at
least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The original schedule called for the work to be done by the fall
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sahre, spokesman for the Air Force Base Conversion Agency,
which oversees the local environmental work, said the agency had no
role in selecting the Illinois firm. He said because the contract
was never formally awarded, the cost was never made public. Sahre
termed it ''a multi-million dollar project.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said the delay will not affect any other aspect of the
base closure procedure, nor will it impact plans to turn the
property over to local control in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers said the agency
believes it gave all businesses an equal opportunity to bid on the
Griffiss work, but it will abide by the GAO decision.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Presidential Campaign Slick  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IVANOVO, Russia (AP) -- For a candidate who insists he's too busy
being president to campaign, Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of
time on the road, running one of the slickest election campaigns
Russians have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the vast country on trips described as official
business, the acting president has reached out to interest groups,
building support for the March 26 presidential election -- and
giving himself an apparently unbeatable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the executive must prove their worth by their
concrete deeds, not advertising,'' Putin told reporters, insisting
that he was not campaigning on a visit this week to Ivanovo.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working with Russia's disillusioned voters, who
are tired of empty promises after a decade of democracy following
the Soviet collapse. Putin's image as a tough leader who can get
things done goes down well with voters, even though he rarely
offers specific policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a master of his word, who doesn't give empty promises,''
said Lyuba Belova, 34, a worker at the New Ivanovo weaving plant,
which Putin visited. ''So what if he's a former KGB man? That means
he's a well-disciplined person, and discipline is what our country
needs most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's 11 rivals seem almost invisible. The acting president
has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion
polls say.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin's activities as
president and his trips to the provinces, there are few signs that
Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election. Putin has
not accepted Zyuganov's challenge to debate him and issues have
barely surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 election, when Boris Yeltsin defeated Zyuganov
by dwelling on fears of a Communist comeback, few people take the
Communists seriously anymore. Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and named
Putin acting president, giving him a big edge at winning a full
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only elderly people nostalgic of the old times will vote for
Zyuganov,'' said Yelena Rusova, another worker at the weaving
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' platforms are vague, with Putin and his rivals
all pledging to ensure economic growth,improve miserable living
standards, combat corruption and crime, and restore Russia as a
great power.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov talks about rolling back market reforms and reviving
Soviet-era economic controls. Putin says he will go on with market
reform, while boosting state economic oversight to ensure everyone
gets a fair break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice isn't between Putin and Zyuganov. It's a question
of to be or not to be for Russia,'' the Communist chief said
recently, adding that Putin's program ''is murderous for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of economic experts, including reformers, has been
working out an economic program for Putin, but it's not clear when
it will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it would be offered to the public even before the
election,'' Putin said on a recent trip, then quickly added:
''Surely, before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has focused on reaching out to the country's various
interest groups, such as local government officials, farm workers
and factory crews, showing interest in the problems each segment
faces.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivanovo, a major textile center 190 miles east of Moscow,
Putin was targeting two groups at once -- industrial workers and
women. So many women work in the city that it is known as ''The
City of Brides.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit coincided with International Women's Day on Wednesday
-- a national holiday when women traditionally receive gifts and
flowers. Putin spoke about reviving the textile industry, then
complimented his mostly female audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The official purpose of this trip is to attend an official
meeting dedicated to prospects of light industries, but the real
reason is to visit Ivanovo ... the women's capital -- on the eve of
March 8,'' he said Tuesday as the hall burst into applause. ''We
owe everything to women.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin prefers to address big official gatherings and rarely
seems comfortable chatting with people, rarely going out to press
the flesh. Not that the voters seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a lot of work to do, he has no time to lose,'' Belova
said as Putin rushed through her workshop without stopping to talk
to any of the admiring workers.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Has First Close Above 5,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to its first
close above 5,000 today as the technology stocks that dominate its
ranks lifted the entire market and pulled the Dow Jones industrials
out of a slump.
</P>
<P>
   the Nasdaq composite index rose 150.13 to close at 5,047.39.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.20 to 10,010.73, a
gain that was largely driven by its technology components.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators also closed higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 34.99 to 1,401.69.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,689 up, 1,295 down and 499
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.12 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.19
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.32 to
606.05.
</P>
<P>
   Surging shares of computer and telecommunications companies
powered the Nasdaq today. Investors snapped up shares of the
computer networking company Cisco Systems and the name-your-price
retailer Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   The index briefly crossed 5,000 on Tuesday, but fell back as
investors cashed in stocks to capture profits from its stunning
rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq smashed through its latest thousand-point milestone
just 46 trading sessions after it first closed above 4,000. By
contrast, it took the Dow nearly nine months to rise from 4,000 to
5,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is
up 24 percent, while the Dow, which has been depressed by concerns
about industrial company profits, is down 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange also
rose today. Computer maker Hewlett-Packard soared, driving the Dow
into positive territory. America Online also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks also rose amid the latest wave of
takeover talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, off more than 100 points in early trading, slumped for
most of the session on continuing fears of rising interest rates.
Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Intel accounted for more than half
the Dow's gain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow is fighting with itself to do a little bit better, but
I really don't see much that's changed,'' said Larry Lawler,
manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York. ''It's all
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a wide range of industrial stocks fell, indicating that
investors worried about rising interest rates lack enough
conviction to stay in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa and United Technologies both fell.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chips has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital and other private investments favored by many
technology companies will be slower to dry up than increasingly
expensive bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Denmark To Vote on Joining Euro  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Denmark took a step closer to
adopting the European Union's common currency on Thursday, when
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen set a date of Sept. 28 for a
national referendum on the euro and urged voters to say ''Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt that joining the euro is the best for
Denmark,'' Nyrup Rasmussen said Thursday at a news conference after
meeting with party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The common currency was launched by 11 EU countries Jan. 4,
1999, for corporate and investment transactions in hopes that it
would increase European integration along with borderless travel
and virtually free trade. Euro coins and bank notes won't be
introduced until Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the euro has declined nearly 19 percent against the
U.S. dollar since its debut. In New York trading Thursday, the euro
was worth 96.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, Sweden and Britain declined to adopt the euro in its
initial phase. Greece, which was not allowed in because of its high
inflation and budget deficit, is hoping to gain membership next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will work for a clear 'yes','' Nyrup Rasmussen said, adding
that rejection would put a ''banner across the country reading
'uncertainty and insecurity.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bendt Bendtsen, the head of the opposition Conservative Party,
which also favors joining the common currency, said Denmark now had
more than six months to discuss the benefits of membership.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should voters reject it, it will have consequences for the
economy, for Danish companies and foreign investments in Denmark,''
Bendtsen told the Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Spouses Work Different Shifts  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Until recently, Bettie Ridgley and three women
co-workers at Bethlehem Steel were feeling the strain of rotating
hours so they devised a way to split up round-the-clock shifts so
that each could have more time with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   A poll commissioned by the AFL-CIO finds nearly half of working
women -- 46 percent -- work a different shift than their significant
other, sometimes by choice. The labor federation released on
Thursday the Jan. 6-11 telephone survey of 765 working women over
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgley, 52, a crane operator who has worked for Bethlehem
outside Baltimore for nearly 25 years said families and friendships
can be strained when work schedules impose separation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It caused relationships to suffer.... We'd become depressed,
less motivated,'' she said. Her own marriage failed, but she has
grandchildren and her new schedule means she can help care for them
more easily.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is part of the AFL-CIO's effort to keep tabs on the
priorities of working Americans and mobilize them to vote in this
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation has endorsed Vice President Al Gore and is
mounting a vigorous campaign on behalf of pro-labor congressional
candidates, mostly Democrats. Gore is scheduled to address an
AFL-CIO-organized gathering of female union members in Chicago this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that working women share some concerns men have
raised in other surveys, including improved health care and
retirement security.
</P>
<P>
   But women also highly ranked better equal pay laws, improvements
in child care and getting family and medical leave laws expanded to
guarantee paid time off.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO's working women's
department, said those concerns seem to be ''directly related to
the strains of balancing their work and family'' that are evident
in the reasons many women give for working different shifts from
their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   In households with children under age 18, women were even more
likely to say their work hours differed from their spouses -- 51
percent, compared with 41 percent of those who don't have young
children, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't afford child care, then you work a different
schedule than your husband,'' Nussbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dorsey, 31, an assistant produce manager at a Kroger
supermarket in Cincinnati, is on maternity leave after giving birth
to her first child. She used to work days and spend evenings with
her husband, a carpenter whose outdoor jobs require daylight.
</P>
<P>
   However, when she goes back to work, she said she plans to
request some evening shifts, likely 4 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that a couple of days a week we're going to have to
play the ... parents where one comes and one goes because day care
is so expensive,'' said Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents who can afford childcare choose to work different
schedules anyway because they want their children to spend time
with them, not day-care providers. Other women make the tradeoff to
pursue an attractive career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not the kind of person who can really sit still,'' said
Debora Sutor, 39, a Chicago-based flight attendant who sometimes
goes several days without seeing her husband, a dayshift concrete
company superintendent, and their two sons, aged 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   Still other women have may no choice in the matter; 34 percent
of those surveyed said they have no say in their working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber of Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman said the recent
tight labor markets have prompted more employers to offer
flexibility in schedules to keep workers happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Business groups also have been strongly supporting legislation
to provide more flexible working environments,'' Coleman said. That
includes comp-time and flextime proposals unions have opposed
because of concerns for workers' rights to overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Few statistics are available comparing men's and women's work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Labor Department data, from 1997, showed 14
percent of American women and 19 percent of men working shifts
other than the most common daytime, weekday hours. But it did not
compare shifts of men and women living in the same household.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO poll used a much smaller sample of the
population than the Labor Department did, its findings suggest that
evening and weekend shift work by women may be on the rise: 28
percent of women polled said they work shifts that include some
weekend and evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO survey was conducted by pollsters Lake Snell Perry
and Associates Inc. and has a margin of error rate of plus or minus
3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill Gaining Support  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's China trade bill
appears to have enough support to pass the Senate, if narrowly,
according to an informal head count by Senate sponsors. Support in
the House remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters of the measure count 60 votes in favor of the
pact, just enough to stop potential delaying tactics by opponents,
congressional officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The count suggests that about 30 senators oppose the legislation
and about 10 are undecided, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent the legislation, which would grant China
permanent normal trade relations, to Congress on Wednesday and was
pressing for a final vote in both chambers before Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give China the same permanent trade benefits it
grants most other nations. China's trade status now must be renewed
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is required under a market-opening agreement the
administration struck with China last year to allow Beijing to join
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based international
organization that oversees world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   But given the opposition from organized labor and other interest
groups, the debate is shaping up as the biggest battle of the
election-year Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., has predicted that
as many as two-thirds of House Democrats would oppose the
legislation. That cast doubt on whether Republican leaders could
win passage of the measure given the slim GOP margin of control.
</P>
<P>
   There are 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats and two independents in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart on
Thursday said it's ''early now to start trying to count heads. And
I would suggest that anyone whose putting head count numbers out
now is speculating rather than providing real solid information.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to make that case. And we're hoping that, you
know, sometime in the spring, we can bring this to a vote,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Commerce Secretary William Daley told
reporters after a speech to a business group, ''We probably don't
have the votes right now'' in the House to win. ''It's very
fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the American Council of Life Insurance, Daley
predicted, ''This battle will be over one way or another by
Memorial Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley plans to lead a group of lawmakers to China in April, one
of several trips planned by the administration in its lobbying
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The trade legislation only requires a majority vote in both
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Senate opponents are expected to try to use delaying
tactics to stall the proposal, supporters effectively need 60 votes
rather than 51 to be able to prevail on motions to limit debate.
Those motions require three-fifths of the Senate, or 60 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senate support for the package is stronger than House support.
Trade-liberalizing measures traditionally enjoy more support in the
Senate than in the House. But Senate Finance Committee Chairman
William Roth, R-Del., warned the administration last week not to
take Senate support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The informal head count suggesting sponsors barely have the 60
votes needed suggests that the fight will be a close one even in
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Shepard's 'True West' Is Shattering  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sam Shepard's play ''True West'' is shattering.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this brilliant two hours of theater, the message
has been delivered that America is in worse shape than a
now-trembling theatergoer imagined. Families are beyond fragmented.
When a mother finally notices one son strangling another, she just
walks out of the house. Consumerism runs rampant. Morality is
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   The West isn't an American frontier of natural beauty or
possibilitiies any more. People have given up hope of improving
their lives; they'll settle for change -- any change; they long for
an irretrievable past.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a play first performed 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''True West,'' which opened Thursday at Broadway's Circle in the
Square, conveys its harrowing vision through a tale of two
brothers. And Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, best known
for films (both star in ''Magnolia'' and ''Boogie Nights''), prove
they're highly talented stage actors. They trade parts at some
performances and are superb in both.
</P>
<P>
   ''True West'' begins with Austin, a screenwriter, typing a
script in his mother's suburban kitchen northwest of Los Angeles.
Lee is just back from living for three months in the California
desert. He drinks beer from the can and makes crude comments,
sometimes shouting. He steals TV sets and other household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   After a sleek producer, Saul Kimmer, played by Robert LaPone,
visits Austin and meets Lee, the brothers begin to turn into each
other. At first, they're successful. Lee plays golf with Saul and
sells him an idea for a Western. Austin's script is dropped.
Slipping into his brother's persona, he drinks whiskey and steals
16 toasters.
</P>
<P>
   But role reversal proves to have its limits. Lee can't type, let
alone express his ideas with pen and paper. Austin wants to live in
the desert but he doesn't have the skills. The brothers develop a
murderous rage toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   When their mother (Celia Weston) comes home from vacation she
finds her kitchen drawers dumped, toast underfoot, a typewriter
destroyed by a golf club, and one son choking the other, and leaves
for a motel.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Broadway prices, it's worth going to ''True West'' twice
to watch Hoffman and Reilly switching parts.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly plays Lee with much more menace and the play is more
serious. When Hoffman plays Lee, his taunts of his brother are more
sarcastic than threatening and some of Lee's remarks and tantrums
seem funny.
</P>
<P>
   Director Matthew Warchus keeps the action tight and focused, on
a raised, almost square stage with a back wall of cabinets built on
the Circle in the Square's long oval stage.
</P>
<P>
   The box office will know who plays Lee and Austin at each
performance but it won't be advertised or done on a regular
schedule. They flipped a coin Thursday morning to assign roles on
opening night, with Reilly playing Lee and Hoffman as Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The play premiered off-Broadway in 1980 and was staged again,
still off-Broadway, three years later with John Malkovich and Gary
Sinise, followed by real-life brothers Randy and Dennis Quaid.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, who is also an acclaimed film actor and director, won
the Pulitzer Prize for his 1979 play ''Buried Child.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Challenges Report on Gays  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon challenged a report Thursday that
anti-homosexual abuse in the armed services more than doubled in
the past year, but said it had no statistics of its own.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said neither he nor Defense Secretary William
Cohen had read the report, but would ''take appropriate action'' if
it were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   They were responding to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network
report that said there were 968 incidents of harassment in the
armed services in the past year, including a murder, assaults and
verbal gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers group, which has reported on military harassment
against gays annually for six years, says the problem is worse than
ever, with a record percentage of women discharged for being gay
last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said that in past years
''a lot of their findings have tended to be anecdotal and don't
provide enough concrete information for us to proceed further.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are specifics in this year's survey, we will follow
those up,'' Quigley said at a regular briefing, adding officials
would try to learn whether appropriate action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's inspector general is scheduled to issue a report
on implementation of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy in all of
the services later this month. That report, based partly on a
survey of military personnel, also is intended to assess the level
of anti-gay harassment in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-page report says incidents in fiscal 1999 increased 142
percent from the previous year, which was double the year before
that.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any indicator that I can point to that shows a
great increase,'' he said, but acknowledged later that he did not
know if a count was kept on such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would feel it in readiness reporting. You would feel it in
a variety of ways. And we've just simply not seen that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon officials said there are no figures showing the
total number of incidents because most are handled with a warning
and never reach a point where they would constitute a legal case
that would be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman pointed out that
discharges for homosexuality decreased last year by 10 percent
after several years of increase.
</P>
<P>
   The report included an announcement that the family of Pfc.
Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, Ky., is filing a wrongful death
suit in his July death, charging the military failed to protect
Winchell, who was rumored to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a military jury sentenced Army Pvt. Calvin N.
Glover, 19, to life in prison for the slaying. Prosecutors said he
was driven by hatred of homosexuals to bludgeon Winchell to death
as he slept in his cot.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Police Raid Erotic Hair Shop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVAL, Quebec (AP) -- Women in the Quebec city of Laval suspected
their husbands and boyfriends were getting a bit more than a shave
and a haircut at a local hair salon.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested eight people at Le Salon Sex Symbol, where
stylists stripped, performed exotic dances and talked dirty as they
clipped clients' hair, said Laval police spokesman Guy Lajeunesse.
The 28-year-old owner and a client were caught naked, playing with
a sexual toy and oil, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three female employees and five male customers were charged with
working in or frequenting a house of prostitution, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-month-old undercover investigation started after several
women called police worried that the hairdressers were offering
their husbands and boyfriends sexual services, Lajeunesse said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of the 5-year-old business received haircuts from
scantily-clad women who -- for more money -- showed their breasts,
undressed entirely, performed erotic shows and exchanged caresses,
Lajeunesse said.
</P>
<P>
   Though erotic hair salons are legal if no touching takes place,
police believe patrons at Le Salon Sex Symbol could buy sex,
Lajeunesse said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found some hair on the ground,'' Lajeunesse said. ''One of
the men got his hair cut. They have a few clients who just go for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's supposed to be the main attraction.''

<HEADLINE> House Voting on Taxes, Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overcoming resistance from Republican
conservatives but not President Clinton, the House debated
legislation Thursday that combines a $1 boost in the minimum wage
with a $122 billion tax cut intended to soften the wage increase's
impact on employers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans staged the twin votes to prevent Democrats from
pushing through their own minimum wage increase, which has strong
support from Northeastern Republican moderates who want to defuse
it as a campaign issue in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether we take a thoughtful approach and a
balanced approach, or whether we have an ill-conceived bill foisted
upon us,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a main sponsor of the GOP
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House planned votes later Thursday on legislation that would
increase the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage by $1 over two years, or
possibly a three-year increase like that in a Senate-passed bill.
Votes also were set on the tax legislation, two-thirds of which
consists of cuts in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bill meets Clinton's wish for a two-year wage boost,
the president repeated Thursday he would veto the measure if it
included large tax cuts. Clinton contends the tax relief
disproportionately benefits the wealthy and would consume a chunk
of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering,'' Clinton said. ''Congress should send me a bill I can
sign, not one I have to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, contended the tax package would offset the
costs to business of raising the minimum wage, which many in the
GOP view as a job-killer and hindrance to new investment or
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point is simply, let's find some tax relief to cushion the
blow,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate centered on the estate tax cuts. Costing
$78.6 billion over 10 years, they were portrayed by Democrats as a
giveaway primarily for people with incomes over $319,000 a year.
Democrats were prevented from offering their own, smaller tax
package for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not fighting any tax relief. We're fighting for the
right kind of tax relief,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sponsors said current estate taxes actually prevent small
businesses and family farms from being passed down to heirs and
require costly tax planning simply to ease the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue is, who are the heirs?'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. The tax cut, he
added, ''is not going to benefit the people who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax package also would gradually boost 401(k) contribution
limits and make other pension changes; make health insurance
premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed sooner than
under current law; increase the amount of business meals that can
be deducted; and enact other tax breaks for small business.
</P>
<P>
   The floor debate came after two days of intense negotiations
between GOP leaders and Republican conservatives who threatened to
delay the bill over their desire to allow states to choose whether
to implement the wage increase. The measure had already been
delayed once from last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong, closed-door meeting off the House floor at
midday, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., urged conservatives to
stick with their fellow Republicans. A turning point came when one
Democrat, Jim Traficant of Ohio, walked into the meeting and
bluntly told Republicans that they risked losing their majority in
this fall's election if the minimum wage bill went down, according
to congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the conservatives, Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona,
said later the group agreed to back down ''out of loyalty and
respect'' to Hastert and other GOP leaders, but he described it as
''a gigantic concession by us to the moderates. We are not going to
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the state-flexibility issue was stripped out of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage bill is H.R. 3833.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill is H.R. 3832.

<HEADLINE> Open records bill triggers broad debate in Senate panel, but novote  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Everyone who appeared before the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Thursday agreed New Jersey's 37-year-old law
governing public access to government records is overdue for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to rewrite the law last year became bogged down and no
bill received final approval from either the Senate or Assembly by
the end of the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, spokesmen for municipal governments agreed with
open access to government business, but they cautioned against
proposed expansions that might do more harm than good by exposing
private information about families and their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A new wrinkle emerged on whether nonprofit corporations formed
by governments to manage economic projects should be required to
disclose the contracts they sign with private developers.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Public Records Law mandates that any document
required under statute shall be maintained as a public record. But
it does not apply to vast banks of information at all levels of
government, from consulting reports to land appraisals to bill
receipts, for which there is no specific mention in any state law.
</P>
<P>
   The main bill under consideration now, S-866, expands the 1963
law to create a presumption that all government documents are to be
regarded as public records unless a specific law or executive order
from the governor says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the presumption to release documents would shift
away from secrecy and in favor of requests from public persons --
curious citizens, community activists, news reporters, political
opponents, hostile lawyers, direct-mail marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cafferty, a lawyer for the New Jersey Press Association,
said, ''(Providing records) should not be regarded as some
different thing they have to do. It is an essential function of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   No vote was taken Thursday, but the debate was far-ranging.
</P>
<P>
   William Kearns, attorney for the New Jersey League of
Municipalities, said, ''We are not opposed to making information
available to the public. That is not the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kearns said overhauling four decades of case rulings and
executive orders was hazardous and required caution.
</P>
<P>
   Kearns' favorite example is the list of homes on any given
street which may or may not have burglar alarm systems. He said
legitimate business persons seeking to sell alarm systems might
like a list of homes without such protection, ''but I can think of
other people who might like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafferty said sensitive records can be obtained under current
law, and the proper way to deal with such problems is to outlaw
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''You pass a law regulating the abuse,'' he said. ''You don't
say the records aren't public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, lawyers, citizen activists and newspaper executives
debated how a public-records law could be better enforced, agreeing
the current law provides minimal enforcement and thus invites
flagrant refusals to comply.
</P>
<P>
   It would create a $1,000 fine for public officials or employees
who refuse to comply, and would limit legal expenses for the public
by allowing them to take their complaints to municipal court.
</P>
<P>
   Others said such penalties could intimidate qualified
individuals from accepting municipal employment or from seeking
public office.
</P>
<P>
   Branchburg municipal clerk Sharon Brienza, an officer in a
clerks' association, warned lawmakers an ill-phrased law could put
clerks in a bind between residents who want to see material and
local politicians who want it sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have heard stories where the mayor has told a clerk: Don't
give that information out,'' Brienza said, cautioning lawmakers
that a narrow penalty provision could make it worse for them. She
said penalties must also be written in to specify that supervisors
or elected officials can be fined for pressuring clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can happen. It does happen,'' Brienza said. ''It has to be
addressed.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Step Up Laundering Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to crack down on money laundering, the
government has identified several ''high-intensity zones'' for
increased law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of federal, state and local authorities will be formed in
these areas identified by the Treasury Department as: Los Angeles;
New York City and northern New Jersey; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and
the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, ''a money-laundering action team will be created
... and will proceed this year to launch concentrated enforcement
activities,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat testified
today at a hearing of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces and local prosecutors will be trained in detecting
money laundering, a new activity for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Other geographic areas or industry sectors are expected to be
named in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering is a serious threat to our country because it
facilitates drug trafficking, organized crime and international
terrorism, and because it encourages corruption in foreign
governments, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, deputy attorney general of the Justice Department,
on Wednesday called the administration's new money-laundering
strategy ''a highly ambitious and far-reaching agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee's chairman,
expressed support for the administration's strategy, which includes
a legislative proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to working with the administration ... to pass
meaningful anti-money-laundering legislation this year,'' Leach
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, seeking to stem the flow through
U.S. banks of billions of dollars from drug trafficking and other
illegal activities, also is seeking new powers from Congress to
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative proposal outlined last week by Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers would give the government the authority to ban
financial transactions between offshore financial havens and U.S.
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody needs to come out of the closet and expose them for
what they are,'' said convicted former money launderer Kenneth
Rijock, referring to island nations in the Caribbean that are
havens of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's financial terrorism,'' he said in an interview this week.
A former Miami lawyer who did two years in federal prison, Rijock
explained in an Associated Press story in September how he used to
fly from Florida into islands such as Anguilla and easily deposit
millions of drug dollars into a dummy corporation's local bank
account. Sometimes he and his cohorts used rubber stamps of cartoon
characters as signatures on deposit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at today's hearing was Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has criticized the administration's plan as
insufficient because it gives the Treasury Department discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it. Schumer
and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the House Banking Committee like the
administration's proposal so much they have said they would
co-sponsor it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Leach and the panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John
LaFalce of New York, proposed a stricter measure that would have
required U.S. banks to collect detailed information on their
customers from countries considered to be money-laundering havens.
The administration's proposal would leave it up to Treasury to
decide whether to impose data-collecting requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new strategy, the government is:
</P>
<P>
   --Putting new rules into effect that eventually will require
storefront check cashers and money transmitters, brokerage firms
and casinos to notify authorities of suspicious transactions, as
banks now must do.
</P>
<P>
   --Making some $2.5 million this year in grants to state and local
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors' offices to help them
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Fraud at $13.5 Million  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare lost $13.5 billion last year because
of fraud, waste and mistakes, translating to about 8 cents for
every dollar spent, government auditors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's slightly higher than the $12.6 billion in losses in 1998,
but remains down significantly from losses in the $20-billion range
in previous years by the federal health insurance plan for the
elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said a crackdown on
fraud that began in 1993 is continuing to stem program losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''These results show that our progress is not a one-time
phenomenon but something sustainable on which we can build,'' said
DeParle, testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said lawmakers want to see further
declines in Medicare's losses, noting, ''by any measure, $13.5
billion in losses is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   One troubling finding in the 1999 audit was a big increase in
documentation errors -- one of the most pervasive problems in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors -- when there's little or no paperwork to
determine whether services billed for were actually performed --
caused $5.5 billion in losses. In 1998, those losses were $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said HFCA is testing new documentation guidelines and is
expanding education programs to help providers file claims
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   While last year's estimate of total losses was higher than in
1998, auditors concluded that results for the two years are
similar, statistically speaking, because they are based on randomly
selected claims that may have had a higher dollar value in 1999
purely by chance.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors with the Department of Health and Human Services
Inspector General's office reviewed 5,223 claims from 1999 valued
at $5.4 million. Of those, they found problems with 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the dollar value of the sample bills, auditors estimate
that overall, Medicare paid out $13.5 billion it shouldn't have.
That's 7.97 percent of the $169.5 billion Medicare paid directly to
medical providers, including doctors and hospitals. Billing through
HMOs that participate in Medicare is excluded. In 1998, the error
rate was 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot conclude that the current error rate is
statistically different,'' said Inspector General June Gibbs Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the first year the comprehensive Medicare audit was
done, overpayments accounted for 14 cents of every dollar spent, or
$23 billion. In 1997, 11 cents on the dollar, or $20 billion, was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also renewed an offer on Thursday to go easy on health
care providers who voluntarily confess to fraud or billing
mistakes, pledging not to kick them out of Medicare if they can
show they have fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to encourage providers to come forward and disclose
conduct that threatens federal health care programs,'' Brown said
in a letter to providers. A leniency program for those who turn
themselves in began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Medicare audit showed that documentation errors
occurred mostly at home health agencies, medical equipment
suppliers and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors and medically unnecessary procedures have
accounted for $54.8 billion, or 70 percent of the $69.5 billion in
improper payments made during the four years that HHS has been
tracking Medicare's error rates, auditors estimate.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urges China To Cool Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADENA AIR BASE, Japan (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen
appealed Friday for China and Taiwan to halt their war of words and
said he hoped to visit Beijing this summer to urge restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides should lower the rhetoric and lower the tensions
and then try to work this out in a peaceful fashion rather than one
of intimidation and confrontation,'' Cohen said en route from
Washington to Hong Kong for his first visit to the former British
colony since it reverted to Chinese control in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's Air Force plane stopped to refuel at the U.S. military
base on the island of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The defense chief said he would use his public appearances and
private meetings in Hong Kong to stress the Clinton
administration's view that Taiwan's status must not be settled by
military means.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he hoped the ''rhetorical tensions'' will subside
once Taiwan holds presidential elections March 18.
</P>
<P>
   China sees Taiwan as a renegade province and has said it cannot
rule out using military force if Taiwan tries to gain independence.
Washington recognizes Taiwan as part of ''one China,'' but is
committed to providing the weaponry Taiwan needs to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he hoped to visit China early this summer. He did not
mention a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Cohen is scheduled to meet with Tung Chee Hwa, the
Hong Kong chief executive, and other government officials. He said
he would stress the need for stringent export controls in busy Hong
Kong harbor to prevent the illicit transshipment of narcotics and
materials intended for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme of Cohen's Asia tour -- not just in Hong Kong, but
next week in Vietnam, Japan and South Korea -- will be China and its
sudden shift last month to a more aggressive stance on reuniting
Taiwan with the mainland. More broadly, there is regional concern
about the direction of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pursued a series of high-level visits to
Hong Kong to underscore its determination to help Hong Kong remain
as free and open as it was before Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has a
high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs. Thus, it was China that denied U.S. Navy requests to make
ship visits at Hong Kong after the mistaken U.S. bombing of China's
embassy in Yugoslavia in May.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, U.S. ships have resumed port visits to Hong Kong, most
notably the USS John Stennis aircraft carrier battle group in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're back to pretty much the same routine'' as before the
bombing, Adm. Dennis Blair, commander in chief of U.S. Pacific
Command, told a Pentagon news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he did not discuss future ship visits during a visit
to Beijing in late February.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the weekend in Hong Kong, Cohen is scheduled to
travel to Vietnam on Monday to become the first American secretary
of defense to visit since the Vietnam war ended in April 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His visit comes amid a series of national celebrations of the
communist defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Buys Back $1B of U.S. Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, brimming with cash, bought back
$1 billion of the national debt Thursday in the government's first
repurchase of debt in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department paid $1.345 billion to repurchase the $1
billion -- a tiny fraction of the $5.7 trillion national debt. Of
that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the buyback was ''another historic
landmark in our fiscal turnaround'' and ''a striking reminder of
the extraordinary progress we have made in putting America's fiscal
house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''In the last seven years we moved from the largest
deficit in history to the largest surplus in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenues -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase some debt.
</P>
<P>
   By buying back some of its older, higher-yielding securities,
the government over the long run expects to save money on interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buyback operations are an important debt management tool that
can reduce the cost to the American taxpayer,'' said Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, adding he was pleased with Thursday's
results.
</P>
<P>
   The repurchase was limited to 30-year bonds sold between 1985
and 1990. The Treasury accepted offers on nine of the 13 securities
eligible for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The coupon interest rates on the securities bought back ranged
between 8.875 percent and 11.25 percent, compared with 6.25 percent
on 30-year bonds sold last month.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Treasury plans to buy back another $1 billion
in securities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There appears to be a lot of interest from investors in
this,'' said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research
Corp. in New York. Moreover, ''the economic effects of debt
buybacks over time are tremendous. It puts downward pressure on
rates, which will promote investment and capital spending and that
will add to economic growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bought back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Summers announced that the government planned to buy
back up to $30 billion of the $5.7 trillion national debt this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first budget surplus in 29 years -- $69.2 billion -- occurred
in 1998, followed by last year's record $124.4 billion surplus, the
first back-to-back surpluses since 1956 and 1957, when Dwight
Eisenhower was president.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Medicare Plan Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' chief budget analyst criticized
President Clinton's plan for strengthening Social Security and
Medicare on Thursday, calling it a ''misconception'' to believe it
would have an impact on either program's solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told
the Senate Budget Committee that Clinton's proposal to move
billions of dollars in federal surpluses into the Social Security
and Medicare trust funds would do little to buttress those
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a direct criticism of the president unusual for a CBO
director, Crippen questioned Clinton's claims that building up the
trust funds would help, saying, ''I know he is not alone in that
misconception.''
</P>
<P>
   Crippen added, ''The transfers would not, as some have asserted,
strengthen Medicare or Social Security. At most, they might have
the opposite effect of imparting a false sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Crippen's comments echoed criticisms Republicans have made of
Clinton's plans for helping the two programs, which provide medical
insurance and pensions for more than 40 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that to best prepare Social Security and
Medicare for the coming retirement of the baby boomers, the
programs' revenues will have to be increased or benefits reduced.
</P>
<P>
   CBO has traditionally been a nonpartisan agency. But in recent
months, some Democrats have complained that Crippen -- a GOP
appointee -- has produced some analyses tilted toward Republicans.
Crippen has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said that Crippen's presentation
Thursday was ''biased'' because it did not acknowledge that both
programs would be helped by Clinton's plan for massive debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The millions of Americans who would have access to these
programs for many more years, I am sure, would consider that a very
positive thing,'' spokeswoman Linda Ricci of the White House budget
office said of Clinton's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say that debt reduction strengthens the economy
and should make it easier for the government to raise the revenue
it will need in the future to pay Social Security and Medicare
benefits to baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal 2001 budget Clinton sent Congress last month,
Clinton said his plan would keep Social Security solvent through
2050 and Medicare afloat through 2025 by promising the programs'
trust funds some of the money that the government would save on
interest payments after debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that he would use $2.5 trillion in projected federal
surpluses over the next decade to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Crippen also presented his agency's preliminary analysis of
Clinton's fiscal 2001 budget, which included slightly rosier
projections of federal surpluses than the CBO presented in January.
The improvement of several billion dollars a year was caused by
CBO's expectation of slightly lower spending than it thought two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, CBO said, surpluses are still expected to
total from $900 billion to $1.9 trillion, excluding Social
Security's vast surpluses and depending on how much spending is
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO analysis also said that even with the tax cuts and extra
spending Clinton has proposed, the surplus -- excluding Social
Security -- would still be $423 billion over the next decade. That
is $209 billion more than Clinton himself estimated.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency said under Clinton's plan the government should
be able to retire the $3.6 trillion publicly held debt by 2010 --
assuming that people and institutions who hold Treasury bonds are
willing to sell them back. Clinton has said he wants to retire it
by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national debt is $5.7 trillion. About $3.6 trillion
is held by the public, the rest is money the government owes itself
for Social Security and other trust funds.

<HEADLINE> Lands' End Stocks Jumps 15 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JENNY PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Lands' End's stock jumped 15 percent on
Thursday, bouncing back from an early decline as investors shrugged
off disappointing fourth-quarter results and instead focused on the
possible turnaround of the company this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgeville, Wis.-based catalog giant's shares tumbled more
than 10 percent during morning trading after the company's earnings
missed Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But then investors took note of Lands' End's comment in its
earnings report that it expects a rise in sales and profits by the
end of this year. That led many analysts to raise their earnings
estimates on the company for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gassman, an analyst at the Richmond, Va.-based
investment firm Davenport &AMP; Co., said moves by the company to cut
costs and restructure its business will eventually pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people buy stocks strictly on earnings expectations
vs. reality,'' Gassman said. ''I think things are pretty positive
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End stock finished the day up $4.62}, or about 15
percent, to $35.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. It fell as low
as $27.75 early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $28.32 million, or 92 cents a share in the
quarter ended Jan. 28, compared with $25.69 million, or 84 cents a
share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End's profits missed Wall Street analysts' expectations
of $1.09 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 results include a restructuring charge of $7 million.
Excluding that charge, the company earned $1.07 a share in the
fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter were $449.63 million, down from $542.17
million a year ago. Sales in November and December -- the most
critical selling period of the holiday shopping season -- were down
almost 15 percent from the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, sales were $1.32 billion, down from $1.37 billion
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in sales was somewhat expected. Over the last year,
Lands' End has been scaling back the number of catalogs it sends
out and the size of each catalog. In 1999, the company mailings
declined by 8 percent and the number of pages mailed were down 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth quarter, it eliminated a key catalog at
Thanksgiving and repositioned its catalog sent in January to
include a mix of clearance and full-priced merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End business continues to be hurt by weakness in its core
catalog business, where its well-known product lines -- such as
khakis, T-shirts and dresses -- are featured. Sales were down 9
percent to $780 million.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble with that division was partially offset with strength in
corporate sales, which rose 9 percent to $397 million. Its Internet
business also fared very well, with sales more than doubling from a
year ago to $138 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that more than 20 percent of online buyers are
first-time customers to Lands' End.
</P>
<P>
   ''(We) believe that this channel will continue to be an
important growth opportunity for us,'' Lands' End chief executive
David Dyer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said its cost-cutting measures should begin to
pay off by the end of the year. Lands' End expects profits in the
first quarter to be somewhat weaker than a year ago and sales to be
flat. By the fourth quarter, Lands' End anticipates much-improved
results.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended Jan. 28, the company earned $48.03 million,
or $1.56 a share, compared with $31 million, or $1.01 a share, a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Earnings Rise 3.5 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz posted a 3.5 percent rise in
earnings before special charges for the quarter ending in January
as sales of core products like ketchup and sauces grew in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh-based food company earned $227.2 million, or 63
cents a share, in the three months ended Jan. 26, up from $219.5
million, or 60 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Heniz's earnings bested analysts predictions by a penny a share
for the quarter. A survey of analysts conducted by First
Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings of 62 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The figures did not include special restructuring charges in
both quarters, which brought the net income figures down to $171.1
million and $120.6 million respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues edged higher to $2.29 billion from $2.28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz president and CEO William R. Johnson said the company had
''continued sales increases in ketchup, condiments and sauces,
foodservice, and our businesses across Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares rose 25 cents to $34.50 in trading Thursday
at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Kroger Posts Earnings Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Kroger Co.'s earnings increased in the
fourth quarter and for all of 1999 despite costs of absorbing the
Fred Meyer Inc. supermarket group.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest retail grocer said Thursday it earned $246
million or 29 cents per share, in the three months ended Jan. 29,
up from $234 million or 28 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But its earnings would have been 39 cents a share if the $105
million in costs of merging with Fred Meyer were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   That was a penny a share higher than the 38 cents anticipated by
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger shares fell 56\ cents to $14.81\ in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly sales were $11.24 billion, up slightly from $11.2
billion for the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, Kroger earned $628 million or 73 cents per
share, compared with $237 million and 28 cents a year earlier.
Sales for 1999 totaled $45.35 billion, up from $43.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger said its estimated savings in operating costs as a result
of combining with Fred Meyer totaled $160 million for fiscal 1999,
better than the company's projection of $155 million. Kroger
expects those savings to total $260 million in fiscal 2000, $345
million in fiscal 2001 and $360 million in fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The company's pharmacy sales have more than doubled in the past
five years and Kroger now operates 1,500 pharmacies, management
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates more than 2,300 supermarkets and
multi-department stores in 31 states under names including Kroger,
Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers, Dillon, Fry's, Food 4
Less and Quality Food Centers. Kroger also operates 796 convenience
stores, 389 fine jewelry stores and 42 food processing plants.

<HEADLINE> Census Undercount Could Cost $11.1B  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A population undercount in this year's census
similar to the undercount in 1990 could cause some states to lose
over $11 billion in federal aid, according to a study released
Thursday by a Census Bureau oversight panel.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the presidential appointees of the U.S. Census
Monitoring Board said states with the biggest populations would
take the hardest hit: California would lose $5 billion, and Texas
nearly $2 billion if a more accurate head count doesn't occur, or
if a statistical method known as sampling is not used to counter an
undercount.
</P>
<P>
   The study, accessible on the Internet at www.cmbp.gov, also
shows other states stand to gain funding if the undercount is not
corrected. For instance, Pennsylvania would gain over $2 billion,
and Michigan over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's less a question of not having as much or having more than
it is the money that's intended for other groups,'' board co-chair
Gilbert F. Casellas said. ''While on a statewide basis you may
consider yourself getting a larger number of dollars because of
your count, based on the analysis, certain cities within those
states actually lose out because of the effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Murray, a congressional appointee to the board, said
he enthusiastically supported the report if its purpose was to
spark more people to respond. More people may send forms back if
they know what census results are used for, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if the major point is to use this as a weapon in a
political fight, then I'd be very disappointed,'' Murray said.
There is a ''temptation to say that statistical methods will solve
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates it undercounted 1.4 percent of the
population, and favors using sampling to account for those people,
mostly children, and minorities and residents in urban areas who
tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans favor using a strict head count, claiming it
provides the most accurate statistics possible.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at eight federal programs which comprise 82
percent of the $185 billion allocated to states in 1998. The study
is based on a projected undercount of 1.75 percent in 2000, but
those forecasts are conservative because the Census Bureau has
predicted an undercount of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Court decision mandated that only non-sampled
data be used for reapportioning congressional seats, but left open
the possibility of using sampled data to redraw political
boundaries and redistribute federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is scheduled to release both sampled and
non-sampled data.
</P>
<P>
   The study, performed for the board by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
noted that several urban counties with high concentrations of
minority groups also stand to lose big in the 10 fiscal years
following 2002, when new formulas based on 2000 census figures
could kick in.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member monitoring board was established by Congress to
oversee Census 2000 operations. Four members were appointed by
President Clinton, and four by the Republican-majority Congress.

<HEADLINE> Financial services industry tops list of Giuliani donors  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani may call his Senate race
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton a carpetbagger, but when it comes to
campaign contributions from out of state, he's raking in enough to
fill a few bags of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions of over $200 for the New York City mayor have
poured in from every state except North Dakota, according to an
analysis of his campaign filings released on Thursday by the Center
for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor raised 44 percent of his money from outside New York
when considering donations of $200 or more, the nonpartisan center
found. An earlier analysis by the Washington D.C.-based center
showed the first lady raised 56 percent of similar contributions
from outside New York, taking in donations from 45 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp has been critical of Clinton's out-of-state
fund raising. But the mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum,
defended Giuliani's own money sources by saying the Senate race has
''national significance.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry led Giuliani's donor list,
giving the mayor $1.9 million. Lawyers led Clinton's giving,
donating $666,879, and were closely followed by people in the
entertainment industry, who contributed $439,740.
</P>
<P>
   Within financial services, the securities industry gave Giuliani
$782,000; the real estate industry $488,000; and accountants
$112,000, the center found.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees gave the mayor $781,000 and lawyers gave $429,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Giuliani's top 20 donors were securities firms, with
Credit Suisse First Boston topping the list. The company's
executives and their immediate families donated $121,800 to
Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among Giuliani's collections from out-of-state, $694,000 came
from New Jersey, $448,000 from Texas, $405,000 from Connecticut,
and $380,000 from California.
</P>
<P>
   New York donors who contributed more than $200 apiece gave
Giuliani $4.5 million in total.
</P>
<P>
   CRP Executive Director Larry Makinson scolded the Giuliani
campaign for failing to disclose the occupations or employers for
21 percent of his large contributors, who together gave more than
$1.8 million to the mayor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said Giuliani's nondisclosure ranked ''among the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law requires candidates to make their ''best
effort'' to identify the employers and occupations of donors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp failed to provide occupation information for 5
percent of its donors, who contributed just under $300,000, the
center found. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has raised some $70
million for his presidential bid, has managed to provide
information on 90 percent, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without employer data it is impossible to calculate exactly
which industries and companies have been most generous to a
candidate, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp immediately seized on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just what is Rudy hiding from the people of New York?''
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson asked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Giuliani raised $11.8 million for his Senate campaign,
compared to Clinton's $8 million. The center's analysis considered
only donations over $200 because the candidates are not required to
itemize amounts below that.
</P>
<P>
   That means the analysis does not account for $3.3 million in
donations to Giuliani or $1.9 million to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady continued to rake in money from outside New York
on Thursday, traveling to Omaha, Neb. for a $1,000-per person fund
raiser hosted by billionaire investor Warren Buffet, InfoUSA
founder Vinod Gupta and Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey. Kerry is
leaving the Senate to run the New School University in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, a frequent Democratic donor, contributed $1 million to
the recent White House Millennium celebration organized by the
first lady. Kerrey had reportedly been promoting Gupta for an
ambassadorship to either Bermuda or Fiji, but Gupta didn't get
either job.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in second among Giuliani's donors was a group of 40 real
estate firms affiliated under the umbrella of the Kushner Companies
of Florham Park, N.J. Together, they contributed $86,000 to the
mayor's Senate effort.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc. was another top donor. Together, the pharmaceutical
giant's political action committee, employees, and employees'
families gave $44,994. Employees of the City of New York were also
high on the list. They gave $40,450 to Giuliani's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Those connected to Walt Disney, especially the Miramax films
division, were Clinton's single biggest contributors, with
employees and their families giving the first lady $56,500.

<HEADLINE> Mayor objects to Whitney exhibit linking him to Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is scheduled to be
featured prominently in the upcoming Biennial show at the Whitney
Museum of American Art. Just don't expect him to plunk down his 10
bucks to see the exhibition, in which one piece links him to the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gee, I'll put it on my Palm Pilot,'' Giuliani said
sarcastically Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly unamused by the museum's plans to put the piece
by New York artist Hans Haacke into its own room during the
prominent show, Giuliani promised that his objections would not
reach the level of those stirred by a dung-decorated painting of
the Virgin Mary displayed last year at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brooklyn Museum receives a large part of its operating
budget from the city, the Whitney gets only a small amount of city
money, mostly for various educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people want to engage in desecrating religion or attacking
people's ethnicity or race, then in America -- even though it's
difficult to accept for a lot of people -- people have a right to do
that,'' said Giuliani. ''But they've got to use their own money to
do it. They have to pay for it themselves. You can't be using
taxpayer's money to do the kinds of things that were being done at
the Brooklyn Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Brooklyn Museum drew Giuliani's ire by
including in its much-hyped ''Sensation'' show a portrait of the
Virgin Mary by British artist Chris Ofili that incorporated
elephant dung and cutouts of nude female body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who said the painting demeaned Catholics, halted city
funding to the museum and kept the issue on front pages by
complaining about the painting almost every day for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge eventually ruled that the city could not
withhold money and the museum's funding was restored.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the piece is ''Sanitation'' by New York artist Hans
Haacke -- a work inspired by the Brooklyn Museum brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born Haacke's installation consists of a wall lined
with a row of garbage cans, each containing a speaker playing an
audiotape of marching soldiers. On a wall above will be a copy of
the First Amendment framed in gold and six printed quotations --
three from Giuliani discussing the Ofili painting, and three from
prominent conservatives, including Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The quotations are in Gothic typescript -- a style said to be
favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Giuliani quotes says: ''I would ask people to step
back and think about civilization. Civilization has been about
trying to find the right place to put excrement, not on the walls
of museums.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, the mayor promises to ''remove funding for the
Brooklyn Museum until the director comes to his senses.'' The third
quote states that since the museum has ''no compunction about
putting their hands in the taxpayers' pockets,'' Giuliani had no
''compunction about putting them out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The other remarks are from Helms, Reform Party presidential
candidate Patrick Buchanan and Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson
criticizing public funding of art they deem offensive. Buchanan is
quoted as saying: ''This elite cries 'censorship' and falls back
upon that last refuge of the modern scoundrel, the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that what bothered him most about reports
about Haacke's work is its downplaying of the significance of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an issue here about demeaning the whole historical
and contemporary importance of the Holocaust, and when people
misuse descriptions like that, in essence, they do a grave
injustice to the people who suffered in the Holocaust and to the
reality of what the Holocaust is all about,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is scheduled to open March 23.

<HEADLINE> Art Exhibit Jabs at NYC Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An upcoming exhibit at the Whitney Museum of
American Art all but calls Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a Nazi, with
quotations from the mayor written in Gothic typeface and audio
speakers playing a recording of marching soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, scheduled to be featured prominently in a Whitney
exhibition of new American art, was prompted by Giuliani's decision
to cut off funding to the Brooklyn Museum of Art for its display of
a painting of the Virgin Mary plastered with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly unamused by the new piece, Giuliani said he would
not make an issue out of it. He pointed out that the Brooklyn
Museum receives a large part of its operating budget from the city,
while the Whitney gets only a small portion of city money, mostly
for educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people want to engage in desecrating religion or attacking
people's ethnicity or race, then in America -- even though it's
difficult to accept for a lot of people -- people have a right to do
that,'' Giuliani said. ''But they've got to use their own money to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Giuliani said Chris Ofili's painting of the Virgin
Mary in the Brooklyn Museum's ''Sensation'' exhibit demeaned
Catholics. He halted city funding to the museum and kept the issue
alive for weeks by venting against the painting almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   A court later ruled that the city could not withhold money, and
funding was eventually restored.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy led to the new piece -- ''Sanitation,'' by New
York artist Hans Haacke.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born Haacke's installation consists of a wall lined
with a row of eight to 12 garbage cans, each containing a speaker
playing a tape of marching soldiers. On a wall above will be a copy
of the First Amendment framed in gold -- and six quotations, three
from Giuliani discussing the Ofili painting, and three from
conservatives, including Republican North Carolina Sen. Jesse
Helms.
</P>
<P>
   The quotations are printed in the Gothic style said to be
favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Giuliani quotations reads: ''Civilization has been
about trying to find the right place to put excrement, not on the
walls of museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The other remarks are from Helms, potential Reform Party
presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan and Christian broadcaster
Pat Robertson, criticizing public funding of art they deem
offensive. Buchanan is quoted as saying: ''This elite cries
'censorship' and falls back upon that last refuge of the modern
scoundrel, the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The work was commissioned by the Whitney, which said it did not
know ahead of time exactly what Haacke would produce. The museum
said it notified the mayor of the work as a courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that what bothered him most was that
Haacke's work demeaned ''the whole historical and contemporary
importance of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When people misuse descriptions like that, in essence, they do
a grave injustice to the people who suffered in the Holocaust and
to the reality of what the Holocaust is all about,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> Soy OKd as School Meat Substitute  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tofu and soyburgers may be coming soon to
school lunch menus. What will the kids say?
</P>
<P>
   ''Disgusting,'' said Greg Dudzinski, 17, of Ripon High School in
Ripon, Wis., as he toured the Capitol on Thursday. ''The regular
hamburgers are bad enough, so soyburgers'd be a lot worse,''
offered Zach Richey, 13, of Scottsboro Junior High in Scottsboro,
Ala., another tourist.
</P>
<P>
   But the government -- hoping to reduce the amount of fat that
children are eating -- on Thursday approved the use of soy as a meat
substitute in federally subsidized meals for schools and day-care
centers. The change will allow schools to offer an array of new
soy-based products, including tacos and burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all young people oppose the change.
</P>
<P>
   Mariel Spano, 17 of Sandy Creek High School in Syracuse, N.Y.,
also visiting the Capitol, said she likes soyburgers: ''They're
less greasy, and they're better for you.... They taste the same,
they're just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan administration tried to make soy a meat substitute
nearly two decades ago -- at the same time it tried to reclassify
ketchup as a vegetable -- but later dropped the idea. At the time,
the proposals were intended as a cost-cutting move. Agriculture
Department officials say their motive now is only to make meals
healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have been restricted to using soy as a food additive and
only in amounts of less than 30 percent. Effective April 10, USDA
is dropping that limit and also will no longer require that soy be
fortified with iron and zinc, nutrients found in meat.
</P>
<P>
   The change will also apply to some other protein food additives
such as fruit purees and whey, which is derived from milk.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the move, USDA officials said they were trying to
''enhance the flexibility of menu planners in finding ways to
reduce fat and saturated fat in the meals they plan as well as ...
to meet the increasingly varied dietary demands of students.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA approved yogurt as a meat substitute in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new rule will allow schools to offer meatless
entrees -- tofu-stuffed ravioli is one menu possibility -- schools
are more likely to use it to increase the amount of soy that they
blend into hamburgers and other fare already on their menus.
Schools will also be looking to food companies to develop new soy
products that children will like.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see putting tofu on a student's plate and having a
good acceptance. I can see taking a product that's familiar with
the students and enhancing it with a larger amount of soy and
having it be acceptable,'' said Jill Benza, director of food
services for the Mesa, Ariz., schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can be sure we're going to do taste-testing with students
as we get into those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools have told the department they are having trouble
complying with government limit on the fat content of meals -- 30
percent of total calories -- despite taking steps like cutting the
amount of cheese on pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   A standard soyburger, which contains no meat, would have 3 grams
of fat, compared to 16 in a beef patty, and a significant amount of
calcium. But the soyburger would have a third less protein than the
beef patty and less iron.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock producers opposed USDA's move, saying that a high soy
content will give meat a bad reputation and that children will be
deprived of the iron and zinc they need. USDA officials say
children get plenty of both nutrients if their meals are balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ketchup isn't a vegetable and soy isn't beef,'' said Mary
Young, executive director of nutrition for the National Cattlemen's
Beef Association.
</P>
<P>
   About 26 million children eat lunch for free or at reduced
prices through the $6 billion federal program.

<HEADLINE> Airline denies passenger's claim that door was opened at 12,000feet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Airlines and federal regulators
denied a passenger's claim Thursday that crew members opened a door
on the plane at 12,000 feet to pull in a loose strap.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members aboard Flight 1558 from Miami to Newark pulled in a
strap through rubber door seals on the Boeing 727, a procedure
approved by the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 137 passengers on board the Wednesday flight may
have heard a rush of air and felt their ears pop when the pilot
adjusted the pressure in the cabin to fly at a different altitude,
but opening a door at 12,000 feet would have been impossible, the
airline said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be similar to trying to open a door on a car
traveling at 300 miles per hour,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred shortly after the plane left Miami at 1:30
p.m. The pilot leveled off to 12,000 feet before the strap was
pulled in, American spokesman Chris Chiames said. The flight
arrived on time in Newark at 4:30 p.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Cora Diaz, 39, of Kendall, Fla., told The Star-Ledger
of Newark in Thursday editions that she saw the flight engineer and
two crew members unlock the door and push it. As the cabin pressure
changed, crew members retrieved the strap, which she said ended in
a metal buckle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody picked up their heads and said, 'What's going on?
What's going on?''' said Diaz, 39.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from The Miami Herald who was on board the flight
said that the pilot said the strap's buckle was banging against the
plane and he feared it could be sucked into an engine, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and the FAA denied that the strap had a buckle on
it. Chiames said the strap had some small snaps, but said a buckle
could not have been pulled through a door seal.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the procedure is an acceptable one,
approved by the airline and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The strap was inadvertently left hanging out of the door by food
service workers, the airline said.

appointments, has said: ''I will protect a woman's right to
choose,''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FINANCE:
</P>
<P>
   Bush: Ban soft money from corporations and unions, not from

   Gore: Yes, openly.
</P>
<P>
   Recognize gay marriage?

<P>
   DEFENSE:
</P>
<P>
   Increase military spending?

weapons research and development, $1 billion more a year for
military pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Yes, amount unspecified.

   WELFARE:
</P>
<P>
   Bush: $8 billion plan in first year to encourage churches and
other groups to assume more responsibility for needy, through tax
breaks and other incentives. Signed Texas law toughening
enforcement of child-support orders.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Says all states, to get federal child-support aid, should
require parents who are responsible for child support payments to
have a job. Parents would get government help if needed to find
work. Would seek to deny new credit cards to parents delinquent in
child support by having federal government give personal
information on deadbeats to credit bureaus. Greater role for
churches and other groups in helping needy.

<HEADLINE> Street Crime Unit cops accused of attacking four minorities  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police officers from the controversial Street
Crime Unit have been accused of terrorizing four Ivy League
graduates, all minorities, as they drove through Manhattan late one
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs -- two men and two women -- said Thursday that none
of the plainclothes officers identified themselves as cops or
showed badges. Their federal civil rights lawsuit against the NYPD,
the Street Crime Unit, and several officers, alleges the cops used
excessive force and unlawfully detained them. The lawsuit, which
seeks unspecified damages, alleges race is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident vividly shows the price citizens pay for the
aggressive tactics employed by the Street Crime Unit and
demonstrates that it is not only the residents of minority
neighborhoods who suffer from these tactics, but also the city's
best and brightest young professionals,'' said the plaintiffs'
attorneys, Richard D. Emery and Jonathan S. Abady.
</P>
<P>
   Police are telling a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said cops believed the
car the plaintiffs were in was stolen and they made every attempt
to stop it, but the driver would not pull over. The officers used
''minimum force'' in making the arrests, McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed officers were also present at the scene, he added.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis also stressed that none of the plaintiffs nor their
attorneys have filed complaints with the NYPD's Internal Affairs
Bureau or the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit has been under heavy criticism since four
white officers fired 41 bullets at West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in February 1999, killing him instantly as he stood,
unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. Last
month, all four officers were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting prompted Police Commissioner Howard Safir to
put many of the plainclothes unit back in uniform because of
criticism that residents could not identify the unit's officers as
cops. However, most of the officers still work in plainclothes;
cops making the unit's arrests are in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Officers with the unit are responsible for patrolling high-crime
neighborhoods looking for illegal guns and other criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plaintiffs -- Jason Rowley, 25, Sheldon Gilbert,
24, Lauren Sudeall, 23, and Marie Claire Lim, 23 -- their run-in
with police began shortly after they left work at the Magic
Beanstalk, a start-up Internet company based in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley is a Brown graduate; the other three graduated from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   All four were in Rowley's 1994 Toyota Camry near Union Square in
Manhattan when at about 11:30 p.m., on Jan. 10. Rowley pulled the
car over to let Sudeall and Lim out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, that's when a car resembling a yellow
taxicab screeched to a halt in front of Rowley's vehicle. A man
jumped out and pointed a gun at Rowley; soon, other men began
piling out of the yellow car.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fearing for his life and the lives of his passengers, Rowley
ducked behind the steering wheel, put the car in reverse, and drove
backwards to escape,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowley couldn't go anywhere because he was blocked in by
another unmarked police car. When he stopped, Detective Robert
Williamson allegedly smashed the driver's side window and pulled
Rowley through it, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   After being handcuffed, Rowley said he was hit, punched, kicked
and then hit with a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was going to shoot me,'' Rowley, who is black,
said at a news conference. ''I was ripped out of my car, handcuffed
and beaten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plainclothes officer pulled Gilbert, who is black, from
the car, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gilbert was then punched and received many blows to his body
and head from two police officers while he was lying on the
ground,'' the lawsuit said. ''A police officer then threw Gilbert's
torso over a concrete barricade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert claimed he put his hands up immediately when he saw
police approaching him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had no badges, no IDs. The approach to the car was very
hostile,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lim, a Filipina, and Sudeall, were ordered out of the car and
handcuffed. Sudeall has one parent who is black, another white.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was absolutely terrified for our lives,'' said Lim. ''I was
very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said police saw Rowley run a red light and ran his
license plate. The car came back as a stolen vehicle and police
began to follow. At the news conference, Rowley said his car was
stolen in November 1999 and he reported it to the police. A few
days later, police found and returned it to him.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, the ''alarm'' -- a police term meaning the
car was reported stolen -- was still on the car on Jan. 10. Police
did not immediately know why.
</P>
<P>
   All four plaintiffs were taken to the 13th Precinct in
Manhattan, where they were questioned. Rowley was charged for
reckless endangerment and reckless driving. The charges were later
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The Center for Constitutional Rights filed a
class-action federal lawsuit alleging the Street Crime Unit
discriminates when it ''stops and frisks'' residents. The lawsuit
seeks to eliminate frisks that occur without probable cause for
officers to believe a crime has been committed.

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs Terror Victims' Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously
approved legislation Thursday that would make it easier for former
hostages and other victims of state-sponsored terrorism to collect
judgments they win in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., would set up a process for successful U.S.
plaintiffs to recover from countries on the State Department's list
of nations that sponsor or support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the bill, claiming it could
result in retaliation against U.S. diplomatic properties abroad.
But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Congress last month
she was willing to work with former terrorism victims and their
families to find a way to help them collect.
</P>
<P>
   The measure moved toward a Senate vote at a time such judgments
have been piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who might benefit from the legislation are the
families of four Americans killed when their small plane was shot
down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996; former American hostages held
in Lebanon in the 1980s; the family of Alisa Flatow, an American
college student killed in Israel by Islamic terrorists; and the
families of victims of Pan Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   No one has collected anything even though U.S. courts have
awarded hundreds of millions in judgments under a 1996 law allowing
the suits. The new legislation would require the U.S. government to
help the victims and their families collect from frozen assets.
</P>
<P>
   The administration in the past has gone to court to block these
plaintiffs from collecting, even though Clinton initially requested
the 1996 legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president pledged to fight terrorism, made promises to
victims families, encouraged them to seek justice and signed
several laws supporting the rights of victims to take terrorists to
court,'' Mack said after the vote. ''But ultimately he has chosen
to protect terrorists assets over the rights of American citizens
seeking justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lautenberg: ''This brings us one step closer to deterring
terrorist attacks against Americans abroad and to obtaining
compensation for the Flatow family and for victims of terrorism
here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act would free frozen
assets to satisfy U.S. court judgments in terrorism cases. It does
give the president authority to protect diplomatic properties from
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 1796.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Panel Deadlocks  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal advisory panel searching for ways to
publicly monitor gene therapy research failed Thursday to make
final decisions, but planned to meet again in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by the first death of a patient caused by gene therapy
and a groundswell of public concern, the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee is trying to establish a new system that would compel
researchers to file public reports on any illness or death by
patients enrolled in genetic experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to do this, or it will be done for us,''
said Sue L. Levi-Pearl, science director of the Tourette's Syndrome
Association and a committee member. ''We need to take a very hard
look at what we can do to improve and to protect the public
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, which advises the National Institutes
of Health, recommended changes in regulations that would stiffen
the NIH reporting requirements of researchers now permitted to
conduct human experiments in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the 15-member committee could not reach an agreement on
details of the plan. The chairman, Claudia A. Mickelson of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said they would meet again
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see us address this issue until it is dead,''
Mickelson said at the end of a two-hour committee debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee must deal with a formal appeal from
biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin, who wants a moratorium on
gene therapy research. Rifkin said in a letter that in the past 10
years, gene therapy research has ''run amok'' and failed to live up
to its promise of finding cures for disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are compelled to report to the Food and Drug
Administration all serious adverse health effects experienced by
patients in gene therapy trials. But, by regulation, the FDA cannot
publicly release these reports.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations also require researchers to report adverse
events to the NIH, which can release the reports to the public. But
many researchers earlier ignored the NIH reporting, some saying
they were reluctant because publicizing the reports would violate
patient confidentiality or reveal trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The issue moved into the spotlight in September after an Arizona
teen-ager, Jesse Gelsinger, died at the University of Pennsylvania
four days after being injected with a genetic drug designed to
correct a liver disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has halted the program and charged that Pennsylvania
researchers failed to appropriately report problems with the
research.
</P>
<P>
   Other death and illnesses among gene therapy patients have since
been reported. One death in Florida may have been caused by gene
therapy, although autopsy results are unclear. Gene therapy
programs at least two other centers have been suspended. Some
members of Congress have expressed concern that the public is being
mistrustful of gene therapy research.
</P>
<P>
   After Gelsinger's death, the advisory committee sent out letters
to researchers, insisting that they report all gene therapy adverse
events to the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Patterson, executive secretary of the NIH Office of
Biotechnology Activities, the committee's parent office, said
Thursday that the agency received 970 adverse reports in 1999, most
of which arrived after the committee's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Already in 2000, she said, researchers have reported 464 adverse
events.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that of 1999's total, only 85 were considered
serious. In 2000, 43 of the 464 reports were considered serious.

<HEADLINE> Fisheries' Management Said Failure  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Management of the nation's fisheries has been
an expensive flop for much of the last decade, a nationwide
coalition of environmentalists and fishermen's groups said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ineffective policies have led to depleted stocks on both coasts,
prompting the federal government to spend $160 million since 1994
on disaster relief for fishermen, according to the Marine Fish
Conservation Network.
</P>
<P>
   Congress now is considering another $421 million for programs
including boat buybacks and job training programs for fishermen
affected by the collapse of stocks of crab, salmon and groundfish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not criticizing giving money to fishermen to help them
weather disasters, but we are criticizing the management that led
to the disasters,'' said Lee Crockett, executive director of the
Conservation Network, a 19-member organization including the Sierra
Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Fish Forever and the
National Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing industry in the Pacific Northwest has received the
most disaster relief since 1994, due to declines in the salmon
harvest. Last year, the Bering Sea crab fishery in Alaska
collapsed, which the coalition said was the result of lack of
action by government officials to prevent overfishing, habitat
destruction and ''bycatch'' -- the unintentional harvest of
non-target fish.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett said regional fishery management councils, made up of
industry representatives, scientists and state government officials
who formulate plans for managing fisheries, are to blame for the
problems. The councils have failed to enforce existing regulations,
which has led to overfishing and closures of fishing areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also says the National Marine Fisheries Service --
which has final say on regional plans -- has provided poor
oversight. The groups noted that last year the agency acknowledged
it did not know the status of nearly 75 percent of the nation's
managed fish stock.
</P>
<P>
   New England Regional Fishery Management Council spokeswoman
Patricia Fiorelli said ''there's certainly room from improvement,
no argument there.'' But she defended the councils.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always a balancing act trying to put in conservation
measures and balance it against how it's going to impact
communities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., sponsored 1996 legislation that set
criteria for determining when a fishery is overfished and how those
areas should be revitalized. Gilchrest said the bill did not go far
enough. So, he is sponsoring a coalition-backed measure this year
that seeks to ''err on the side of conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that proposal, councils would be required to take entire
marine ecosystems into account when granting permits and to ensure
new fishing gear or practices would not hurt habitats.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to its first
close above 5,000 Thursday as the technology shares that dominate
its ranks lifted the entire stock market. High-tech stocks also
pulled the Dow Jones industrials out of a slump and sent them
climbing more than 150 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 149.60 to close at 5,046.86, easily
topping its previous record close of 4,914.79, set last Friday. The
Nasdaq smashed through its latest thousand-point milestone just
over two months after it first closed above 4,000. By contrast, it
took the Dow nearly nine months to rise from 4,000 to 5,000 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 154.20 to 10,010.73, a gain largely driven by
technology components including Hewlett-Packard and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 34.99 to 1,401.69, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies set its own record, soaring 11.39 to 606.12.
</P>
<P>
   Surging shares of computer companies powered the Nasdaq.
Investors snapped up shares of the computer networking company
Cisco Systems, up 6 15/16 to 139 5/16, and the name-your-price
Internet retailer Priceline.com, which rose 6[ to 93 11/16. Chip
maker Intel rose 3 7/16 to 118].
</P>
<P>
   Companies that build networks for the Internet also thrived.
Redback Networks soared 32 3/16 to 359~ after announcing it will
split its stock two shares for one. It's the second split for
Redback since the company went public last May, a sign of
technology companies' ability to finance their rapid growth by
selling their coveted stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-growing companies like Redback are largely responsible for
the Nasdaq's speedy ascent to 5,000. The Nasdaq briefly crossed
5,000 on Tuesday, but fell back as investors cashed in stocks to
capture profits from its stunning rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, is
up 24 percent, while the Dow, which has been depressed by concerns
about industrial company profits, is down 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are tired of hearing about the new economy vs.
the old economy, but that's where it comes down,'' said Ralph
Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora, one of Wall Street's most relentlessly bullish
analysts, said he expects the Nasdaq to reach 6,000 within 12 to 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're an astute observer, your portfolio will reflect
what's new and exciting and dynamic,'' he said. ''A lot of those
are the companies that are in the Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange also
rose Thursday. Computer maker Hewlett-Packard soared 11 to 151~.
America Online rose 6] to 61\.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, off 117 points in early trading, slumped for most of
the session on continuing fears of rising interest rates. Analysts
said those worries, which contributed to a 570-point Dow plunge in
the first two sessions of this week, are still evident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow is fighting with itself to do a little bit better, but
I really don't see much that's changed,'' said Larry Lawler,
manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York. ''It's all
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a wide range of industrial stocks fell, indicating a
lack of conviction about the merits of blue-chips, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies fell 1 3/16 to 48 1/16, Eastman Kodak fell
1{ to 54 15/16 and 3M lost 1| to 80 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' move away from blue-chips has gathered force in
recent weeks amid a growing sense that those companies are most
vulnerable if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, investors have poured money into technology
stocks at the expense of blue-chip industrial stocks, wagering that
the venture capital and other private investments favored by many
technology companies will dry up more slowly than increasingly
expensive bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every
two that fell.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.37 billion shares, compared with
1.48 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Dips Vs. Major Currencies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against other currencies
Thursday, despite another rebound on Wall Street, as relatively
tame jobless numbers did little to aggravate interest rate worries.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 96.75 cents, up
from 96.11 cents late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at
106.46 Japanese yen, down from 107.04.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar failed to get a lift from the stock market, which
posted another strong day following its harrowing plunge on
Tuesday. Higher prices for Treasury bonds didn't help the dollar
either.
</P>
<P>
   Traders brushed off a report from the Labor Department showing
that unemployment benefits edged up last week. Markets already
expect another rate increase from the Federal Reserve March 21, and
the jobless report did little to worsen the outlook for higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The yen made more headway against the dollar, despite the
lingering threat of intervention from the Bank of Japan, as some
good indicators out of Japan lifted sentiment about that country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   January machinery orders and several other economic reports came
in stronger than expected, raising hopes about improving sentiment
in the Japanese business world.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6608 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6716, and 1.4582 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4562. The
British pound rose to $1.5823 from $1.5818.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0215
German marks, down from 2.0350; 6.7799 French francs, down from
6.8251; and 2,001.31 Italian lire, down from 2,014.64.

<HEADLINE> Wage Bill Promoted by Ohio Rep.  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant played a key
role in persuading rebellious Republicans to help clear passage of
a minimum wage bill, GOP officials said Thursday, warning that they
they risked losing their majority if they failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Traficant, D-Ohio, spoke up at a midday meeting of Republican
conservatives where Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., appealed for
their support on a procedural vote.
</P>
<P>
   His message was ''if you start losing stuff like this you're
going to be in the minority,'' one GOP aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democrat, Traficant ordinarily could be expected to favor a
takeover of the House by his own party, in part because it would
leave him in line for a subcommittee chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have courted him, though -- giving him the right to
sponsor a key amendment in the minimum wage debate, for example.
His spokesman, Paul Marcone, said the veteran lawmaker believes the
Democratic leadership backed a rival in this week's primary
election in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   John Del Cecato, a spokesman at the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, strongly disputed that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fully supported Congressman Traficant and did everything in
our power to help him,'' he said, including making a campaign
contribution and advising other donors to do likewise. An aide to
House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said Traficant
expressed his thanks in a conversation on the House floor during
the day for the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, serving his eighth term in the House, disclosed
recently that he expected to be named in a federal indictment
stemming from a corruption probe in the Youngstown area of Ohio,
which he represents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Traficant beat federal charges of taking bribes from
mobsters. Though he is not a lawyer, he defended himself in court
and successfully argued that he took $163,000 in mob money only to
use as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The self-defense helped create a wave of popularity that carried
him to election to Congress in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was struggling to ease an intraparty controversy over
the minimum wage bill when he convened the meeting of conservatives
just off the House floor. Traficant had offered in advance to
attend, and Hastert invited him after the session was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Marcone said Traficant ''talked passionately about the need to
pass the minimum wage and he had a lot of nice things to say about
Dennis Hastert.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Traficant told Republicans the legislation
was ''the right thing to do and they should rally around their
speaker. He was saying that as a Democrat, but this is good for the
Democrats and they should support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage. But the
election-year pressure from Democrats and some Republicans was
unstoppable, and the GOP leadership decided to craft a companion
package of tax breaks to mollify business groups who oppose an
increase in the wage floor.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats opposed the tax cuts, saying they were tilted
toward the wealthy. But Traficant dissented in remarks on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''A tax break for the boss who raises their wages is a decent
tradeoff to me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thursday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil prices rebounded somewhat Thursday from a drubbing
that raised questions about how much oomph is left in the year-long
bull market, reversing course when a refinery shutdown in Texas
renewed worries about dwindling supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline, too, climbed back 4 percent higher as energy
commodities increased across the board.
</P>
<P>
   In other futures markets, hogs and copper advanced.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a nearly $3-a-barrel tumble -- the biggest price drop
since 1990 and highest one-day percentage decline since December
1998 -- crude showed staying power above the $30 threshold. Light,
sweet crude for April delivery rose 43 cents to $31.69 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The gains came late in an up-and-down session on news that a
67,000-barrel-a-day unit at a refinery in Deer Park, Texas, had
been shut down due to a problem discovered in an inspection on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The outage turned out to be much less serious than traders
initially thought, and the gasoline-producing unit at the refinery
-- a joint venture of Shell Oil and the Mexican state oil firm Pemex
-- was restarted late Thursday. But with U.S. and world stockpiles
perilously low, the market hypersensitive to any supply disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''This refinery outage underscores just how nervous this market
is right now about supplies,'' said Phil Flynn, energy markets
analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The rise came despite word from Mexican Oil Minister Luis Tellez
that his country and Norway -- top producers who are participating
in the Mideast cartel's clampdown on output -- will hike production
in April, a move OPEC is increasingly likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''OPEC is talking, and it looks like we're going to get a raise
in production,'' said Flynn. ''But we're going to go back to
reality, which is that even if they raise production, we're still
tight in supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   April unleaded gasoline rose 3.62 cents to 98.80 cents a gallon,
April heating oil rose 1.15 cent to 76.46 cents a gallon and April
natural gas rose 7.6 cents to $2.786 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   April Brent crude from the North Sea rose 49 cents to $29.29 a
barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs rose 2.2 percent to a one-month high on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after beef prices leaped to the highest level
this year. Analysts said that should prompt retailers to save money
by buying more pork loins in place of beef.
</P>
<P>
   April lean hogs rose 1.30 cent to 60.75 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Copper jumped higher on the Comex division of the New York Merc
on a technically driven rally helped by the rise in U.S. stock
markets. Copper prices often rise and fall with economic data, as
its fate is closely tied to the health of the construction industry
and demand for new housing.
</P>
<P>
   May copper settled up .95 cent at 79.90 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Pakistan Visit a Must  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday it would be
''a grave mistake'' to see his visit to Pakistan as a stamp of
legitimacy on the military leaders who ousted a democratic
government there last October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the best way to promote America's interests in
Pakistan -- a U.S. ally during the Cold War -- is through continued
contact. ''It would be a mistake not to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president is to visit Pakistan late this month at the end of
a five-day visit to India and a brief stop in Bangladesh. The
administration debated for weeks whether to include Pakistan on the
president's itinerary, fearing that a visit to the country's
capital, Islamabad, would be seen as an endorsement of army chief
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who led a coup against former prime minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   India waged a concerted lobbying campaign to keep Clinton from
going to Pakistan, its arch rival. Pakistan waged an equally strong
drive to persuade Clinton to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton decided to stop in Pakistan for a few hours.
He is expected to meet with Musharraf and also seek an opportunity
to speak to the Pakistani people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that our ability to have a positive influence on the
future direction of Pakistan -- in terms of the restoration of
democracy, in terms of the ultimate resolution of issues in the
Indian subcontinent and in terms of avoiding further dangerous
conflicts -- will be greater if we maintain our cooperation,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with reporters on the South Grounds of the White House
after a meeting with Democratic allies to push the Republican-led
Congress to approve new a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Senate Democrats embraced the president's blueprint, agreeing to
end competition among legislative proposals by several senators and
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we are moving forward together by uniting around common
principles, setting standards that any prescription drug plans
should meet,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Clinton said he had asked the White House
counsel's office to deal with a request by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ill.,
chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, for hundreds of
thousands of e-mails sent to the White House, some of which may
relate to fund-raising irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they will handle it just fine,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Drop to 8.23 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates, for the third week in a row,
inched down this week, reflecting investors' belief that the
Federal Reserve will be able to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year mortgages slipped to 8.23
percent for the week ending March 10, down from 8.27 percent the
week before, according to a weekly survey released Thursday by
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year
high of 8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent
rate for the week ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also
fell this week with an average rate of 7.81 percent, compared with
the average rate of 7.84 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.68 percent this week, unchanged from the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy continues to show strength, inflation remains tame
and the market is confident the Fed is serious about keeping
inflation in check. All of this has led to the stabilization we see
in today's vibrant mortgage market,'' said Freddie Mac's chief
economist, Robert Van Order.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending March 3
increased 18.2 percent from the previous week and were down 22.3
percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Loses Longtime Executive  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is losing the executive who ran its
wireless business since 1997 but was passed over for the top slot
of the new wireless company AT&AMP;T is creating with an IPO of a new
tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Hesse announced Thursday he is leaving to pursue a trail
taken by several AT&AMP;T executives in recent years, joining a small
startup with a plan to provide better and faster ways to transport
a rising flood of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Hesse's decision to leave wasn't a shocker, even though he'll be
sacrificing guaranteed riches in what may be the biggest initial
public offering in history, the upcoming sale of a new stock
representing AT&AMP;T's wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Many major companies are grappling with the flight of talented
executives looking to run their own show and strike it rich in the
Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T likely knew it was choosing between Hesse and
John Zeglis when it named Zeglis the CEO of the new Wireless Group
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Zeglis, another highly regarded veteran, may not have stuck
around much longer, having been passed over twice for AT&AMP;T's top
spot in the past few years: first when John Walter was named to
replace longtime CEO Robert Allen, and then when current CEO C.
Michael Armstrong was named to replace Walter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the hottest job market ever in these
executives' careers, an extraordinary job market for executives
that have experience in running communications networks,'' said
AT&AMP;T spokesperson Adele Ambrose. ''Many AT&AMP;T executives' phones are
literally ringing off the hook. My phone is ringing off the hook.
We have a lot of talent here and a deep bench and they're willing
to pay huge bucks for people with experience at a company like
AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   Hesse, who presided over the introduction of AT&AMP;T's hugely
successful Digital One Rate wireless calling plan, is joining a
small Seattle-based venture named TeraBeam Networks as president
and chief executive officer. The privately held company is planning
to provide high-speed Internet connections with a combination of
wireless and optical technologies, two of the hottest sectors in
the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   Mohan Gyani, a veteran industry executive who was hired in
December as the chief financial officer of the new AT&AMP;T Wireless
Group, will succeed Hesse as president and chief executive officer
of the group's core mobile phone business.
</P>
<P>
   Other former AT&AMP;T executives who've gambled for big Internet
paydays include Alex Mandl, who now runs the wireless network
operator Teligent; Joseph Nacchio, who runs AT&AMP;T rival Qwest
Communications; and Robert Annunziata, who just stepped down from
the helm of Global Crossing, a network builder and operator now
being run by Leo Hindery, the recently departed chief of AT&AMP;T's
push into cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Gyani, the former CFO of AirTouch Communications, the mobile
phone company acquired last year by Vodafone of Britain,
acknowledged that one of his most important jobs will be ''to make
sure that we're out there talking to our employees'' so that
there's a smooth transition. Still, he added, ''People have become
very accustomed to rapid change in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gyani's new role, he'll lead one of the nation's biggest cell
phone companies, but one that has lagged behind in the current
frenzy over wireless Internet access, even though AT&AMP;T was one of
the first mobile phone companies to introduce data services.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shareholders are expected to approve the wireless IPO at a
special meeting on Tuesday. In addition to the mobile calling
business, the new tracking stock will reflect the performance of
AT&AMP;T's international wireless investments and a foray into
''fixed'' wireless delivery of Internet and telephone services to
businesses and homes.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Initial U.S. Buyback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Thursday following the first
government buyback of Treasury notes in an effort to pay down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose [ point, or $1.25
cents per $1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves the opposite
direction, fell to 6.15 percent from Wednesday's 6.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced earlier this year that it would buy
back long-term government debt using funds generated by the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury paid $1.345 billion on Thursday to back $1 billion
of securities.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders predicted that the price of long-term notes would
increase when demand lowered. Those predictions proved true on
Thursday, and the rest of the bond market followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said declining oil prices were also a factor in pushing
up bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 1/32 point,
while intermediate term securities rose [ to 9/32, according to
Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.83 percent, with the
discount up 0.01 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.66 percent.
Six-month bills yielded 6.06 percent, as the discount fell 0.01
percentage point from Wednesday to 5.80 percent. One-year yields
were 6.15 percent, with the discount falling 0.01 percentage point
to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 5.81 percent from 5.75 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 13/32 to 93 7/16
from 93 1/32 on Wednesday. The yield to maturity of the index was
6.11 percent, down from 6.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bradley End White House Bids  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling as swiftly as they soared, John McCain
and Bill Bradley abandoned their presidential races Thursday and
chided their triumphant rivals on the way out. ''Millions of
Americans have rallied to our banner,'' McCain said as both
candidates sought to leverage the support they had earned.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator pledged to press his case for political
reform and warned that Republicans will ''slip into the mists of
history'' without it. McCain, who pulled swarms of Democrats and
independents into GOP contests, offered nominee-in-waiting George
W. Bush his ''best wishes'' -- but not his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before McCain bowed out, Bradley told reporters he would
support Vice President Al Gore, but he also accused his fellow
Democrat of ''distortions'' in their primary fight. ''I hope that
he will run a better campaign in the general election,'' said the
former New Jersey senator, who was unable to win any primary or
caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Iit was a victorious day for the political establishment that
backed Bush and Gore, both of whom vanquished their rivals after
stiff challenges. ''When you do battle with entrenched power ...
it's very difficult,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of McCain's announcement, Bush's team was
reaching out to McCain intermediaries in an effort to mend fences.
The rivals themselves spoke briefly by telephone, but settled
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''John needs some time to think, and I need some time,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said to be still seething at the Texas governor, McCain is in no
hurry to make peace. He planned to take a week's vacation before
determining what leverage he has with Bush and what he might want
to achieve with it, said a McCain adviser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows he is not bargaining from a strong position, but
the adviser said his boss wants to somehow keep his signature issue
-- campaign finance reform -- on the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, McCain quit the race but didn't shut
down his campaign -- a technicality that keeps his options open to
make things uncomfortable for Bush, who needs McCain's endorsement
to unify the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's options, according to the adviser, include:
barnstorming the country to promote campaign finance reform,
leading a platform fight at the Republican National Convention or
even mounting a third-party presidential bid. Aides say that last
option is remote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself has ruled out bolting the GOP and said Thursday,
''I love my home.'' He did, however, leave himself a loophole by
saying in his departure speech that the party deserves ''the
allegiance of none'' if it doesn't embrace campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCain's top supporters said he urged the senator to let
go of the enmity he feels toward Bush. ''There's no question that
there's some bitterness there and some anger,'' said Sen. Charles
Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the 10th Republican to leave the race. Bradley has
been Gore's only challenger. They could not sustain momentum
against the sheer force of their rivals' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had the most potent insurgency, staggering Bush in New
Hampshire and Michigan. In a testament to his drawing power, one of
every four GOP primary participants had never before voted in a
Republican contest.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths cleared, Bush and Gore warmed up for what both camps
predict will be a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor criticized Gore for supporting a ban on
unlimited, unregulated donations while raising the so-called ''soft
money'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   Using a line he unleashed against McCain in their primary
battles, Bush said of the vice president, ''We're not going to be
fooled by somebody who says one thing and absolutely does
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reissued his challenge to forsake TV ads in the general
election. ''We can elevate our democracy,' he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bradley nor McCain made clean exits.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat did not release his delegates, saying they had
earned a voice at the national convention. He has 412 delegates --
more than 1,000 behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the race, Bradley said he will help elect Gore
and ''continue to work for a new politics and for the values I laid
out in the campaign.'' He said those values include campaign
finance reform and politics that is honest, positive, compassionate
and ruled by convictions, not polls. Aides said Bradley, 56, may
well run again.
</P>
<P>
   McCain left more room for doubt by suspending his campaign. The
tactic may allow him to collect his full allotment of federal
campaign funds, including convention expenses. He also retained
control of his 231 delegates, a fraction of the 1,034 needed for
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with the Bush campaign will be conducted by
John Weaver, who has a long-running feud with Bush strategist Karl
Rove. Bush will assign somebody else to deal with Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers will take the weekend off and meet again early
next week to discuss their boss' options. They say it is unclear
what, if anything, McCain will seek in return for a show of unity.
</P>
<P>
   The options range from demanding that Bush embrace political
reforms -- a move that would cause the Texan problems with his
conservative base -- or merely a showing of respect toward McCain
and his centerpiece issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the speech does is put the onus on (the Bush campaign)
and the Republican Party,'' McCain campaign manager Rick Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a hill at his Sedona, Ariz., retreat, a stunning
snowcapped mountain range behind him, McCain said he will take some
time to decide his next step.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will try to force open doors where there are walls to your
full participation in the great enterprise of our democracy,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Speaker proposes new school construction funding formula  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Assembly Speaker Jack Collins today nudged
closer to a compromise with Senate leaders and Gov. Christie
Whitman over school construction funding for New Jersey's poorest
30 districts.
</P>
<P>
   But his new plan still does not provide 100 percent funding for
all school building projects in the so-called special needs
districts, something Senate President Donald DiFrancesco and the
governor support and which was ordered by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The amended bill Collins unveiled Thursday, A-2041, passed the
Assembly Education Committee on a party-line 5-2 vote and now heads
to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives the poor schools 100 percent state funding for
projects that address health and safety concerns and overcrowded
classroom conditions, but less state aid for extras such as media
centers or cafeterias. Collins previously proposed a flat 90
percent aid for all projects in the special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill reserves some funds for middle class districts as well.
It creates a no-interest $1 billion revolving loan fund, and calls
for increases in direct debt service aid for those largely suburban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' new bill would also allow lawmakers to add or subtract
special needs districts in the state, something the Whitman
administration favors but wants to consider separately from the
funding bill, according to Education Commissioner David Hespe.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said he feared the school construction pricetag
could exceed $11.5 billion statewide. Under his plan, even the
poorest school district would contribute a sum toward non-emergency
building projects, on a sliding scale depending on how much overall
state aid they currently receive.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said his decision to include 100 percent funding for
certain building projects is a compromise, but he is willing to go
no further.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor and the Senate president indicated they wanted
100 percent across the board, but the Assembly is not going along
those lines,'' he said after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats raised objections to Collins' half-a-loaf approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court was clear that Abbott districts should get 100
percent of funds from the state, period,'' said Assemblyman Rudy
Garcia, D-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   They also balked at voting on a bill after receiving no time to
digest 23 substantial amendments just before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe also confessed he was ill prepared for the late changes to
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some amendments we like, some amendments we don't
like and some amendments we haven't figured out yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe later questioned whether the poor schools would gain under
Collins' change to 100 percent funding for some projects, compared
to the speaker's earlier call for 90 percent funding for all
projects.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center, which sued
the state on behalf of the poor schools, said he is holding out
hope that Collins will eventually embrace full funding.
</P>
<P>
   His new plan ''only amounts to funding for half a school,''
Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate version of the school construction bill, S-200, already
calls for 100 percent funding for all poor school projects. It was
the subject of a separate hearing by the Senate Education Committee
Thursday but no vote was taken
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a valid point, everyone should contribute something,''
Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, said of Collins' bill. ''If not
for the court decision, I'd agree with his version.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Cut Another 5,000 Workers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. told federal regulators it may cut
another 5,000 workers this year as part of its continuing
downsizing, and added that the strike by engineers and technical
workers could slow aircraft deliveries through this summer,
affecting the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   A document filed by the company Wednesday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission said Boeing should wind up with 180,000 to
190,000 employees at the end of the year, compared with an earlier
target of 185,000 to 195,000 announced six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jobs will be trimmed through attrition and
reorganization, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a revised projection, and doesn't necessarily mean
that we will be laying off 5,000 people,'' said Boeing spokesman
Peter Conte.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said the additional job cuts were not related to the
strike, and would not speculate on whether the small but increasing
number of engineers who are quitting the company outright would
affect any potential layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has reduced its work force from about 228,000 to 194,100
workers over the past year. Conte said the company's annual
attrition rate is around 9,000 to 10,000 positions annually, which
will likely make up most of the additional cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Conte added that some people may get laid off as part of
reorganization or consolidation efforts, though he declined to
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   The company also confirmed that its first-quarter earnings will
be affected by the strike that sent 17,000 engineers and technical
workers to the picket lines a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strike will affect Boeing's ability to deliver commercial
aircraft to customers in the first quarter, and may affect earnings
and deliveries in the second quarter as well, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said the impact on earnings depends on how long the
members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees stay
out. The commercial airplane division has seen the most immediate
impact, because SPEEA engineers are needed to certify the planes
before they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effects on the second quarter really depend on when the
engineers come back and how we implement our post-strike recovery
plan,'' Conte said. ''We do need those employees, and we've asked
them to come back for the good of this company.''
</P>
<P>
   SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding said that he hoped
the impact on the company's profits would spur Boeing to resolve
the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned that they'll lose an entire month's worth of
deliveries here,'' Bofferding said. ''We've said all along that we
don't want to hurt The Boeing Co., but we need a contract that
demonstrates respect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The union staged a walkout a month ago after contract talks
collapsed. The engineers and technical workers are pressing for
guaranteed bonuses and a benefits package that does not include
increased health insurance payments.

<HEADLINE> Memphis Co. Buys Big Stake in Aetna  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- An investment company has bought 6 percent
of Aetna Inc. and says it has held talks with other firms about a
takeover of the beleaguered health insurance giant.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis-based Southeastern Asset Management Inc. outlined its
moves in documents filed this week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It also said it wants to become more involved in
Aetna's governance.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna's board is looking at ways to boost
the company's stock price, which rose $2.87{ to $57 in trading at
4:30 p.m. Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. That was well
below its 52-week high of $99.87{.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares had dropped to $40 a share last month
before the resignation of its chairman. Aetna also had been hit by
unexpectedly high costs in its Aetna U.S. HealthCare managed care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's board was scheduled to meet Friday and into the weekend.
Directors are due to discuss whether to negotiate with WellPoint
Health Networks Inc., which last month made a joint takeover bid
with the Dutch financial company ING Group NV.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint said it is looking at Aetna U.S. HealthCare, and ING
is interested in Aetna's financial services and international arms.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Pare Colombia Aid Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee rejected a Democratic effort
Thursday to trim a proposed aid package for Colombia supported by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as lawmakers moved toward approval of a $9
billion measure that also would finance U.S. troops in Kosovo and
recovery efforts from recent domestic natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   By a 36-20 vote, the House Appropriations Committee rejected an
effort by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., to withhold $552 million of the
bill's $1.7 billion for to help Colombia and its neighbors combat
cocaine production.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the committee's Republicans and one-third of its
Democrats opposed Obey's amendment. Though Democrats had other
amendments ready that would restrict the Colombian money, the vote
on Obey's amendment signaled that the proposal to step up U.S.
efforts in the South American country likely would survive.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also used a mostly party-line 31-23 vote to reject
an effort by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to add $1.3 billion for
drug treatment and prevention programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants $1.3 billion more for the effort, on top
of $300 million already in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress needs to know a whole lot more about what we're doing
before we proceed,'' said Obey, whose amendment would have allowed
a House vote on providing the $552 million by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Obey and others argued that the United States risks a costly,
10-year involvement in Colombia, where a decade-long civil war
already has taken 35,000 lives. Colombia has become the world's top
cocaine producer, and efforts by Bogota to stop the traffickers
have so far produced scant results.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Obey's plan cited the need to do something to
reduce the drug problem in the United States, and they chided Obey
for opposing a plan backed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your lack of confidence in him is stunning to me,'' said Rep.
Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The aid to Colombia includes money to supply 63 helicopters,
train and equip Colombian troops and police, strengthen human
rights efforts and persuade coca farmers to grow other crops.
Included are small amounts of aid for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to committee leaders, White House budget chief Jack
Lew lauded lawmakers' ''timely support,'' saying it would ''help to
stem the flow of drugs into the United States and will further
benefit the United States by bringing greater peace and prosperity
to an important ally.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate on the House floor, and in the Senate, is
uncertain because of Democratic opposition to the Colombia plan and
conservative unease over the size of the overall legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The entire bill, which would finance a wide range of foreign
affairs, defense and domestic programs, is nearly twice the size of
the $5.2 billion Clinton has requested. It would be paid for almost
entirely from the federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$2.2 billion for recovery from last fall's Hurricane Floyd and
other disasters. Clinton has proposed $1.2 billion. The extra money
includes $7 million to combat Pierce's disease, which is hurting
Southern California farms, and $40 million to help producers of
lime and other citrus crops damaged by the citrus canker.
</P>
<P>
   --All $2 billion Clinton wants for the costs of American forces
in Kosovo, and the $25 million for U.S. operations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   --$1.6 billion to cover the Pentagon's higher fuel bill caused by
rising oil prices and $854 million to bolster the Defense
Department's health insurance program. Clinton asked for neither.
</P>
<P>
   --$104 million to build a new U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
But it ignores the additional $135 million Clinton requested for
new diplomatic buildings in Pristina, Kosovo, and in Tirana,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   --$40 million Clinton wants to help resident near the Vieques,
Puerto Rico, firing range used by the Navy.

<HEADLINE> NATO Denies Spy Leaked Kosovo Plans  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Allied and NATO officials on Thursday
denied a report that a spy gave information to the Serbs during
last year's Kosovo campaign, but a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged
they might have had advance word of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a BBC report on the leaks, the officials conceded
that security measures had been lax at the start of the air
campaign, when Serb forces shot down a U.S. stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said there were indications
that the Yugoslav military new about some bombing plans, but he
blamed it on a system of distributing air defense orders to member
nations via fax. He said that problem disappeared when the faxing
procedure ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can definitively say that there wasn't a mole of some
sort, but there is no evidence there was,'' said Bacon, who was
traveling to Asia with Defense Secretary William Cohen. ''There are
people in NATO who believe there could have been a mole.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military analysts attributed the problem to ''sloppy
communications and information handling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our operational security procedures in the early stages of the
war were probably not as good as they should have been'' and were
tightened, said Rear Adm. Craig Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   He told a regular Pentagon briefing in Washington that officials
''greatly cut down on the list of those who receive the air-tasking
order on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also offered what appeared to be an alternative
explanation for the breaches.
</P>
<P>
   There were ''communication intercepts, too many of the allied
aircraft sent their transmissions in the clear,'' Quigley said, so
those procedures were tightened as well.
</P>
<P>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. released details Thursday of a
documentary alleging that a mole supplied information on the
allies' strike plans and flight paths in the first two weeks of the
air campaign, allowing Serbs to move troops and equipment away from
intended NATO targets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched its 78-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia in March
1999 to force President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC program, ''Moral Combat: NATO at War,'' claims that an
internal classified report prepared for senior U.S. defense
officials concluded that the Serbs had information on air raids and
reconnaissance flights. The program is to be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC said it had been given information on the case by
sources in the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   It said that initially 600 people at NATO headquarters had
access to details of the strike plans, but the leaks stopped
immediately after that number was cut back to 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson acknowledged Thursday that
security measures included ''progressively restricting information
to those who needed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson said ''we have no knowledge and no evidence that
the air tasking order was ever leaked to the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were always sensitive to security and that meant that
throughout the campaign we were consistently reviewing security,''
Robertson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation ran rife about the nationality of the alleged
spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Liberal Democrat Party spokesman Menzies Campbell
told the BBC that some Czech intelligence officers working for NATO
were ''in fairly intimate contact with old friends in Moscow,'' the
possible route of information to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC documentary says Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme
commander, suspected that information was leaking and ordered an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC interviewed Clark for the documentary, asking if there
was a spy at NATO headquarters. ''Absolutely not,'' Clark
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a spy ''in NATO,'' he replied. ''I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time spy allegations regarding Yugoslavia
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, A French army major was arrested on charges of spying
for Yugoslavia while he was chief of staff for the French
delegation at NATO headquarters in Brussels, months before the air
campaign began. He was released by a French appeals court.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds rose by $14.60 billion in the latest week to $989.87
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose
by $12.53 billion to $823.03 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets rose by $2.07 billion to $166.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $12.33
billion to $716.42 billion for the same period. Among institutional
funds, taxable money market fund assets rose by $11.64 billion to
$664.33 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $692.1 million
to $52.09 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.706 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.679 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.26 percent from 5.27 percent the
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day
average yield rose to 5.24 percent from 5.22 percent, IBC Financial
Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day compounded yield remained unchanged at 5.40
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to
5.38 percent from 5.36 percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
48 days, down from 49 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.04 percent as of
Wednesday from 2.09 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing
checking accounts held steady at 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.85 percent
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.83 percent the
previous week. Yields were 5.25 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.22
percent; 5.54 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 5.55 percent; and
5.91 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs 2 Controversial Judges  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed Richard A. Paez and
Marsha Berzon as federal appellate judges Thursday, ending years of
bitter debate over whether they were too liberal and whether women
and minority nominees have more difficulty winning Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, interrupting his presidential campaign
schedule, made a rare appearance in the Senate to be ready to cast
a vote, in his capacity as president of the Senate, in case of a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't needed as first Berzon, by a vote of 64-34, and
later Paez, by 59-39, were confirmed as judges on the 9th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore celebrated the confirmations by saying, in Spanish,
''Friends, today we've finally achieved justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a troubling pattern of the Republican Party
standing against qualified judicial nominees who happen to be women
and minorities,'' he said at a news conference. Paez is
Mexican-American and was strongly supported by Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also referred to the nominees' diverse
backgrounds in hailing the votes at the end of a White House
meeting with religious leaders: ''I think maybe we're, by fits and
starts, moving toward our one America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later thanked the Senate for the votes but added that
dozens of judicial nominees still await confirmation.
''Election-year politics should not be used as an excuse to slow
down the confirmation process,'' he said. With Thursday's votes
there were 73 vacant federal judgeships, nearly 10 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, now a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, has been
waiting more than four years for Thursday's vote, longer than any
other nominee in history. Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer, was
nominated by Clinton two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senate conservatives succeeded in delaying their confirmation
votes, contending the nominees are too liberal and would add to
what they consider the activist tendencies of the San
Francisco-based 9th Circuit, which covers a vast area of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Paez has been criticized by conservatives for his statements
about affirmative action and benefits for illegal immigrants.
Berzon has angered conservatives with her defense work for labor
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees' opponents have vehemently denied that minority or
female candidates are treated differently, and said race was never
an issue when many Democrats opposed the Supreme Court nomination
of Clarence Thomas, a conservative black.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are activist judges. I think they are out of the
mainstream of American thought and I don't think either one should
be on the court,'' Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said of Paez and Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   The political vitriol became intense last fall when the Senate,
along party lines, rejected a black nominee, Missouri State Supreme
Court Judge Ronnie White, for a federal judgeship. Clinton called
the vote a disgrace and linked it to the long delay on Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., voted against both
Paez and Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have preferred that they never had been nominated,''
said Lott, but he nevertheless abided by a promise he made last
fall to give the two a yes-or-no vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made a last-ditch attempt to deny
Paez that vote, introducing a motion to postpone it pending an
investigation into Paez's role in a plea agreement the Justice
Department reached with John Huang, who was accused of raising more
than $1 million in illegal contributions for the Democrats during
the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, a former federal prosecutor rejected for a federal
judgeship by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986, contended that
in approving that plea bargain, Paez ''may have improperly
acquiesced to a 'sweetheart deal' which advanced the interests of
the Clinton-Gore administration rather than the interests of
justice and the American people.'' His motion was defeated, 67-31.
</P>
<P>
   Berzon, reached at home, thanked Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who urged his conservative colleagues
to allow the votes and cast his in favor of both Berzon and Paez.
''I look forward to sitting on the 9th Circuit and pledge to
approach every case in a fair, thoughtful and open-minded manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some bitter feelings remained. Thomas Jipping of the
conservative Free Congress Foundation said Republicans who voted
for the nominations had helped ''move the nation's most activist
court further in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, said that by stalling on nominations, the Senate was
''tearing down the integrity and the independence'' of the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., warned the Republicans that
blocking nominations of a president from the opposite party could
come back to haunt them if a Republican captures the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, what goes around comes around. You're setting your
president up for this kind of twisting in the wind,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> EPA Issues New Pollution Standards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency issued new
pollution control standards Thursday for hand-held garden tools
such as chain saws and trimmers, saying the rules eventually will
keep 350,000 tons of chemicals out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have anticipated the standards, which will not be
fully in place until 2007, and already have made significant
improvements in reducing pollution from these tools, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, which apply only to newly purchased equipment,
cover small engines of 25 or fewer horsepower generally used in
hand-held trimmers, chain saws and other garden tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20 million such tools sold annually nationwide and
they are the single biggest source of smog-causing hydrocarbon
emission from nonroad sources, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since this equipment is used mostly during the hot summer
months, when ground-level ozone is the highest, it causes problems
for asthmatics and aggravates other respiratory conditions,'' the
EPA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said while reducing pollution, the technology
required to meet the new standard also will increase fuel
efficiency by 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Brushes Off Slush Fund Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Brushing off the slush fund scandal that has
disgraced him and his party, Helmut Kohl broke his self-imposed
isolation Thursday to announce he has raised millions to pay any
fines it may face and will be returning to political life.
</P>
<P>
   But the 69-year-old former leader also looked further ahead and
set a date for his retreat from politics, saying he would not run
again for parliament in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With the same deafness to criticism that helped him ride out
crises during 16 years as German chancellor, Kohl insisted Thursday
he would rather help pay for the financial damage than reveal the
source of secret -- thus illegal -- campaign money he accepted in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference since the scandal broke in
December, Kohl said he had mortgaged his home as part of a drive
that has raised the equivalent of nearly $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   He defied calls even by some in his Christian Democratic party
to give up his seat in parliament, saying he would return to his
place in the Reichstag building next week after an absence of
nearly four months.
</P>
<P>
   However, he later announced he would not run again in the next
parliamentary election in 2002. ''That's the way into true
retirement,'' he said in an interview on ARD television.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl indicated a reason for keeping his seat for now was his
immunity from prosecution as a legislator while prosecutors and a
parliamentary committee examine his conduct. ''If I had no seat in
parliament, I would be without protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Kohl looked relaxed and joked at
times as he denied trying to buy his way back into favor with his
opposition Christian Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no reason to have to make up with the party,'' he said.
''I'm trying to correct my mistake. ... I was and remain in the
party. It's my political home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has dramatically lost standing with his party and the
public, despite his legacy as the man who united Germany after the
Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   His refusal to reveal the source of off-the-books donations
remained the unsolved nub of the scandal. Kohl says he promised the
donors anonymity and reiterated he will keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not named the names and I will not name them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Kohl of having contempt for the law. His refusal
to comply with disclosure laws enacted by his own government has
also prompted parliament to investigate whether money was traded
for government favors -- a charge Kohl again denied Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not for sale,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's governing Social Democrats condemned Kohl, saying he
was trying to buy his way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is trying to shirk responsibility by having third persons
finance his breach of the law,'' declared Social Democratic
legislator Frank Hofmann.
</P>
<P>
   For the Christian Democrats, led by Kohl for 25 years until his
1998 election defeat, their former leader's strategy was a mixed
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said the party ''welcomes any
contribution'' but that ''the loss of credibility ... cannot be
redressed with money alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Thursday showed that 87 percent of Germans
agreed. The Forsa poll of 1,002 people had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said he and his wife, Hannelore, would contribute $350,000
-- about $100,000 in cash and the rest from a loan on their
mortgage-free house in Ludwigshafen.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped to repay it with profits from his memoirs,
which he revealed for the first time that he is writing.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl released a list of more than 30 contributors to his
fund-raising drive. Major donors were German media mogul Leo Kirch
and Helmut Maucher, outgoing board chairman of the food giant
Nestle.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an independent audit that found he accepted $1 million
in undeclared contributions between 1993 and 1998. No fine has been
levied yet for those misdeeds, but German law calls for it to be
three times any amount donated illegally to be paid by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl did not say whether any of the money raised would go toward
paying off a $20 million fine imposed on the party for failing to
declare the equivalent of $9 million held in secret accounts abroad
by the Christian Democrats branch in Hesse state. The party is
appealing the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl set off the scandal in December with his admission that he
accepted secret political donations, allegedly from concerned
citizens who wanted help establish the Christian Democrats in
former communist East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the affair has expanded to include a web of secret
accounts, millions more in secret funding and judicial
investigations -- including one that could lead to breach of trust
charges against Kohl.

<HEADLINE> IMF Overhaul Wins Committee Support  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A blue ribbon commission that has proposed a
radical overhaul of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank won support Thursday from members of a key Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm told members of the
panel that he hoped to attach many of the panel's recommendations
to legislation the administration is seeking on debt forgiveness
for the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we write that bill, we are going to look at everything you
proposed,'' Gramm told members of the International Financial
Institutions Advisory Commission. ''We are going to give this
(report) the opportunity to see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended limiting IMF activities to supplying
short-term emergency loans to countries in financial crisis and
after a phase-in period having that support go only to countries
following approved economic practices, such as reforming their
banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
   For the World Bank, the group recommended refocusing loans on
some 80 of the world's poorest countries that don't have access to
private sector loans. That would mean scrapping 70 percent of the
World Bank's current loan program that goes to nations such as
China, Argentina, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil, who are
able to borrow money in global capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's endorsement of the panel's broad recommendations
received support from Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who said he could
not understand why Democrats had been so critical in their initial
reaction to the 120-page report, which was delivered to Congress on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said he was ''stunned'' by the comments of House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who branded the report
''neo-isolationist'' and a ''slash-and-burn approach'' to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said he was one of those who had pushed to have Congress
create the advisory panel in 1998 legislation which provided $18
billion in additional U.S. resources to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not done to make the IMF and the World Bank disappear
from the world scene,'' he said, but rather to reform two
institutions which have come under heavy criticism from both
conservatives and liberals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While Mack pledged that ''we are going to find a way to move
these suggestions forward,'' it was unclear what the prospects for
success might be given the extent of Democratic complaints about
the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gephardt, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., blasted the commission's work product as ''not thoughtful,
but reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   The split between Republicans and Democrats in Congress mirrored
the deep divisions on the 11-member commission, which was chaired
by Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   The six members of the commission appointed by Republicans were
joined by two Democrats who voted for the panel's report. Three
Democrats voted against the final report.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sachs, a prominent economist at Harvard University, who
joined the Republicans in endorsing the recommendations said he had
been stunned at the level of criticism aimed at the report by many
people who had yet read it. He noted that all 11 members of the
panel had voted in support of having the IMF, World Bank and
wealthy nations forgive all debts to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   He said this one recommendation, if adopted by Congress, would
go a long way to alleviate crushing poverty in 40 of the world's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional approval of legislation to totally forgive U.S.
loans to poor countries ''would galvanize the rest of the world to
address this issue,'' Sachs said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Raises Funds Outside N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani may call his Senate race
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton a carpetbagger, but when it comes to
campaign contributions from out of state, he's raking in enough to
fill a few bags of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions of at least $200 each for the New York City mayor
have poured in from every state except North Dakota, according to
an analysis of his campaign filings released on Thursday by the
Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor raised 44 percent of his money from outside New York
according to the nonpartisan center, which counted donations of
$200 or more. An earlier analysis by Washington D.C.-based CRP
showed the first lady raised 56 percent of similar-sized
contributions from outside New York, taking in donations from 45
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp has been critical of Clinton's out-of-state
fund raising. But the mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum,
defended Giuliani's own by saying the Senate race has ''national
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry led Giuliani's donor list,
giving the mayor $1.9 million. Lawyers led Clinton's giving,
donating $666,879, and were closely followed by people in the
entertainment industry, who contributed $439,740.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees gave Giuliani $781,000; the real estate industry gave
him $488,000; lawyers $429,000 and accountants $112,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among Giuliani's collections from out-of-state, $694,000 came
from New Jersey, $448,000 from Texas, $405,000 from Connecticut,
and $380,000 from California.
</P>
<P>
   New York donors who contributed more than $200 apiece gave
Giuliani $4.5 million in total.
</P>
<P>
   CRP's Executive Director Larry Makinson criticized the Giuliani
campaign for failing to disclose the occupations or employers of 21
percent of his large contributors, who together gave more than $1.8
million to the mayor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law requires candidates to make their ''best
effort'' to identify the employers and occupations of donors.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said Giuliani's nondisclosure ranked ''among the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp failed to provide occupation information for 5
percent of its donors, who contributed just under $300,000, the
center found. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has raised some $70
million for his presidential bid, has managed to provide
information on 90 percent, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without employer data it is impossible to calculate exactly
which industries and companies have been most generous to a
candidate, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp immediately seized on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just what is Rudy hiding from the people of New York?''
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson asked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Giuliani raised a total of $11.8 million for his Senate
campaign, compared to Clinton's $8 million. The center's analysis
considered only donations over $200 because the candidates are not
required to itemize amounts below that.
</P>
<P>
   That means the analysis did not account for $3.3 million in
donations to Giuliani or $1.9 million to Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Pataki's Empire State Development arm running ads  </HEADLINE>
With BC-NY--Capitol Corridors, Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Television advertisements featuring Gov.
George Pataki and extolling the virtues of his administration's
taxing and regulation-cutting polices have started to appear,
courtesy of the state's Empire State Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are aimed at urging businesses to locate or expand in
New York, Empire State Development spokesman Eric Mangan said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials started to appear Feb. 21, Mangan said. They
will be shown through March 19 on stations in all major New York
markets, as well as in Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Hartford and
New Haven, Conn.; Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, Montreal
and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will also be shown on the national cable networks, CNBC
and CNNFN.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan said that after a pause later this month, the ads will
return from April 3 to April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the ads is to have companies expanding and
creating new jobs for New Yorkers,'' Mangan said. ''We want to get
out the message that New York is the place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangan said the ads cost $4 million to produce, and the cost was
split between Empire State Development and the New York Power
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The ads feature one of either three New York companies -- New
Venture Gear, General Composites and Reciprocal -- and describe what
the administration says is their success stories at being in New
York. They all also show Pataki giving a personal invitation for
companies to call his administration to find out more about New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan denied that the appearance of the ads had anything to do
with an anti-Pataki ad campaign which began earlier this year from
Change-New York, a conservative anti-tax group once allied with the
governor. Those ads complain about population losses and allegedly
anemic job-creation figures under Pataki's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan said the state ads had been in production for several
months, since well before the Change-New York commercials began to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Change-New York spokesman Brian Backstrom countered that the
Pataki administration ads are obviously designed to rebut the
Change-New York ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think clearly the governor feels the need to improve his
public image,'' Backstrom said. ''Unfortunately, he is trying to
alter reality and use selective data to do so, all at taxpayer
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Change-New York president Tom Carroll said the ads would more
appropriately be funded out of Pataki's campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki argues that Change-New York is the one distorting his
record at fostering job growth and improving economic opportunities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State Development, headed by close Pataki supporter
Charles Gargano, heads the administration's business-promotion
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Lobbies for Homeless  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miss America Heather French asked Congress on
Thursday to commit more money to help homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to pay them back,'' she said. ''They have seen worse
things in their daytime than we have seen in our nightmares,''
French told the House Veterans Affairs subcommittees on benefits
and health.
</P>
<P>
   French wants Congress to devote $750,000 from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development for homeless veterans. Republicans
and Democrats at the hearing expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 3 percent of the $1.1 billion HUD spends on homeless
projects is targeted towards veterans, according to the National
Coalition for Homeless Veterans. Veterans account for 23 percent of
the homeless population.
</P>

   French, the daughter of a disabled Vietnam veteran, has

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Smuggler Caught in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A woman attempting to smuggle cocaine
onto a flight to Spain was caught by a hair: Police say the drugs
were hidden in her wig.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities at Bogota's international airport said Thursday they
had arrested 33-year-old Luz Mery Gutierrez the night before after
allegedly finding more than a pound of cocaine embedded in her
coiffure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was glued in there so strongly that efforts to remove it by
hand were ineffective,'' the state security police said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez drew security guards' attention because her long shock
of thick, straight hair didn't match a passport photo showing a
woman with short curly brown locks.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Gutierrez admitted having the cocaine attached to
her head at a beauty parlor.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die As Planes Collide in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Two small planes collided on a runway in
a huge fireball Thursday, killing all four people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine planes, a Cessna 152 and a Cessna 172, carried
two people each. No one on the ground was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a big fire, so everyone went out there,'' said
Rosalie Radtke, a secretary at a company a quarter-mile from
Sarasota Bradenton International Airport. ''All the guys saw was a
big ball of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller had cleared one of the planes for
takeoff, said Pat Cariseo, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board in Washington. At the same time, the
pilot of the other plane was granted permission to position his
aircraft and hold on the same runway.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was not immediately clear, Cariseo said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has asked for a specialist in air traffic control to
look at the role of the control tower in the accident, NTSB
investigator John Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow said there was a ''tremendous
impact followed by tremendous fire.'' One plane was heavily
damaged; there was almost nothing left of the other aircraft, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were interviewing six witnesses, some of whom gave
conflicting statements, Bristow said. NTSB investigators were sent
from Miami and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' names were not immediately released. J. Kevin
Drake, an attorney for Cirrus Aviation Flight School, said the
school had not been officially notified but ''we fear that it is an
instructor and student. We fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake refused to identify the two.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, about 50 miles south of Tampa, handles small
private planes, domestic jets and international charter flights
from Canada. The airport sees 1.5 million passengers a year. Miami
International Airport, by comparison, has about 34 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second accident at the airport in 24 hours. A
single-engine aircraft had trouble with its landing gear and made a
belly landing Wednesday. There were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> Aid Distributed in Madagascar  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Aid workers distributed food,
medicine and blankets to thousands of flood victims on Thursday,
while France sent helicopters to the Indian Ocean island to assist
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in recent weeks has killed at least 130 people, the
government's disaster agency said. Up to 700,000 people have been
affected and were in need of some form of emergency assistance, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   A French ship carrying four helicopters to assist in the relief
effort was expected to arrive Saturday, and two British helicopters
also were expected to join the effort this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Gloria, the weather system that caused flooding in
Madagascar, is the same one that has dumped weeks of rain on
flood-ravaged Mozambique and left up to a million people homeless
or without their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar lies off Africa's southeast coast, due east of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria was downgraded last week to a tropical depression but it
continues to dump rain on both nations.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding is expected to worsen the spread of disease. More
than 1,000 Malagasies -- as residents of this island are called --
have already died from cholera since an epidemic erupted a year
ago, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday that the
cyclone had caused ''heavy damage to houses and road links.''
</P>
<P>
   An official appeal for international assistance would be
launched shortly, Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Notes Were Never 'Missing'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missing pages from the notebook of an FBI
agent investigating donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign were not missing at all, according to an agency report
obtained by a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, during a hearing by the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, FBI agent Roberta Parker testified that pages were
missing from her red spiral notebook after it was returned to her
from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, who is leading the committee's investigation
into Clinton-Gore campaign fund raising, estimated the missing
portion at 27 pages and promised an investigation. The notebook was
sent to an FBI lab to try to determine who might have removed the
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting a fingerprint analysis, the lab conducted an
''indentation analysis,'' a technique used to determine whether the
pages actually were missing. In a Nov. 1 report, an FBI examiner
concluded no pages had been removed, The Washington Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's spokesman, Harvey Valentine, said Thursday the
senator would not comment on an ongoing investigation. A committee
spokeswoman also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Jim Davis said, ''The internal inquiry into this
matter is continuing. It is inappropriate for the FBI to reach any
conclusions about the conduct of any employee prior to completion
of the fact-finding.'' Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, a 17-year veteran of the FBI who also is a lawyer, is
based in the Baltimore field office. She and two other agents
testified at the hearing under subpoena. Another agent testified
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the ''missing'' notes covered a period in 1997 when
the agents and Justice Department attorneys had strong
disagreements about tactics in the investigation of presidential
friend Yah Lin ''Charlie'' Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Trie was a major Democratic fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to
campaign finance violations.

<HEADLINE> $122B Tax Cut Pushed Through House  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To soften the impact on employers of a $1
increase in the minimum wage, Republicans pushed a $122 billion tax
cut through the House Thursday despite a vow by President Clinton
to veto it and grumbling from conservatives about the whole
package.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on alternative minimum wage proposals were planned later
in the evening. GOP leaders made the tax measure part of the wage
package to deny Democrats a stand-alone wage bill, which has strong
support from Northeastern Republican moderates who want to defuse
it as a campaign issue in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether we take a thoughtful approach and a
balanced approach, or whether we have an ill-conceived bill foisted
upon us,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a main sponsor of the GOP
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 257-169 to pass the tax bill, two-thirds of
which consists of cuts in estate taxes. It will be combined with
legislation that would increase the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage by
$1 over two years or a version that would increase the wage by $1
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bill meets Clinton's wish for a two-year wage boost,
the president repeated Thursday he would veto the measure if it
included large tax cuts. Clinton contends the tax relief
disproportionately benefits the wealthy and would consume a chunk
of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering,'' Clinton said. ''Congress should send me a bill I can
sign, not one I have to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, contended the tax package would offset the
costs to business of raising the minimum wage, which many in the
GOP view as a job-killer and hindrance to new investment or
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point is simply, let's find some tax relief to cushion the
blow,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate centered on the estate tax cuts. Costing
$78.6 billion over 10 years, they were portrayed by Democrats as a
giveaway primarily for people with incomes over $319,000 a year.
Democrats were prevented from offering their own, smaller tax
package for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not fighting any tax relief. We're fighting for the
right kind of tax relief,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sponsors said current estate taxes actually prevent small
businesses and family farms from being passed down to heirs and
require costly tax planning simply to ease the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue is, who are the heirs?'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. The tax cut, he
added, ''is not going to benefit the people who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax package also would gradually boost 401(k) contribution
limits and make other pension changes; make health insurance
premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed sooner than
under current law; increase the amount of business meals that can
be deducted; and enact other tax breaks for small business.
</P>
<P>
   The floor debate came after two days of intense negotiations
between GOP leaders and Republican conservatives who threatened to
delay the bill over their desire to allow states to choose whether
to implement the wage increase. The measure had already been
delayed once from last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong, closed-door meeting off the House floor at
midday, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., urged conservatives to
stick with their fellow Republicans. A turning point came when one
Democrat, Jim Traficant of Ohio, walked into the meeting and
bluntly told Republicans that they risked losing their majority in
this fall's election if the minimum wage bill went down, according
to congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the conservatives, Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona,
said later the group agreed to back down ''out of loyalty and
respect'' to Hastert and other GOP leaders, but he described it as
''a gigantic concession by us to the moderates. We are not going to
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the state-flexibility issue was stripped out of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage bill is H.R. 3833.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill is H.R. 3832.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Tenn. Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Memphis was a city in mourning Thursday --
flags were at half-staff, bouquets of flowers were placed on fire
hall steps, and firefighters and law officers wore black bands
across their badges.
</P>
<P>
   All were in memory of two firefighters and a sheriff's deputy
who were slain Wednesday -- allegedly by one of their comrades,
firefighter Fred Williams -- in a rampage that has angered and
saddened this Mississippi River city.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just so shocking,'' said Pam McFarlin, who took food to
firefighters at Fire Station No. 55 and brought a bouquet of
flowers to the home where the men were shot. ''We all just feel so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 41, ambushed the firefighters as they arrived to fight
a blaze at his home, authorities said. Williams' wife, Stacey, was
found shot to death in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were still looking for a motive. Fire
Chief H.J. Pickett said the blaze was deliberately set, but
investigators were trying to determine whether it was done so to
lure firefighters to the home, or to cover up Mrs. Williams' death.
It was also unclear whether Williams made the 911 call to report
the fire, Police Director Walter Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a six-year veteran of the Fire Department, was shot in
the groin by a police officer when he refused to put down his
weapon, authorities said. Williams was under police guard at a
hospital in critical condition. Authorities plan to charge him
Friday but did not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that when firefighters arrived at the burning
home, Williams ran out of the garage firing a shotgun and
screaming, ''Get away! Get away!''
</P>
<P>
   Killed were firefighter Lt. Javier Lerma, 41, the son of a
Memphis firefighter who died battling a blaze in 1977, and Pvt.
William Blakemore, 48, a firefighter who was working for a sick
colleague, possibly Williams, Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not work at the same station as the men who were
killed, but they probably knew each other. Firefighters often cover
shifts of sick comrades at other stations, Pickett said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had returned to work Monday after taking a leave of
absence for ''employee assistance,'' Crews said, not providing
details. Williams left work early Monday, claiming he was sick, and
had not returned for shifts Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire chief wouldn't discuss Williams' work history or his
leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   Crews said the couple had married on Valentine's Day and
Williams moved into the house this week. He faced a court hearing
next week on a domestic violence charge from October involving Mrs.
Williams, then his fiancee. Details were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Harrison, Mrs. Williams' former husband, told The New
York Times that he was trying to get custody of his 8-year-old son,
who was living at the house. The boy was in school when the
shooting occurred and was taken to Harrison's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors had reported seeing smoke coming from the house and
alerted Williams, but he said everything was fine, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stopped to see if we could help, and a guy came out and
started shouting, 'Everybody go away and leave me alone!''' said
Kia Bradley, a passer-by. Williams then allegedly ambushed
firefighters and sheriff's deputies as they arrived to help.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Deputy Rupert Peete, 45, was shot in his patrol car.
Deborah Gatewood, 46, who was walking in the neighborhood, was
apparently trying to warn Peete that Williams had a gun when
Williams shot at them, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gatewood was wounded in the face. She was in satisfactory
condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters received counseling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all went back to work this morning at 7 a.m. doing what we
were doing yesterday morning -- fighting fires. It's what we do,''
Pickett said.

<HEADLINE> NBC Affiliates Object to New Sitcom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- At least nine NBC stations have decided not
to air the network's new comedy ''God, the Devil and Bob'' because
of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was scheduled to premiere on Thursday and then
settle into a Tuesday night time slot, is a cartoon about an
everyman named Bob and the moral questions he faces. Bob meets God
in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations in Boise, Pocatello and Twin Falls, Idaho; Salt Lake
City; Tupelo, Hattiesburg and Jackson, Miss.; Shreveport, La.; and
South Bend, Ind., have refused to air the program. NBC has 215
affiliates nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, some of those stations decided to air the program in
late-night hours, but NBC said the program must be aired in its
regular time slot or not at all. The Salt Lake City and Pocatello
stations have sold the sitcom to affiliates of competing networks,
where they will air Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's a cartoon, it's not a kids' program,'' said
Doug Armstrong, president and general manager of KVTB in Boise.
''It has adult humor and themes, yet the marketing seems geared
toward younger kids. Kids and families are our priority so we have
asked NBC to schedule the program later in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the show's tongue-in-cheek humor and drinking and
sexual references.
</P>
<P>
   KTVB has asked the network to air the program Saturdays at
midnight, following ''Saturday Night Live.'' Armstrong said calls
to the station are running 10-to-1 in favor of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The network said in a statement that it considers the show
entertaining and that it hopes the affiliates eventually will agree
to broadcast it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stations, KSL in Salt Lake City, also refuses to air
''Saturday Night Live'' because of its content.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Tout Juvenile Crime Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite congressional inaction on gun safety
legislation, a bipartisan group of lawmakers reported Thursday that
Democrats and Republican can agree on other ways to fight youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers are touting early childhood programs such as Head
Start, afterschool centers, community policing and better access to
job training and college. Two dozen House members, who began
meeting last year after the Columbine High School shootings, said
they would recommend to their party leaders that further work on
youth crime laws include these solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their report reinforces that Congress should play a supportive
role in combating youth violence,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and the House's top Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, asked the lawmakers to identify causes of violence and
find solutions both parties could support.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry
Hyde, said the Illinois Republican found some merit in the
recommendations and would study the group's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report discusses ways that schools and communities are
helping troubled children but does not deal with the issue of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Differences over gun safety regulations have caused a deadlock
on Capitol Hill of juvenile justice bills that continues despite a
White House meeting this week to prod negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we looked at was the whole array of interests, ideas,
philosophies and solutions,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who
opposes gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't leave anything off the table other than the very
divisive issue which is debated and will continue to be debated and
that is gun control issues and their effects on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not offer specific proposals to boost violence
preventing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't try to put price tags on any of the proposals in
this report,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who headed the
group with Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Eye Fetal Tissue Research  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former abortion clinic employee Republicans
hoped would buttress allegations that fetal tissue is being sold
illegally instead confessed to lawmakers Thursday he had made
inconsistent statements about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Dean Alberty's appearance before the House Commerce
health and environment subcommittee had been widely anticipated,
particularly after a national television broadcast on alleged
problems with fetal tissue laws.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion lawmakers have expressed concern that some tissue
retrieval companies are illegally charging exorbitant prices to
make a profit from the procedure. One pathologist who bragged of
the profitability of fetal tissue before a hidden camera on
Wednesday's episode of ABC's ''20/20'' did not respond to a
subpoena from the House panel to testify Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty, of Lee's Summit, Mo., did appear and was questioned
under oath. He said he had no knowledge of a profiteering scheme.
In an anti-abortion group's video, he had said that such a practice
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything I said on the video when I was not under oath, that
is a different story,'' Alberty told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty did assert, in the most dramatic part of his testimony,
that doctors in the clinic would sometimes use lengthier procedures
when doing abortions if it meant keeping a fetus intact.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-abortion lawmakers said they will continue to push to
end the use of fetuses for medical research -- despite Alberty's
conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is too big for any one person,'' said Rep. Chris
Smith, R-N.J. ''This issue is just beginning to get the airing it
needs. This is just one day in this ongoing battle to stop this
heinous practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who support abortion rights urged caution. ''If state
and federal laws are not being enforced, let's do better,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ''But let us not sensationalize this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it is legal to use fetal tissue for research
as long as it is donated, not sold, by the woman. Congress in 1993
lifted a ban on federally funded research using fetal tissue, but
made it a felony to purchase or sell the tissue for profit. The law
allows only reasonable charges to cover he cost of extracting and
transferring tissue to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue is seen as among the best hopes for finding new
treatments for illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by anti-abortion lawmakers is that some tissue
retrieval companies are charging prices as high as $325 for a
spinal cord and $75 for a single eye.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said they would seek contempt-of-Congress
against Dr. Miles Jones, the Missouri pathologist who appeared on
television, for not responding to the panel's subpoena. They also
asked the Justice Department to investigate the allegations raised
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers urged Congress not to ban fetal tissue
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned that in attempting to enforce the laws
governing fetal tissue research ... Congress may unnecessarily
over-restrict fetal tissue research,'' said Dr. Samuel M. Cohen, a
University of Nebraska Medical Center pathologist. ''This would be
a grave mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore To Stay With Son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tipper Gore has canceled her part in a
bus tour of Tennessee this weekend to stay in Washington with her
son Albert III, who may need surgery on an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old injured his right ankle a few days ago during a
lacrosse scrimmage for his team at Sidwell Friends High School
team, said Camille Johnston, Mrs. Gore's spokeswoman,
</P>
<P>
   She did not know how the injury occurred. ''He will need medical
attention over the weekend and his mother wants to be with him,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Albert Gore Jr., the vice president and Democratic
presidential candidate, was home Thursday but planned to fly to New
York on Friday morning to continue campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores have reason to be protective of their only son. He
nearly died after being hit by a car in 1989 when he was 6 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Their eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, will take her
mother's place on the bus Saturday and ride from Memphis to
Nashville for a get-out-the-vote rally in advance of next Tuesday's
primary.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Headline 10 Funding Events  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will headline 10
fund-raisers in the next month as the Democratic National Committee
fills its campaign coffers for the fall elections, party sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While dates and locations were still being finalized, the plans
had been drawn up for whoever emerged as the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee following Super Tuesday contests this week.
Gore was assured of the nomination Thursday after his only
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, withdrew from the race after
failing to win any of those contests.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources could not say how much they hoped to pick up,
but noted that President Clinton has raised $6 million at 10 events
so far this year, and has another 10 scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fund-raiser on the Democratic schedule will be in
the spring, a salute to Clinton that is expected to raise millions.
It is being chaired by veteran Democratic fund-raiser Terry
McAuliffe, who was the chief money man for the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The party hopes to raise $100 million this year, some of it in
accordance with federal contribution limits so it can be used to
aid Gore directly. The rest would be unregulated soft money, which
can be used for get-out-the-vote efforts and issue advertisements
that are designed to help elect Democratic candidates without
specifically urging a vote for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Democrats meet their goal, they could trail the
Republicans by tens of millions of dollars. The Republican National
Committee said it plans to raise $172 million this year for its
campaign. Its major fund-raiser, a black-tie gala in Washington, is
scheduled for late April.

<HEADLINE> Police Hunt Md. Murder Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Schoolchildren were kept indoors and residents
locked their homes in a neighborhood just outside the city Thursday
as police hunted for a man accused of killing four people in a
two-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph C. Palczynski, 31, was believed to be on foot. Early
Thursday, police recovered guns they said were used in the
shootings and a stolen car he was believed to have driven, but
Palczynski was gone.
</P>
<P>
   While police said his estranged girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead,
told them the rifle and pistol-grip shotgun were Palczynski's only
weapons, investigators weren't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 24 hours now. Who knows what he's got?'' said Bill
Toohey, a Baltimore County Police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Palczynski abducted Whitehead on Tuesday night
in nearby Bowleys Quarters after shooting to death George and
Gloria Shenk, a couple who had sheltered the woman after she moved
from Palczynski's home a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Shenk home, he allegedly shot and killed David
Meyers, 42, a neighbor who tried to help Whitehead during the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, police said, a woman was killed and a
2-year-old boy was wounded when they drove by as Palczynski fired
shots during an attempted carjacking. The boy, shot in the cheek,
was in stable condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped late Wednesday after they stopped at a motel.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski had been arrested last Saturday for allegedly
assaulting Whitehead. He was released on bail on Sunday, then
bought a rifle and shotgun on Monday, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   He already had an extensive criminal record dating to 1988
including several assault convictions and time in both prison and a
psychiatric facility. In 1989, Idaho police use tear gas to flush
him from an apartment while serving a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as police combed neighborhoods and 20 schools kept
children inside as a precaution, one of Palczynski's childhood
friends appealed to him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know I care about you, you know I love you, and you've got
to stop this, man,'' George Coleman told WJZ-TV.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Extremist Sentenced to Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A member of the Palestinian group Hamas was
sentenced to life in prison Thursday for two attacks in the West
Bank -- one which left an Israeli soldier dead.
</P>
<P>
   Amin Talul, 21, from the town of Dahariya, southwest of Hebron,
carried out the attacks two months apart, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first incident, two Israeli soldiers were wounded in a
drive-by shooting in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, in January 1999, one soldier died and
another was wounded in a shootout at an intersection leading to the
Palestinian-controlled section of Hebron. The city is divided into
Israeli and Palestinian parts.
</P>
<P>
   The army statement identified Talul as an activist in Hamas, an
extremist Islamic group opposed to peace with Israel. The group has
carried out dozens of attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Iyyad Batat, a Hamas leader, was also
involved with the fatal 1999 attack. Batat was killed Dec. 13 when
Israeli forces attacked a house in Beit Awa, a West Bank village
near Hebron.

<HEADLINE> HMO Patients' Protections Sought  </HEADLINE>
BY KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inching toward consensus on protections for
patients in health maintenance organizations, congressional
negotiators agreed Thursday to let consumers use out-of-plan
hospitals in emergencies and to prevent plans from discriminating
against providers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, said lawmakers need to focus on resolving
more difficult questions about whether patients can sue their
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators with two competing bills are
working on compromise legislation that would give Americans certain
rights when dealing with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have concentrated on provisions where their
differences are not so great. Last week, for example, lawmakers
agreed that pediatricians could be designated as a child's primary
care physician without prior approval from health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan House measure would cover 160 million Americans
with private insurance and allow patients' to sue if they were hurt
by a health plan's decision to deny care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill crafted by Republicans applies to 55 million
Americans whose health plans are not regulated by states and
prohibits lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to negotiators that noted a self-imposed March 31
deadline, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., urged lawmakers to begin resolving major differences in
the two bills concerning lawsuits and coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are matters we really have to resolve first,'' Dingell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the conference committee,
said he was open to starting talks on lawsuits and applicability,
but wanted to finish up other matters first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can continue a good full effort on the patients'
protections and then we can certainly begin some discussions on
some ideas on scope ... and appeals,'' Nickles said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Tuvalu School Fire Kills 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUI, Tuvalu (AP) -- Fire swept through a locked dormitory at a
high school in the South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, killing 17
teen-age girls and a matron, a local radio reporter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was believed to have been caused by a student's candle
which toppled over in the sleeping quarters of Motufoua Secondary
School.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, girls between 14 and 17 years old, were locked
inside their dormitory and couldn't escape when the fire broke out
late Thursday night, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told
Australia's National Nine News.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girls were in the dormitory, were trying to escape from
the fire but could not because all the doors were locked,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The matron died as she attempted to battle past the flames to
free the girls, Semi said.
</P>
<P>
   No further details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana revealed the tragedy to
his country Friday in an address on Radio Tuvalu. He said he would
visit the high school later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu is one of the world's smallest nations in both population
and size. Its 9,000 people live on 10 square miles of coral atolls
in the Pacific Ocean, about 620 miles north of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly called the Ellice Islands, Tuvalu was ruled by Britain
from the 1890s until 1978 when it became independent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Won't Wait Up for S.C. Results  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Al Gore or Al Gore. That was the choice
for South Carolina Democrats meeting in presidential caucuses just
hours after Bill Bradley quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   Even state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian called it
''an irrelevant event.''
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses, which were sparsely attended, stood in sharp
contrast to the state's Republican primary last month, which drew a
record 573,000 voters at a pivotal time in John McCain's challenge
to front-runner George W. Bush. McCain lost South Carolina and went
on to widespread losses in Tuesday's voting. He suspended his
campaign Thursday, just after Bradley quit the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who didn't win any states, endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After Super Tuesday, the AP's delegate count showed Gore had
1,479 delegates to 414 for Bradley, with 2,170 needed for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three of South Carolina's 52 delegates were being awarded
in caucuses that are also used for precinct organization.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they did not immediately plan to break down
the votes by congressional district and it could be as late as
Monday before the party figured out how all the delegates would be
apportioned among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known third choice in the state was retired political
science professor William Kreml, whose campaign is protesting
federal campaign finance laws.

<HEADLINE> $9B OK'd for U.S. Troops in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee gave bipartisan approval
Thursday to a $9 billion measure financing U.S. troops in Kosovo
and other programs after rejecting a Democratic effort to trim aid
in the bill for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which also has money for recovery efforts from
recent domestic natural disasters, was approved by the House
Appropriations Committee by a 33-13 vote. House passage is possible
next week.
</P>
<P>
   By 36-20, the committee rejected an effort by Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., to withhold $552 million of the bill's $1.7 billion for
stabilizing Colombia's government and helping it and other nearby
countries combat cocaine production.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also used a mostly party-line 31-23 vote to reject
an effort by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to add $1.3 billion for
drug treatment and prevention programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed $1.3 billion more for Colombia and
other Andean nations, on top of $300 million already in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress needs to know a whole lot more about what we're doing
before we proceed,'' said Obey, whose amendment would have allowed
a House vote on providing the $552 million by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Obey and others argued that the United States risks a costly,
10-year involvement in Colombia, where a decades-long civil war
already has taken 35,000 lives. Colombia has become the world's top
cocaine producer, and efforts by Bogota to stop the traffickers
have so far produced scant results.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Obey's plan cited the need to do something to
reduce the drug problem in the United States, and they chided Obey
for opposing a plan backed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your lack of confidence in him is stunning to me,'' said Rep.
Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The aid to Colombia includes money to supply 63 helicopters,
train and equip Colombian troops and police, strengthen human
rights efforts and persuade coca farmers to grow other crops.
Included are small amounts of aid for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to committee leaders, White House budget chief Jack
Lew lauded lawmakers' ''timely support,'' saying it would ''help to
stem the flow of drugs into the United States and will further
benefit the United States by bringing greater peace and prosperity
to an important ally.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill seems likely to pass the House, despite Democratic
opposition to the Colombia plan and conservative unease over the
size of the overall legislation. But GOP leaders of the Senate,
which has yet to write its own version, have so far shown little
enthusiasm for the package.
</P>
<P>
   The entire bill, which would finance a wide range of foreign
affairs, defense and domestic programs, is nearly twice the size of
the $5.2 billion Clinton has requested. It would be paid for almost
entirely from the federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$2.2 billion for recovery from last fall's Hurricane Floyd and
other disasters. Clinton has proposed $1.2 billion. The extra money
includes $7 million to combat Pierce's disease, which is hurting
Southern California farms, and $40 million to help producers of
lime and other citrus crops damaged by the citrus canker.
</P>
<P>
   --All $2 billion Clinton wants for the costs of American forces
in Kosovo, and the $25 million for U.S. operations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   --$1.6 billion to cover the Pentagon's higher fuel bill caused by
rising oil prices and $854 million to bolster the Defense
Department's health insurance program. Clinton asked for neither.
</P>
<P>
   --$104 million to build a new U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
But it ignores the additional $135 million Clinton requested for
new diplomatic buildings in Pristina, Kosovo, and in Tirana,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   --$40 million Clinton wants to help resident near the Vieques,
Puerto Rico, firing range used by the Navy.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Communist Party HQ Seized  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Radical nationalists who seized the
headquarters of the Ukrainian Communist Party surrendered to police
early Friday, ending a 13-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Group members said they gave up after government officials and
lawmakers agreed to consider their political program. One by one,
teen-agers and young men, as well as one young woman, emerged to
board waiting police jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen students took control of the building in Kiev's
old, picturesque Podil district at about noon Thursday, sending
communist officials fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded a ban on Communist Party, which they said
undermined Ukrainian independence, a purge of former Communists
occupying state posts, and called on Ukraine to leave the
Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian nationalists are generally wary of Moscow, which they
suspect of imperialist trends, and they often accuse the Communist
Party of being a Russian agent seeking to enslave Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The youths spread gasoline inside the two-story building to
prevent police from entering. They also placed an old car next to
the entrance, claiming that it contained explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything reeks of gasoline here. One bullet is enough to
cause a blast,'' one group member who identified himself as Serhiy
said through a loudspeaker before their surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy police forces and commando units were brought to the
scene. Nationalist legislators and Volodymyr Tsybulko, an aide to
Ukraine's prime minister, went inside to negotiate. Tsybulko took
two of the group to meet with government officials and examine the
government's program for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not terrorists. We're not against democratic interests,
but we demand to implement our requirements,'' one group member
said through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets distributed by the group said the group acted on the
eve of the 100-year anniversary of a historic speech made by
Ukrainian nationalist figure Mykola Mikhnovsky.
</P>
<P>
   During the takeover, a guard fired several shots from a gas
pistol inside the building. There were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Although both the attackers and the negotiators said repeatedly
there were no hostages in the building, one elderly Communist
somehow remained trapped inside for hours. When he suddenly started
to bang on the window and asked to be released, the attackers
promptly set him free.

<HEADLINE> Judge Hears Arguments in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With flag-waving demonstrators tying up traffic
outside, a federal judge heard arguments Thursday on whether he has
the right to second-guess the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez asked U.S. District Judge K.
Michael Moore to order the INS to hold a political asylum hearing
for Elian. The U.S. government, however, asked the judge to dismiss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-hour hearing, the judge gave no indication of
when he might rule.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's fate has been debated since November, when he was
found clinging to an inner tube off Florida. His mother and 10
others drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to reach
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS in early January ordered that Elian be returned to his
father in Cuba, a decision backed by President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno. The order was put on hold pending the court
fight.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Edwin Kneedler, a government attorney, argued that
Congress gave the attorney general the power to administer
immigration laws, and ''the decisions of the attorney general are
subject to only narrow judicial review.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the great-uncle argued that the INS' actions are
not exempt from court review, and that the agency violated the
boy's rights by refusing to grant him a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any alien that is within the United States ... is entitled to
apply for asylum and INS is obligated to hear that claim,'' said
attorney Linda Osberg-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler said that the boy's father opposed asylum for his son,
and that his wishes should be respected over those of the boy's
great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a father closely involved in the child's life,''
Kneedler told the judge. ''This was not an absent father; this was
a present father.''
</P>
<P>
   He said INS officials conducted a thorough investigation, which
was reviewed by Reno, and found no basis for an asylum claim.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, about 60 demonstrators -- most of them
supporters of Elian's staying in the United States -- waved huge
Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our hope that the court's resolution of the motions that
were argued today will make it possible for this little boy to go
home to his father, and bring an end to this extraordinary case,''
Patricia Maher, U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman, said after the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was not in the courtroom Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Head OKs Dollar as Currency  </HEADLINE>
By GONZALO SOLANO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's president on Thursday signed a
controversial bill into law that will make the U.S. dollar the
official currency of this small Andean country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a law long anticipated in Ecuador that will provide a
new structure to the nation,'' President Gustavo Noboa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa ratified the reform package before boarding a plane to
attend the swearing-in of Chilean President Ricardo Lagos. Congress
had passed the bill early last week.
</P>
<P>
   After Noboa's flight departed, international lenders in
Washington announced a three-year, $2 billion aid package to help
finance the rebuilding of Ecuador's economy, with the dollar plan
as the cornerstone of the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The country can now count on a $425 million lifeline from the
World Bank, while the International Monetary Fund said it will
contribute $300 million, and the Inter-American Development Bank
pledged a further $620 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporacion Andina de Fomento, an Andes-based development
bank, will provide the remaining $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador had been desperately negotiating for the aid after
defaulting last year on its foreign debt, which now tops $16
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill signed by Noboa lays out a 180-day schedule to withdraw
the local currency, the sucre, from circulation and replace it with
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador now joins Panama and nine other developing nations where
the dollar is legal tender.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa has said that changing the currency is the only way to
stabilize Ecuador's economy and halt rising inflation, which
currently tops 90 percent, the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The switch will prevent the government from printing extra money
to meet its budget after years of deficit spending, eliminating a
major cause of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's mostly poor population of 12 million people had
expressed skepticism about the currency switch.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar plan was one of the issues that prompted hundreds of
Indians and young army officers to seize the empty Congress
building on Jan. 21, leading to then-President Jamil Mahuad's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Power was ceded to Noboa, the democratically elected vice
president.

<HEADLINE> NY Mogul Sentenced 90 Days in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Real estate mogul Abe Hirschfeld was sentenced
to 90 days in jail Thursday because he violated an order to keep
quiet about his trial for allegedly trying to hire a hit man to
kill his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, the 80-year-old millionaire who once offered Paula
Jones $1 million to drop her sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton, was convicted of contempt of court in a non-jury
trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   He brought several newspaper stories in court Thursday in an
effort to convince Justice Harold Beeler he was too honest and
important to go to jail. The judge was not convinced, however, and
also fined Hirschfeld $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had issued a warrant for Hirschfeld's arrest Wednesday
after Hirschfeld failed to show up for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld apparently attended the opening of a play at a
theater he redeveloped in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday night, and he
showed up in court in a gold and silver lame dinner jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led from the courtroom, Hirschfeld yelled at court
officers, ''Stop pushing me! Nazis!''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld's criminal solicitation trial ended with a deadlocked
jury. Prosecutors said that case will be retried, as will a tax
evasion case that also ended in a hung jury.

Govt. Dept. Taking Over Canada Student Loans Program
<TEXT>
<P>
   HULL, Quebec (AP) -- A federal government department, under fire
for bungling job grants, is taking over the high-risk and costly
Canada Student Loans program.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for more than $1.5 billion in annual student
loans will pass from several banks and credit unions to Human
Resources Development Canada on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize there are insufficient financial institutions
willing to participate in the (loans program) in its current
form,'' said Thomas Townsend, director general of learning and
literacy for HRDC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to assure the program will continue on Aug. 1.
Students won't see any change.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't ease everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not confident at all,'' said Reform MP Maurice Vellacott,
a human resources critic for his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''HRDC couldn't handle this in the past and that's why it went
to the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa had negotiated for months with Royal Bank, CIBC and the
Bank of Nova Scotia to renew a 1995 deal that expires July 31.

Winnipeg Man Who Wants Fairness in Tax System Has Day in Court
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Winnipeg man who says the tax system favors the
rich over the poor was in court Thursday to find out if he can
launch a lawsuit to wipe out that inequity.
</P>
<P>
   George Harris is taking issue with a 1991 tax ruling that
allowed a family -- widely believed to be the Bronfmans of Seagram
fame -- to transfer $2 billion in assets out of the country without
having to pay tax.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers told the Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday that
Harris should be allowed to go to court on behalf of the public to
challenge the tax ruling because it didn't comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Peltz said his client isn't trying to meddle in the tax
affairs of others but is attempting to get a court's interpretation
of the relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue Canada's conduct fell ''far short'' of what the public
would expect, added Peltz, and ''there ought to be a remedy.''

Quebec Govt. Says Judge Was Wrong To Strike Down Sign Laws.
</P>
<P>
   GRANBY, Quebec (AP) -- Laws are needed to protect French in
Quebec but it's not up to the provincial government to prove the
language is in danger, a government lawyer argued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those who challenge the province's language laws must
prove the future of French is no longer at risk, said Jean-Yves
Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in an anglophone ocean and no one can question that,''
Bernard told Quebec Superior Court Justice Paul-Marcel Bellavance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear the French language will always need protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec government is appealing a ruling last fall that
struck down language laws requiring the predominance of French on
commercial signs.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a couple who had a bilingual sign for their
antique store called the Lyon and the Wallrus in Knowlton, Quebec.
The store is now in nearby Sutton, with a smaller version of the
same sign.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a Quebec Court judge ruled in favor of the couple.
The judge said the government did not prove in the case that French
is still threatened in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The government considered the sign illegal because its English
and French lettering were of equal size. The law, which remains in
effect pending the appeal, allows for bilingual commercial signs as
long as French is predominant.

International Water Forum, Great Lakes Water Report, Raise Export
Issue
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- International attention is again being focused on
Canada's fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   That's renewing the debate over whether Canadians, who often
take their abundant water resources for granted, may be forced sell
water to export markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, a virtual moratorium on large-scale water removals from
the Great Lakes will likely be a key recommendation when a joint
Canada-U.S. review body delivers its final report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, the International Joint Commission has been
studying ways to protect the massive transborder lakes. The IJC
conclusions are expected to help set water policy on both sides of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected to warn that the Great Lakes ecosystem can't
afford to lose any water to bulk commercial sales.

Inuit Leader Says Labrador Community Overwhelmed by Rising Tide of
Death
</P>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- As if a murder and a rash of
suicides weren't enough, the grim death toll in Labrador's largest
Inuit community continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crisis response teams in Nain have been working like
they've never worked before,'' William Barbour, president of the
Labrador Inuit Association, said Thursday from the isolated
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just the suicides that we have been dealing with in
Nain. It's the many, many other deaths we've been dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, 15 people in Nain have died of
various causes, including a variety of illnesses, Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who died was Barbour's own daughter. She was among
three people who have committed suicide since Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within Nain, we are dealing with a major crisis,'' Barbour
said, making a few oblique references to his own ''personal
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not just Nain, it's all of our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 4,800 Inuit in Labrador. About 1,300 of them live in
Nain, the region's oldest and most northerly Inuit community.
</P>
<P>
   The Newfoundland government has appointed Premier Brian Tobin to
lead a committee to study the problems faced by Labrador
aboriginals, who also include the Innu nation farther south.

<HEADLINE> Austrian OK After Hand Transplants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- In a rare operation, surgeons
successfully transplanted hands on a man who lost his in an
explosion. He was reported in good condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Kelz, 45, a policeman from the southern Austrian province
of Carinthia, underwent the procedure in Innsbruck, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 18 surgeons worked for 17 hours to successfully
complete the surgery Wednesday. While one team prepared the surgery
for the right hand, another worked simultaneously on the left,
Hildegunde Piza, head of the Innsbruck plastic surgery ward, told
the Kurier newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Kelz was ''generally in good condition,'' doctors said Thursday
in a statement carried by the Austria Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the high risk of infection, only doctors are allowed to
visit Kelz, who remains on medication to keep the body from
rejecting the new organs, said Dr. Raimund Margreiter, head of
surgery at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Kelz's surgeons expect that within a year, he will be able to
perform basic skills with both of his new hands, although the new
hands will never have the full function of the natural ones.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1994, Kelz lost both of his hands in a pipe bomb
explosion. For more than five years, he used protheses to continue
working as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Matthew Scott, of Absecon, N.J., became the first
person in the United States to receive a transplanted hand. Other
hand transplants have been performed in France and China.

<HEADLINE> Hotel development agency dodges public records law  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lawmakers said they will consider extending
public-records laws to include economic development agencies formed
by county and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   City officials here have formed the nonprofit Lafayette Yard
Community Development Corp. to build a hotel and conference center
with city and state financing. Private developers could not be
lured to the project one block from the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the nonprofit corporation have denied a request
from the Times of Trenton to see the contract it has signed with
Marriott International Inc. to manage the facility. Attorney Lemuel
H. Blackburn Jr. told the newspaper New Jersey's public records
disclosure law does not apply to nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   News of the dispute prompted strong reaction on the Senate
Judiciary Committee Thursday as the members debated proposals to
strengthen the law on access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Martin, R-Morris, is the prime sponsor of S-866, the
main public records bill under consideration before the committee.
Asked if nonprofit developers like the Lafayette Yards agency were
covered in his proposal, Martin said, ''I don't think it is, but it
is something we are going to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Publisher Richard Bilotti testified about the dilemma
Thursday to the Judiciary Committee to illustrate the need to
toughen existing law.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal councils -- and the subcommittees, boards and
authorities they create -- have always been subject to laws
concerning public records and public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But these nonprofit agencies are a new species, often engaging
in negotiations or contracts with real estate developers or other
private firms unaccustomed to having their business open to public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, shook his
head as Bilotti detailed the agency's lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take care of it in the budget language,'' Gormley
said, implying that state funding for the hotel project will be
hinged on cooperation with public records requests.
</P>
<P>
   Bilotti said the Times' attorneys will fight in court for the
Lafayette Yards documents, but that ordinary residents cannot
afford such measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is information that should be available to the public,
and if you don't have access to attorneys, it is a problem,''
Billotti said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that the refusal to disclose the Marriott
contract could set a precedent for withholding other financial
details about the hotel project as it progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The Lafayatte Yards agency is authorized to borrow $31 million
by selling municipal bonds. The hotel project will also be
supported by $14.5 million in financing from state agencies and the
city's parking authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of public pieces to this thing,'' City Council
president Frank Cirillo told the newspaper. ''The community has a
right to know what agreements have been struck between these
groups.''

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Minimum Wage Raised  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With the national election one month away,
President Alberto Fujimori raised the monthly minimum wage Thursday
nearly 20 percent to $118.
</P>
<P>
   The raise, the first for workers in the private sector since
September 1997, was announced in the government's official
newspaper, El Peruano. It was immediately denounced by opposition
politicians as election pandering ahead of the April 9 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage was $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 years in power, Fujimori has been widely credited
with stemming guerrilla violence, stabilizing the economy and
bringing roads, electricity and higher health standards to Peru's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the 61-year-old president's free-market reforms have failed
to generate the jobs and higher wages he promised.
</P>
<P>
   About half Peru's population live in poverty, according the
United Nations, and government figures show that only one in every
two people in the labor force has steady work.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authoritarian president still commands a solid lead
in the election race according to opinion polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over 213,000 lighters are being recalled by
the manufacturer. The lighters can leak butane when ignited,
causing an excessive burst of flame.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's Stores Inc. of Irving, Texas, in cooperation with the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, is recalling the lighters after
14 reports of excessive flame, including three reports of consumers
whose hands were burned as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled all-purpose lighters are refillable and contain
butane. They are about nine inches long and have a white plastic
base. The lighters' handles are red, green or blue plastic with a
black plastic trigger and on/off switch and a metal barrel.
</P>
<P>
   A yellow label affixed to the handle reads in part, ''DANGER:
EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE CONTENTS UNDER PRESSURE...MADE IN CHINA.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighters were displayed in a cardboard display sleeve under
the brand name Handy Home. The brand name is not on the lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's Stores nationwide sold the lighters from July 1998
through January of this year for about $2 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should stop using the lighters immediately and return
them to any Michael's Store for a refund. For more information,

<HEADLINE> Keyes Predicts Gore Will Beat Bush  </HEADLINE>
By RON JENKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Alan Keyes promised Thursday to stay in the
Republican presidential race because George W. Bush is too weak to
stand up to Al Gore on key moral issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush can't do it,'' Keyes said at the Oklahoma Capitol
before a speech at the Christian Heritage Academy in Del City.
''I've watched him and he can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion, but would make exceptions in cases of
rape and incest or to protect the life of a pregnant woman. Gore
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''So when he stands toe to toe with Al Gore ... he will come off
looking second best because he doesn't know how to make the case,
properly and effectively. And so we'll lose,'' said Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a former Reagan administration official, said he did not
take as a personal rebuke the fact that he had not received more
votes so far during the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   One reason he said he will not drop out of the race is that he
wants to break the mentality of Republicans going into the voting
booth ''to be a rubber stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sickening, but if people want to go on with it, to go
into the voting booth and continue this garbage, it's no reflection
on me,'' said Keyes, who has campaigned strongly in opposition to
legalized abortion, gay rights and for prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was presenting a message and if voters did not accept
it, ''you make a judgment against yourself and against America.''

<HEADLINE> MetLife Files To Sell 179M Shares  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Metlife Inc., the nation's second-largest life
insurer, filed Thursday for an initial public offering of 179
million shares, or 24 percent of the company, which is converting
to a public company from one owned by policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are expected to price between $13 and $15 each,
raising up to $2.7 billion, the company said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The offering has been scaled back from the company's original
plans. In November, MetLife estimated it would raise $6 billion by
selling 255 million shares for $14 to $24 each.
</P>
<P>
   That would have made it the largest domestic IPO ever,
surpassing the $5.47 billion raised this month by United Parcel
Service.
</P>
<P>
   But insurance stocks, along with other ''Old Economy'' blue
chips have come upon hard times in the intervening months,
prompting the company to make a more modest offering.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based insurer could raise an additional $1.1
billion through a private placement of 73,000 shares with Credit
Suisse First Boston and Banco Santander Central Hispano SA, who
together could hold up to a 9.8 percent equity stake, according to
the filing.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife also filed to sell up to $1 billion in convertible
securities.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the offering, MetLife will issue 493.5 million

<HEADLINE> Ill. Panel To Study Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Gov. George Ryan on Thursday launched a new
commission on capital punishment that will study Illinois' death
penalty system and recommend reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, 13 death-row inmates have been released -- one
more than the state has executed since capital punishment was
reinstated in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that shows the system badly needs repair. He said the
moratorium on executions he imposed in January will remain in place
until he is convinced that the system is working.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until I can be sure that anyone sentenced to death in Illinois
is guilty and until I can be sure with moral certainty that no
innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, nobody will
meet that fate,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McGarr, a former federal judge, will head the panel.
Former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and former U.S. Attorney Thomas
Sullivan will serve as co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   William Webster, a former federal judge and a former director of
both the FBI and CIA, will serve as an adviser to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   One of 14 commission members is best-selling novelist Scott
Turow, a former federal prosecutor, who said prosecutorial
misconduct will be examined by the commission along with the
question of what kinds of cases call for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the death-penalty cases that were reversed,
prosecutors acknowledged they had the wrong man after they were
confronted with DNA evidence, new witnesses or confessions from
others. In other cases, the inmates' convictions were thrown out on
appeal and prosecutors have yet to pursue retrials.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's is the second high-level commission to study the death
penalty issue this year. A panel appointed by the Illinois Supreme
Court already recommended requiring a number of steps, including
requiring attorneys to have more experience before they are allowed
to defend capital cases.

<HEADLINE> Missing Fla. Girl Found in Store  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Three days after she was abducted as
she got off her school bus, a 10-year-old girl walked alone into a
Wal-Mart 25 miles from her home Thursday and asked for help --
ending her ordeal but not the mystery of what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   A short time after the Wal-Mart employees called police, Jessica
Rodriguez jumped into her mother's arms and was smothered with hugs
and kisses, Sheriff David Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believe the child was dropped off
outside the Wal-Mart by her captor, but it was still unclear what
happened to her while she was missing. Authorities were searching
for the man they believed grabbed her from her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's fine, she's talking to mom. She's in good condition,''
Turner said. ''She's one tough, strong little girl. She was very
happy to see her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica was taken to a hospital for an examination. Police said
they planned to interview her as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   She returned home just before Thursday night, where about 60
relatives and friends greeted her with a cheer. A classmate gave
her a white rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all told her we loved her, we missed her,'' said here aunt,
Vivian Elliott. ''What more did we have to say?''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was reported snatched by a stranger Monday as she got
off the bus with her two younger sisters at their rural home
northwest of Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, her mother and aunts made tearful
public pleas for her return. Her uncles combed through the woods
looking for her, emerging dusty and bloodied from briar scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Jessica had been found alive came as her mother,
Jennifer Graham, was undergoing a routine lie-detector test at the
sheriff's office, said Sharon Gogerty, a spokeswoman for the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Turner and Graham
immediately left for Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mom went out screaming,'' Gogerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica's sisters, ages 4 and 8, told authorities they saw a man
grab her from her long dirt driveway in the middle of the afternoon
and put her in a green Jeep Cherokee. The bus driver said he never
saw the man, nor his Cherokee. A composite drawing of a man in his
30s or 40s was produced using information supplied by the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica's extended family has lived in the isolated woods
northwest of Gainesville for five generations, considering it a
safe place to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in rural Gilchrist County, we don't have crimes of this
nature occurring,'' the sheriff said. ''This is an extreme rarity.
This is very traumatic for the family and community.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her daughter was found Thursday, Graham pleaded for the
girl's return on NBC's ''Today.'' ''I love my daughter and we are
all human. And we are praying for both of you. And please bring my
baby back home to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said she normally met her daughters at the bus stop as a
safety precaution. The girls were the last students on the bus in
the afternoon, and Graham said she knew it wasn't a good idea to
let her guard down.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, she said, she had fallen asleep on the couch
after working a night shift at a fast-food restaurant and caring
for her youngest, a 6-month-old boy. Her fiance, Thomas Kelley, a
mechanic, said he was working in the yard and heard the girls
scream. He ran toward them just in time to see the man back out of
the driveway and speed off, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Tucker, regional director for the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, said children kidnapped by strangers are rarely found
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the sheriff made reference yesterday to the Good Lord
-- I think he was with us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Hauled to Court 14 Years Later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Some 14 years after she failed to appear
in court on a misdemeanor charge, the law finally caught up with
Suzanne Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Officers came to Meyers' home on Sunday in this suburban Detroit
community, slapped the handcuffs onto the 30-year-old mother of two
and carted her off to the station -- all stemming from an alcohol
possession charge from her teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been racking my brain,'' Meyers said. ''I don't even
remember this.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge threw out the charge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Vohs, police chief in nearby Warren, said Meyers was
brought in during officers' routine work to clear a backlog of
misdemeanor warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''A warrant's a warrant,'' he said. ''The officer had no way of
knowing it happened when she was 16 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meyers didn't see why she had to be handcuffed in plain view
of her neighbors, or why relatives were made to post $100 bond for
her release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so humiliated,'' she said. ''I have never even had a
speeding ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said she tried to plead guilty ''to get it over with,''
but Judge Dawnn Gruenburg balked at accepting her plea on Wednesday
when Meyers said she couldn't remember the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Gruenburg soon threw out the charge after consulting with
Warren's city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy about that, but I'm kind of mad because they put
me through all that,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Meyers and her family are new in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know the neighbors yet,'' she said. ''I'm sure
they don't want to know me now.''

House Approves Minimum Raise Hike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House tonight approved a $1 increase in the minimum
wage over two years and a 10-year, $122 billion Republican tax cut. The vote was
246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the $5.15-an-hour wage by $1 over
two years -- a $2,000 raise for a full-time worker. The amendment replaced a
Republican plan to increase the wage by $1 over three years. Earlier, the House
voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill, two-thirds of it cuts in estate taxes.
Meanwhile, President Clinton vowed to veto the measure, saying the tax relief
disproportionately benefits the wealthy and would consume a chunk of the
projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up Social Security and
Medicare.

McCain, Bradley Quit Presidential Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Sen. John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley
dropped out of the race for the presidency today following heavy primary losses
earlier this week. An hour before McCain abandoned his campaign, Bradley told
reporters he would support Vice President Al Gore, but he also accused his
fellow Democrat of ''distortions'' in their primary fight. ''I hope that he will
run a better campaign in the general election,'' said the former New Jersey
senator, who was unable to win any primary or caucus. McCain, defeated by
establishment-backed George W. Bush, was the 10th Republican to leave the race.
Bradley has been Gore's only challenger. They could not sustain momentum against
the sheer force of their rivals' organizations.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Record-setting temperatures soared today as high
as the 70s around the Northeast, spreading spring fever and unleashing an
out-of-season blast of thunderstorms. In Worcester, Mass., the temperature
climbed to 74 degrees, leapfrogging the old record of 60 for the date. It was 34
degrees above the normal high, according to the National Weather Service.
Records were set at 78 degrees in Atlantic City, N.J., and at 73 in both
Scranton, Pa., and Rochester, N.Y. Boston was a record 72. Even far-north
Burlington, Vt., to went to 66 -- beating the record set when the mercury hit 60

Plastic Time for Miller Beer

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. is going to sell three of its
best-selling beers -- Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft and Icehouse --
nationally in 16-ounce and 20-ounce plastic bottles as well as in the
traditional glass bottles and aluminum cans. Scott Bussen, a spokesman for the
Milwaukee-based brewer, said beer in plastic stays cold longer than in aluminum
cans and as long as in glass bottles, it weighs much less than glass and it is
unbreakable. But he conceded that there was ''natural skepticism'' by beer
drinkers to the idea of a plastic beer bottle but said Miller found in the test
markets that the wariness ''tends to melt away'' when they get a chance to hold
the bottle and taste the brew.

at 53.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 127, Trail Blazers 119, OT  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson hit a trio of 3-pointers in
overtime and scored 10 of his season-high 23 points in the extra
period to spark Indiana over Portland 127-119 Thursday night. The
victory stretched the Pacers' franchise-record home winning streak
to 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had a chance to win the game in regulation, getting the
ball inside to Rik Smits. But he was triple-teamed and tied up with
fourth-tenths of a second to play.
</P>
<P>
   Smits made up for it in overtime, scoring six quick points to
give Indiana a 115-108 lead with 2:29 left in the extra session. He
finished with 22 points, one of six Pacers to finish in double
figures as they overcame a career-high 29-point effort by Portland
reserve Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller and Chris Mullin, who made his first start of the
season with Jalen Rose out with the stomach flu, each scored 17 for
Indiana. Dale Davis contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds to the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace scored 24 for Portland, which dropped its third
game in four starts as the Pacers raised their home record against
Western Conference teams to 18-0. Arvdas Sabonis had 21 points for
the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's third 3-pointer in the overtime put Indiana ahead
118-110 and Portland never seriously challenged after that.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter was tight all the way and Portland led only
once. A 3-pointer by Wells left Portland trailing 103-100 with 1:51
to go. Sabonis completed a three-point play to tie the score with
1:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Davis made one of two free throws with 1:13 left and
</P>
<P>
   Portland took its final lead on a short hook shot by Wells with
53 seconds to go. After Travis Best put Indiana back in front,
Wells tied the game at 106 by hitting the first of two free throws.
But he missed the second to set up the play by Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana built an 18-point lead, 55-37, when Best made two free
throws with 5:18 left in the first half, but then went cold as
Portland went on an 11-1 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers tied the game twice early in the third
quarter, then fell behind by 10 twice in the period, which ended
with the Pacers leading 89-86. Scottie Pippen, who was scoreless in
the first half, had 10 points in the quarter
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wallace picked up his league-leading 25th technical foul
when he protested being called for his third personal. ... Indiana
was just the ninth Portland opponent to reach 100 points. ...
Mullin, who has seen limited action this season, left the game late
in the third quarter when he pulled his right calf muscle and did
not return. ... Indiana swept the season series with Portland. ...
Wells' previous high was 23 points on Jan. 8 against Phoenix. ...
Jackson, who had nine assists, had his previous season high of 18
on Dec. 30 against Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Chides League, Mavs, Cuban  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Mavericks coach-general manager Don Nelson
and owner-to-be Mark Cuban say flamboyant forward Dennis Rodman was
released Wednesday because the team was no longer in playoff
contention.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellious Rodman, as always, had a different point of view.
</P>
<P>
   In his first comments since being dropped by the only team
willing to put up with his antics, Rodman criticized the league,
the Mavericks organization and Cuban in an expletive-filled tirade
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not a personal thing, then it's the NBA, saying if you
don't get rid of Dennis Rodman, then you're not going to be an
owner,'' Rodman said. ''I think it's an injustice because I'm me,
Dennis Rodman. I haven't done anything wrong. I thought I was doing
a good job. I thought I lived up to my expectations. I don't get
it. I really don't get it. I get the short end of the stick every
... time. What am I doing wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's comments were made to Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson and Cuban, the bottom line was that Rodman did not
amount to more wins.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had won 10 of 13 games before Rodman's Feb. 3 signing. In
the 29 days and 13 games of the Rodman era, Dallas managed to win
just four games while enduring two ejections and a one-game
suspension from the league's most-pierced player.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question Dennis Rodman would still be here if we
were still in the playoff hunt,'' Nelson said after the Mavericks'
first post-Rodman shootaround. ''We had to decide if we wanted to
continue to give him 35 minutes a game or if we wanted to play
younger guys. We decided to play the younger guys. It was nothing
he said or did.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Rodman didn't supply ample ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Following a loss to Seattle on Tuesday -- the Mavericks' fifth in
a row -- Rodman criticized teammates and lashed out at the
ever-enthusiastic Cuban for being over-zealous.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Nelson said the comments had nothing to do with his
release. Both said plans to drop the tattooed one began after a
loss to Sacramento Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dennis is a passionate, emotional player and he vents
verbally,'' said Cuban, who had Rodman living in his guest house
for part of the season. ''That's just Dennis. I didn't take it
personally at all. If I was thin-skinned, I never would have done
it in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments still carried some sting.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't ever want to take shots at your teammates,'' said
Mavericks guard Eric Strickland. ''It hurt a little bit, but I
can't say it's going to stop me from playing the game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst capped what Mavericks players knew was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would have been great if it could have worked out,
but it definitely wasn't working out,'' guard Steve Nash said. ''I
didn't want to see him go in one sense, but on the other hand I
think it was time that he did go. I don't think he wanted to be
here. If Dennis wanted to be here, I think we would have seen a
different Dennis and a different result.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the same Dennis with the same result.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman wore out his welcome with San Antonio and even though he
won three championships with Chicago, his act was wearing thin
before he left there. Rodman was released after 48 games by the Los
Angeles Lakers last season.
</P>
<P>
   True to form in past stops, Rodman distanced himself from blame
in what may have been his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got used again,'' Rodman said. ''It's like being
blackballed. I've done so much for this league and people want to
see me play. ... I don't get it.''

<HEADLINE> Satellite Privatization Bill OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation intended to begin privatizing the
world's communications satellite network and give U.S. companies
direct access to it passed the House on Thursday. President Clinton
is expected to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill gives more competition and choices for Americans in
satellite services,'' said Rep. W.J. ''Billy'' Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House on a voice vote, will allow
telephone companies to bypass the Comsat satellite network and get
direct access to the global Intelsat consortium. It also will allow
Comsat to merge with Lockheed Martin Corp., a major defense
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat, which had expressed concerns about earlier drafts of the
legislation, supports the measure now heading to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed the Senate last week, sets forth
clear steps for the two intergovernmental satellite consortiums --
Intelsat and Inmarsat -- to follow on the road to privatization. If
they do not abide by these criteria, their access to the U.S.
market could be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to craft a compromise that will truly change the
satellite system for the better,'' said Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was necessary for Lockheed Martin Corp. to
complete its proposed deal with Comsat. The defense contractor
purchased 49 percent of Comsat early this fall, but could not
acquire the rest of the company because of current Comsat ownership
limits written into a 1962 law.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat, based in Bethesda, Md., was chartered by Congress in
1962 to keep then-telephone monopoly AT&AMP;T from extending its
control to international satellite communications. Once the law is
rewritten, the companies will have to go back to regulators to get
approval for the remainder of the deal.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gino Odjick's go-ahead breakaway goal early
in the third period led the Philadelphia Flyers to a 3-1 victory
over Washington on Thursday night, snapping the Capitals six-game
unbeaten string.
</P>
<P>
   Odjick took a pass from Valeri Zelepukin deep in the
Philadelphia zone, skated in and beat Olaf Kolzig to the glove side
with a backhander 2:45 into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros added an insurance goal with five minutes left
while the Flyers were on a 5-on-3 power play. Rick Tocchet added a
second-period goal in his first game with the Flyers after being
re-acquired Wednesday from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simon scored for the Capitals, winless in six games at
Philadelphia. Washington entered the game on a 5-0-1 streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie goalie Brian Boucher made a number of brilliant saves for
the Flyers, who held a 33-18 shots advantage. Boucher grabbed a
shot by Simon out of mid-air late in the first and made a juggling
stop on Andrei Nikolishin's hard shot midway through the third.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, playing in his 300th NHL game, put the Capitals ahead 1-0
at 12:03 of the first period with his team-high 23rd goal. He
flicked the puck in from the goal mouth after taking a pass from
behind the net from Ulf Dahlen.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet flipped in a rebound of his own shot on a power play
with 2:44 left in the second to pull the Flyers even. Philadelphia
leads the NHL with 65 power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, one of the most popular players during his first stint
with the Flyers from 1984-1992, received a thunderous ovation after
his 13th goal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Goal judge John Casey suffered cuts on his head with 14:15 left
when the lights behind the Washington net were knocked to the
ground after Lindros checked Dmitri Mironov into the boards.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Dan Marino To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Marino has decided to retire after 17 seasons
with the Miami Dolphins, and he'll announce his decision Monday,
according to broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
   Marino decided to reject an offer to play one season with the
Minnesota Vikings, CNN-SI and WTVJ-TV in Miami reported Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, didn't return phone calls seeking
comment. Dolphins president Eddie Jones said the reports that
Marino had decided to retire were news to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not heard a thing about it,'' Jones said. ''It's Dan's
decision to make. If he has made it, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings wanted Marino to replace Jeff George as their
starting quarterback. Marino earlier decided against remaining with
the Dolphins after concluding that new coach Dave Wannstedt didn't
want him back.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, would follow Miami coach Jimmy Johnson into
retirement. They clashed frequently during the Dolphins'
disappointing 1999 season, and Johnson publicly criticized Marino
for poor decisions and costly turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Their final bid to win a Super Bowl together ended with a 62-7
playoff loss at Jacksonville, the most lopsided defeat in franchise
history. Johnson retired the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Marino voided his contract in February and became a free agent.
When the Dolphins signed free agent quarterback Jay Fiedler to a
three-year, $3.8 million contract, it was clear Marino had likely
played his last game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Marino was angry about the way the Dolphins treated
him in recent weeks, but he declined to complain publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a Dolphin for 17 years, and I'll be a Dolphin for
the rest of my life,'' he said in February. ''That will never
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the most prolific passer in NFL history. In 17 seasons
he has completed 4,967 passes for 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns,
all NFL records. In 1984, his second season, Marino threw for 5,084
yards and 48 touchdowns, league records that still stand.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Friday
morning on selling by foreign investors. Japanese stocks rose
sharply, bolstered by sharp gains on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.63 yen at late morning, down 0.03 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 106.46
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 275.93
points, or 1.40 percent, moving to 19,938.26 at the end of the
morning session. On Thursday, the average closed down 104.47
points, or 0.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar dipped on foreign selling but
its downside was limited by continued fears that Japan's central
bank would intervene to stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan sold about $1 billion of yen in
Tokyo, the second such action since Jan. 4, in an attempt to halt
the yen's rapid advance against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Trades remained in a narrow range as Haruhiko Kuroda, vice
finance minister for international affairs at the Finance Ministry,
confirmed Japan's currency stance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to take action as needed,'' Kuroda told
reporters, hinting at possible further intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials have said the yen's rapid rise
against the greenback will hurt the nation's nascent economic
recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and
cutting into earnings of exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.20 yen, up from
102.89 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher Friday thanks to
strong gains on Wall Street, where the technology-rich Nasdaq
composite index rose 149.60 to close at 5,046.86, topping its
previous record close of 4,914.79, set last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.20
to 10,010.73 at Thursday's finish.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 9.52 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,653.29. The
TOPIX closed down 17.37 points, or 1.05 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8250 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7850 percent. Its
price fell 0.34 point to 99.78.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Iowa St. 85, Nebraska 48  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Put a line in front of Stacy Frese's
feet -- curved, straight, no matter -- and she's ready to let fly.
</P>
<P>
   Frese hit three 3-pointers and 9-of-12 free throws Thursday
night, scoring 20 points as No. 10 Iowa State beat Nebraska 85-48
in a physical Big 12 tournament semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''She controls everything,'' Nebraska coach Paul Sanderford
said. ''She makes big shots when they need big shots. When she
plays well, Iowa State is a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones (24-5) converted 27 fouls by Nebraska (18-12) --
plus a technical on Sanderford -- into a 30-for-40 night from the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska was 13-for-19 from the line and couldn't make up for
the disparity from the floor, hitting just 27 percent (18-for-68)
of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told the kids to keep guarding until the ball went in the
basket,'' said Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly, whose team meets
Texas in Saturday's final after the Longhorns upset No. 6 Texas
68-50. ''They (Nebraska) had been playing very well, and defense
set the tone in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Angie Welle added 15 points for top-seeded Iowa State, which
took control in the first half with a 14-0 run and added a 10-0 run
in the late first half and early second. Lindsey Wilson had 12
points -- 10 on free throws -- and Erica Haugen finished with 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones never led by fewer than 20 points after the first
two minutes of the second half and with 8:10 left doubled the score
at 74-37.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last whipping I remember like this, I took from my dad
when I was about 13,'' said Sanderford, who picked up a technical
for arguing a traveling call. ''I don't have any explanation for it
-- I thought we were prepared mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Casey Leonhardt led fifth-seeded Nebraska with 11 points
but got into early foul trouble and didn't make a field goal in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kubik, who set a tournament record with 32 points in
Nebraska's 80-67 quarterfinal victory over Kansas, didn't score in
the second half Thursday and fouled out with seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to make it tough on Kubik,'' Frese said. ''They were
probably a little tired. The minutes start to wear on you after a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubik's two steals gave her 12 in three tournament games and 416
for her career, moving her into ninth place on the NCAA Division I
list.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's foul trouble helped Iowa state take a 40-23 halftime
lead. The Cornhuskers didn't take a free throw in the first half,
while the Cyclones were 11-for-16 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Leonhardt scored 10 early points for Nebraska, including a
basket that tied the game at 16 with 9:35 left in the half. She
picked up her second foul with 9:12 left and didn't return until
5:45 remained -- and didn't play again in the half after getting hit
with her third personal with 5:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Leonhart's second foul, Nebraska didn't score again until
Kubik's basket with 4:47 left. By that time, the Cyclones led
30-16.

<HEADLINE> Texas 68, No. 6 Texas Tech 50  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- JoRuth Woods scored 17 points Thursday
night as Texas continued its run of upsets in the Big 12 tournament
with a 68-50 semifinal victory over No. 6 Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second victory over a ranked opponent in as many days
for sixth-seeded Texas (21-11), which beat No. 18 Oklahoma 71-68 in
Wednesday's quarterfinals and plays No. 10 Iowa State in Saturday's
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Edwina Brown offset eight turnovers with 14 points and nine
assists for the Longhorns, who are trying to become the first team
to win four tournament games since Colorado in 1997, the
conference's first season. Prior to this year, no sixth seed had
even made the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Tai Dillard added 13 points and freshman Alisha Sare had 10 for
Texas. Dillard also had eight rebounds as Texas outboarded the
second-seeded Red Raiders 41-25.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (25-4), the two-time defending tournament champion,
shot just 34 percent (17-for-50) from the floor and managed only
one field goal in the final 12{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns shot 30-for-60, 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' 18-footer at the buzzer gave Texas a 40-29 halftime lead,
and she added five points in the first 5{ minutes of the second
half as the Longhorns padded that advantage to 51-33.
</P>
<P>
   Aleah Johnson's basket with 9:05 left cut the margin to 59-47,
but the Red Raiders didn't score again for more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also struggled to score down the stretch but was able to
widen the margin to 66-47 before Keitha Dickerson hit two free
throws to break Texas Tech's drought with 3:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson led the Red Raiders with 19 points and eight rebounds
but only scored six points in the second half. She was the only
Texas Tech player in double figures.

<HEADLINE> Annan Criticizes Sierre Leone Rebel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan singled out
Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh in a report Thursday, saying
his hostility to U.N. peacekeepers was harming the country's
fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's ''often negative and confusing approach'' raises
questions about his commitment to implementing a July cease-fire
agreement he signed with the government, Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Citing continuing cease-fire violations by Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front and the obstruction of U.N.
peacekeepers, Annan said: ''Nothing short of the full cooperation
of all parties concerned, particularly the RUFP, is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan added that a ''major test'' of Sankoh's intentions toward
the peace process would be the return of weapons and equipment
seized from Guinean and Kenyan troops in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 troops from the West African intervention force known
as ECOMOG were disarmed by a handful of rebels in January as they
were on their way to join the U.N. force -- an embarrassing incident
that prompted the United Nations to remind troops that they are
allowed to use force to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone was sent to the West African
nation to monitor a cease-fire agreement reached by rebels and the
government in July and to oversee the disarming of fighters in the
country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Annan also noted a shortfall of $20 million for a
trust fund for disarming the fighters and urged governments make
new pledges at a donor conference in London on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether there was some concern about singling out
Sankoh in the report, Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the
U.N. chief was merely advising the Security Council of the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would be responsible of the secretary-general
to ignore the problems that have been created by the behavior by
Mr. Sankoh,'' Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 100, Mavericks 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 13 rebounds as the
Minnesota Timberwolves routed Dallas 100-79 Thursday night in the
Mavericks' first game since releasing controversial forward Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon had 17 points, Wally Szczerbiak scored 16 and
Joe Smith added 14 as the Timberwolves won for the eighth time in
their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley scored a season-high 26 points and pulled down
nine rebounds for the Mavericks, whose losing streak has reached a
season-high six.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got 15 points from Dirk Nowitzki and 14 from Michael
Finley before an announced crowd of 13,435. Minus the Rodman
sideshow as a draw, however, there were only an estimated 10,000 at
Reunion Arena for Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had three of their four home sellouts this season
with Rodman in the lineup, but Dallas won only three of Rodman's 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who was released Wednesday, was averaging 14.3 rebounds
for Dallas. The Mavericks were outrebounded by the Timberwolves
43-34.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota went on a 10-2 run early in the third quarter to build
a 65-48 lead and took a 69-58 advantage into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks got as close as 75-66 early in the fourth quarter
on Robert Pack's basket. But the Timberwolves countered with a 9-2
run, capped by Anthony Peeler's 3-pointer, to build an 84-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mavericks were without forward Cedric Ceballos,
day-to-day with a sprained pinkie on his left hand. ... Minnesota
held a 46-37 halftime lead. ... Mavericks coach Don Nelson returned
to the bench after missing four games with the flu. ... The
Timberwolves are 30-2 when they lead at the start of the fourth
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Bad Behavior Often Caught on Tape  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The funniest thing to happen on an NBA bench might have been the
night a few years ago when Miami's Willie Burton ordered a pizza
from a courtside vendor and promptly ate the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was in street clothes at the time, sidelined with an
injury. But he had barely finished licking his fingers when the
commotion began. A chronic underachiever, Burton got blistered for
dining out with the game still in progress. Now exiled to Europe's
pro leagues, he never quite lived it down.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the big deal?'' Burton said. ''I was hungry. It's not
like I committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but he should consider himself lucky. It could have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The only official rebuke came from then-coach Ron Rothstein, in
private. If the same episode took place today, Burton would find
himself facing Pat Riley. And thanks to a new edict from the
league, little of what Riley had to say would be left to the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik told
coaches that refusing league orders to wear a live microphone
during certain televised games will draw fines starting at
$100,000. Riley did exactly that last weekend, but he will be the
last member of his fraternity allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to belittle their concerns,'' Granik said, ''but
it has been determined that this is how we want the business to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagging ratings -- down 14 percent on NBC and 18 percent on cable
outlets TNT and TBS -- apparently have some NBA and television execs
reaching for the panic button. The TV partners are shifting their
schedules around to show more Toronto Raptors' games, and take
advantage of the fast-growing Vince Carter phenomenon. But to feed
the entertainment beast in the meantime, the league has decided to
sacrifice some of the privacy of the coaches, officials and
players.
</P>
<P>
   Like the coaches, some officials will be wearing microphones
during some national telecasts, and an unmanned camera in the
locker rooms will be turned on briefly to give viewers a feel of
what an NBA locker room looks like during a normal halftime or
pregame team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the reaction, you'd think the coaches had been
instructed to report to the Clippers for a reeducation program.
Utah's Jerry Sloan said he'll ''get my throat cut fighting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, New York's Jeff Van Gundy, Los Angeles' Phil Jackson and
Indiana's Larry Bird have been only slightly less strident in
raising objections.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns range from the impact it will have on how they do
their jobs -- ''Guys know they're being listened to, I think it
inhibits them and me from saying things they need to say,'' Trail
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said -- to what happens to the
B-material that isn't suitable for broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches have received assurances from the league that such
material will stay in the archives. But more than a few legendary
locker-room tirades have found their way onto ''bootleg'' tapes.
And both Dunleavy and Van Gundy admit to being squeamish at the
thought that the raw feed is bouncing around in some control room
or production truck.
</P>
<P>
   The players feel even less secure.
</P>
<P>
   Detlef Shrempf worried, ''What if someone sees me half-naked?''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Latrell Sprewell, who might still be looking for work
had cameras caught his confrontation during practice with coach
P.J. Carlesimo at Golden State several years ago, likened it to
''sitting at the family dinner table with a mike.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like invading space as far as our little family
goes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters, of course, unless the coaches or the
players union fight back. Union director Billy Hunter has asked for
a meeting and threatened a grievance if his clients don't get
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The best moments in basketball, as in the rest of life,
generally are unscripted. Few people understand the upside of this
undertaking better than NBA commissioner David Stern. On the other
hand, he should be mindful of the can of worms that is about to pop
open.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a few moments in NBA history with the benefit of
microphones, the interplay between coach and player as they
happened live: Jackson commenting on Scottie Pippen's sitdown
strike with 1.8 seconds left in a playoff game between Chicago and
New York; any opposing coach watching Allen Iverson hog the ball to
string together meaningless 40-point games; any coach, pro or con,
talking about Dennis Rodman any time.
</P>
<P>
   Reflection is sometimes the pause that refreshes, the last
chance for a steaming coach to avoid setting off a chain reaction
that ends badly for everyone involved. Sometimes, too, those few
seconds give coaches and players the chance to polish their
material.
</P>
<P>
   After a 35-point loss to the Bulls in the playoffs several years
ago, Atlanta coach Bobby Weiss laughed and said, ''We weren't even
the second-best team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been consulted just a few moments earlier, instead of
that gem, there wouldn't have been a printable word coming out of
his mouth.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Markus Naslund and Alexander Mogilny scored
third-period goals and the St. Louis Blues blew a third-period lead
for the first time this season as the Vancouver Canucks came back
for a 2-2 tie Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues entered the game as the NHL's only team with a perfect
record (29-0-0) when leading after two periods. But Naslund beat
Roman Turek with a wrist shot off a faceoff at 3:18, and Alexander
Mogilny tied it at 14:05 on a shot from just inside the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Al MacInnis recorded his 800th assist and Mike Eastwood had a
goal and an assist, as the Blues improved to 13-0-3 against
Canadian-based teams.
</P>
<P>
   No United States team has ever gone undefeated against teams
from Canada in one season. St. Louis has three games remaining
against those clubs. Blues coach Joel Quenneville improved to
12-0-1 against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis recorded his assist with 2:02 left in the second when
Eastwood tipped in his slap shot from the point. Tyson Nash scored
the other goal for the Blues, who have a five-game unbeaten streak.
St. Louis is 15-2-2 in its last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Turek had a shutout streak ended at 141:38 when Naslund scored.
The Blues, who outshot the Canucks 39-19, have allowed two goals or
less in 48 of their 67 games and are 37-3-8 in those contests.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Potvin made seven saves in overtime for the Canucks,
0-for-7 on the power play. St. Louis has killed 46 of 48 power
plays in a 10-game span.

<P>
   Nash got the Blues going when he scored his fourth goal at 13:45
of the second. Eastwood set up the play by keeping the puck in
along the right boards. He got it to Nash at the top of the right
circle and Nash put a wrist shot under the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood made it 2-0 at 17:58 by directing MacInnis' blast from
the right point past Potvin for his 17th goal.

Fire Kills 18 Teens, 1 Adult in South Pacific
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NUI, Tuvalu (AP) -- Eighteen teen-age girls and their adult supervisor were
killed Thursday night when a fire tore through a locked dormitory at a high
school in the South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, a government spokesman said. The
blaze was believed to have been caused by a student's candle which toppled over
in the sleeping quarters of Motufoua Secondary School. Tuvalu Prime Minister
Ionatana Ionatana revealed the tragedy to his country Friday in an address on
Radio Tuvalu. With a population of 9,000, Tuvalu is one of the world's smallest
nations in both population and size.

Deutsche Telekom Ends Qwest Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG abruptly ended talks today with Qwest
Communications Inc. about a possible three-way merger with U S West. Earlier in
the day, U S West, the Denver-based Baby Bell, issued a vaguely worded statement
saying it ''would consider taking steps to facilitate any additional
transaction,'' as long as the new offer did not jeopardize or delay U S West's
union with Qwest. Qwest, a long-distance phone company that focuses on Internet
traffic, started negotiating with Deutsche Telekom weeks ago -- behind the back
of U S West. The initial friction between Qwest and U S West, however, eased
after Qwest said it would only agree to an offer that included U S West.

Minimum Wage Hike Passes in House
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House tonight approved a $1 increase in the minimum
wage over two years and a 10-year, $122 billion Republican tax cut. The vote was
246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the $5.15-an-hour wage by $1 over
two years. The amendment replaced a GOP plan to raise the wage by $1 over three
years. Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill, two-thirds of it
cuts in estate taxes. Meanwhile, President Clinton vowed to veto the measure,
saying the tax relief disproportionately benefits the wealthy and would consume
a chunk of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up Social
Security and Medicare.

Norway Government Will Resign
</SUBHEAD>

   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's prime minister said Thursday his minority
government will resign following a failed vote of confidence in a key
environmental dispute with parliament. Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Christian
Democrat, said he would deliver his formal resignation to Norway's figurehead
monarch, King Harald V, on Friday. Bondevik had staked his three-party
government on opposition to building electrical power plants to burn some of
Norway's vast natural gas supplies. He said it would weaken the Nordic nation's
strict environmental laws.

Venezuela Deputy Sure on Oil Hike

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's deputy oil minister said Thursday he
is ''sure'' oil-producing nations will agree later this month on an output hike
to reduce soaring international petroleum prices. ''There will be an accord,''
Alvaro Silva said in an interview with The Associated Press and Dow Jones
Newswires. Silva said OPEC and non-OPEC producers must work to achieve a stable
oil price suitable for producers and consumers, but didn't give a price level.
The U.S. government is concerned that high prices and low inventories threaten
to feed inflation and provoke supply shortages.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson hit a trio of 3-pointers in overtime and
scored 10 of his season-high 23 points in the extra period to spark Indiana over
Portland 127-119 tonight. The victory stretched the Pacers' franchise-record
home winning streak to 25 games. Indiana had a chance to win the game in
regulation, getting the ball inside to Rik Smits. But he was triple-teamed and
tied up with fourth-tenths of a second to play. Smits made up for it in
overtime, scoring six quick points to give Indiana a 115-108 lead with 2:29 left
in the extra session.

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Florida 89, Mississippi 67  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- If depth is the key to a postseason run, look out
for No. 11 Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who must win four games to win the Southeastern
Conference tournament, used 11 different players Thursday to wear
down Mississippi in an 89-67 victory in a first round game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (24-6) shared the SEC title with three other teams, but
were seeded third in the Eastern Division -- behind No. 8 Tennessee
and No. 16 Kentucky -- and forced to play in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other team, Auburn in 1985, advanced from the first
round to win the tournament. The Gators play Auburn, the second
seed in the Western Division, in a Friday quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to advance in the NCAA tournament and this
tournament, you need depth and we've got it,'' Florida coach Billy
Donovan said. ''We knew all year we'd need 10 guys a night to get
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Kenyan Weaks scored 18 points for Florida and led four
other players in double figures. Mike Miller scored 15, Udonis
Haslem added 11, Donnell Harvey had 11 points and 12 rebounds, and
Justin Hamilton scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Harrison scored 20 points to lead the Rebels (17-13), who
are likely headed to the NIT -- ending a string of three straight
NCAA tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the NIT will take a 17-13 team,'' Ole Miss coach Rod
Barnes said. ''If we don't deserve to be invited, something is
wrong with the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, on the other hand, is looking for a high seed in the
NCAA tournament. To get it, the Gators need to win the SEC
tournament and hoped an easy game against the Rebels would ease the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   But they struggled in the first half -- they trailed by nine at
one point -- and needed a late run to take a 35-32 lead into
halftime. That forced Donovan to use some players much longer than
he wanted, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a taxing physical game for 30 minutes,'' he said. ''I
was not really happy because I would have liked to cut down on
Haslem and Mike's minutes, but we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was able to successfully make a change to his lineup,
giving Hamilton, freshman, his first start of the season instead of
Weaks. That gave the Gators a pure shooter coming off the bench,
and Weaks delivered with four of Florida's five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why they are so good, they are bringing four or five
McDonald's All-Americans off the bench,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, there were just too many Gators for
Mississippi. Florida used a furious 20-0 run to put away the Rebels
and take a 69-49 lead with 6:58 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a good example of our style of play, they played a
great first half and got a lot of easy baskets against our press,''
Miller said. ''But we continued to do that because we knew they
were only six or seven deep. And in the second half it became
difficult for them to go up and down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida did the most damage by scoring seven points in a
25-second span.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Wright hit a jumper with 8:24 left and Ole Miss' Marcus
Hicks lost the inbound pass two seconds later to Weaks, who was
fouled and made two free throws. The Rebels didn't score at the
other end, Wright hit a running jumper for Florida and was fouled.
His free throw with 7:59 to play made it 65-49.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-shooting Rebels, meanwhile, ended a five-minute scoring
drought on Hicks' layup with 6:50 to play. But it was too late for
Ole Miss, which was 4-for-22 from 3-point range and was
outrebounded 41-24.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks scored 19 and Rahim Lockhart added 12.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- W.D. Hamilton, who devised a widely accepted
theory to explain the evolutionary basis of altruism, died Tuesday
of malaria, which he contracted in the Congo. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had gone to the Congo to research the theory that the
AIDS virus originated from polio vaccine trials conducted in Africa
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was best known for his theory of ''inclusive fitness,''
published in two papers in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in
1963 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He set out to solve the apparent contradiction between the
evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest, and the fact
that individuals sometimes behave in ways that benefit their kin
rather than themselves. Hamilton's insight was to focus on the
survival of genes rather than individuals.
Homar Hernandez:
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Homar Hernandez, a songwriter who was to have
been inducted into the Tejano Music Awards Hall of Fame, died
Saturday of a heart attack. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't read music or play an instrument, but Hernandez
composed 144 songs, 88 of which were published and recorded by some
of Tejano's most famous stars in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Among his compositions was the romantic polka ''Rosas para una
Rosa'' (Roses for a Rose), which became a hit in 1985 for singer
Ramiro ''Ram'' Herrera. Emilio Navaira, Shelly Lares, Laura Canales
and Johnny Hernandez at Aztlan also recorded Hernandez's songs.
John Husak:
</P>
<P>
   MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Veteran broadcaster John Husak died
Tuesday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Husak was the first news anchorman at KEYC-TV in Mankato when
the station signed on the air in 1960, and he anchored the news
there for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   He then coordinated the station's public service campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In his career Husak covered thousands of stories in southern
Minnesota and northern Iowa, including the Mankato flood of 1965,
and had interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt and Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he was inducted into the Mankato Television and Radio
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, a daughter and two sons.
V.K. Narasimhan:
</P>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- V.K. Narasimhan, a newspaper editor who
battled to preserve freedom of expression during a crackdown by
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, died Thursday after a brief illness.
He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Narasimhan began his 40 years in journalism with The Hindu, a
respected daily in Madras, and later worked with the Deccan Herald
in Bangalore. The highlight of his career was his editorship of the
mass circulation Indian Express newspaper in 1975, when Mrs. Gandhi
declared emergency rule, imposing censorship and curtailing freedom
of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi imprisoned hundreds of her political foes and
pressured the media to highlight only her achievements. Many
newspapers willingly complied, but the Indian Express was among the
few institutions that defied her.
</P>
<P>
   Narasimhan is survived by two daughters and three sons.
Jack Sanford:
</P>
<P>
   BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) -- Jack Sanford, the National League's Rookie
of the Year in 1957 and a 100-game winner in a 12-year major league
career, died Tuesday. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford was 137-101 with a 3.69 ERA for the Philadelphia
Phillies, San Francisco Giants, California Angels and Kansas City
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Sanford went 24-8, winning 16 straight games, as the
Giants won the pennant, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in a
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched three games in the World Series against the New York
Yankees, going 1-2 with a 1.93 ERA against a roster that included
Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. He pitched a three-hit shutout in
Game 2 and struck out 11 in Game 5.
Dorothea Walker:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Dorothea Walker, a former contributing
editor to Vogue and House &AMP; Garden magazines, died Tuesday. She was
93.

designer Michael Taylor, creator of the ''California look,'' to the
attention of East Coast writers.	   During World War II, she did a radio program
for the Navy in
Honolulu, where her second husband, Richard Walker, was stationed.
She later wrote and broadcast a weekly radio show called ''Navy
Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Walker spent 45 years writing features on fashion and
living as the West Coast editor of Conde Nast publications,
publishers of Vogue and House &AMP; Garden.

Francisco and Richard W. Walker of London; a sister, Ursula Bergen

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Boat Accident Probed  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Rescuers contended with heavy surf
Thursday as they searched for victims of a boat accident off Puerto
Rico's coast that killed at least 10 illegal Dominican migrants and
left 33 missing.
</P>
<P>
   Police boats and a helicopter scoured a 5-mile stretch of the
northwest coast between Isabela and Quebradillas, but high seas
made the search difficult. No new survivors or victims had been
found by late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police and U.S. Border Patrol agents said 27 people survived
Wednesday's accident and were in custody. Most were to be returned
to the Dominican Republic in the next few days, said Ivan Ortiz,
spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of migrants disappeared into the coastal brush
and hills. Special Border Patrol units and police were searching
the northwest region.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 people on the boat undertook the same voyage
thousands of other Dominicans do each year, attempting the
dangerous 75-mile crossing in hopes of higher wages and better
lives. Dozens -- if not hundreds -- die in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said many of the passengers were from the central
Dominican city of Santiago and that they had paid $12,000 to
smugglers for the trip from the eastern Dominican town of Bavaro.
</P>
<P>
   They said heavy waves smashed their boat apart early Wednesday
roughly 60 yards from shore while its crew was trying to rescue a
woman who had fallen overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make it to the U.S. territory find work there or try
to take advantage of the lack of border and customs controls in the
capital of San Juan to get to the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 Dominicans illegally entered Puerto Rico in
the past two years, U.S. authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal Dominican residents in Puerto Rico visited Isabela
Thursday, some to see if loved ones were among the victims. Soaked
clothing, shoes, personal effects and pieces of the boat were
strewn along the beach.

<HEADLINE> Utah State 64, Pacific 41  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Troy Rolle scored 16 points and Utah State
extended the nation's longest winning streak to 17 games by
defeating Pacific 64-41 Thursday night in the opening round of the
Big West Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Daniels and Bernard Rock added 11 points apiece for
top-seeded Utah State (26-5), which became the winningest team in
school history. The 1997-98 squad finished the season with 25
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeaten in 17 conference games this season, the Aggies advanced
to a semifinal match Friday night against either UC Santa Barbara
or Nevada, which played later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No player scored in double figures for Pacific (11-18), which
had trouble penetrating Utah State's imposing interior defense and
shot poorly as well, converting just 33 percent of its field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels and Dmitri Jorssen each had four blocks, answering
Pacific's physical play with some muscle of their own while helping
to hold the Tigers to a season low in points. The Aggies finished
with a season-high nine blocks, one shy of the school record
against San Jose State in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 20 at halftime, Pacific scored seven of the first nine
points in the second half to pull within 15 but couldn't find the
shooting touch to sustain its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Brown drained a 3-pointer to get the Aggies going again,
and later Rock converted a three-point play and Curtis Bobb
connected from 3-point range to put Utah State back up by 20 with
7:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers managed just eight points the rest of the way as both
teams began to substitute freely.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration for Utah State, bidding for its second
conference tournament title in three years, began earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Rock hit a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the first half and
then celebrated by bumping chests with teammate Brennan Ray at
midcourt as the Aggies opened a 38-18 lead.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 101, Rockets 82  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton and Howard Eisley scored 17
points each while Karl Malone and Bryon Russell each had 16 as the
hot-shooting Utah Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 101-82 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Utah shot 56.9 percent (41-of-72) to win its sixth straight. The
Jazz pulled away from a 46-44 halftime lead, getting a
fourth-quarter boost from the bench, to win for the 11th time in 13
games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Moochie Norris and Shandon Anderson scored 16 to lead the
Rockets, while Kelvin Cato had 15 and Bryce Drew 11. Rookie Steve
Francis had 14 points two nights after scoring a career-high 32 in
a loss to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton shot 8-of-11 from the field, while Eisley made 7-of-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz found an answer each time Houston threatened in the
second half. The Rockets pulled within 54-52 with 8:49 remaining in
the third on a 3-pointer by Drew, but Utah went on a 12-4 run over
the next 3:43.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston cut it to 69-66 early in the fourth quarter on a
jumper by Norris, the Jazz reserves scored the next eight points.
Jacque Vaughn, who finished with eight, scored twice during that
burst.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Utah bench produced 29 of Utah's 32
points. Jazz veterans Stockton, Malone and Jeff Hornacek stayed on
the bench throughout the final period.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Utah has beaten Houston 12 straight times. ... Jazz fans
booed Anderson during introductions and each time he touched the
ball. He signed with the Rockets as a free agent after three
seasons in Salt Lake. ... Utah's longest winning streak was seven
straight from Dec. 4-15. ... Houston's Cuttino Mobley didn't
travel. The team cited undisclosed personal reasons. Starting
forward Walt Williams didn't dress because of a back strain. Both
played in Tuesday's loss to Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> No. 19 St. John's 75, Villanova 70  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bootsy Thornton scored 21 points and
third-seeded St. John's, which blew a 15-point second-half lead,
scored the game's final six points for a 75-70 victory over
Villanova on Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Big East
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-ranked Red Storm (22-7) advanced to Friday night's
semifinals against second-seeded Miami (21-9), which beat Notre
Dame 61-58 in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a rematch of last week's regular-season finale, won
by Miami 74-70 in overtime, and of last season's semifinal, won
62-59 by St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, which had won nine of 10, appeared in control early,
building a 41-26 halftime lead on 56 percent shooting (18-for-32).
But the sixth-seeded Wildcats (19-12), who trailed 43-28 less than
a minute into the second half, used a 13-2 run capped by
consecutive 3-pointers by Gary Buchanan and Brian Lynch to get
within 43-39 with 16:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who shot 58.6 percent in the second half
(17-for-29), tied the game at 59-59 on a free throw by Brooks Sales
with 6:58 left. They took their first lead of the game 66-64 on a
jumper by Sales with 4:04 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova was up 70-69 with 51 seconds left on two free throws
by Buchanan, but those were its last points.
</P>
<P>
   Chudney Gray scored on a drive with 40 seconds left to give the
Red Storm the lead for good and, after a missed jumper by Malik
Allen of the Wildcats with 24 seconds left, Anthony Glover scored
on a breakaway dunk with 16 seconds left. After Villanova turned
the ball over as it scrambled to get off a tying 3-pointer, Erick
Barkley was fouled with 4.8 seconds left and made two free throws
for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Lavor Postell had 18 points for St. John's and Barkley had 11
points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan led the Wildcats with 19 points and seven assists and
Allen had 16 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   This will be St. John's third straight semifinal appearance. The
Wildcats have not advanced past the quarterfinals since 1997.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Shane Battier scored 19 points and No. 3
Duke opened its quest for its 11th ACC title by dominating Clemson
inside and out in a 94-63 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils (25-4) shot 56 percent, including making an
Atlantic Coast Conference tournament-record 17 of 29 3-point
attempts, and had a 38-28 edge on the boards, helping them defeat
Clemson for the ninth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   Duke used a 31-4 run in the first half to take control of a game
that matched the highest-scoring team in the ACC against the
league's last-place team in scoring and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Mike Dunleavy made a successful return after missing
four games with mononucleosis as Duke, the tournament's top seed,
advanced to Saturday's semifinals. Dunleavy played 20 minutes, made
six of seven 3-pointers and finished with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Nate James added 18 points for Duke, Jason Williams had 14 and
Chris Carrawell added 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-seeded Clemson (10-20) shot 37 percent and had 17
turnovers. The Tigers have lost three games to Duke this season by
a combined 79 points.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, losing to the Blue Devils in the ACC tournament for the
fourth consecutive time, got 14 points from Will Solomon, 11 from
Andrius Jurkunas and 10 from Ray Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, the defending ACC champion, opened its title defense by
shooting 61 percent in the first half, including 10 of 14 from
3-point range, and outrebounding Clemson 22-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, trailing 15-14 and looking for their first lead,
instead turned the ball over to start the decisive run.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemson missed 9-of-11 field-goal attempts, Duke made six
of seven from 3-point range alone. Dunleavy led the way, hitting
all three of his long-range shots.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy capped the surge with a 21-footer from the top of the
key, stretching Duke's lead to 46-18.
</P>
<P>
   Jurkunas scored the next six points, but the Blue Devils stayed
true to form and answered with a 3-pointer, this one from James,
and stretched their lead to 23 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage in the second half, the Tigers had 34 points -- and
were trailing by 31.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson fell behind by as many as 33 in the late stages.

<HEADLINE> Tijuana Officers Suspected in Slay  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- The gangland-style assassination of
Tijuana's police chief may have been ordered by two of his
officers, Mexican prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California Attorney General Juan Manuel Salazar had said
earlier that the six people arrested in the murder of Police Chief
Alfredo de la Torre were suspected of carrying out the killing at
the behest of a drug trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Thursday that their testimony had led investigators
to believe that an assistant police chief and a police officer
orchestrated the shooting, then fled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The six suspects arrested Wednesday include a former city
official and a former police officer.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, the six were to be paid $15,000 by
Assistant Police Chief Juan de Dios Montenegro for the hit but
never saw the money, Salazar said. U.S. officials are searching for
Montenegro and officer Praxedis Osuna Solis.
</P>
<P>
   De la Torre was gunned down Feb. 27, causing a public outcry in
what may be Mexico's most violent city. Tijuana, a city of 1.2
million, has seen more than 70 murders this year alone -- more than
one a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference late Wednesday, Salazar said the men
admitted working for Vicente Zambada Niebla, whom he identified as
the son of drug trafficker Mario Zambada from the northwestern
state of Sinaloa.
</P>
<P>
   According to the testimony, Osuna and Montenegro were linked to
the drug dealers. Details of the connection weren't clear.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said the men had killed 14 other people, including
attorney Rodolfo Gallardo, a former state judge who was shot to
death along with his wife, son and a local policeman on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the traffickers wanted to create confusion
that would help them operate without interference, but Salazar said
investigators were looking into other motives as well.
</P>
<P>
   Zambada apparently has been trying to compete with the Arellano
Felix brothers, a notoriously violent drug gang based in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   De la Torre was shot to death while driving to his office.
Investigators said gunmen fired at least 99 bullets at his car, 57
of which hit him. He died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said police confiscated several automatic
rifles and other weapons from the suspects.
